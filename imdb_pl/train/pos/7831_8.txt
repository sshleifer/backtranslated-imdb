The German medieval saga of Fritz Lang is in Die Nibelungen: Kriemhilds Rache (1924). Kriemhild (Margarete Schoen) wants to avenge his murdered husband, Siegfried. His brother is too weak to lead the murdered, Hagen, to justice. King of the Huns (Rudolf Klein-Rogge). He will give birth to a child and invite the brothers to a party. Etzel and the other Huns should kill Hagen, but he is protected by his brothers. We see a huge battle of life and death begins, and it sets the whole place on fire. In the end, Hagen is dead, like Kriemhild. These films deal with great themes such as revenge and immortal love. We probably saw better movies later on these topics, but it was one of the first.
