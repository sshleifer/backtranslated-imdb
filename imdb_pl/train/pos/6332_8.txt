This movie is good for television. I like it because I am a huge fan of disaster films, even though it's a family movie. Accuracy in the movie from the book is one and a half. They found the names of the heroes, but there was no storm hunter in the book, the scene with the Hatch family fleeing the tornado was not in the book. he involved Dan Hatch and his friend riding with the policeman on his way to the police station for security. and in the book, Dan and his friend are 12 years old. That's all I can think about. In general, it was a good movie, although it could have been a bit more accurate in relation to the book. Did you know that the book was based on the true story of a series of tornados destroying a small town in Nebraska in 1980?
