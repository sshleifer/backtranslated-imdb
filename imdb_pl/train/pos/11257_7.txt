Erotic cinema of the '70s was tame compared to the triple X's of today, which is good. Because there is a good story around naked rituals and sex scenes. Of course, I regret that they did not have the vampire effects they had at the time, and sex was a bit disturbing. In addition, some of the accents were difficult to understand during periods, but it is worth to watch the unedited version, and then the edited version entitled THE DEVIL'S PLAYTHING. But if you do not care about naked women dancing and having sex, this is not a movie for you. However, I liked it and I give it ... 7 STARS.
