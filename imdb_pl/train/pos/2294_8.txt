... Hawk Heaven for lovers of French cinema and by extending the French Screen Actors / Actresses. In the worst case, it's indulgence, the actors start fooling about other actors, questioning the legitimacy of practicing the profession, etc., While at best it's a great celebration / sending the best actors who are currently working. From a simple premise - the request of Jean-Pierre Marielle to ignore the water in the restaurant - Blier turns in all directions and allows the cream of the French cinema to strike with his things in front of the camera, even nodding to those who are no longer (Jean Gabin, Lino Ventura) including the director's father, Bernard, one of the greatest fans of the French cinema, from whom a heavenly phone at the end of the movie is giving off. Discursive and prolix, yes, guilty as accused, but also guilt.
