Maybe this is not the best movie from 2006, but it was just a movie that aroused and thought about. The Sentinel is a good film of a political thriller that seems similar or even borrows some elements from other political thriller movies, such as In the Line of Fire and Manchurian Candidate. The basic plot of this movie is similar to other films: The plot to kill the president of the United States. Michael Douglas acts as Secret Service Agent Pete Garrison, who heads the operation only to find out later that he was framed. Associate Kiefer Sutherland is a rival named David Breckinridge and Eva Longoria as Jill Marin, who is the debut agent under the leadership of agent Breckinridge and Oscar winner Kim Basinger as the first lady Sarah Ballentine. One of the improvements in this movie may be more action, because some sources consider the action movie to be the same as Thriller's, but the good thing in this movie is instead of assassination on the US President. it concerns a mole (traitor) in the Secret Service that leads the president in the wrong direction.
