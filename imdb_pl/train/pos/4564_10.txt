If there ever was an inspirational story that could move anyone, disabled or not, to persevere despite adversity and to do so (even when "do it" as an expression, proper, can have a wide berth, which is ultimately a personal truth), MY LEFT STOP it is. It's a difficult movie to watch: sometimes the less calm aspects of Christy Brown's personality appear in two key scenes - one when his sister declares that she is pregnant and will get married right away, while his father has a bad reaction and dinner at the table, when the woman who reached him made him able to communicate effectively, now he announced at the crucial moment (inauguration of Brown's art) that he is going to marry another man - it is difficult. Very, very hard. More because he is a man who can not adequately react to these events and can express himself only in the only way he knows: through screams, screams and curses, the purpose of which is to hurt himself. However, this is not a story of heartache and family dysfunction, even if there is enough autobiographical equipment in it, but a man who overcomes his serious disability, becoming a functioning human being and a force to be reckoned with in the world of art. Daniel Day Lewis won the Oscar for his powerful, unforgettable performance as a flawed but persistent Christy Brown, and Brenda Fricker also did this for her secondary role as a reliable mother of Brown.
