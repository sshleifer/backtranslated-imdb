I really liked this movie. I am convinced that Matt Stone and Trey Parker are comic geniuses of our time. They have an amazing ability to add this level of absurdity to pop culture and make it gloomy, but in a realistic way ... if that makes sense. This mainly makes South Park very funny. Once you've passed the fact that it's probably the most vulgar and indiscreet cartoon in history, you see in every episode a message that's being passed on. You can see it in BASEketball. Though directed by David Zucker and completely absurd, he has a sincere message about corporate America and shame, which is the main league sport. I'm also a sports fan, that's why sometimes I find this movie funny because it's so real in this weird way people do not like to love. The pre-prologue is brilliant ... Tears of laughter are formed every time I see that these players start Riverdance! Some may dislike this film because it is not just a cup of tea for everyone ... but, like South Park, when you look beyond the absurd ... it has a really authentic message that is transmitted by a literal comic genius. I gave this film 8 out of 10 stars.
