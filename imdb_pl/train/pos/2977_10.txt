There are so many words I want to use to describe this movie, but can not I really do that? This movie is a movie to watch, if you just want to sit, laugh, cry, and then pee. I'm serious. Do not watch this movie if you are easily offended by vulgarity, sex, nudity, homosexuality ... and everything else related to nature. Being a woman, and this may not even be a factor, I can watch this movie over and over again. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are absolutely brilliant. In addition to all other debuts, I think that Baseketball is the winner of the award. I'm laughing now, just thinking about some stupid things they do in the movie. Watch the movie!! That's all I say. It's hard for me to leave this comment because I am one of those people, like Ozzy Osbourne, who has a curse in almost every line that comes out of their mouths when they talk. So I keep it professionally. The best movie. Heck yeah !!
