It is a very well made film, meticulously directed, with some great actor who is sometimes deeply moving - for example a scene with a loyal but unrepeated assistant police officer and his wife. The plot is convincingly developed and exciting. The gangster character is particularly interesting and plays an almost metaphysical role in the hero's life. It is clear that the cops are as rough and ready as the figures of the underworld. <br /> <br /> Some minor objections: I think the ending is one-sided because it celebrates the successful integration of the hero with the structure of the police and justice system, which breaks the ambiguity of the police figures, which has been maintained to this point. I also think that the main female character is a bit weak: not much more than a catalyst for the hero's salvation, everything that seems to be doing is crying and fainting when tough guys are fighting.
