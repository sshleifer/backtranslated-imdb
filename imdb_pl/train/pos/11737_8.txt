OK, this movie is stupid. I mean it in a good way. He was intentionally stupid and was one of the better "stupid" movies I saw. Jokes and gags are deliberately wrong, but delivered in such a way that all the right notes hit me. Supporting figures were quite shallow and mediocre. There is quite a weak plot, but it works well. <br /> <br /> The character of Elvira is of interest here. She is adorable and adorable. for this acting talent she had physical qualities that were frankly frank. Few people would disagree. The parts that show her silhouette were also funny scenes in the film. <br /> <br /> I had a smile to my ear from the first scene to the last one. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended to fans of comedies and fans of beautiful women. I'd like them to make a dozen other Elvia movies.
