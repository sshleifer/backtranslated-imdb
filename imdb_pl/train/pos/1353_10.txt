The cast is different, and now they have adopted a different approach, we have street smart band "Networth" vs. alleged professional team "Magna", but boy, if you think that the street wise team would have trouble, you would be right. While the Magna team sometimes struggled with problems, the street team just broke up week after week. <br /> <br /> First, he repeats several things, as long as Apprentice 3 is the first to continue the same absurd mentality (from Trump) and play this series: if you are a good project manager, but you lose, the team will turn against you and you will be fired, even though your teammates are often those who work halfway. It's just absurd that a game show that claims to employ the best candidate actually "weeds" the best while dysfunctional candidates stab each other until one is left and that person is not the best. lol <br /> <br /> Someone this season saw a total of cursing, backstabbing, and even gay offensive stereotypes carried out by teams trying to run campaigns. <br /> <br /> The list of victims so far cast by Tara Dowdell, Audrey Evans, Danny Kastner, these three, are the only ones I feel have been unjustly dismissed by Trump, the rest really happened because they only fueled the conflict, anger and suffering. It's amazing how one of the candidates, Audrey Evans, said how she was fired and how some of her worthless colleagues are still in the game. <br /> <br /> Yes, this game is "The Apprentice" where manipulation, backstabbing and always popular "all gang on the project manager" rule the mentality. <br /> <br /> However, it was a fun ride, the candidates receive a wide range of tasks from photo sessions to building boxes for miniature golf, building new apartments. <br /> <br /> It's still "Apprentice", so all you can do is laugh all the time, like madness and chaos, until the lucky winner is the winner.
