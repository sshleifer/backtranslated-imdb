These types of films about young teenagers struggling with their own sexuality were something special, bold and daring a few years ago, but over the last few years more and more such films have appeared, which makes films still difficult to stand out. <br /> <br /> Also this movie was not very public, apart from the usual small film festivals on which this little French movie was, as well as the great festivals that always like these little films about everyday matters that are not often taken up in films. The film premiered at Cannes in 2007, and also won several awards there. <br /> <br /> The movie does not stand out from the others, because in reality it has few new films when you've seen similar movies like this one, but that does not really mean that Naissance des pieuvres is bad. The film is certainly a good clock that deals well with its subject and constantly tells its story, and therefore also effectively, in a typical, slow French film tempo. <br /> <br /> This is a video about puberty that focuses on the lives of mainly 3 completely different teenagers. Sexuality is a big topic in the film, which is treated gently and subtly. This makes the film and its story quite realistic, though perhaps somewhat predictable, because the film does not offer anything original enough in its genre. <br /> <br /> This type of French film will probably frighten many people because they probably expect them to be very artistic, with deep layers and meanings. "Naissance des pieuvres" is however a very accessible film for everyone and you do not really have to be in Euro-Teen movies to appreciate this movie. It is a sweet and somewhat sensual kind of film, due to its theme and visual approach. <br /> <br /> The movie is also realistic for its actors who did not have and have extensive experience in film business, but genuinely looks and feels in their roles. Strong individual characters provide the film with cool motifs and good moments. <br /> <br /> A good movie on the subject. <br /> <br /> 7/10
