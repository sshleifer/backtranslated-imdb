I saw this movie earlier today and was amazed at how accurate the dialog for the main characters is. I did not think it was a movie - it's more of a document (the part I liked the most). The leading ladies in this film seemed as real to me as all fifteen-year-old girls I know. <br /> <br /> All in all, a very nice movie for those who like independent films.
