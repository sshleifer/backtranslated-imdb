Good day. I just watched this movie today for the 14th time for the third time in 3 days. I am a history teacher who has too much time on his hands. I need life. I found a film containing a striking resemblance to breaking the mountain. I also discovered that I look like Jean Lafitte if he was white. also my favorite line in the whole movie came from Mr. Petey - "this child can shoot the eye of a squirrel from 300 yards !!" oh, and my favorite scene in the movie was the time in which the British came, and one drummer who was so devoted his work, and he drummed until his death, as if this drum completely ended the war ... it would not be. Well, that's all I would like to say about this film. OH, one more thing ... bonnie brown is crazy bipolar hesitation of the physical mood of BEEYOTCH. that's all.
