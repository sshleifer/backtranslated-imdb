I did not expect Val Kilmer to convince John Holmes, but I forgot that this is not a porn legend. In fact, the entire cast turned into amazing performances in this very underestimated film. <br /> <br /> As mentioned before, look for a set of two discs and watch the "Wadd" document first; it will provide you with a lot of information about the story that will help you appreciate the movie. <br /> <br /> Some people seem unhappy about putting a DVD video from the LAPD crime scene. There are many reasons that may have been taken into account, one of which is that the John Holmes trial for murder was the first in the United States where such material was used by the prosecution. If you do not want to see it, it's easy to avoid it; the menu is clearly marked as "LAPD Crime Scene Footage"!
