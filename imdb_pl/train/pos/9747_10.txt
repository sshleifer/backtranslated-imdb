I remember seeing this movie when it first appeared in 1982 and then I loved it. About 4 years later, I had the privilege of seeing Luciano Pavarotti singing at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York (in Tosca), so seeing the ending of this movie reminds me of this wonderful night. What do you dislike in this film? The music is brilliant and Pavarotti (Fini) was in the best shape and still looked great. History is actually very funny, and the "food fight" scene is still one of the funniest I've ever seen. The balloon flight over the Napa valley was beautiful and the song he sang "If we were in love" (one of Pavarotti's few songs in English). And hearing the wonderful duo of Santa Lucia. Get real people, it was a movie about an opera singer, Georgio Fini, who is currently playing Pavarotti. Kathryn Harrold and Eddie Albert were great in their supporting roles. <br /> <br /> I am very happy that I still have an almost worn VHS tape of this movie, but I would love to have it released on DVD, especially now Pavarotti is not with us anymore, because I think it covers the best performance of Nessun Dorma sung by him still in the movie!
