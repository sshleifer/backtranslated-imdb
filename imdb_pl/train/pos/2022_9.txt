The only complaint I have about this adaptation is that it is sexed. Things that are only mentioned in the novel are shown on the screen for some strange reason. Did they think that the audience would be too stupid to understand that they were not showing them everything? In addition, it is very good quality. All actors perform wonderful works, animating their heroes. For shallow women out there, it's worth seeing at least because Toby Stephens as Gilbert is the sexiest thing in history. If I was Helena, I would probably forget that I'm still married when I look at him ... <br /> <br /> Something like a spoiler - The final scene is a funny reversal of what happened in the book.
