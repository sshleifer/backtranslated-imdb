I was not born until 4 years after this great show, which was first aired, but fortunately I managed to catch replays from the mid-90s, and the rest is history ...... I was addicted. The assumption was quite simple; two blind agents Nemezis, Richard Barrett and Craig Stirling (William Gaunt and Stuart Damon) collaborate with an expert (if not young) Doctor and Biologist (Sharron Macready) to follow the bamboo curtain to regain the dangerous biological factor through the red porcelain. During their flight their plane hits the fire of machine guns and crashes in the heart of the Himalayas, where their lives are saved by a mysterious and previously undiscovered civilization that heals and strengthens the senses of the trio, creating a scene for many exciting adventures that will come ... <br / > <br /> The series lasted for 30 hours and I think it was a relatively short one season that caused the cult status. <br /> <br /> Monty Berman, the producer, was known for doing things as cheaply as possible, and sometimes the show suffered from incredibly sticky sets - especially in episodes such as "Happening" (studio replacing Australian outback) and "Operation Deep Freeze" and "The Beginning" snow kits, but if you manage to get around this and focus on characters and storylines, the show was really fun. He had a great mix of adventure and a lot of deadly humor (mostly from some great liners from William Gaunt). <br /> <br /> The chemistry of the three leads was fantastic - you get the impression that they were really having a great time doing the show, which is confirmed by the document from 2005, in which three bands reunite after over 35 years to mention the program ( and laugh at Anthony Nicholls horrible wig !!). Everyone had the same time on the screen and everyone had their moments to shine. I must say that I have always been a fan of Richard Barrett - I loved his sardonic humor with this dangerous advantage - he was certainly a man you did not cross, and those eyes ... the most blue eyes that I will probably see on TV. Since then, I've also been interested in Bill Gaunts' career. However, Craig Stirling would certainly have his fan base and I'm sure Alexandra Bastedo had a whole queue of male fans swooning over her too. <br /> <br /> The program also featured a lot of guest stars, which encouraged including Donald Sutherland, Jeremy Brett, Peter Wyngarde, Burt Kwouk, Anton Rodgers, Kate O'Mara, Jenny Linden, Paul Eddington and Colin Blakely. <br /> <br /> For me, significant episodes are: "Auto Kill", "The Interrogation", "The Fanatics", "The Mission" and "The Gilded Cage", but I'm sure everyone has their favorite favorites . <br /> <br /> If you have the chance to watch this program for the first time or after many years of watching it, remember to watch it in the context of the time it was made, and just sit back and enjoy - characters and chemistry from three leads, this great show was me and I do not think I ever got tired of it. <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
