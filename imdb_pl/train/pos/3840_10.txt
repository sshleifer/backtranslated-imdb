Jerome Crabbe has a central role in this film. I've seen this movie six times and I'm still not tired. This film is in some respects similar to Flesh + Blood. Gerald Soetman is a great writer. He wrote all the Dutch films by Paul Verhoeven. Paul Verhoeven is one of the greatest directors. I saw all of his films except Showgirls. My mother does not like him, but I do not agree. I think all of his films are a ride to see especially Total Recall and Basic Instinct. Jerry Goldsmith has made several of his films, including Total Recall, Basic Instinct and Hollow Man. I would like Jerry Goldsmith to never die. Dutch films are different, but still pleasant.
