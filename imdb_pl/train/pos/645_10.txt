I hate too long, chatty French movies, but my favorite movie of all time is the longest and best French movie. I saw it twice in the mid-1970s and then disappeared. But in the end I saw him again in 1999 and I fell in love again. The most remarkable thing is that today it feels just as fresh as 25 years ago. If you have not seen it, do not miss your chance!
