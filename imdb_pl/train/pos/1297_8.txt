Faithful adaptation of a humorous and interesting French novel about a cynical and depressed middle-aged software engineer (or something), largely based on the first-person narrative, but not worse. Inept (in a petty bourgeois manner), philosophical and sorcerous, the best way to describe both a film and a novel is that it is something more intellectual of Charles Bukowski (lack of respect for the CB). Extremely funny, but also grim analysis of social and sexual relations, the great achievement of the film is that it reflects the real life in such a recognizable way that you ask: why there are no such films? One of the rare examples of a good book that creates just as good a movie.
