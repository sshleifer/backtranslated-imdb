The Sarah Silverman program is ... better than other programs. No laughter, no jokes, just a program. Sarah Silverman program. If you're like me and you love comedy, then this is probably a program for you. <br /> <br /> Sarah Silverman brings with it fun and funny. A mix of different styles that make up your own. <br /> <br /> This program is not something you would like to start to compare war with, seeing that there is nothing to do with them (other programs). This series is his own being and I think most comedies will like him. <br /> <br /> Go and see.
