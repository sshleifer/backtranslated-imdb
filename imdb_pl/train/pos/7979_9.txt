Tony Scott can make good and bad films, I personally think he can be a little flashy and tacky, and his work obviously suffers compared to his fairly well-known brother, but this is probably his best movie. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie so great that Scott gives Denzel (in a hot form, better than Training Day) and a revelation that is sometimes Dakota Fanning to create a real warmth and tenderness relationship . Configuration is not boring at all, although it takes time - it engages and takes us on a small journey to the character - including the wonderful role of Radha Mitchell as a mother. It all makes the action much more effective because we invest so much in the form, for all their too obvious weaknesses. This movie has you on the edge and can not cope with the end. <br /> <br /> Of course, the movie would be nothing without Washington. I often wonder why it seems that he has so many roles in the main role, when he is clearly as good as almost every man there (I can really only think of one, Daniel Day Lewis, who now has more power on the screen). This film should be huge, considering its status and strength as well as the quality of the film. It just shows that if the studio does not turn the film on the handle, it will go straight to the video. I would like to have a chance to see it on the big screen.
