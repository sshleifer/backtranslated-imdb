If you're under 13 or over 13 and you're very intoxicated, you'll love D-war. If you're a seriously devoted fan of all sorts of mindless action movies, you'll love D-war. Otherwise, do not worry! Today I watched this movie with my nephews and three of their friends. They really loved it and it made me feel good. After the film ended, all the children (my nephews and their friends) could not stop thanking me for taking them to the theater. <br /> <br /> CG is good. Acting and directing are terrible. The plot is extremely simple. But because half the audience was children, they shouted, shouted and cheered each time the dragons appeared on the screen. This made the viewing experience much more exciting than it should be. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie that you can take your kids on, but apart from the last sequence of D-War battles, it's disappointing. I give this film 7 out of 10, mainly because the children loved him very much.
