"The Odd Couple" is one of those films that far exceeds its reputation. People know it, humming a theme song, complain about life with a scruffy "Oscar" or fussy "Felix" ... but they do not sell the movie without knowing it. It's not just a tidy guy living with a careless guy; is a portrait of two friends helping each other in the agony of divorce. It's also damn funny from beginning to end, but it's a kind of comedy that results from realistic, stressful and just awful situations. So some viewers found the movie somewhat uncomfortable, but I think its credibility is its strength. Besides, Matthau's bulldog's face just breaks me! My favorite comedy, according to a country mile.
