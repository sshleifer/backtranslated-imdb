This is a great Classic movie from the 1940s and well made. In this film are very dramatic scenes with John Garfield, (Al Schmid), "Force of Evil", 48 and Dane Clark, (Lee Diamond), "Last Rites", 88, the fight against the Japanese during World War II is completely surrounded and only one machine gun. When Al Schmid was able to return home after being injured by a terrible injury, his problems began with his family and his betrothed friend. Data Clark played an outstanding supporting role as Lee Diamond, who did everything to help his mate Al recover his life. The war never wins and you can not forget about all the brave injured military personnel in hospitals for veterans of all wars and our current veterinarians!
