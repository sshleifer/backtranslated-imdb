This movie is just too funny, completely non-gangster PC. If Mel Brooks took a photo of Mob in the 1930s, it probably would look like this. Too many great one-liners to remember, and although it is not for everyone, everyone who does NOT laugh many times does not have a pulse. So, put it in and LET you Iceholes !!!
