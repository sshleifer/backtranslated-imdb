Overall, I was impressed by the pilot. The first fifteen minutes were disturbing because the creators seemed to be trying to create a science fiction version of The OC, but this fear is corrected when a terrorist incident occurs, and hence the play enters topics and situations that I rarely see television. <br /> <br /> BSG dealt with topics such as monotheism, existentialism, reality, death and terrorism, but these were above all the overtones that the viewer could contemplate or ignore if they so choose. On the other hand, these themes are the theme of the concert, and I personally recalled such works as Ghost In The Shell and The Matrix as reference points while watching and surprising how well the topics were discussed. I think if you're a fan of the two I mentioned, or other movies / TV shows about the topics I've referred to, I think you'll at least find something here. <br /> <br /> As for the starting point to explain how the situation that we know in BSG came to, I think that they dealt with it in a very interesting way, I especially liked how they explained where it came from Cylon's belief in one God, and the creation of Caprica was advanced enough and modern technology thrown in to appear in the future, but not completely alien to us as viewers. <br /> <br /> The only real weaknesses I noticed are the relationship between Greystone's parents and the actress who plays "Lacy Rand." Although I like Eric Stoltz and Paula Malcomson individually, together their scenes seemed chemically deprived, at the moment it could simply rely on developing their characters, but this is something that I think requires work. I also found Magda Apanowicz, who was not convincing in her role. This may again result from the experience and time needed for development, but throughout the episode of her acting seemed forced and not entirely self-confident. <br /> <br /> Based on the remote control I look forward to where the "Caprica" ​​will come, and let's hope it will touch the size that BSG once did.
