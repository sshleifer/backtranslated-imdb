A clever scenario of the late SEBASTIAN JAPRISOT and the clever performances of two male heroes - ALAIN DELON and CHARLES BRONSON (or rather, it should be the other way round) will result in an engaging and fun thriller. <br /> <br /> Add to the above the right direction from veteran JEAN HERMAN and the rare but effective result of FRANCOIS DE ROUBAIX, it becomes easy, why this film has a strange timeless quality. <br /> <br /> This is a friend buddy or a story with two loners, both disappointed and tired of the world, returning probably from Algiers. Like other colonial powers of that time (after World War II leading up to the 1960s), France fought to keep appearances abroad. The loss of Algiers was a bitter blow. <br /> <br /> ADIEU L'AMI (original title) chronicles the actions of our two (anti) heroes who are fighting to release after that. <Br> <br /> One thing happens after another, and the viewer really needs to pay attention because JAPRISOT is thin and thrifty with his script: if there is, there must be a reason. <br /> <br /> Just to say that these two men are fighting, physically and mentally, for one long weekend. Their motivation is completely different, their goals are different - their survival depends solely on themselves. The fact that ALAIN DELON and CHARLES BRONSON are so different on the outside - the first, probably a pretty boy, and the other an ugly bandit, adds to chemistry. <br /> <br /> This task creates a great story, which in turn makes the movie great. <br /> <br /> In order not to forget that there are women in this film and according to the Japrisot method, they are also unforgettable, though not so strongly developed; to say a lot more would spoil the joy of discovering their true nature. <br /> <br /> FAREWELL, A FRIEND IS RELEASED IN THE UK; ANAMORPHIC IMAGE, 16.9 IMPROVED; ONLY In English (even subtitles for the hearing impaired); WORKING TIME 110 MINUTES; MONO SOUNDTRACK, but the music of DE ROUBAIX has a lot of damage! <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it.
