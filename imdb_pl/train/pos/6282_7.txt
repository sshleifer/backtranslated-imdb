Nick Cage is Randall Raines, a retired car thief who is forced to retire when he is forced to save his brother Kip (Giovanni Ribisi) life when working on the job, completing the brothers' work of stealing 50 cars one night. He must gather his old crew, whom he can trust, to help him download her and take his brother from the Netherlands. But the cops are on him, so he can do it? It was one of the best film candidates that could be played, as the original was far from classics. And if you do not go into that, expecting a lot, and change the thinking part of your brain so you can ignore the hole and just take a movie of what it is. You will use the ride. Look at the double bill from "The Fast and the Furious" for a quick hijink night, just do not take the car on the spin right after it. <br /> <br /> My class: B - <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: 7 minutes Jerry Bruckheimer Interview; Bruckheimer Bio / Filmography; Action overload: select Reel; The Big Chase; "0 to 60"; "Wild Rides"; Stars in motion; The cultic video "Painted on the heart"; Theater trailer and trailers for Shanghai Noon, Mission to Mars and Coyote Ugly
