I must say that I liked this film completely. Those were funny moments, some warm parts, just good ones. I personally liked this movie because it is something that I can finally refer to in my childhood. This film, in my opinion, is more focused on the young gay population. Shows how a young gay would be treated during adolescence. All mockery, defiant and unknowing is something that I, like most young female boys, will always remember, and now a movie that shows how difficult it is to grow up gay. So I definitely recommend watching this movie. It probably should not really be seen until the person is old and mature enough to understand her
