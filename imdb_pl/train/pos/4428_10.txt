I must completely disagree with the other commentary regarding this film. Visual effects complement the supernatural motifs of the film and do not lessen the plot. I also loved how the movement was different from the Crouching Tiger, because this time the sword action did not have any strings and most of the time you can see the action up close. <br /> <br /> I think that the Western audience will be very confused by two scenes, one of which concerns a monk trying to burn himself alive, and the other about singing villagers that this is the end of the world. These scenes are derived from certain interpretations of the Mahayana Buddhist text (Mahayana Buddhism can be found in China, Korea and Japan), and the second scene deals with the quirkiness in the Japanese calendar ... people thought that the world would come to an end ... Gojoe has action , history and visualizations to hypnotize every viewer. I strongly believe that with a skillful edition, you can sell it in the US. My one complaint is about the last battle scene (I can not say anything - sorry).
