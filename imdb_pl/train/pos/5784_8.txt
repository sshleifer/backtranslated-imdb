I noticed that many people who publish in "Kerching!" The management seems to hate this series, which I actually think is very surprising. I think it's one of the best shows of British kids. It is a pity that it ends because it is very funny (though sometimes tacky) and has great characters. The main character is a bit similar to Del Boy, though much smarter. Along with 2 best friends, he tried to earn a million pounds for his mother, starting his business online and taking the nickname "Rudeboy". His friends are Seymour (who likes to cook) and Danny (who has a simple mind and comic character). Throughout the concert, some characters left and new ones appeared, but it was always fun and improving.
