That's what I expected during the premiere of Star Trek DS9. Not a light DS9. It was a great concert, but it never gave the fans more of what they wanted. Enterprise is such a show. Although it is similar to the original trek, it is different enough to be original in its own way. It makes the exploration ideas excite us again. And it was one of the basic ingredients that made the original so loved. Another component of success were the relationships between crew members. Viewers really cared about the crew. The Enterprise also has a lot to offer in this field. The chemistry between Bakula and Blalock seems very promising. While sexual tension in a TV series can often become a ball, I think that tensions in an enterprise can lead to much more and say a lot more than typical. I think that when we deal with such a great figure of different races or genres, we get very interesting ideas and television. We should also pay attention to performances, Blalock is very convincing, because Vulcan T'pol and Bacula really have a capricious character and strength that provides excellent performance. The rest of the cast also had good performances. My only reservation is as follows. Topic. It's good that it's different, but I like it a bit, for my taste. We need something a little bit bigger. It does not have to be orchestral. Maybe a little more electronic sound would be enough. And my second complaint. They sell too many additives. They could fix it by selling fewer commercials or making all the shows have two participants. Otherwise, we'll see that the shows end too soon, just like one of my Voyager complaints.
