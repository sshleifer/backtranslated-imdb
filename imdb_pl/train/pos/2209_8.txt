In my opinion, this is a pretty good show with well-known figures. I liked the sight of Greg Kinnear as the host. There are many reasons why I said that. Although Hal Sparks was a good host, sometimes I would like Greg Kinnear not to leave. If you ask me, nobody seems to be in the TV program for the whole time. Even so, I liked watching different hosts and other people masquerading as stars. If you ask me, it was fun. Before I finish this, I must say that I miss this concert. In conclusion, I highly recommend this program to all fans of sketch shows. You'll really like it.
