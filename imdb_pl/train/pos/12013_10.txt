After reading the comments on this video and seeing mixed reviews, I decided to add my ten cents worth saying that the film was perfect, not only in terms of visual beauty, writing, score, acting and directing, but through the presentation of the story of Joseph Smith and the way he has traveled through life in hardships and persecutions, for faith in God in the way he felt and knew that he was his path. I am very happy that I had a small role in telling the story of this extraordinary man. I recommend to everyone that they see it when the opportunity arises, no matter what religious path it may go, it only instills more determination to live the life that we should with the true values ​​of love and forgiveness that the Savior taught to do.
