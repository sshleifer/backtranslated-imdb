To connect with the beauty of this movie, pay special attention to the soundtrack, not only to music, but to the way all sounds help in the weave of images. How beautiful the opening scene leading to the expulsion of Gino establishes the motive of moral ambiguity! Pay attention to the way music introduces heroes when we are guided in a Giovanna marriage. Do not expect that you will find a lot of information about the political life of Italy in 1943. This is not the point. On the other hand, if you are susceptible to the music of images and sounds, you will be put into a word that goes beyond neo-realism. At the end of the film, we have moments reminiscent of Antonioni's landscape, which has more in common with the characters' inner lives than with real places. This is one of my favorite Visconti movies.
