This is not a bad movie. He follows the new conventions of contemporary horror, or film in the film, a well-known actress running to life in the first scene. This film takes the old psycho-killer convention and manages to do something new and interesting. It's always nice to see Molly Ringwald back in the attack. <br /> <br /> So it can be an example of what this species has become. Cut hits all the characters and is terrifying in some parts. I liked that I gave him eight.
