I really like this movie ... when I started to watch it, I thought I was going to get bored shortly, but it surprised me ... I thought it was a great movie and I saw it several times. Characters are reliable and I have to say that I fell in love with Brian Austin Green again (first time as Beverly Hills 90210). I recommend this movie if you are a fan of it, but I agree with another comment written earlier that the ending is a bit disappointing. I would like it to turn out to be a bit different! It does not matter, however, a good story.
