Probably my favorite movie, a story of selflessness, sacrifice and dedication to a noble cause, but it is not science or boring. It just never gets old, even though I've seen it 15 times or more in the last 25 years. The performance of Paul Lukas brings tears to my eyes, and Bette Davis, in one of the few truly lovable roles, is a delight. As the grandmother says, children are more like "dressed dwarfs" than children, but it just makes watching them more enjoyable. The slow awakening of the mother to what is happening in the world and under her own roof is credible and surprising. If I had a dozen thumbs, they would all be "on top" of the movie.
