I just came back from pre-release watching this great science-fiction movie noire. His style is definitely unique and very well made. It is filmed with real actors, but transformed into a black and white comic book style that you have never seen before. It goes a step further than Sin City and does it well. It is a successful combination of French comic and film cultures. The story and mood remind you of Blade Runner, and if you like this one, you'll love this one. The plot is intelligent, never boring and has some nice twists. This film is a must for every film-maker, except maybe for those who do not like science fiction or b & w.
