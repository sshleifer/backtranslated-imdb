This film is about basically interpersonal relationships and interactions between them. The main character is an elderly lady who begins her journey to her past at the twilight of her life, analyzing how she has lived her life. This journey is caused by the economic crisis of the sons and his intentions to put her in a nursing home. It is a very honest look at some of the issues that we all ask ourselves at some point in our lives, and there are plenty of secondary ideas to discuss in this film, such as family heritage, true love, marriage or destiny. Although this kind of movie melodrama is nothing new, this one can be useful to watch it with family members to discuss some ideas. The actors have good performances and the characters are very reliable, but over time some characters may not be fully developed. I really recommend this movie for a quiet Saturday afternoon.
