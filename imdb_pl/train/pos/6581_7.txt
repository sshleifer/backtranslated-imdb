Looking for Quo Vadis in my local video store, I found this version from 1985, which looked interesting. Wow! It was amazing! A very kind movie of Ken Russell - bizarre, stylized, very artistic and of course "different". Nero was presented not so much as incarnate evil but as a crazy, unfulfilled emperor who would rather have a circus career. He probably wondered why he was placed on the ground in the "leading" empire - it was not too much fun, and the fun was what he missed. Klause Maria Bandaur had a great time playing this role and played for everything that was worth it. Yes, Nero persecuted Christians with revenge; one of many who did it. At one point, one of his supporters murmurs: "No one will ever understand that we just protected ourselves." He is right.
