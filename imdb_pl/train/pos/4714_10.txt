Famous words of the owner of Roman Maroni's nightclub, "a bad corker," which spends the whole film not only as a rival of Johnny Dangerous, but also in English. <br /> <br /> Another unappreciated classic that you can only find in the afternoon matinÃ©es or "Late Late Late Show", Johnny Dangerously is a wonderful satirical hit about the good heart of a boy who secretly leads a criminal life to help pay for medical care mother and put your brother in law school. br /> <br /> Yes, there is a story, but who cares? The cast, which includes Joe Piscopo, Dom DeLuise, Marilu Henner and Alan Hale Jr, will make you wait until you see what will happen next. <br /> <br /> There is too much laughter here to be found here. Like an airplane, you have to pay attention or miss something. I highly recommend it to anyone who can laugh well or two !!!
