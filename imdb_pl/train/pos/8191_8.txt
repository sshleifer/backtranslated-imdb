The Impossible Planet and The Satan Pit consist of two of the best episodes of the "new" second season of Doctor Who. Having said that, it should be obvious that a significant part of the story essentially transfers the story of Quatermass and the Pit (1967) to the space scene, with the history of the universe intertwined with the Beast's story 666. These episodes cement the emotion of the relationship between Rose and Doctor, while emphasizing the growing self-confidence Rose, establishing her as not quite equal, but also a partner with our beloved Lord of Time. Also noteworthy is the elegant scenario of Matt Jones, which reduces the sporadic over-reliance on one-dimensional films for the Doctor and the performances of the entire cast, especially the illustrious Shauna Parkes as the actor captain Zachary Cross Flane.
