Thinking about the "Great Escape", I let my mind return to this little gem of a childhood movie. I read and reread the autobiographical novel from 1949, which inspired it, and when it came to the only cinema (in fact we never used that word) in a city that showed "foreign" films, I bought my ticket for the first time. <br /> <br /> As someone brought up on war chronicles and propaganda films during World War II, I was very interested in discovering the realities of this conflict, which was reflected in the memories and stories of people who were there personally. It expanded later on the willingness to buy for years every book on the subject and finally to read the equally fascinating novels of Hans Helmut Kirst and Erich Maria Remarque, which provided even deeper sensitivity. However, film versions were not similar to that because they rarely provided goods. <br /> <br /> The black-and-white film was never served as well as in those years. I have never seen any technical version of a war that seems as authentic as the deep chiaroscuro of films like "Wooden Horse". If it is true that we are always doomed to imprisonment in the images of our childhood, then I confess it freely. <br /> <br /> And there will never be another like Leo Genn as an emblematic British war hero on film. Even Sir Alec.
