Although time has revealed how some effects have been made, this love and adventure story is still unique. <br /> <br /> If you've never seen this movie before you are shocked at how much later filmmakers were stolen. I watched it with a friend who was surprised by how much Disney Aladdin put together from the movie. They loved the movie and were happy that it was a milestone for many other films and creators. <br /> <br /> I gave the movie 8 out of 10 instead of 10 out of 10, which is where a large part of the movie lives, because during the last 15 minutes, the movie breaks down during stimulation. Everything is hurried, as if it must suddenly come to an end. From the point from the exit of the genie to the end, it seems that it is more a sketch, and then the end of painting. It does not kill the movie, but it weakens it. <br /> <br /> It's still required watching for anyone who loves a good story or even a great movie.
