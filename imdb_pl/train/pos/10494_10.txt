An excellent view of a mature woman who will lose everything (even the secateurs have a mortgage). The way he engages in this special "business", innocence and true love that exists between people from a small town, is perfectly mixed to give us a fresh, light and fun comedy as a result. I could not stop laughing at the very funny scene of two old ladies in the drugstore. <br /> <br /> I love European movies, and on movies like this one my opinion is growing. The film, which I also recommend with eyes closed, in the same genre, is Waking Ned Devine. <br /> <br /> Saving Grace, a comedy that many friends enjoyed the same way as me. You will like it.
