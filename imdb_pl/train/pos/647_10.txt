Well, of course not, women are too sensitive and needlessly average, which is interesting from mother to whore, though not pseudo-artistic, extravagant or blatantly. Unlike many of you, I have only seen La Maman and La Putain twice. Like many good movies, I noticed that my opinion on this subject improved after the second look. All I know is what I've seen and I have not gone into further exploits until I bought the DVD myself. I need to understand exactly why I like this movie so much, but really, what do I care about, why? Although I am sure that I could form a wonderful explanation. Okay, so you can disagree, maybe it's a bit boring, I'm not an expert. The blonde reminds me of beautiful Grushenka.
