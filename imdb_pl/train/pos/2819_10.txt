This movie is buffoon! and I loved it! The "Dragonlord" (Jacky Chan) and his buddy "cowboy" completely made the movie fun, meaningful and simply stupid. The film is a rare mixture of the struggle between good and evil and (somehow) miracles and games that grow up. Long Shao Ye takes the viewer through the daily activities of the young dragon dragon (so-called because he is the son of a rich family) and cowboy, which includes the implementation of clever, sophisticated ways to avoid learning (with the help of the entire household, including the guardian) competing in a rather boyish (and idiotically interesting) ways to get the feeling of a local girl, to compete in "football" (you'll see what I mean) and the list goes on. Somehow they are in the middle of a fight to save a shipment of valuable antiques and the lives of several people. <br /> <br /> The movie has its serious moments. But they do not depress but inspire. Boys' play is not lost in this exchange, but is actually used against evil. What I really love about this movie is how it ends. Not a typical confrontation (which in itself was amazing), but well, you will see. I will only say that it really captures the spirit of the movie. <br /> <br /> stupid, witty, meaningful and nostalgic. great movie.
