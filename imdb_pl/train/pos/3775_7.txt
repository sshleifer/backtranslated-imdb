My Take: goofy, yet ingenious mess. <br /> <br /> Keanu Reeves (Yes! That Keanu Reeves) and Alex Winter return as two punk rock idiots in the continuation of the adventure comedy BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE, now an iconic classic. In this sequel, Bill and Ted have much more to do than travel in time. They could equally well travel to Heaven and Hell! At the beginning of this sequel, Bill and Ted are preparing for the "Battle of Teams" contest, which can make them more famous than ever. Meanwhile, many years in a futuristic civilization, the wizard of time from the first film (always observed George Carlin) runs a university praising the names of Bill and Ted. There, the evil tyrant (Joss Ackland, from THE HUNT FOR RED October) is plotting to get rid of two idiotic rock stars once and for all. It sends two identical Android replicas (in the words of Bill and Ted: Robot Us) to do a dirty job. <br /> <br /> Later Bill and Ted are dying and they have to find their way through hell, with the inhabitants who just have the worst memories of the duo and then across Heaven trying to return to earth to save their girls ... and their show. During this breakaway journey, they play board games with none other than Death (William Sadler, from DIE HARD 2), recalling a similar moment in the classic foreign film THE SEVENTH SEAL from 1957, help from several intelligent aliens and more. <br /> <br /> The range of BOGUS JOURNEY's lush special effects is not a standard yet, and even a bit of humor and appearance and style are a bit outdated (to be honest, the film also seems to have been released in the wrong year, even in the 90's But with this there is no lack of imagination and lively return of both performances and direction, BILL AND TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY is fun, ingenious and so, fake. <br /> <br /> Mark: *** 1/2 of 5.
