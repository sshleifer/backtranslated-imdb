I remember the original series primarily thanks to the unique combination of twisty humor and macabre subject matter. Kolchak was a hard-bitten reporter from the school of Ben Hecht, who reported on the big cities, and his lively determination and wise attitude made even the most mundane episode extremely visible. My personal favorite was "The Spanish Moss Murders" because of its completely original story. Poor, troubled youth from Cajun from Bayou Louisiana, participates in a sleep study experiment to analyze dreams. Something is inexplicably bad and it literally dreams of living a swampy creature inhabiting dark folk tales about his youth. This sinister manifestation looks for all those who have harmed the dreamer in his conscious state and brutally strangling them to death. Kolchak investigates and discovers this terrible truth, to the disappointment of police captain Joe "Mad Dog" Siska (wonderfully written by grumpy Keenan Wynn) and a dream-sleep researcher, played by the second creator of improvisation in Second City, Severn Darden, to quit, subtle perfection. A maliciously funny, shaking finale takes place in the Chicago system and is an attraction of the series. Kolczak has never been better. Timeless.
