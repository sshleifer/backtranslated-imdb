Although the style of the film is not as understated and realistic as the sound version, it is still a very good movie. In fact, he was considered the perfect movie in his time, because he was nominated for the first Oscar for the best film (losing to WINGS). I still think that WINGS is a top-class film, but this one is excellent, despite the slight over-attention of the host, Emil Jannings. <br /> <br /> Jannings is a general from Tsarist Russia, who survives the last days earning a few bucks in the twenties, being an addition to Hollywood. It seems that his happiness changed when he received a call to quit - to play the imperial Russian general fighting the communists during the revolution. Of course, this is not very prudent when it comes to acting, but also forces the old lady to think about old times and revolutions. <br /> <br /> Exactly what's next, I'll leave you, but it's a pretty good movie - especially at the end. By the way, look for William Powell as a Russian director. Despite the fact that it was made in 1928, with makeup does not look much younger than in many of his later films.
