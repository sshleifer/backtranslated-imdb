It was a typical B-class movie in Hollywood from the 1940s, but he managed to go beyond his expectations. Why? It has a great story and is supported by Nina Foch, George MacReady and Dame May Witty, as the feminine villain of all people. <br /> <br /> When the young lady answers the secretary's announcement, she certainly gets more than she expected. The only talents an employer is looking for are those that will lead to her death. It seems that Witty and MacReady want to pass it on, as their daughter-in-law and wife, respectively. MacReady killed his real wife and wants to do Foch so that he can apply for the body. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of how Foch tries to get the city residents to believe her and how she has been virtually thwarted by everything she does. Why do not people believe her?
