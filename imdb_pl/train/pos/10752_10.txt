It was the most visually stunning, moving, amazing and amazing story I've ever experienced. Honestly, even these adjectives can not describe it. I can not just choose one scene that would stand out for me. I suppose if I had to name a few, it would be the fireman's reaction to the crash of the jumping victims; the reaction of the people trapped in the elevator, who did not realize what was going on, finally come out on the terrifying scene; shock and disbelief onlookers; and finally silence. <br /> <br /> On this day, and even now, I am reminded of Star Wars (1977). Obi-Wan says: "I felt a great disruption in the Force, as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and suddenly fell silent." It's amazing how it is so accurate in its description. There was a real disruption of strength. <br /> <br /> This document clearly shows this disruption. Feelings are so incredibly visual. Anger, frustration, shock, fear, exhaustion and realization of its enormity. It's all there. There is nothing missing. <br /> <br /> It is a powerful and the most moving document and deserving of Emma. Not only because it documents 9/11, but because it is just everything that should be. <br /> <br /> If you plan to watch, be sure to grab a box of tissues. You will need them. I know I did it.
