I saw this movie in the theater when it first appeared a few years ago and I loved it. But I still wanted to see it again this year to see if it's still good compared to the films that are now available, and I'll say it's one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life !!!!!!! !! !!!! <br /> <br /> You must know that you do not have to miss a minute of this movie, if you do not follow the action, you will get lost and you will not understand the end. <br /> <br /> The end is what makes this movie so good, you can not expect it. <br /> <br /> Congratulations for the producer!
