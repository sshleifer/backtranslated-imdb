A visual creative epic with a unique style. <br /> <br /> This film may not have the most alternative drama nor the most artistic action. But who dares to say that this film is not an art? I am not an advocate of the idea that an important film must be serious, non-commercial or interfere with my questions. Even if there are many movies, which corresponds to the attributes I like. <br /> <br /> Bogus Journey is definitely not one of those movies. You get pure, over-creative with a very positive, charged, childish energy. This film does not reflect reality. He is friendly and naive. Imagine the future world described by Rufus - for me it would be a nice combination of time and place to live! In addition to this music; -) <br /> <br /> Technically, Bogus Jorney is very well made. I have always liked the pictures and scenery of this film. Especially at this point, Bogus Journey is definitely ahead of its prequel. Also the effects are good and I think that most of them were made very cg. Generally, I prefer good old effects in big budget movies. Sure it is "another Hollywood movie" from the view of some people. But I think it is a very charismatic way. <br /> <br /> A short word for the soundtrack: all the music of the band and orchestra matches the movie very well. Also no sound. I'm not a huge fan of rock music, but I had to get this song through Winger from the stage of "station" building the bill and ted work in the van. I love the unconventional work of the camera at the beginning. <br /> <br /> Let me end this with this statement: <br /> <br /> This movie is very na√Øve and very ingenious! It is much better than Panzerkreuzer Potemkin, The Godfather, Eraserhead or Aguirre - God's wrath. Is absolutely better than citizen kane, apocalypse or markers chris sans soleil ... ... is even better than Total Recall ... No way!? Yes Yes! <br /> <br /> Bogus Journey Bill and Ted are simply the best movie ever made. <br /> <br /> Whoever dares to disagree is guilty of "artsy-fartsy" or likes Terminator Salvation (which is more defamation) <br /> <br /> PS: part 1 is not a better movie. So Bogus Jorney is a perfect continuation. Even Terminator 2 is not a perfect continuation! This is not!
