The goal of creating this film, one of the earliest and best international cinema releases, was to make it more accessible to the masses. And it succeeded in a perfect way. The audience would not sit down on a love story about two young exotic lovers in ancient Egypt, if they played a typical 300-kilo tenor and soprano with vocal equipment to actually sing great music. Hence the visual replacement of the beautiful directors (young Loren, handsome Della Marra and slinky Maxwell), which make the story more credible, giving those who do not know the story or music a better chance of being drawn into a charming aria that would otherwise not be. All in all a charming introduction to one of Verdi's great works. I remember seeing it when I was in junior high school and it certainly aroused my interest in opera, a form I was not familiar with at the time. I still consider this film sensitive and I recommend it especially to those who can appreciate great music, accompanied by better than average visualizations. Luciano Della Marra was outstanding as Radames and unfortunately he did not appear in the public for any other film.
