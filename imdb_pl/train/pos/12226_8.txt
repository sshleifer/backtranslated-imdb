This is the best TV movie of all time! I say this because I am a big fan of Silverstone? Partially, I would still see it even without it.

Yes, indeed, he is a rebel again. This time he is not angry, he is too good and is a little afraid to do things that seem above the law. But he does not do things that a normal teenager would do. Instead, he spends his time reading the detectives and solves the crime.
