Let me first say that the director has a wonderful use of titles in his shots. I liked it very much. I really liked the movie, but I must say that next to Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinear is quite boring. Brosnan blends in so well with the character that it is really difficult to remember that he is the same guy who played in bond. It also shows its range and depth as an actor. This is a kind of indie flick and it was really nice to see, especially for all the mainstream movies that flood movies at this time of the year. I think that the characters are well prepared. The turn in the middle was particularly good. I also liked how characters realistically break off. So many times in the film we have these caricatures of people who are not really figures but stereotypes of walking ... I like different approaches to this film. I'm thinking about this movie when I think about this movie, but I think it's more enjoyable and overall a better movie ...
