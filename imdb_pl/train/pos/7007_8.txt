From the first scene you get tips on what may be happening here. It becomes more and more obvious when the plot unfolds. Acting is perfect, and these actors touch your soul. Although I knew what was going to happen, I was very surprised by the motive. I'm still surprised why Ben did what he did. We saw "second thoughts" on his face, but the final victim seemed to contradict his emotions and feelings. It was a very interesting and moving story, but it confused me. Maybe it was the point of the movie. I liked the movie and Wil Smith can make another good selection of the movie. This guy knows how to entertain the audience!
