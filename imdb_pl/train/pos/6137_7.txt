What a great gem. This is an extraordinary story that is pleasant to watch. Yes, he has singing, but he is very nicely incorporated into the story and is very melodious to hear him. It was nice to watch; I liked it from the beginning to the end! <br /> <br /> The film takes place in England during World War II. It's about a witch student who is looking for the missing part of the spell he needs. He uses his rough "magic" to move her and the three children under his protection to different places to find her. A correspondence teacher joins them, who is surprised that the lessons from his school do work! <br /> <br /> Although the special effects may seem a bit outdated initially, after getting used to them, they become part of the charm of the film. In fact, the film won the Oscar for these effects! <br /> <br /> The film is innocent and funny - and it's hard not to like melodic songs. The characters are wonderfully interesting to watch. I think that everyone of all ages can find something for themselves in this film.
