Now my friends, movies such as "La BÃªte" (aka "The Beast" or "O Monstro") can only be done on the old continent :), in this movie we see everything: horses dirty sex, nymphomaniac type off gorilla, non etc. etc. In serious words, the allegory that men can sometimes be brutal, visceral and violent, Walerian Borowczyk (director) shows us the loss of innocence, sexual violence, rape and brutality. It is an amazing film experience, bizarre and full of grotesque scenes. I recommend this movie to all fans of shocking exploitation in Europe. If you like this, I recommend: "Orloff Against the Invisible Man" and "Alterated States".
