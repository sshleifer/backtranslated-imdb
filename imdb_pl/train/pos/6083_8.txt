Brian Dennehy, Bill Paxton, Joe Pantalino and, most importantly, Jeff Fahey, all in one movie. Wow, that's all I can think about. They are the four most underrated actors in the industry and they work together perfectly. It's like poetry, how they play each other and emanate the natural ability to seem like the best buddies for eons for making a movie. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is fine and can be quite intense to watch the first time, and the four stars greatly help in re-observation. I can not describe how good it was to see Bill Paxton and Jeff Fahey together on the screen. The greatest moment is watching a couple from a distance and self-filling the vocals, it almost brought tears to my eyes. <br /> <br /> Good movie, great cast, see. Why? Four words, Fahey, Dennehy, Paxton, Pantalino.
