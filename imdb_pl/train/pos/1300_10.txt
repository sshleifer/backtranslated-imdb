For the first time I saw a song from this DVD at a hifi concert in November 2006 in London (so far I was not really in cream !!) It was a great Arcam system that sounded great with dts. and let me tell you that this is by far the most exciting music DVD I've ever seen. Cream's performance at their age was simply amazing, and the sound quality is the best I've heard on a musical DVD. the kind of music you like, it will definitely increase on you. It's pure brilliance of their performance that will make you watch it many times.
