I've only seen season 1 so far, but it's just great !! Many people have been stuck on the island. No one is who he seems to be and everyone seems to have a lot of skeletons in the wardrobe ... it sounds as if Melrose Place meets the Crusoe family and why is it so wonderful? Probably, however, this is not the advertisement of a bucket full of X files, the dose of "what"? and big "hey" and the island you've ever dreamed of - in your weirdest nightmares and you'll be lost. This story has so many twists and turns that it is unbelievable. Great configuration, solid game with liberating acceptance that in the end everyone is human (well, almost everyone ... I think ...) about good and bad sides. But strange, so strange ...
