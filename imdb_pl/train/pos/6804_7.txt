Do not let my constructive criticism stop you from buying and watching this classic Schneider's Roma. This movie was shot at a lower budget, probably against the will of Ernest Marishka, so he had to pay back. For example, England is portrayed as bordering on Germany. he rode the cart himself. They came too soon. Probably could not be helped, but the castle they rented for the film was Austrian. When she said she was a queen, she goes to the royal room, where court members bow to her, where are the British citizens outside the castle, cheering on her new queen? Why ISBN does not show himself on the balcony to welcome his subjects? Low budget! Where did the audience realize these imperfections? I wonder how did the critics feel? In the pub scene, he meets Prince Albert, but the ISBN is not excited about it. During the meeting in the gastronomic part of the inn you will hear music from well-known old American war songs such as "My old Kentucky home" and "Old black Joe". What? songs from the civil war in the 1930s? Is Romy Schneider portrayed as Scarlet? Where is Mammy? Does Magna Shnieder play her too? Is Adrian Hoven Rhett or Ashley? What was in Marishka's mind? Well, add it to the camp. This is the unwittingly satirical account of Queen Victoria. This is the only reason why you should pick it up or see it. 03 11 09 correction Germany and England are combined
