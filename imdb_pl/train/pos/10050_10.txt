Daniell Steel's Daddy, what a refreshing story. This film extolled the importance of the family and the importance of parents in the lives of their children. How rare is it? In the time of "Heather has two mums" (or something else, fill empty spaces), it's easy to understand why this topic is not for everyone. Bearing in mind my father's role, I hoped it would be another Saga Daniell Steel. How disappointing is that it will end. Each character was important and did a fantastic job, fulfilling his role. I would like every character to grow over the years. I loved this movie, this is the one that I will perform every time it's on. Good story, good game and I hope it is not a spoiler, but no intrusive sex or bad language. Yes, it touched my heart. Warning, prepare Kleenex. It is sad that this side of family life is rarely presented today in our entertainment, whether on television or on television. Cinema. Daniell, if you're listening, You Go Girl, give us more.
