This is an excellent movie with star cast and great acting. I never stop watching him. I particularly like the scene where Danny Glover and the character of Kevin Kline, namely Simon and Mack, have a brunch together. Kevin Kline is so natural and it seems that his manners are easy and often met. This is a very "real" movie. <br /> <br /> However, one of the most powerful scenes in the movie is at the beginning of the movie, when Simon arrives on the stage in which the Macka car broke down. The film also has a strong message and does not resemble a stereotypical movie in which one person preaches his audience. Instead, the emotions and situations of actors provide a striking message that works best without using words. And finally, Mary McDonell is always brilliant.
