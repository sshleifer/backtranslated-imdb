For me, the issue of life and death is simply the best film ever made. <br /> <br /> The class emanates from the beginning to the end. It is a stimulating, thought-provoking mirror of the post-war world and relations between nations. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is simply stunning, and the effect of monochromatic and Technicolor mixing to emphasize different worlds runs smoothly. Characters and the development of the story are close to perfection, and attention to detail promotes a completely credible fantasy. <br /> <br /> Regardless of how many times I watch this movie - and often watched it - it never disappoints me. It makes me smile, I laugh, makes me think I'm crying. Today it is as fresh as it was in 1946. <br /> <br /> If I had only one movie to stop and watch, it would be a movie about life and death.
