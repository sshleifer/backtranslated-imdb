A great, funny, sweet movie with Morgan Freeman (who plays alone) and who meets a Spanish girl named Scarlet (Paz Vega) in a small store while researching a potential independent film. For the first ten minutes I was a little uncertain about the movie, but once I was in the shop, I really started to enjoy the movie. It shows how a positive attitude can change something. It does not contain any complicated threads and is easy to follow, but it will endure the saddest moods and make you smile without the need for a small clich√© romance. It contains several scenes that make you laugh at the sides. A very rare masterpiece!
