This very funny British comedy shows what could happen if part of London, in this case Pimlico, announced itself independent of the rest of Britain and its rights, taxes and post-war restrictions. Merry chaos will be what will happen. <br /> <br /> The explosion of the war bomb leads to the discovery of ancient documents that show that Pimlico has been handed over to the centuries of the Duchy of Burgundy, a small historical footnote long forgotten. For the new Burgundians, however, this is an unexpected opportunity to live as they please, free from any interference from Whitehall. <br /> <br /> Stanley Holloway is perfect as a small town politician who suddenly turns out to lead one of the smallest nations in the world. Dame Margaret Rutherford is delighted, like a history professor who supports Pimlico. Other prominent actors include Hermione Baddeley, Paul Duplis, Naughton Wayne, Basil Radford and Sir Michael Hordern. <br /> <br /> Welcome to Burgundy!
