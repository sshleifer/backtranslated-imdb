Great movie! Slow: YES. <br /> <br /> ... but original, deeply atmospheric, dark and terrifying, perfectly SURREAL (feels like a nightmare). <br /> <br /> I would compare it to David Lynch Style (Eraserhead, Inland Empire, Blue Velvet) can be mixed with a bit of Barton Finka and Naked Lunch (Insects!). Also a bit of Jodorowsky (Fando y Lis) .... <br /> <br /> Add some night on earth, Angel Heart and a little Begotten, Pi (would it be remembrance of Tetsuo?) Jacob's ladder, Barker's The Forbidden and Salome - which they should at least create the dark night concept ... NUIT NOIRE. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for avant-garde and / or surreal cinema (like me), you'll like this one. If you're expecting something like a movie full of action with an average story - try your luck with something else. <br /> <br /> Final words: The plot is very, very strange and unusual and probably the # 1 reason why most people who do not appreciate this movie hate it.
