I found the only and only comment on this movie, which is completely uninformed and completely too sharp, so I decided to write my own. I saw the movie for the first time when it appeared, and since then I've caught it a few times. Above all, let me say that, in general, what the film does RIGHT is what makes it worthwhile. It does not matter that he has some budget eccentricities and other mistakes. It's worth watching. The idea to base a movie about Walt Whitman's visit to a restrictive, narrow-thinking Anglo-Canadian community in southern Ontario and liven up people is a great mis-stage. The film is about humanizing catalysis inspired by Whitman. In this sense, it is exactly accurate. Acting - especially Rip Torn (Whitman) and Colm Feore as a doctor - is very good. Scripts and dialogue are strong and pay due attention to the customs and the differences of time. In general, what do you dislike? Also, give me another video where Whitman is so lively?
