Well, it definitely does not look like anything else directed by Lynch. Without supernatural things, without violence, without vulgarisms. Nevertheless, it is a beautiful movie. It's a bit slow, but maybe it was intentional because it's the story of a six-week old man's journey (this is my best guess for the duration). The heroes are ordinary people and therefore they are credible. The performances are good and the final scene was incredibly moving. Anyone who has siblings can refer to him. Lyle and Alvin do not even have to say anything. They return for a moment to old times and all fights are forgotten.
