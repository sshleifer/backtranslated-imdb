Cor blimey. This film really surprised me because it is a masterpiece of comedy. Billy Zane is stunning as the main character and everyone manages to play straight enough for the comedy to be natural and easy. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is really good and the songs are fun. I recommend that you watch this movie with a group of friends, a few bottles of your favorite drink and be prepared for astonishment and good entertainment. <br /> <br /> It leads so perfectly with kitschy masterpieces like Plan 9. From outer space it is in the true tradition of the movie "B". But what makes it more than that is the caliber of people who took part in the film. Ron Pearlman for example. I still feel giggling on the stage, in which Zane takes step by step for no apparent reason in the almost ballet style. Everything is a bit crazy, and the better.
