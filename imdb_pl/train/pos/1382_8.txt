Not everything has been said in this great first movie of Céline Sciamma. Friendship, "desire to match", first sexual feelings ... All this and much more is sublimated by underwater scenes of synchronous swimming. <br /> <br /> All three girls in the movie try to find and express their personality in a completely different way. This is a much less violent approach to understanding teenage years compared to say "Thirteen", but still a very valuable trip. <br /> <br /> You have to see and leave all the American premières in the door. The soundtrack is A + by the way. <br /> <br /> Bon cinéma!
