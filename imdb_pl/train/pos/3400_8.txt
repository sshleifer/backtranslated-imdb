Domini Enfilren (Marlene Dietrich) spent most of her life caring for her father. Now that he's dead, he's free, but he does not know what he wants. Boris Androvsky (Charles Boyer) is a monk who escaped from the monastery to try more life. They meet by accident in Algiers, fall in love and get married. But she can not leave her past behind her, and she can not live without him ... <br /> <br /> HIGHLY ended a romance full of hysterical bad dialogue and situation. Dietrich and Boyer do their best to ensure good performances, but NOBODY can escape some of them! In a sense, however, it is a classic. It's shot in a beautiful technique (try to see it on DVD), where each frame is extremely beautiful. Dietrich is always dressed in nines (even in the middle of the desert) and strikes a hysterical pose to show the clothes and her body. Boyer just walks around, looking overwhelmed with pain (no shock). I still have not been bored. It was great to watch, and the non-stop stupid dialogue kept me seated. The end almost brought me down from the chair because I was laughing like that! Now I love diligent romances and I give them plenty of space, but really - it's unbelievable! It also takes very short 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> As a camp classic, I give him 8. As a serious movie - 1.
