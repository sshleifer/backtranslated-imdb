"Yes, Georgio" is a light and pleasant movie / comedy that contains beautiful settings and beautiful music. This is not my favorite movie, but it's a movie that I liked more than once. Some reviewers have suggested that if someone would like to enjoy Pavarotti, it would probably be better if he picked up a DVD with an opera. Although the full opera may be a better representation of Pavarotti's operatic talents, often the opera requires costumes and stories that completely hide the appearance and nature of the person. "Yes, Georgio" allows Pavarotti to use spoken voice and demonstrate personality and character in a way that the opera will not be. <br /> <br /> Many reviewers seemed to be unbelievable; I do not agree. Extremely talented people can be both self-centered and charming - glamor enough to captivate intelligent and beautiful people. In addition, people who are very different from each other often get insight into themselves and develop in a positive way, contacting people who extend them or take them in directions that they would not choose themselves. Both Georgio and Pamela become more open to unexplored parts of themselves in their relationships with others. <br /> <br /> Relax and let yourself visually and soundly satisfying the movie with Pavarotti at the peak of his vocal abilities. The final scenes from Puccini's Turandot are worth the time to get there.
