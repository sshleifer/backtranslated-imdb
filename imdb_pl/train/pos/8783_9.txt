Gentleman Jim really is not a boxing movie. This is the vehicle for Errol Flynn as Jim Corbett. But, having said that, boxing scenes are a real eye for the contemporary viewer. There are no 12 rounds, decisions are made here. <br /> <br /> Errol Flynn plays an Irish bank clerk who wins the heavyweight champion title. Flynn is perfect for the role of gentle but unpredictable Corbett. His opponent, John Sullivan, is even better, he played an old school, played by Ward Bond. <br /> <br /> The theme of the film is a man who is pushing his big chance. Corbett leaves his mundane life behind and builds a new personality as Gentleman Jim. Jim is a chancer who can adapt to any social environment. He is a liar and an egoist. Sullivan, heavyweight boxing champion, is presented as a simple brutal, but his honesty and sporting competition gives a certain contrast to the main character. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of action and excitement and a wonderful ending with the required redemption for everyone. And Errol Flynn gets a girlfriend.
