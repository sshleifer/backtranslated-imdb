Remarkable for her famous expressive scene when marvelous Detmers takes the penis of his young lover from his pants and mouth. Even without this moment the film is a great, though slightly disturbing, passionate and blindingly sexy ride. Detmers performs a great performance as a partially insane, insatiable admiration, wandering around her flat nakedness. Dressed, partially dressed and naked, she steals most of the film about love, sexual passion, philosophy and politics. For me, the last two are a bit lost, and the ending is the most confusing when her fianc√© is released, while other terrorists are released, seem uncertain of who she wants, and the young lover seems more interested in his exams than anything else when she cries, beautifully, of course!
