A clever, undeniably funny romp with Peter Ustinov as a career defrauder with goals at the American conglomerate in London. He is supported by foxy (and deceptively severe) Maggie Smith and threatened by exposure by the jealous entrepreneur Bob Newhart. It is a panic movie with many minds. Ustinov is unique, like Smith, and Newhart is quite funny. The real surprise is Karl Malden as a pill with the "executive vice president". Malden was rarely so loose. Cesar Romero and Robert Morley appear in funny scenes. The outstanding musical score is Laurie Johnson. The direction of Eric Till is brisk, and the scenario of Ustinova and Iry Wallach is first-rate and very intelligent. Swinging time!
