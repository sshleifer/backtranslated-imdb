As a Pokémon fan, I really liked this movie. He introduces new legendary Pokémon (like any movie) and adds depth to the relationship between his characters. I do not expect, however, that those who are not fans of Pokémon, will enjoy it (this includes MOST adult). Some lines were trivial, but this may be unavoidable when copying a movie into English. The animation was beautiful, although there were several parts that did not look good. And although the villain is a bit banal, I think the movies have done a good job on the bike by various types of villains and I guarantee you that not everyone is like them. Those who did not like it, I say to myself, but Pokémon fans will love it.
