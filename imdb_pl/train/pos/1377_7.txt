In areas where they overlap, this great movie is light years before the innocence of 2004, which gave the impression of a rheumy eye and a heavy breath that stared at young girls. The effect here is much more realistic and really goes to the heads of three heroes who are breaking through a period of youthful traps. These three principles, all unknown to me, give very certain performances, ones that can be so natural that it will be difficult for them to reproduce this quality of action in other movies, so I would not be too surprised if they are not heard again. It would be nice if it could escape the Houses of Arts and Multiplexes, where there is only an outside chance that it will "speak" to the crowd of chewing gum to which it is not addressed.
