This film tells the story of Queen Victoria's life during her youth and her first years as a monarch of Great Britain. <br /> <br /> "Young Victoria" has amazing production. Each stage is designed and decorated with impeccable detail. Extravagant costumes, rich locations and beautifully maintained gardens make "The Young Victoria" very impressive. What amazed me most was the well-thought-out cinematography. As every person is placed in relation to the background or foreground, it is well thought out, each scene is well composed. The scene that hits me the most was when Victoria talks to Melbourne. Melbourne was placed in the center of the door frame for Victoria, while from the corner of Melbourne Victoria was located between the space in which Melbourne held his hand on his hips. be respected and understood by a person without historical knowledge about Queen Victoria. Many events are hurried or even not explained. I was expecting a great coronation scene and, unfortunately, it lasted only a few seconds. <br /> <br /> In general, "The Young Victoria" is a good movie and it would be even better if it was longer so that the events could be properly explained without hurry.
