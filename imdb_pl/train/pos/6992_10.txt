I would not say it's a bad movie; in fact, it is quite typical of the kind of film that has been studying "poverty". Filmed for Monogram, Bela Lugosi is very effective in the role of a somewhat mad doctor-scientist pretending to be a respectable member of the community. In this movie, Bela and his followers have a nasty habit of stealing young brides, and after their deaths they inject my wife Bela with a serum taken from their bodies to keep her young. Lugosi aims to create this nice movie, but the film suffers from ultra-wooden actors with Luana Walters and Tristram Coffin. Coffin (a nice name for a guy in horror) is particularly bad in this case. I've seen him in many movies and TV shows and he's always the same; stiff, wooden and completely unconvincing. Miss Walters is only a little better, but she lacks her acting talent to make her role credible. Nevertheless, the viewer can enjoy the great Lugosi who played another horrible idea to finally be thwarted! Despite the poor performance of some "The Corpse Vanishes" is a nice movie for everyone.
