I watched the movie in a very strange way - I put it on my Netflix list and did not remember why (except that I knew Philip Seymour Hoffman). Since the film has no opening credits, I did not even remember who directed it. <br /> <br /> When I watched with my wife, I turned to her about 45 minutes and said: "You know, I still want to decide that I hate this movie, but something in it does not let me stop watching it. "Then, in the middle of the movie, there are about half a dozen scenes that are really electrifying in the performances of the actors. <br /> <br /> Only when the credits finished, I realized that it was Sidney Lumet movie. And I thought - wow. I'm surprised that Lumet has taken a really dirty little story about really mean people. But this is the testimony of his talent, which took me so much that I did not even realize it was him. <br /> <br /> Philip Seymour Hoffman is really good in this movie. How terrible good. Put it against Capote, and I would argue that Oscar should have been in this movie. <br /> <br /> I also recommend a special narrative plot from Lumet, Hawke and Hoffman about film making - it's fun and educational, in which Hawke plays a student willing to learn at the master's feet. Lumet definitely teaches you the first rule of working with actors - kiss their butts still! <br /> <br /> There are many brutal, melodramatic movies that are empty ciphers when everything is said and done. And in this film there is an element - that the actors fill the air with sulky gusts of emotion, and when the smoke brightens up, there is nothing left. Nothing resonates at a deeper level. <br /> <br /> But Lumet gave us Network and Twelve Angry Men - films that were brought to the highest levels of the cinema in their own way. <br /> <br /> This movie is not on this level. But there is something in it. And maybe that's enough. <br /> <br /> My last comment concerns comments - if you look at the number of comments about this little film here on IMDb - and the depth and intelligence of comments, pro and con - it's pretty good tip that with this movie something special happens.
