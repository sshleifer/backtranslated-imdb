I never trust anyone about the film. This also applies to critics. Sure, if you get positive reviews, it's okay and a plus, but most of the movies that get a critical rave, I hate. I liked the movie, which was an entertainment film. He takes you out of his life for a few hours and becomes a fictional character ... or Catherine Trammell. Sharon Stone is amazing in this role, as in the first. Anyone who says he is awful in this movie must have felt the same in the first b / c that he comes back, acting the same way as in Basic Instinct 1. Catherine is hers, and she plays her perfectly. Her one insert is great, as in the first one. Who can forget in the first movie when he tells the cops, "If you arrest me, do it ... otherwise throw me out of here!" Great scene and believe me, he does it again. I was fascinated by her. Her clothes, the way she smoked, believe me that she's worth the money just to see Stone's performances. I can not wait for this movie to be released on DVD, uninhibited, because I can only imagine how much better it will be. And yes, there are many twists and turns like at the first, including the end!
