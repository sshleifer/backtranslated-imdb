I will start with the fact that at the tender age of 34 I was suddenly widowed. I was devastated because he was not sick - he died unexpectedly basically on the coronary - his cervical artery went out - he died behind our home. The police have speculated a lot because he did something and hit his head. I was a murder suspect until the autopsy came back. <br /> <br /> My children were just as traumatic as me, so in love with my father's good form, like him. I had three young children, without education, without financial support. I did it very, very hard. <br /> <br /> In two years, my parents-in-law attacked me verbally, physically, emotionally and spiritually, not grieving in front of children, wearing masks and showing people what they want to see and not showing them my pain during the holidays. .. No one stood up to defend me and my choice to sit down on one vacation, except, of course, that the therapist of grief I saw had advised me to follow my heart and soul. My parents-in-law did not understand this! My relationship with them has changed forever and I have never returned to holidays. This is just one example of how my regret was neglected! My own (new) husband saw how I fell apart talking about trauma when I shared with my soul. I'm falling down, I can not breathe, I can hyperventilate and I usually do not function for a few days, even if I try to convey the hidden pain. <br /> <br /> Now about this movie ... <br /> <br /> Today my soul was moved, my heart broken. My fears and pain have returned from the real demons that this film presents; how sad it is compared to what others expect from us and demons inside. Adam Sandler perfectly presented the terrible agony you are struggling with, you defeat, and above all you work your own time! This film has absorbed all the pain I have struggled with for years. You see, when something is so bad for your soul, so profound that all utterances come from your lips in moments of thinking, you can not deal with it, not wanting you to be dead and walk through life, in a dead state. <br /> <br /> The Bible has the Holy Bible, Romans 8:26, to which I clung, that when my mouth and soul do not know what to pray for, that God's Holy Spirit carries this torment to God's feet - I do not have to speak. Sandler presented it to perfection! <br /> <br /> There is a scene in which he was taken to trial for mental health reasons, and returns to his in-laws --- (known to me) --- and tells them about the stunning truths he possessed for Se that he can not get through. It is a very powerful and powerful performance. I started yelling and it was hard for me after the troops got up to get out of the theater, feeling that my legs were too weak to do it. My son was with me and saw it first hand, my precise movements while trying to keep it all together; a lesson for him, my youngest one who barely remembers his daddy. It's been 13 years, but this movie brought me back to the point where I lost my parents-in-law forever, when they demanded a mask of my emotions and surrendering to their desires instead of respect for my own. <br /> <br /> I write this, so if you're in mourning, you're prepared for this movie, but I recommend it very well in the 1000-star performance of Sandler. <br /> <br /> If you're not pathetic yet, take a lesson from his movie and just listen and accept people's choices in their grief, letting them find peace in their own time! Sometimes the soul can not say words to convey our pain. <br /> <br /> Go see this movie with handkerchiefs, and not without preparations to take it ... to your soul!
