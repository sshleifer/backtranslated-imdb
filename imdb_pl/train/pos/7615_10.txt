This program is undoubtedly one of the biggest concerts on TV. I mean, acting is great, tension, drama, comedy, it has everything and such a simple story: the plane crashed on the island. The heroes are great, and Evangeline Lilly is HOT !!!!!! Matthew Fox once again shows us who a great actor is, Josh Holloway is great, Jorge Garcia is funny, I could continue and continue. Also unexpected twists, hero stories, music that is at the end of each episode. J.J. Abrahms once again proved that he is an excellent writer and producer. I mean, it's better than ALIAS and I loved ALIAS. Whoever does not watch this program should definitely consider buying a DVD and watching it because it lacks something wonderful. This performance can be the best show in the history of television !!
