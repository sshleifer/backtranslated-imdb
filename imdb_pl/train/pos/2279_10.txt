Previously, the faulty "Slaughterhouse Five" was the best. But this filming of "Mother Night" is very faithful to the book and preserves the comedy, the mystery and intentions of the tragedy. Fortunately, he was not Hollywood or idiotized the movie "Breakfast of Champions." Another good thing about this movie is that you do not have to be familiar with the book to follow it (I think, in the case of Slaughterhouse Five). This is probably also true for Breakfast of Champions, but they did such a bad job that it's better to read a book and not watch a movie! Nick Nolte did a great job in this movie.
