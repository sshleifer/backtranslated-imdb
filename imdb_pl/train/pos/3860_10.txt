In the Netherlands, a gay lecture by Gerard (Jeroen Krabbe) gives a lecture. She stays with a beautiful woman Christine (Renee Soutendijk) for the night and has sex with her (imagining that she is a boy). She plans to leave the next day, but look at the picture of handsome boyfriend Christine, Herman (Thoma Hoffman), and decides to stay on it. Then everything becomes strange. <br /> <br /> A big hit in the home of art in the United States in 1983. Why was he rated by X? Let's see ... there is strangling, full of naked men and women, castration, mutilation, simulated sex, a church scene with a cross that will shock most people, a gay sex scene in a crypt ... and all this comedy !!!!! Paul Verhoeven did it after "Spetters". "Spetters" was attacked by critics for extreme sexual sequences and condemned as junk. Verhoeven filled the film with very obvious symbolism, thinking that critics would think it was art and they praised it. He was right! The critics loved the movie without realizing Verhoeven was joking about them. Even so, it's a great movie. <br /> <br /> It is beautifully made by Jan de Bont (now the director himself) and there are so many symbolisms and obvious "hidden" layers in dialogue that you never get bored. The whole game is great - Krabbe plays a very mean character, but (somehow) has cheer for you; Soutendijk is simply stunning when he looks at her and plays his role in perfection - the small smile she gives when Gerard agrees to stay with her is cool; Hoffman is extremely handsome with a great body - deserves credit for completing the church sequence and going with Krabbe in the crypt. <br /> <br /> It is not for people who are easily offended or weak hearts, but if you like extreme movies that jokingly challenge you (like me), it's for you! 10 all the way.
