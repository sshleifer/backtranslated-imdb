It's one of the movies that does not require either brain or thinking, it's a very funny streak you forgot about in the next hour. I was really surprised by the acting of John Abraham, who usually played a gangster hero with an emotionless face, hence from playing the complete opposite and doing it successfully, pretending to shine among comical geniuses such as Paresh Rawal and Akshaye Kumar. I was also very surprised by three Akshaye girls, because the roles do not require too much talent, but mainly moaning about how Akshaye is falling apart (to other girls) I was surprised when they were able to determine and real personality, and you could distinguish between them, what It's good that most of the songs are good, colorful and funny, so on a boring Sunday evening you will definitely brighten up your mood.
