I am one of those people who usually watch programs and keep my feelings related to the private show. However, Pushing Daisies is my exception. I was interested in the program broadcast in commercials that gave an insight into the premise of the series. Initially, I was skeptical about it, especially after the Six Feet Under final was still in my head. We're going again, I thought. I watched the first, second, third and all other episodes. Wow! First of all, I thought it took the subject of death and was presented in a way that was tasty without getting sick. The characters were addictive and I like the idea that the main character of Ned is not able to literally touch the love of his life, Chuck without the consequences of her death. <br /> <br /> Most of the characters miss things they can not have. Except for Ned and Chuck, Olive misses Ned. Lily and Vivian miss the niece Chuck and Emerson, who always miss the prize money from the mysterious deaths they solve. I think the characters are perfect and reliable. I like that Emerson, who is black, plays from the rest of the character as an African American; I like the subtle cultural humor that sometimes comes from it. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this visual fairy tale is one of the most valuable pastimes I've seen in the 2007 season. I think the series is quite romantic for romantics and enough, who did it for lovers of secrets. I just want writers to come back to work so that the program can evolve further.
