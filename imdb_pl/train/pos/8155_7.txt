I am too old to know (or care) about the exact difference between rap and hip-hop. And being a Canadian, I've probably never seen MTV, but I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> But I thought that this movie was very funny when I saw it, a bright little satire. The culture of hip-hop is now so pervasive that it is difficult not to hear about it over and over. (If we could say the same about the bagpipe music.) I got most of the jokes (at least I think so). Sure, it comes from the spine, but there are many goals that can withstand tap treatment. It's just not carpenters, they're saints.
