when I first saw this movie, I thought it was boring, because nothing happens, but when all the terrible things began to happen, how the church dies and is brought back to life, and also gage and his mom die and there the idiot must bring back them to life, although he warns and ignores Jud.this is not the best job of Steven King. I thought his best job was shining. I do not think that the people who see this movie and comment on how horrible it was they are wrong because they just think they were thinking. as if this person could have done a better job in making a horror movie. I mean making an evil gage and how it kills. Judah is a genius. making the most innocent most unaware form one of the killers is cool. people who did not like the movie are stupid because it's all a scary movie and nothing more. do not expect something from a movie that is not. still in the general area it was not so good. I still recommend people watching the movie
