I loved this movie. The scenery was breathtaking, the plot had a few nice twists and the figures were well rounded. On two fronts, Rob Roy scored well above average. First of all, I rarely saw a "popular" movie in which the quality of dialogue was so high. There were many verbal cuts and thrusts that accompanied the well-prepared fencing. I could give many examples, but why should I? Just watch the movie. Secondly, this film understood the principle rarely recognized. For a drama to succeed, he needs not only a hero, but a really credible villain. If you do not have it, there is not much joy in cheering on good guys. And "Rob Roy" has not one, and three - Count Montrose, his follower Kilairna and Archie. Not one-dimensional villains, but fully muscled and very nasty. It requires a bit more patience than "Braveheart" - there are more dialogues, and the accents are a bit difficult, but it is a much wiser and subtle piece. (As I said, I loved this movie!)
