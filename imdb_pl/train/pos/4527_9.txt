One of the top ten comedies ever <br /> <br /> It seems that it is a comedy so joyful and light that it sings. Keaton's comedies are "carefully, harmoniously, intelligently ordered, thought out. <br /> <br /> Wonderfully funny, deliberately delightful and imaginative, THREE CENTERS should belong to the sketch of the top ten comedy, if I had to sketch one. A triple love story will enchant viewers; I would like to bring this approach here? Keaton's comedy is similar to Lang's DESTINY upside ??? or Ã€ REBOURS. Again, the couple travels through the waters of time and eras in the Stone Age, in Rome and at the time of Keaton in the Mohammedan country, in Renaissance Italy and China. The same device works in both movies - one, gloomy, amazing melodrama; - the second, light, virtuous comedy. At Keaton, it's basically the same couple; or maybe it's the same with Lang. The child desired by Buster and Beery is nice. I found THREE CENTERS well written and clever, without being ostentatiously refined; the plot is basically very POPEYE? as a child is a piece of furniture, the only heroes are two male rivals - Keaton and Beera. <br /> <br /> Keaton's film is simply extremely nice and you might be tempted to say that it looks like an ambitious game, but it is not, but it is great fun, great fun, a lot of fun. And Wallace Beery makes a great nemesis.
