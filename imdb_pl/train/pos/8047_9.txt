I accidentally met this movie and loved it. Timothy Busfield's character has no salutary qualities, and at some point Busfield and Meloni star look at the women who pass ... Meloniego parade is different than Busfield. Janel Maloney is wonderful ... She looks very much like Tea Leone, but the main difference is that Janel can act. Some very nice things in this movie and worth your attention when it's on the cable.
