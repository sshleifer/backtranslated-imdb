I got this movie from Netflix after a long wait, so I expected it when it came. My worst fears were that it would be ploding, and ... well, you know what all the screaming fans were shouting about? GACKTnHYDE = hawt yaoi love? Something like this? I was afraid of it. I was very, very pleasantly surprised. The film was surprisingly visible, even if filming and music made it feel like someone was letting out a couple of nuns, every two scenes, and the acting in part of Gackt was pretty good. Hyde, being, hm, Hyde, acted as a quasi-romantic friend / gang member whom no one who saw him on stage would be surprised. This is one of my two main beef with the film itself. But the rest of the cast (including the children's actors on the opening scene) were very good at doing what they did - which was mostly shot and shouted at. But my second problem was very small, associated with greed. It seemed too frightening to me - like any scene in which someone is shot or falling, they are truly dead or lie there for a long time. But Sho just ... takes shots, repeatedly, turns over, freaks LOT during a conversation and makes Hyde cry. In conclusion, if you're a fan of any of the actors or just a j-movie fan, it's definitely worth watching.
