The only reason I give this film 8 out of 10 is that in my opinion there are several movies that are perfect. This little B picture is a taut story, well told. I was always intrigued by Alexander Knox, but I saw him in very few films. Here is Wilhelm Grimm, a sad little man who turns into a monster. He betrays everything and everyone without a bit of remorse. The performance is one of the most chilling performances I've ever seen. Since the Second World War, actors who played the Nazis or other bad films in films were sometimes nominated for the Oscars. I imagine that since it was done during the war, the Academy felt like honoring such a performance would be like honoring evil. But Knox is betting on this kind of performance - a man so bitter and absorbed in guilt that he does not think about the suffering of others. I still can not accept it. <br /> <br /> Marsha Hunt, who usually plays on a filbert gallows or a social butterfly, is cast against the type probably the best performance I've ever seen. Maybe she does not deserve an Oscar, but the best in her career. Nothing against her; I enjoyed her in those "small" roles that she often played. But here she proves that she fulfills the task of a heavier drama. <br /> <br /> If you like tales about human dramas or stories about the fate of those who have suffered at the hands of the Nazis, I highly recommend this beautiful little movie.
