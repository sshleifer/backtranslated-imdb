This complicated western was a milestone in the career of JAMES STEWART after returning from military service, wanting to change its image, doing western, which is largely considered the reason for the influx of westerns in the 1950s, because it is very impressive. It is a pity that he was not photographed at Technicolor. <br /> <br /> Stewart wins the first prize for the "gun that won the West", but then he has to spend the rest of the movie trying to get it back when it's stolen. SHELLEY WINTERS is a shady girl with a bad taste, and STEPHEN McNALLY is a local bad boy in Dodge City. GEER will be Wyatt Earp, and DAN DURYEA is a bad boy Shelley. And do not you know that this Universal-International film, TONY CURTIS and ROCK HUDSON (both unknown at the time) have some roles. <br /> <br /> An interesting sequence contains the first Indian attack, thanks to which CHARLES DRAKE reveals himself as a coward who leaves, leaving Shelley alone in a horse-drawn carriage. Later he repurchases himself, but this is just one of the twists and turns that makes the weapon go from one unpalatable hand to the other - but eventually it goes to the rightful owner. <br /> <br /> STEPHEN McNALLY and JAMES STEWART have quite a final shootout, which is almost as melodramatic (but not quite) as the final of DUEL IN THE SUN. McNally creates the perfect villain, and DAN DURYEA is as treacherous as the ominous role he played in the 1940s as a gunman with a low standard of living. <br /> <br /> Strictly constructed story is very well directed by Anthony Mann, and it's great to see ROCK HUDSON (recognized as a young bull) in Indian war paint and TONY CURTIS as a young soldier who throws long glances at a slim man and an attractive Shelley Winters. <br /> <br /> It is worth to see and definitely above average history.
