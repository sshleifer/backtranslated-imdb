I really enjoyed it, although while reading the reviews it was quite disturbing for me ... But as a lover of anime art I can completely understand this perfect artistic work, although some of them were contrary to my cultures and I believe ... But hey, it's the world art .. !! The beginning of the film is very strong, strange and confusing. It is difficult to understand the content that makes me respect who made it. Only someone who is very open, can make such a bold movie ... it's absolutely not for children .. even though the characters are cute and charming, but go through disturbing adventures that can not be removed (sorry if the spelling is wrong) with memory.
