I can not believe my eyes when I read a lot of other comments and reviews. As if it was an average movie of some typical guys. <br /> <br /> The movie is great, funny, crazy, brutal, but with minimal gore, and all the way energetic to the core. I loved every piece of it. I do not remember anything as crazy as laughing and showing off the art of fighting. And now the most important thing (at least for me): computer effects are free. When I watch Hollywood actors playing on the screen in a modern, high resolution and damn high-budget "fuflo" (Russian word for "bull * beep *"), I understand that every * sound * of a child can do it - you can match the wires to the body, add cute PC effects and put them into the action movie. Here it is different. I do not think there are even a dozen or so physically advanced action stars in the world that can repeat the fight that takes place at the end of the movie or in the game "Chinese football". And this is just a small cinema from Hong Kong created for fun, not pretending to be "Star Wars". <br /> <br /> Having a DVD with an English soundtrack is not a problem with this movie. It does not spoil the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> You can not mention a very neat theater play. Suppose some of you do not like it. As for me - it's amazing. Look at the Dragon's friend who bravely talks to criminals and suddenly punches the left side of his head with his fist. The expression on his face turns into something capricious and approaches the Dragon with a childish face. And look at the menacing size of his lips - almost from one ear to the other, long when he grimaces. <br /> <br /> This movie deserves a higher rating and a thousand comments from people around the world. We would like to thank our Russian industry for the release of Jackie Chan's classic films. His modern ones are much weaker in my humble opinion and do not deserve much hype. <br /> <br /> A total of 10 out of 10 - the legendary movie in its genre. Thank you for your attention.
