Kenneth Branagh presents his excellent skills both in the game and in writing in this deep and thought provoking interpretation of Shakespeare's most classic and well-written tragedy. Kenneth plays the role of Hamlet with such a clear emotion that causes tears. The performance of Kate Winslet is also excellent.
