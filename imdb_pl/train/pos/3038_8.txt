Ever since Douglas MacArthur influenced more human lives? For better than any other American president who was not elected, he deserved a better film biography. "MacArthur" Universal is not bad. This is not all that should be. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, the potential was there. From the very early episode "Star Trek" "The Corbomite Maneuver" (1966) to the latest HBO films "Something the Lord Made" (2OO4) and "Warm Springs" (2OO5), director Joseph Sargent has become one of the best-known human directors in the film, a man capable of subtly shaping emotional shades of actors' performances and carrying the audience exactly where he wants to. The producer, Frank McCarthy, also gave us "Patton" (197O), the legendary Jerry Goldsmith won both films, and Universal widely advertised the fact that the film was "four years in preparation and production." Nevertheless, "MacArthur" is perfectly suitable and not much more. <br /> <br /> The film begins in early 1942. Shortly before the besieged general ordered by President Franklin D. Roosevelt (Dan O'Herlihy) ?? to escape from the Philippines to avoid being captured by the Japanese. In this way, this film omits: <br /> <br /> · The birth of MacArthur in the barracks in Arkansas in 188, still subject to the attacks of tribes of Native Americans, thus establishing that his extraordinary life stretched from the bow to the weapon thermonuclear; <br /> <br /> · his completion of West Point? first in class 95, <br /> <br /> · how he joined his famous father, General Arthur MacArthur (who won the Medal of Honor in Missionary Ridge in the civil war) for assignments in Japan, China and, most importantly, in the Philippines ; <br /> <br /> · his heroic feats on the trip in 1914 to Vera Cruz; <br /> <br /> · how he jumped in the trenches of the First World War like a mountain goat, often wounded, and advanced with dazzling speed to the brigadier general; <br /> <br /> · his post-war service as the youngest and most progressive commander of West Point; <br /> <br /> · his participation in the war court of Billy Mitchell in 1924; <br /> <br /> · his routing of the Bonus Marchers in 1932; <br /> <br /> his efforts to uphold the pitifully underfinanced army as chief of staff at the beginning of 193; <br /> <br /> · his departure from the US Army to the field marshal (!) of the Philippine army; <br /> <br /> and reactivation of his commission by FDR shortly before the outbreak of World War II. <br /> <br /> All this has been omitted for the prolonged recording of MacArthur trying to fight off seasickness during the evacuation by the PT boat, so we know that "General Mac" is a legend, but not why; nor can we appreciate why the charges of cowardice were so hurt for "Dugout Doug" and so blatantly groundless. <br /> <br /> The rest of his career is now directly: His jumping on the island "Hit" em is not "a campaign, the fulfillment of his promise to the Filipinos? "I'll be back!" - his crowning, getting peace in post-war Japan, and then a difference of opinion with President Harry Truman (actually pugnacious Ed Flanders) on the Korean conflict that led to his complete release and finally his statement to Congress that "old the soldiers just disappear, "and then he did it. Everything quite accurate historically, and all presented with a very conscious lack of comments. <br /> <br /> Sargent and producers are almost painfully distancing themselves from getting a historical record with their own approval or disapproval: if MacArthur's actions seem noble, let them be presented as such; if they seem selfish or bombastic, let these ideas register the Sans comment. Because Joe Sargent is an expert in subtle manipulation of audience reactions, let's see Warm Springs again - this refusal to make a comment seems quite purposeful. Historically, it can be commendable, but it almost overcomes the spectator's efforts to put this extraordinary man in any rational perspective. <br /> <br /> And finally, there is a kind of "cheap" touch of the film, as in the case of "Midway", released at the same time. Both films have been degraded to "television" directors - in this case Sargent, Jack Smight in "Midway", and both have a television appearance. Even the march of Jerry Goldsmith, although perfectly usable, is devoid of subtle tones and the size of his theme "Patton" - just another way in which a man with a large life is commemorated by a very ordinary film. /> In this man there was vanity and pettiness; there was also greatness - and love him or hate him, I must admit that MacArthur did what no military commander did before him: he won peace. <br /> <br /> After all, "MacArthur", like many film biographies, is a good place to start researching this extraordinary man, but a bad place to end it.
