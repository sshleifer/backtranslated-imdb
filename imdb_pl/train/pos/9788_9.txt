I was at the same screenwriters' conference and watched the movie. I thought that the screenwriter - Sue Smith - very clearly summarized what the film is about. However, the movie really did not require explanation. I thought the topics were abundantly clear and inspiring. The film, which deals with the ability to dare to face fear - especially the fear transmitted from parental characters - and defeat it, and thus embrace the possibility of life, is a film that should be valued and tasted. I liked it much more than the lively "Somersault". I also think that Mandy62 was a bit rude for Hugo Weaving. As a guy of his year, I should look so good! I agree that many Australian films have been weak lately, but "Peaches" deliver goods. I'm glad I saw it.
