I really love this program, it's like reading a book, and each chapter leaves you more inclined. It makes you think about what will happen in the next episode, and the struggle to keep friends for years. After the end of each episode, it leaves a sweet, bitter taste in the mouth, knowing that: One - the show was good, you can not wait for the next episode and you really think about what happens to your friends for twenty years. And secondly - the fact that the show was "interrupted" and we will not see the finale of the exhibition in its entirety. Fox obviously does not know what they did, they say they are losing viewers in categories 18-49, and they clearly do not know what people want to see if they get rid of a good program like "Reunion." I have one question that I would like to raise. If they were to bring the show back and move on to the next season, how would it work, because every episode is performed over the course of a year, and history is based on what happens in twenty years? Your answers are welcome. Bring back Réunion! Bring back Réunion!
