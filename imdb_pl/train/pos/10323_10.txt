This is a very funny movie. Some reviews I have read in this forum have been written by people who apparently believe that the film was an effort in a serious drama. It was NOT made in this way .... It is an extremely pleasant movie, performed in a tongue on the cheek. All actors, of course, play while having fun. The battle sequences are vivid, crisp and above all unpaid. The so-called "green death", used on several occasions, is not, as I read in one review, "macabre". Several critics were very critical about the martial arts fight between Doc and the Sea at the end of the film. Hey, brighten up ... Again I remind everyone that this is a funny movie. Each phase of this "fight" has been described, which added to the fun. The actors did not try to imitate Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan. This is not one of those martial arts films. Ron Ely looks great in this movie and is the perfect choice for playing in Doc. Another nice touch is the unique way in which the final fate of the "evil guy" (seas) is treated. I promise you that if you do not try to take this movie very seriously and just watch it for entertainment, you will spend 100 minutes in the most enjoyable way.
