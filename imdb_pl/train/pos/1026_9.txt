I really enjoyed this program for two reasons: 1. Richard Dean Anderson 2. Amanda Tapping. These two performers performed the program with the support of regular visitors and recurring actors. Replacing the RDA in 9-10 seasons was enough to remove the heart from the show. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between all the main characters is simply huge. You get the impression that the actors like to spin when the camera stops turning. This relationship is transferred to the program that we see. <br /> <br /> RDA gives "O'Neilla" a credible personality. He never knows when to give a rest to a wise man. You look at how others roll their eyes in horror at some of his statements. They know, however, that he is a man who needs to be with him when the situation is dangerous. <br /> <br /> There's a lot going on between "Carter" and "O'Neill" below the surface. They manage to keep the lid, but often barely. The Solitudes episode in the first season was one of the best dramas ever watched on television. The love between them made the prospect of death tolerable because they stood before it together. <br /> <br /> "Carter" and "Jackson" often had to smooth out some of the swirls caused by "O'Neill". However, the O'Neilla tactical instincts always seem healthy. He understands what to do without thinking about the matter. The team was exposed several times to danger by others who did not obey his orders. <br /> <br /> The quality dropped significantly in seasons 9 and 10. The original arc of the story was mostly worn, and the new villains never really caught my interest. Ben Browder was much worse than the RDA in running the series. He had his rare moments with Claudia Black, but that's all. Amanda Tapping called in her performances in these two seasons. After the child was born, her appearance changed. She probably thought more about the child than about the exhibition. <br /> <br /> Spin-off "Stargate Atlantis" has a few moments, but it is mainly a weaker effort. The main characters lack the original casting chemistry. Black characters (Phantoms) are so unlikely that they are ridiculous. Maybe Amanda Tapping can breathe life into the program or it will not last longer than the fourth season. <br /> <br /> There has always been a problem for me with special effects on the show. To have pyramid-shaped spacecraft, a design monster is rarely comparable in Sci-Fi. The use of flashlights to illuminate these ships is equally bad. Camping use of decorations from ancient Egypt, which contain ultra-modern technology, is equally difficult to accept. <br /> <br /> I was also thinking about the continuity of the performance. At the opening of season 2, "Daniel Jackson" is shot and his uniform has a yawning hole in which he was wounded. He crawls to the sarcophagus and heals his body and restores his uniform, as if he just fell from the rack in the closet. The episode "Hathor" has a sarcophagus falling into the hands of the SGC, but never mentions it again. This device could be used in several later episodes of "Daniel", "O'Neill" and "Dr. Frasier ".
