But it's a bit funny, at least if you grew up on Weird Al, just like me. It's a mockumentary about your life and career, starting with superstars and coming back to your origin. In some places it is uneven, but some segments are still very funny, especially when it goes to Japan. Although he is not as emotionally textured as Lost in Translation, and he does not consider love to be volatile, he makes an absolutely bizarre cultural melange in the bottle, which is Tokyo street life. he is not considered as an insightful cultural commentator, which he is; perhaps the rose with another name smelled equally sweet. Nevertheless, it is a funny movie.
