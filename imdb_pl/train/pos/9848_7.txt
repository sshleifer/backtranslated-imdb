I looked at this film through the eyes of my child and I was not disappointed. History is well known, some abandoned orphans have to be brought to their parents by an improbable trio (mamooth - sabertooth tiger and lazy animal) ... And I do not want to forget to mention the amazing little anger of his hazenut. It really made me laugh a lot during the whole picture. <br /> <br /> In short: it works, it's fun and it's "must see" with your kids (they'll like it).
