I saw this movie when I was about 7 years old - 33 years ago - and never forgot this movie! I was deeply moved and moved by a brave little boy and a beautiful eagle. And I just could not believe it when it turned into an eagle, when everyone in the theater thought it would die ... <br /> <br /> My sister was with me in the movie and I asked her recently if she remembered the movie, which we saw with the boy and the eagle, and she said she remembered it the way we saw it only yesterday. So it's not just me. <br /> <br /> This movie is MUST SEE !!! <br /> <br /> You will never forget it - just like my sister and I ...
