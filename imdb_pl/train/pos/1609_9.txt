"Moonstruck" is a movie that I liked for the first time when I watched it. I really liked it a second time. I loved it for the third time. Now this is one of my favorite games. <br /> <br /> Humor is subtle, but really good. The film offers a lot of warm humor. the story takes place in an old school in the Italian district of New York. Cher's search for love is pleasant. This film is by far the best work Nicholas Cage did on the film. The figure of an old man is fantastic. Lights the screen without a word. The scene with his dogs howling at the moon was fantastic. But maybe the best character is the one played by Olympia Dukakis. <br /> <br /> The highlight of the film is a scene in which the main characters have it at breakfast with oatmeal in a family kitchen. A unique direction and ending.
