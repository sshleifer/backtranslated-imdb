Now I've always been a fan of Full Moon puppet work. But I must say that Robot Jox is one of the better projects. Yes, you heard me. The story works great, the atmosphere really works and the actors do their first job. Gary Graham, who really stands out in TV shows such as ALIEN NATION THE SERIES and STAR TREK ENTERPRISE, shows that he can be the action star who digs the ass and has a name. Time-lapse effects may have been slightly better. The color was wrong, they look plastic to me instead of the metal it was meant to be. But this is a small complaint compared to the whole, which is Robot Jox, if you like Gary Graham or other Full Moon movies, you'll love this movie. 9 STARS WITH 10.
