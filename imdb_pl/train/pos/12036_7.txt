Why am I so convinced that there is a different movie version of this novel somewhere? I saw this movie again this year, when I'm teaching novels and I notice that the changes in the movie are annoying - there is no appearance of a little boy in the novel, and the ending has been changed. They kill him in the film, but the whole thing is that he's been haunted by events at Eel Marsh House for many years, but he got married again and eventually led to events. Mr. Bentley is a much more likeable character in the novel, the scene in the movie in which Kipps burns the office, is simply stupid, and the constant appearance of a toy soldier signifying the presence of a child is really frightening but pointless Kipps is haunted by a woman seeking revenge, and not a child. I am sure that I have seen a film that is better and closer to the novel, and even more frightening. Is that what I was imagining?
