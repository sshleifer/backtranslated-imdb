I was lucky to see it on a whim during a film festival and I was so hard hit by what I saw that I returned the next night to the second of three shows. A funny, wild and sharp attack on every aspect of mainstream entertainment passively swallowed without tasting by a target group with the lowest common denominator run by a lonely avenging journalist who slowly takes members for his guerrilla war with predictability. the movie is all about it, and it's done in such an unpredictable and refreshing way that you have left after writing the subtitles with hope renewed and excited that the original movies can still be created. Anyone who is frustrated by unfulfilled expectations for something that will brighten their imaginations, is doing well, hunting (and I mean hunting) for this rare object. For fans of Fight Club and any Charlie Kaufman movie and the required viewing for anyone who avoids multiplexes like a mad dog.
