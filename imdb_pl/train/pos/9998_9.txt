Seeing that the average of votes was quite low, and the fact that the clerk at the video store considered it "just OK", I did not have much expectations when renting this movie. <br /> <br /> But unlike the above, I really enjoyed it. This is a charming movie. It did not have to grow on me, I liked it from the beginning. Mel Brooks gives a great performance as the main character, I think he is slightly different from his usual personality in his films. <br /> <br /> There are not many joking jokes or anything like that, but there are some funny scenes and it is generally a very nice and very easy to watch movie. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
