"Scoop" is the funniest Woody Allen movie from 2000. Allen, though he looks like his age, is at the head of his game as a low-magic Sidney Waterman. Its one-liners and attitude are fun. Do not let critics get your opinion. "Scoop" is a top class photo of "Woody-Lite". <br /> <br /> Classical music is a perfect complement to the action on the screen. Scarlett Johanson looks great in this bathing suit. Jackman went crazy. Pictures shine. "Scoop" is a great escapist tariff from the beginning to the end. The last frame of the film itself is worth the admission price.
