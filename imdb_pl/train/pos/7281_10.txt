I saw this movie for the first time at a local station on a Sunday afternoon in horror around 1969 or 1970. Uncut. I was only a small child at the time, but I really liked it and it was not really terrified. I thought it had such a cool and very original story. Returning my thoughts, I am still surprised that he was shown during the day at T.V. not cut in those years. I've been looking for this movie since then, I've seen it over and over and I've always loved it. You'd think John Waters would love this movie. It must be not only a frightening movie, but one of the funniest, hottest films ever made. Surprisingly, you do not hear that worship after the movie "Blood Feast" or "The Hills Have Eyes" has won over the years. He has a cult, but in my opinion he should become an iconic classic. As far as I know, it appeared a little before the appearance of Blood Feast, making it probably one of the first real gore movies. In fact, this movie has elements of Hershell Gordon Lewis and little Russ Meyer thrown in for good. <br /> <br /> In any case, I recommend it to anyone who likes cheap, dingy, black and white horrors from the early 1960s (I think the date at the end was 1960).
