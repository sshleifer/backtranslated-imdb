Aim to the top! Gunbuster is one of those anime series in which classic was written. I totally liked this series and it still remains my favorite anime. And although it was not the first animated Gainax product, it was their first OVA series. <br /> <br /> Mainly as a parody of the 70s sports drama Aim For The Ace (Ace O Nerae!), Gunbuster raises as a serious drama at the end of episode 2, when Noriko Takaya is forced to survive the death of her father who he died in the initial meeting of humanity with the race of insects. Humanity is at war. Because of his father's death Noriko wants to become a combat pilot. But her lack of trust sometimes turns out to be disturbing, and she is weakening. Her friend, Kazumi Amano, even has doubts whether Noriko will be chosen as a pilot. However, Noriko coach Koichiro Ota believes in her. His personal mission was to check if he managed to become a pilot because he was a survivor of the battle in which Noriko's father was killed. <br /> <br /> Other characters are Jung-Freud, a Russian combat pilot assigned to serve in the squadron Noriko and Kazumi belong to Smith Toren, interested in the love Noriko, who died in his first aircraft carrier, and Kimiko Higuchi, childhood friend Noriko . Kimiko's involvement is also interesting, because while Noriko is off in space, Kimiko stays on Earth to live normally. And because of the dilation of time, Kimiko is getting old normally on Earth, while Noriko is the same age in which she left school. At the end of the series, Noriko is around 18 years old and Kimiko is in the mid-fifties. <br /> <br /> In total, this is an excellent anime series to watch, if you're a fan of the giant mecha robot and Gainax animation. If you like other Hideaki Anno concerts or you're a fan of Haruhiko Mikimoto graphics, give this program a chance. It will grow on you.
