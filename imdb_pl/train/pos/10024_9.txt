There are so many things you can rely on in Aro Tolbukhin. En la mente del asesino (inside the killer's mind) that it is very difficult to talk about it without warning. Let's say that this movie is like an exercise in the cinema, but it's really well done. It is made of super 8, black and white photos, 35 millimeters, colors, interviews, retrospectives. Aro Tolbukhin is like a film made a document or vice versa, which most peculiar aspect concerns doubts that wonder you, did he really exist? The film is about the later life of a Hungarian sailor who came to Guatemala, worked on a religious mission and then killed some people. An act for which he was caught and sentenced to death. The film begins because some French documentalists became interested in this figure, so they interviewed him before he died. Nowadays more people have been involved and have made a deeper examination of the characters. The one we're witnessing - a movie. <br /> <br /> In the main part of the story, we are guided by the semi-free phase to look into Aro's mind, mainly to decipher why he did what he did. However, it is important that filmmakers never give us a unilateral point of view; they left judging for all of us, and even if we can understand his actions, clearly we never justify them. So the first half is based on a reminder of information; Later things turn into Aro's childhood, giving the film such an amazing new strength (even hard has never been weak or boring). <br /> <br /> I do not mean - and I do not want to - spoil anything; so the only thing to say is that if you accidentally get the film close to you, believe me, the journey to see it is more than worth it.
