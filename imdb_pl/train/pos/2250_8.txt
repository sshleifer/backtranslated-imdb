This is a great movie about the Mormon fight and their final settlement in Salt Lake, Utah. The beginning and ending are especially powerful, and the message is what we all have to remember - God does not speak, but communicates, if we only listen. When I write this in the midst of a horror movie in New Orleans and the vicinity because of Katrina, I was particularly touched by the Mormons who had to leave everything behind and go after the murder of Joseph Smith. People came to this country to avoid religious persecution, but they could not. The Mormon struggle to cross the country, the cost of living, the suffering they suffered was truly awe-inspiring, demonstrating their enormous strength. When it comes to the actual beliefs of Mormons, this is not taken into account to a large extent, and polygamy is mentioned, but it is not at all the central element of the film. <br /> <br /> The cast is top notch, though others who have commented on more information about the actual characters and can tell you how true the performances were. But as actors, Dean Jagger, Mary Astor, Brian Donlevy, John Carradine, and Jane Darwell, they cope well with the scenario they received. <br /> <br /> Though the movie could easily stand alone (and certainly today), Tyrone Power and Linda Darnell were added to the cast to gather crowds in cinemas and watch a movie about the Mormons. The authority is unusually handsome as a young Mormon, and Darnell, as Zina, is not Mormon, but stays with her family after her father's death. The power does not have much to do until the end of the movie, when it has a big stage, and Darnell (still a teenager during the filming) has even less, although they create a lovely pair. Their fate remains unclear when it comes to her conversion, and wonders about polygamy in their case. However, you can not beat one of the eye candy.
