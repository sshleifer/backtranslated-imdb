Do not treat this movie as another film for children - the whole family can enjoy it. It's a strange blend of the movie, because it seems to contain a movie, but at least makes sense at the end (as opposed to modern movies!) Gives you all the elements of the movie (decent plot, good characters - Well, it's a Muppets star, a list of smaller stars * What's surprising is the fact that it can be a roller coaster of emotion, a bit sad, a bit warm, a bit funny and a little serious - all this creates a nice family movie that everyone can watch together. <br / > <br /> * The celebrity stars in the film are actually the best stars of the day, but there is only one real movie star and no one dares to cover Miss Piggy !!!!
