Summary: Zandalee is a young woman who feels more and more trapped in a marriage with Thierry. Thierry himself is struggling with his father's death in the previous year and he lost his way. He sank into work, folded his magazine, and Zandalee desperately missed the attraction between them. It includes Johnny and old friend Thierry, who used to be artists in exile. But Johnny is still painting and has only one job to rent. He takes the day when he comes and goes to his destiny tomorrow. Between Zandalee and Johnny, there is an immediate harsh attraction that goes into romance. But Zandalee is struggling with desire for lust, conscience and love for her husband. But none of them, not Zandalee, not Johnny and not Thierry, can stop the relationship between them to get out of control. <br /> <br /> Comments: This is a thriller. But maybe more of a heart thriller than a simple thriller, which is about life and death and the threat of violence. Not that the heart thriller can not take fatal proportions, but the threat comes from a different point of view. Until the second half of Zandalee until the appearance of the thriller and although the basis for this is determined in the first half, I can not really describe this genre as a thriller. Much more romantic drama than anything else, but with the currents of other genres. The developing thriller is there, but it also has something more than a little sensual erotic kind. Because that's what it's all about, what drives characters, and so the whole story. Desire. The necessity of having and the necessity of being. <br /> <br /> In my opinion it is quite good, definitely better than today (4.1). It takes a lot of time, but the feeling of tension grows and it works very well with the erotic part, with taste. It's always an integral part of the story, it must be there to give the story the weight you need, and I've never felt it was an excuse to show a naked breast or something like that. But unfortunately the culmination of this story is well before the end, and the end itself seems flat, even if it is dramatic in its own way. <br /> <br /> The cast is impressive, led by famous actors such as Nicholas Cage and Judge Reinhold. But the show is almost completely stolen by Erika Anderson. Beautiful and very adept at playing sometimes subtle feelings of desire, she excels at both Cage and Reinhold, who sometimes makes the bot overboard and becomes a bit rough. Her later career is too thin to show the talent she shows in Zandalee, I can only hope that this is due to her own choices. Small favorites also appear in two small favorites, which give the film a bit of an advantage. It's Steve Buscemi and Joe Pantoliano. <br /> <br /> When you're in the right mood, it's a very good movie, maybe I used a different end to get the loan I really deserve. <br /> <br /> 7/10
