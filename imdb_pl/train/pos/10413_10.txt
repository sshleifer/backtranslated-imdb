I grew up with it as my favorite movie of all time. Special effects are amazing in the era and won prizes. I remember the dialogue, as if I had heard him yesterday. It's just a great, timeless adventure. The music is by Miklos Rosza, who is the best in the history of cinema. Sabu is a thief. Conrad Veidt is a great villain. I have a copy at hand, for the next trip down the memory strip. Whoa there! Rex Ingram wants to get out of his bottle of genii!
