The Booth gives a completely new character to your typical J-horror. This movie puts you in the role of the hero of the story. The director wants you to see what the hero sees and thinks. <br /> <br /> The story is about perceiving people who work, live and love our hero and how he perceives the people who surround him with an outdated DJ booth radio station. The story restores the layers of the main character like onions in flashbacks, when the movie runs according to the direction from which we learned that things are not always what they seem. The film took place mainly in a small, outdated radio studio with a very bad story, where the main character was forced to broadcast his talk show due to the fact that the radio station was in the process of changing location. It is from this limited space that this film develops and makes you feel very claustrophobic and very paranoid. Sometimes our hero can not determine that the strange events in the old studio were caused by a ghost or some conspiracy on the part of his associates or all of this was in his mind. In this movie, I like the fact that the filmmakers make you see through the eyes of the main character and make you just as paranoid as the hero. This movie is very intelligent, it adheres to a short 76-minute movie.
