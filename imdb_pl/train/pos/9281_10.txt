I do not know how and where Iranian directors draw inspiration from inventing such a plot. In fact, it is a very simple conspiracy that many directors can come up with - but may not be able to display it on the film the way Jafar Panahi did. <br /> <br /> The movie is like two spinning worlds at the same time one connected to the other - a football match and a fight between the sexes, which takes place behind the walls of the stadium. <br /> <br /> It makes you feel like you are in a movie, and you are again one of the characters and while watching the movie, as if you wanted to have a look at the football game. You will feel exactly the same emotions and feelings as these actresses in the film. Grabbing you in the way you wanted to see the ending, you will want to know the verdict, you will die to see what will happen to the girls. <br /> <br /> I like the occasional conversation between a smoking girl and one of the military interns. It's like Martian VS mars, it really shows the difference in the thinking of men and women and the struggle of women for equal rights and opportunities, especially in a very patriarchal society like Iran. <br /> <br /> This is the second movie about Jafar Panahi I've seen (the first one is Crimson Gold) and I'm waiting for more. <br /> <br /> I am already addicted to Iranian films and this is a must!
