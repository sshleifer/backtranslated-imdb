Even so early in his career, Capra has achieved quite a success thanks to his work with the camera and the sense of time. It is a thin story - and sometimes quite predictable - but it gets very good results from its cast and has quite complicated camera movements that intimately engage the viewer. The first part looks like the story of Cinderella, although everyone with the brain sees that the bottom falls out of it - a rich "prince" will lose a fortune. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, due to his good cast and fast pace, it's easy to fall into stereotypes. Then the film becomes more original, because the couple must find a way to keep themselves. The ending is very predictable, but satisfying. I also want to praise the writing of the title: very witty and funny.
