It is a film that anyone interested in, induced or suffering from eating disorders should see. This is an extremely accurate and sensitive portrait of the teenager's bulimia, its causes and symptoms. The girl is played by one of the most outstanding young actresses in the cinema, Alison Lohman, who later was so spectacular in "Where the Truth Lies". I recommend showing this movie in all schools because you will never see a better one on this subject. Alison Lohman is absolutely unique and she is astounded by her ability to express the anguish of a girl suffering from this compulsive disorder. If the barometers tell us about the air pressure, Alison Lohman tells us about the emotional pressure with the same accuracy. Its emotional range is so precise that each stage can be measured microscopically due to gradations of trauma, in the scale of growing hysteria and desperation, which achieves unbearable intensity. Mare Winningham is a great choice to play your mother and she does it with a lot of affection and a number of emotions as well-tuned as Lohman. Together, they form a pair of sensitive emotional oscillators vibrating with each other in resonance. This film is a truly amazing achievement, and director Katt Shea should be proud of it. The only reason you can not see this is because you're not interested in people. But even if you like nature films the best way is after all the animal behavior on the sharp edges. Bulimia is the extreme version of how a tormented soul can destroy your body in a rage of despair. And if we do not sympathize with people suffering from the depths of despair, then we are dead inside.
