I did not read this book, but in the whole movie I was terrified with only one thought in my head: This is Vonnegut. I have never seen the author, all intelligence and life behind novels, so well translated into a film. This film had the same complexities as in Vonnegut's novels: jokes were often meaningful and symbolic, and dramatic events and symbols were often jokes. <br /> <br /> Campbell was also very Vonnegut, perfectly presented by Nick Nolte. He had all the features of Vonnegut's "hero": lack of concern for political boundaries, an ironic dark humor giving way to stupid inaction in response to stress and unwillingness to push his version of reality into the people around him. > <br /> In general I was constantly surprised and impressed when I watched this movie. It was the same feeling that I, reading "The Cradle of the Cat", my first novel, Vonnegut, as if it was the most perfect strange thing that could have happened, he thought about YES, and he made her real and important. Yes, there is nothing but "White Christmas" albums. That's how it goes!
