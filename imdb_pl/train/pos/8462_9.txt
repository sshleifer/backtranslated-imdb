I recently bought a collection of one of these incredible series and even after watching the three episodes I am still mesmerized by the elegant stylization of animation and slow but thoughtful action stories. I'm still a fan ..... with some minor pains. <br /> <br /> Although this part of the Gundam saga is very cool and has what the previous series - a stylish satirical way of telling about the errors of war and not giving up the need to have control or power over everything (sounds familiar?), I have to say that this becomes a little too mild-dramatic in further explaining the lives of the main characters and their relentless need to stomach pain about everything that's going on and what needs to be done to stop the OZ group from succeeding in their plans (especially the character named Wufei ... I mean, she moans more than an American character on the soap opera. adviser, true? <br /> <br /> Besides an exaggerated drama (I think it mainly comes from dubbing English voice actors), this series is still very exciting and I'm still enchanting. That means it can always be worse. It could be like the last part, SEED ...... eeeewwww, talk about a gentle-dramatic ... Talk I'll talk about it later.
