As a child, I preferred the first Care Bear movie because it seemed so dark. I always sat and watched the first one. Over the years, I've learned to prefer this one. I think this movie is too dark for babies, but when you get older, you learn to value it, because you understand it more, it does not seem as dark as it was back when you were a kid. > <br /> This film, in my opinion, is better than the first one, everything is much deeper. It may deny the first movie, but you have to ignore the first movie to watch this movie. The young are just too cute, I rewind the scene "Flying Colors". I usually annoy everyone by singing it. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is great! Big hand for Carol and Dean Parks. I love every song in this movie, I downloaded them all and only listen to "Our beginning", now known as "Recalling". I've always preferred this soundtrack to the first one, although I just love the song Carol Kings in the first movie Care-A-Lot. <br /> <br /> I think the animation is great, the animation in both films is fantastic. I was surprised when I sat down and watched him about 10 years later and saw that the animation was perfect at that time. It was really surprising. <br /> <br /> There is not much support from other people to say that this movie is great, but it is. I do not think it was weird / strange. I think it's a great movie. <br /> <br /> Essentially, this movie is about how Care Bears formed and defeated Demon, Dark Heart. The end is surprising and once again beats every "Pokemon Movie" with the problems of Moral Care Bears. It leaves you affected. Again, this movie can teach everyone of all ages about morality.
