This is nothing extraordinary, groundbreaking or innovative, but "Dog Days" is for some reason an extremely fascinating study of the characters. It's as if CRASH stumbled over an evil dose of heroin, but not completely. This is an Austrian film about the fate of a few depressed, mad and irritating people and their offensive relationships with each other. It is disturbing, but it is very well-kept and interesting to observe the crazy little things that these characters do. Certainly not for a weak heart, this highly pessimistic film offers no end or revelation at the end, we only see the lives of these disgusting people in two days. Rating: B
