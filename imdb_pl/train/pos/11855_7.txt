Wow. Something out of surprise. Although defective, it is much better than I expected. <br /> <br /> A completely new Arcturus liner with around 3,000 passengers is on the last days of a 16-day trip to Jupiter. Without warning, the Cerebral ship (central computer) issues an alarm and orders everyone to evacuate. <br /> <br /> Soon there are only a handful of people, including one of the ship's astrogators (Penny), captain (Cary) and director of the shipping line (Kenyon). <br /> <br /> It turns out that the alarm was false and that the main brain functions unevenly <br /> <br />. Other passengers and crew must escape the ship and avoid personal conflicts to survive. <br /> <br /> The film starts very well. Opening advertising is a very nice touch. There are obvious similarities to 2001: A Space Odyssey and the historic Titanic sinking <br /> <br />. The movie sometimes slows down and has problems with stimulation <br /> <br />, but overall it is well made and works well.
