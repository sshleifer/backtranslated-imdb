I was lucky to see Zero Day last night. It's an amazing movie. It is very disturbing. <br /> <br /> In a sense, Zero Day is very similar to "The Blair Witch Project". He was shot with handheld cameras. It's about 2 children. Only your average children. Andre and Calvin. They are launching a campaign against the High School entitled "Army of 2". <br /> <br /> The whole story is told in the form of Video Diary from two children. It shows relationships with parents there, among others, showing that they are ordinary children, just like people we know or have come across. We learn that the last mission of the Army 2 will be entitled to Zero Day. They plan to shoot there at High School. <br /> <br /> You see how they have access to the weapons, as planned, everything. They emphasize that the media have not touched them at all and there is no reason to do so. As I said, all this is described in the form of Video journal, and then they store the tapes in the safe so that they can be seen after Day Zero. <br /> <br /> The actual shooting is shown by Survillence cameras throughout the school. Really chilling in your veins. The film is very chilling in your veins. Some things that they say, as planned, you would have to see for yourself. One quote I remember is the only time Calvin is herself. He says that "Andre thinks that they will just leave the car in some kind of escape, doing it in many schools across the country. I do not know what he's thinking about, but the only way I leave school is a black plastic bag. " <br /> <br /> I probably will not give you the right idea for this movie. You really have to see it yourself. It's now for festivals. <br /> <br /> A +.
