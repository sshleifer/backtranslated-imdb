A nice surprise! I was expecting a further reduction of the line: The Rock (9) -> Con Air (7) -> Armaggeddon (4). Especially in the case of such an overcrowded movie. Perhaps that's why so few have approved this new type of Bruckheimer tariff. Smart dialogue instead of joking one-liners, decent background / motivation instead of stereotypes shake and bake, and when the chase came, you really wanted it. Fanboys expect the roller coaster of Armageddon: stay away. This is one of the most intelligent action fans. It did not bother me that Jolie looked so little.
