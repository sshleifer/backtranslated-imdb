Welcome to Collinwood is one of the most delightful movies I've ever seen. Excellent team cast, strong assembly and a great direction. A movie about capers that does not go into standard tricks. <br /> <br /> There is not much to say about this film without breaking it. The tag line says it all - 5 guys. 1 Safe. No Brains. <br /> <br /> William H Macy and Sam Rockwell lead an amazing cast. George Clooney should congratulate you on making this gem. <br /> <br />
