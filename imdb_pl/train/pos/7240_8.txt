When I found this movie in my local video game, I expected it to be another cheesy American vampire movie in the same style as "The Lost Boys" (1987). sometimes it's a bit trite, but there are still enough stylish pieces and surprises to please vampire enthusiasts. It is the perfect combination of romanticism and horror, and sometimes surprisingly bloody.
