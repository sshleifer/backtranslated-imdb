I really thought they did a great * job, there was nothing wrong with it at all, I do not know how the first commentator could say it was horrible, it moved me to tears. ), but I try not to cry in the movie because it's embarrassing, but it got me. It was a good SOOO! I hope they will release it on DVD, because I will definitely buy a copy! I feel that it has renewed my faith and gave me hope that I can not explain it, it made me want to be a better person, they have gone through so much and it seems obvious. In comparison, I feel that our own attempts are nothing. Well, not anything, but they hardly match what they had to go through. I love it. Who played Emma ?!
