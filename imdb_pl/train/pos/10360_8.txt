It is a story about docudram in the Linda Chamberlain case and a look at its impact on Australian society. It pays special attention to the problem of insinuation, rumors and expectations when it comes to real dramas. <br /> <br /> One of the issues that history involves is how everyone will give the same emotional response to the situation. Not everyone falls into a savage melodramatic hysteria for any major crisis. Just because characters in movies and TV work in a certain way, there is no reason to expect that real people will do it. This is especially useful for journalists and news editors who seem to be looking for a big sob scene that will attract ratings. This is a problem that should be constantly solved. <br /> <br /> Pencils play characters with depth, personality and sensitivity. And they are skilfully supported by a large cast of all fact-based gamers. Some viewers may be surprised that many of the cast in this story are people better known in Australia as comic actors. It reinforces my idea that comic actors create some of the best in drama, because thanks to the comedy they know how to create a quick impression of individual people. <br /> <br /> (Warning Spoiler!) <br /> <br /> I have to say something very personal here; in this sense, I am a former Adventist who was a practicing member in Australia during this incident; so I have a slightly different impression on this story than most. I think it is supported with incredible creativity and personality as well as an emotional heart. I think the best scene is the one in which the couple is chased by new helicopters. He captures the themes of the story perfectly. <br /> <br /> I once heard Fred Schepsi say in an interview that he told the actors to "perform best for their character". Although this is particularly relevant to this story, I think that this is also a general principle that should apply to all activities as well.
