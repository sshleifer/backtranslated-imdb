I was surprised by an imaginary Battlestar Galactica, a series that always guessed me and led me to tears more than once. A hardened sci-fi fan, I like to think that I can choose good things from BS, and that was good. <br /> <br /> As such, when I first heard about the prospect of the prequel series a few months ago I had a bad feeling in the intestines. I was afraid that the formula that made Battlestar so successful would be re-used in Caprica, which would not work at all. The BSG tale of a pathetic, ragged group of survivors trapped on decks of decaying starships and guided by prophetic vision and sequence of pseudo-miracles, was perfectly complemented by extraordinary music and a better cast of actors. Caprica feels different. Where BSG takes place after the fall of the great civilization, Caprica presents this civilization in its cold and decadent splendor. The general climate I got from Caprica was similar to that of the Minority Report, minus the excessive and contrary to the intended theatricality. In the true form of BSG, Caprica in the first programming hours dealt with the issues of religious freedom, racism, morality of playing God and the nature of the human soul. <br /> <br /> The cast for Caprica is also great. Each character is unique and deep, from an obsessive and distant scientist who became an entrepreneur, to his restless and deliberate daughter, every actor and actress throws himself into his roles. <br /> <br /> Music that has been used extensively in BSG also plays a significant role in Caprica. Powerful Battlestar drums and mournful dudukies served his subjects very well. Caprica uses a more orchestral sound, which gives the show a completely different feel than the previous one. <br /> <br /> The new Caprica is definitely its own show, drawing from the Battlestar series only as much as it needs. I can not wait for the full series.
