Just having "my hello at home" with my 23-year-old daughter in Iraq, the Camp Anaconda medical support unit, I felt compelled to get a DVD. I wanted to hear how others return to their feelings, to better understand her mentality upon arrival and not wait for something to happen. No matter how you react to war and peace, this movie is a great start for all Americans to begin healing our recurring vacuum. The most important statement of the whole movie is "Take Action" about the problem. An extremely emotional movie. I would like to strongly recommend this film to the veterinarian of the whole mature family and ask him to continue the plan of listening to comfort that will help in returning to the Gulf War. My daughter saw this DVD. He took her emotions into account and in fact committed himself to preparing again for the next 6 years. Her time spent on the sand is such that she did something good. Local children Balad received the first medical treatment for various common ailments, usually not able to afford free social services and translators. She glanced over her shoulder at the trip in Iraq. "We've changed some hearts and minds there." A great DVD you need to have an open mind and see all the pages
