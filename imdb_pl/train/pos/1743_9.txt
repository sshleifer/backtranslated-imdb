After watching many Greek films, I feel very suspicious of most of them. But after seeing this, I felt surprised. The films are great without a great deal of testing. It can not be said that the scenario is so great whether photography is perfect or technical. This is a real story and is happening in Greek rural areas in places forgotten from God. The movie is like hitting a stomach and I really want things to not be like that. This of course speaks of the xenophobia of the Greek people (ignorance) to everything else. The problem of this guy is not that he is a former convict. The problem is that he is not one of those people. He is different and does not want them (that's why all the good things he does, turn him into a boomerang). He also talks about people's apathy, because there are people who are against king hunting but do not dare to express their opinion. After all, the hypocrisy of a society that is religious and that tries to act as God says is clearly visible, but at the same time acts so unfairly towards the king. It shows how easily people rationalize their feelings or beliefs in accordance with an established system. After all, you can have a positive lesson from this very bad story, which means that you can understand and be part of this society only if you want to become one of them. If you want to stay different and even yourself, you are lost (and this is not far from reality). I think it's tragic that history is real and that it should be a bell for everyone. No comment for the main actor, because he has already received the prize and I think that his game was great. A little comment for Hatzisavvasa (policeman game), he is like a dinosaur, he played many roles and I am sure that this role for him was very easy, but he plays so well that he can not be denied a big applause. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a good Greek movie.
