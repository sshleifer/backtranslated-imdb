How can the film be both controversial and delicate? This does it with an almost perfect structure. Nobody wants their daughters to be athletes. Apparently most cultures do not want their daughters too small. We see a group of great actors that we have never heard before, depicting people from different cultures who live modestly until their children do not want and can not become professional footballers. The structure around the parallelism of both cultures is great. There is no condescension. Both cultures are perceived as modern and important. (And yes, both are also stupid). One drawback: the Hindu wedding ceremony seemed to involve hundreds of relatives, but not one child.
