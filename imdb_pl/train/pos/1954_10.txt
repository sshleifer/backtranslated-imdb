I thought this movie did a good job. It was not as creative or original as the first one, but who expected it. It was great fun. the more I think about it, the more I like it, and when it goes out on DVD, I will pay for it very proudly, every last cent. Sharon Stone is great, she's always there, even if her movie is horrible (Catwoman), but this movie is not, it's one of those movies that will be underestimated throughout life, and will probably become a classic in 20 yrs. Do not wait until it becomes a classic, watch it now and enjoy it. Do not expect a masterpiece or something that is addictive and touching, just let yourself get out of life and get involved in them. <br /> <br /> All in all, the movie is funny and I recommend people who have not seen it, because what critics say and safe, does not always count, see it for yourself, you never know, you can just enjoy . I tilt my hat to this movie <br /> <br /> 8/10
