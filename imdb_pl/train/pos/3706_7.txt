The biggest surprise in this movie was the performance of Daryl Hannah. Instead of playing the stereotypical, dark blond roles that he usually performs, he plays on the street, an intelligent, weary world. He does not have a huge role, but he's doing great, presenting Lois Harlan as a tired, though accustomed woman, to hide his boss's indiscretion.
