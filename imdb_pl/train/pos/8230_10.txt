Eglimata (= crimes) is a story about small crimes committed on a daily basis by people who in a crazy scenario can lead to an absolute catastrophe. One of the smartest Greek series! Actors such as Ketty Konstadinou and Maria Kavogianni showed a whole new dimension of themselves and talent and gave us moments of incredible "guilty" laughter. Each viewer seemed to recognize the evil side of his self in one of the characters or at least on the side of himself that they wished. Actors of all ages who played larger and smaller parties gained as much space in the heart of the Greek audience. My personal favorites (apart from the first two I mentioned) are Vassilis Haralambopoulos, Athinodoros Prousalis and Stavros Nikolaidis, but many amazing actors have been relayed by some episodes from time to time. Anyone in the world understands that the Greek should find a way to watch this series, despite the fact that over 5 years have already passed on television. In Greece, they repeat the series (ANT1) in every respect, as in the summer or early afternoon zones. We will never forget Eglimata or any casting team!
