This, in my opinion, a very good movie, especially for lovers of Michael Jackson. It contains news about drugs, stunning special effects and an amazing music video. <br /> <br /> The main movie focuses on the song and music video "Smooth Criminal". Unlike the four-minute music video, this is normal speed and in my opinion much easier to watch. <br /> <br /> However, the plot is quite strange. Michael Jackson plays a magic "gangster" who, when he sees a shooting star, transforms into machinery. Throughout the film, it transforms into a racing car, a giant robot and a spaceship. <br /> <br /> Especially the robot scene is a bit stretched out and weird. Compared to the rest of the movie, I found it a bit unsuccessful. <br /> <br /> The child is kidnapped, Michael tries to save her, is tortured and beaten, and suddenly turns into a giant robot that blows up all the bad guys. A bit strange? Yes. <br /> <br /> But in addition to the bizarre robot scene, this is a very good movie, and every fan of Michael Jackson will enjoy both Smooth Criminal video and movie.
