This movie was very funny, I would like to have this film for my collection from the 70s. I have to see the list again, I know this cast of characters, people I've met for years and that make me look for this comedy, unfortunately it has never been introduced on DVD or VHS. Redd Foxx is always a comedy clown, Pearl Baily is a great match as his witty and sneaky wife, Norman is a son with a secret, he is not sure if he will have a future, if he is over, Dennis Dugan crazy funny man. Miss Dobson, a whore with a heart and a small conscience. Love, desire, strange family ties This film qualifies for a return to an encore, a situation comedy with a mix of events, how it could and should find a way to remake. I think finding a cast would be extremely difficult, perhaps impossible, except for Jerry Seinfeld playing the role of Dennis Dugan, this earmarks a few episodes of Seinfeld, which also brought me back to Norman, the fact that keeping them in close proximity was certainly impossible to reform a fake whore and infidelity of a parent. This movie was a wild advice for the taxi driver, remind me of the episode Kramer advised his caddy over his lawyer. (episode from Seinfeld). Parents have a moment of jaw, having fun over the fun of Shouting brings me back.
