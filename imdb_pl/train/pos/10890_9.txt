Come on, people. This movie is better than 4. I see it happens ... rich people did more crazy things than this. And it was fun. <br /> <br /> I watch a comedy to have fun, to escape from the pressure of the world for a short while and you do not have to take anything too seriously. This movie fully suits this purpose. I judge the film based on my own achievements and I do not intend to compare Surviving Christmas to Blazing Saddles. I watched how completely dysfunctional people become caring, sympathetic individuals who can easily live away from my home. He will remain on my list of "favorites ..... must watch for the holiday season". If you want to have fun 90 minutes, watch this one.
