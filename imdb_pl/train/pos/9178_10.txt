I really have to say that it has always been my favorite when I went to see my grandmother. And it still is. It is very, very close to the book. The way it's filmed and the players were just perfect! I have to recommend this film to everyone who has not seen it. Almost everyone I talk to hates TV movies, but it was really great! I gave him 10/10.
