I saw this movie for the first time in the theater when I was 8 and it still spoils me. Muppets are so cool and approach the show business in a refreshingly naive way. My favorite scene is that the rats start whispering a campaign on behalf of Kermit in an elegant restaurant. This is one intelligent and fun movie for children and parents. Long live Kermit, Miss Piggy and the rest of the gang.
