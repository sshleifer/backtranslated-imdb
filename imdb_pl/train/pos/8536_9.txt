I recently had the opportunity to see "The Waterdance" and I loved it. I really do not understand why it's called that, because there is really no dance there, except maybe a dance in a strip club at the end. We present the main characters of the film, invalids in the hospital. This story shows the romance between a guy with physical disability and a healthy woman, which is a very sweet story. Unfortunately, you can not watch such movies today. I'm not "stuck in a time bend", I'm not saying that everything in the 80's and early 90's was better than today, but I really think that the film industry is getting worse and we can learn a lot from old movies - I have old movies I mean everything from 1920-1998.
