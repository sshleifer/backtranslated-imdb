I loved watching Friday evenings "Sabrina, teenage witch" at TGIF ABC. I think it was one of the best concerts at TGIF. My friends and I met every Friday to watch this concert and we never missed an episode. <br /> <br /> My favorite character was Salem. He was charming and so funny. I also liked Sabrina's boyfriend, Harvey. He was hot. I think Melissa Joan Hart also played a good teenage witch. My favorite episodes were "Sabrina Through the Looking Glass" and "Hilda and Zelda: the Teenage Years". These episodes were great. <br /> <br /> Generally I miss this performance very much. I hope that one day ABC will come back with new episodes. I give 10/10 to this exhibition.
