Part of what was so great in the classic Looney Tunes cartoons was their disregard and the fact that they were not afraid to do anything they wanted. In this case, Marvin the Martian has the task of restoring a landowner. Indeed, he encounters a Bugs Bunny who warns against rebellion on the part of Marvin's dog. After Marvin finally catches bugs - using a bazooka throwing out Acme jacket! - Errors have more things planned for a trip back to Mars. I mean, if you thought it was a major change in the Solar System, when you deprived Pluto of the planet's status, you have not seen anything yet! Yes, "The Hasty Hare" goes all the way. How they buy Acme products in space is probably bigger than most people, but it's the point - I mean "hare" - have fun. And believe me, you will definitely be. After all, a small amount of space will never hurt anyone.
