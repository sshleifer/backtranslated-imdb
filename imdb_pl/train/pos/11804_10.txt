He hired the movie as a joke. My friends and I had so much fun that I went and found a used copy and bought it for myself. Now, when all my friends are looking for a fun movie, I give them Sasquatch Hunters. It must be said, however, that a rule was introduced that made the film a lot better. Conversation is not allowed when the movie is turned on, unless the words are repeated Sasquatch in singing. I also liked the credit at the end of the movie. "Thanks for the Jeep, Tom!" Whoever Tom is, I'm thanking you, because without your Jeep the movie has not been realized. In short, a great movie if you're looking for something to laugh about. If you want a good movie, maybe you're looking for something different, but if you do not mind laughter at the expense of a man in a monkey suit, get a copy.
