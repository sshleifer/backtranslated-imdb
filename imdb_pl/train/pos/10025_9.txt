It must be a unique return of two species in history. A gigantic monster of a film genre with a live mummy film genre. This unique mix creates a unique and attractive story. The cast is outstanding, including TOM BOSLEY, who, as far as I know, has never been in horror before. The effects are impressive, and the idea of ​​a giant mummy filled with smaller mummies is cool. My only complaint, I would like us to see more giant mummies, but otherwise I think they did a great job. Dialogue, characters and history were perfect. Acting was great. It must be the best science fiction movie. You heard me, the best science fiction movie. I give THE FALLEN ONES 9 OUT of 10.
