New York I Love You, like its predecessor (Paris Je T'Aime), is a mix of different stories that reflect different types and aspects of love, but unlike it, the rhythm is much faster and the stories much shorter. The film offers a unique view of the city of New York with its various and different landscapes. New York, I Love You, offers a first-class cast featuring such great actors as Shia LaBeouf, Natalie Portman, Ian McKellen, Hayden Christensen, Chistina Rcci and Orlando Bloom, Ethan Hawke, James Caan and Robin Wright Penn, as well as outstanding writers and directors such as Brett Ratner and Anthony Mingella.
