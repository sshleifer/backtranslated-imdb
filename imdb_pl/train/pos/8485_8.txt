Gung Ho tries to express many ideas and at the same time entertain us with a funny comedy. The result is uneven, but generally funny. Keaton quite well balances all three aspects of his main character. Wantabedde is even better. One warning: George Wendt is very poor in his supporting role. Otherwise it is quite a nice time capsule.
