This Italian-French remake of the film from 1946. By the same name from 1986. He raised the heat early and does not allow us to come up with air. The story is about a high school student (Federico Pitzalis) who can not take her eyes off the mysteriously beautiful young woman (played by the Dutch phenomenon of Maruschka Detmers), who lives next to the school. One day he follows her, and his stubbornness pays off. There is only one problem: she got engaged with a sketchy character (Riccardo De Torrebruna) who could or did not commit a shameful crime, and if she repents, she will probably be released with a slap on the wrist. In addition, the young woman is a bit "funny in the head," and this confirms when we discover that she saw the father of a boy who is a psychiatrist. Giulia's emotive instability is equal to her great sexual desires. Hot, hot, hot, from the very beginning, with handsome leads and a Detmers bomb that plays us like a yo-yo (like the boy does) from stage to stage, with enough tension to guess us - and even after - to end. Available versions of R and X (!).
