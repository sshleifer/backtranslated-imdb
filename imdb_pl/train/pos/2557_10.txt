I, I am a child in my heart, which means that I love to watch cartoons, still do it! I remember watching Bugs Bunny, when I was a kid, he was still my favorite. I thought it was a great "new" TV show and than my dad said, "Bugs Bunny, I remember watching him when I was younger" and I think, "Dad, bugs did not exist, they were younger." So I think that it certainly enjoys more than one generation, maybe 3. I love this program, it's great for children and adults, OK, everyone. It's very funny, me and my husband, both at the age of twenty, we love watching shows and we do not mind replays. This program restores many memories, happy ones. I also love the holiday addition from Tweety as Tiny Tim, it's cute. I can not choose my favorite Looney Toons character because they have changed over the years. When I was little, it was Bugs and Porky Pig, of course. Pepe is cool, I always loved him. Actually, I have to say that all my favorites. I give this program 10 out of 10, because it is a great program for all ages, very funny, voice acting is amazing, the only drawback is that unfortunately it ended up 2 years ago, but the replays are great!
