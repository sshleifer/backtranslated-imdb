EARTH (2009) *** 1/2 Big adaptation of the BBC / Discovery Channel series "Planet Earth" offers a rather majestic sample of nature in all its glory with some really stunning moments "how the hell did they get this material ?! taking into account the incredible scenery of animals in their natural habitats and the environmental message of the circle of life, it can be cruel (witness how the Great White Shark catches the seal of the walrus as a quick meal!) and charming (different children and their lease). The sounds of Basso profundo narrator James Earl Jones strengthen his "divine views" and depth. Withdrawn from literally hundreds of hours of footage, the only problem is due to the fact that it should be in IMAX format, and maybe even longer! Oh, well, it's always the next time (because Disney Studios have produced this count for a series of more). Dirs: Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield.
