About two hundred members of the Cleveland Ohio film association, named Cinematheque, met on August 19, 2000, to view the privately imprint of Michelangelo Antonioni's 1970 movie "Zabriskie Point." Cinematheque director John Ewing, who deals with obtaining the best printouts for his series, previously shared with the audience that this print was specially transported from Italy to the one showing only. <br /> <br /> The audience was delighted when the film developed its artistry on a huge widescreen screen. Watching this wonderful print showed how Antonioni intended, realizing that this is indeed a work of modern art. It all the more suited to the fact that the series falls within the Cleveland Insititue of Art at University Circle. <br /> <br /> Antonioni's compositions are created for the Cinemascope landscape. His beautiful balancing of images, striking use of colors, wide choreographic movements, all this is the work of a real artist using the screen as a canvas. <br /> <br /> In the end, the audience understood "Zabriskie Point". As the narrative unfolded, it became obvious that this work did not concern history per se, but rather the impressionistic rendering of the volatile images of his subject by the artist. The setting of some of the more turbulent actions of the sixties is only a dramatic motor for a wide collage of the artist. <br /> <br /> Antonioni is not bound by conventional narrative standards and can stop at any time to creatively embroider the event with magnificent decorations. The audience willingly went with the flow of his unusual imagination, because his huge paintings on the huge canvas attracted attention. While the audience could only be tangentially involved in the relationship between the characters, she realized that the theme here is human aleination, the director's recurring theme. <br /> <br /> It was also understandable that no smaller or lower quality printouts than the original one in Cinemascope can render this particular rendering. The audience was all the more grateful for watching "Zabriskie Point" in the original, breathtaking format and finally broke into a loud applause.
