Being a transplanted New Yorker, I could be more critical than most in watching the city hall. But I must say that before I even got to the very story, I was enchanted by the shooting and political atmosphere of New York created by director Harold Becker. <br /> <br /> For example, there is a reference to Woerner restaurant in Brooklyn, where political boss Frank Anselmo likes to eat. When in 1996 I lived in New York, in Remsen Street in the center of Brooklyn, there was or was a Woerner restaurant on Remsen Street. In fact, it was particularly privileged by the political people in the district, although they had several other meetings. <br /> <br /> No wonder, because the script was a co-author of Nicholas Pileggi, who still writes both political and organized detective stories. He knows the atmosphere well and he knows how these two worlds are intersecting in this film. <br /> <br /> The detective played by Nestor Serrano goes to an informal meeting with the relative of the mafia boss, Anthony Franciosa, and things break out and three people are dead, including an innocent 6-year-old boy whose father went to school. The story is growing, and finally goes to the town hall itself. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino plays the mayor of John Pappas, and John Cusack is his deputy mayor transplanted Louisiana, a state that has a tradition of distinguished corruption. He is an outsider here, and Cusack, trying to control the damage, finds more than he expected. <br /> <br /> Danny Aiello is playing the political boss of Brooklyn Frank Anselmo, and for those of you who do not come from New York, his character is based on the late Queens Queens President Donald Manes, who was also overthrown by the scandal. He is a very similar politician from Brooklyn, whom I knew in times when friendship with organized crime and favors for them, make Aiello w. <br /> <br /> Town Hall was a farewell show in the film for Anthony Franciosa, one of the most underrated and underestimated talents on the screen. Nobody is watching anyone else when he is there. <br /> <br /> The best moment of Al Pacino is that at the funeral of a killed child, he takes over the proceedings and turns them into a political triumph for himself. Its part is complex, it is a decent man, but someone is entangled in the corruption that needs to be built in a place like New York. <br /> <br /> For those who want to know about political life in Big Apple, City Hall is highly recommended.
