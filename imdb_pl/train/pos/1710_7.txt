This movie is an exact copy of a television series on the doordarshan Indian television channel, which was broadcast at least 15 years ago. The series was known as "gubbarre", meaning balloons. Each episode was a new story. The story is excellent and the original is much sweeter and "convincing" Abhay Doel does a good job, but does not fit the role of "normal" and "third-class" guys (as he calls himself in the film). In fact, Shayan Munshi with short-cut hair and no designer's clothes would fit the role of Abhays, but Shayan simply has no talent to do it. <br /> <br /> I would suggest watching the series, if available. It's the same story, except running with the mother of friends and admission. The acting of television actors was much better than these "stars." <br /> <br /> The only reason why movies are a flop is that the director tried to stretch the story for half an hour (or 45 minutes) for 2+ hours. So he has to drag. Even songs with nasal singing do not keep up. <br /> <br /> These movies are good for a lazy Sunday afternoon and are really refreshing if you did not watch the original TV series. The script and the end of the serial number were much better <br /> <br /> ##### FLEXING SPOILERS ######### ##### AHEAD SPEILERS ######## # ##### FLEXING SPOILERS ######### ##### FLEXING SPOILERS ######### ##### SPOILERS FORWARD ######### the ending of the original series was much stronger when the hero himself dumps the girl, even thought she was ready to marry him. HE is aware and tells her that he does not want to be "paid off" and has never helped in this intention. The director or screenplay somehow can not capture the original ending in this film. The original end would bring tears to the girls' eyes and make the guys nod. The delivery was not right. <br /> <br /> But personally, I think it's a pathetic copy. Do not give credit to the director / screenwriter. The story is amazing and comes from one of the well-known novel writers in the PREMCHAND munshi class. I am not sure if this is the history of premchand munshi, but many other short stories include several tales of premchand munshi and other great Hindi writers.
