I really enjoyed watching this movie! At the beginning, seeing his poster, I thought it was another easy romantic comedy ... but it's just more than that! Personally, I believe that this idea (which I am sure that a significant number of viewers had just before watching the movie) is another important part of the great concept of the film itself (or even its marketing strategy)! I mean: Nowadays, we are slaves of images! For impressions! I went to the cinema to see this movie with the wrong impression, bad expectations, and finally felt how superficially I could be! For example, the sequence at the end of which Sidney buys a plane ticket to return to New York and when asked to "give away the autograph," which means signing a ticket, believes that it's only because I got into television thanks to a scandal on prizes, which is now a star. And this is, I think, the culmination of this main theme around which films are made. Besides, I think that the movie also offers us a solution that can be used in this movie, as illustrated by Sidney's attitude: do not take too seriously yourself or anyone else ... "even saints were people at the beginning" ... as Sophie says in the film . Saints are stars at the moment. We attribute to them the "aura" of perfection, eternal happiness, but the reality is much smaller. Even the saints of any religion are images, ideal models of behavior and life. Even they were not really ... they became "real" after death and we looked back at them. And this is the catch: we need our saints! we need our stars! We strive for them as if they were not for them, we would not have anything to strive for. Television and all other media are means to create and capture our aspirations. We desperately need reference points for which we measure. And so we got to the cinema to watch the film in the first place: check if we can adjust the benchmark or whether the benchmark is small for us. This time it was bigger than we expected.
