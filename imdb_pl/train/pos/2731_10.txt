I'm sorry, I do not have much time to write. I'm not a psychologist, but I've known him for 25 years. She said that Scott Wilson played the role of sociopath (without conscience) exceptionally well. I agree! She also said that Robert Blake introduced a person with anger and control under the influence of an impulse that had a conscience, but she could not control herself perfectly. I agree! What a cool and huge movie. I've seen over 2,000 movies and found myself in the top hundred. My friend regularly deals with clients throughout her life. My only criticism was the narrative at the end of the film. Many people grow up in less than ideal conditions, but only one in a million will behave as the two losers did.
