It's a bit of a puzzle for many of Lynch's artistic crowds. They are trying to write it as some senseless, crude, side project by Lynch. In this way Lynch lets gas between his real works of film art. Well, it could be a fart, but it's one of those intriguing farts you smell and feel embarrassed when you admit that you like. <br /> <br /> Stupid distilled beyond it is art. What can you do with the aspects of modern life, but laugh at it. If you took it seriously, you would go crazy. You hook him, smell him, taste him, you feel his agony, his ridiculous folly, and then you express it in any chosen medium. This is called art, and art is not stupid. But this is Dumbland.
