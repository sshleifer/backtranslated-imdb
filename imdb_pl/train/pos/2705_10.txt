This is a script that Ed Wood worked for 10 years trying to create it. Aris Iliopulos finally got the idea of ​​making a script that Wood saved from a burning house at the expense of other, more temporary valuables. <br /> <br /> This is a movie without dialogues, which some may stupidly describe as silent. In fact, it is quite a noisy movie without brazen talk about most movies. In the hands of these filmmakers, music and sound effects provide a rich sound experience that works better than any snipe from a Hollywood script mill, especially the stupid movie from the boat in which Billy Zane was last ("Watch out!", "Oh no!" - J Cameron .... ick ...) In this film, I will take wonderfully communicative, monosyllable murmurs of Zane every day. <br /> <br /> Billy Zane is in charge of a team of players who obviously really wanted to be in this movie. Ricci is as bright as ever, and the gods shine when you can put Sandra Bernhard, Rick (s) Schroeder, Earthy Kitt and Andrew McCarthy on the same poster. <br /> <br /> The design is perfect, the pyramid set is excellent, and the bestial performance of Ron Perlman is simply wonderful. In summary, it is a chaotic, internal masterpiece beautifully made by fans of Ed Wood Jr., author and film-maker. The responsibility of anyone who really loves movies is what Iliopulos and his cast do. A movie that will make you want you to do it yourself.
