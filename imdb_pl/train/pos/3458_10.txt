Casting Jack Cassidy as Ken Frankin was a pure glow. Cassidy epitomizes arrogance, self-confidence, charm and wit - all with a patronizing, evil, small smirk on his face. In my opinion, Jack Cassidy is definitely the best murderer (he appeared three times) in the Columbo series. This special (and first) performance is my favorite Columbo episode in history - no doubt. Fresh Steven Spielberg did an amazing job with the camera (yes, there were a few shadows on the actors), captured the nuances and teased at various and intriguing angles between Columbo and Franklin. Also, panoramic and tight shots at Big Bear Lake in California (home at Franklin's house) were very impressive. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this episode yet, you owe it to him - it's a real masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Jack Cassidy was a very talented actor and singer. His charismatic personality was highly contagious. His death in 1976, at the age of 49, was very sad and indeed very tragic - he certainly had the best years ahead. Have a rest in the Jack Room, you will live for eternity thanks to your wonderful work.
