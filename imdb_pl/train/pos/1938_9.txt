Big bad swimming has a low budget, indie about it. So many times I start watching independent films that have really good reviews, only to find out that they are pretentious, voted by people who are so blinded by the idea of ​​the film and its potential for provocation that they forget that the film is primarily a form entertainment. <br /> <br /> I do not know if a big bad bath has any message or more meaning or metaphor, if I did, I missed her. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning, BBS was right, it was easy, warm and human, there were no great dramas or significant insights, I just connected with the characters right away. And when, as with all good films, the end came, I felt sadness at the loss of this connection. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for something big or quick or insightful look elsewhere, look for a movie trying to deliver more than it can. BBS provides a solid, enjoyable, real experience and I felt rewarded and imbued with watching it.
