If you have not heard about this movie from Walt Disney Pictures, do not worry about it. It would be categorized into other Disney movies for educational purposes, such as "Family Planning." <br /> <br /> It was produced together with Kotex to teach teenage girls about menstruation, probably. It only educates at the superficial level, so it does not enter into the heavy details of the animated sequence of "Ram's Head" / reproductive system. <br /> <br /> The movie shows elements of "Disney's Wonderful World", such as turning the page and using animation to tell stories. <br /> <br /> This movie can not be found, so if you can find a movie, good luck and joy.
