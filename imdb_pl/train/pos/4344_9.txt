The film gets to the heart of the tension between the son and father. <br /> <br /> A great dialogue, beautiful landscapes and great acting is a great way to show the onion that tears the layers back. /> <br /> The main problems of parenthood, communication and masculinity are investigated indirectly. <br /> <br /> In a funny way, the curtain is withdrawn, the masks slide down a bit, and the truths are exposed. > <br /> All this happens in the format of the tour. The background is the rural state of New York at the beginning of autumn, just as trees change colors. WOW!
