What begins with a very predictable and slightly bleak thing is finally quite fun and fun. "Right to Die" is not too uncertain, but it's more than making up for it with bizarre sets and over the top. <br /> <br /> Spoilers here: <br /> <br /> The best credits also go to the dead show of Martin Donovan as one of the wicked characters ever to win a screen. Playing a character in a great "restrained" way, in the end you almost feel bad for a guy when his big plan eventually fails. Corbin Bernsen is also enjoying the scenery playing a not-so-good guy who gets his own desserts. <br /> <br /> End of Spoiler. <br /> <br /> Revenge from dead flick, "Right to Die" draws many benefits from its performers and is more than a good way to spend less than hours.
