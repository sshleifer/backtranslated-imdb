Only 9/10 from me, the perfect 10 would have been if there were more stories for the film, but still Moonwalker remains a fun festival of music, dance and entertainment. Starting with the editing of video clips from Jackson's long career, he reminds the viewer why he is often considered the "King of Pop." From your blockbuster "I want you back" to "We are the World", the award-winning charity record for Africa. After this short film, though nondescript in the Oscar-winning scenario, it provides a fantastic and entertaining drama for the audience. The ending is perfect (sexy!) Interpretation of "Come Together". Something that the whole family can watch and enjoy.
