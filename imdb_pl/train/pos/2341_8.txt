It's a really fun program, done in a scary way, like Tim Burton's movie. It's worth a look because it's much more creative than most shows this season. Most importantly, this is not a "real" program. I wonder why the viewer is so ready to accept concerts (which lack creativity) and ignore great programs, such as those that have a creative attitude. <br /> <br /> Although some condemn the premise, I think it's really extraordinary. Much more pleasant than "Ghost Whisperer" and "Medium". I think it's the funniest thing on the lamp from "My Name is Earl". <br /> <br /> Oh, and narration and music are great. If you like shows that are a bit off the beaten path, I recommend it. It is not as strange as Twin Peaks, but it has a serious breakdown.
