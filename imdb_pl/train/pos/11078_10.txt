I watched a movie today and just broke my mind. It's a real masterpiece of art and I do not understand why most people think it's junk. The main idea of ​​the movie - take your ego, and then you will have real power! It was the main battle at the end of the movie, and Guy Ritchie showed it in a great way. "The biggest enemy will hide in the last place you'll ever look like" - remember this from the movie? Because our real enemy is in us - it's our ego ... This voice, which always tells us that we are important, gives us our pride, which tells us not to give but to take, which creates our aggression wants to have control that creates all negative feelings and thoughts. GR expressed this idea in a surprising way and showed that the only way to get a real check is to lose control and just let go of personal meaning. A great movie!
