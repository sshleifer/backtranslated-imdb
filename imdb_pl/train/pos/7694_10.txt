I'd like to know why John Amos left the show and how he died again in the show? I could not relate to everything, but sometimes they came home with the problems they were struggling with. By the way, have they ever gotten out of the ghetto? I think the episode with the black Jesus was my favorite. We had to see how they were going through some good moments. something they often did not have. I would like them to bring back the show. During the day, so that people can actually watch. I do not think a movie or a new program will work. Especially without the original cast. They are really what made Good Times GoodTimes. These are my questions and comments. Thank you!!
