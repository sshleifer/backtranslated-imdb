This series could be the best in Britcom history, and it's very good considering the competitors (Fawlty Towers, Good Neighbors, to name only two). <br /> <br /> What made the Butterflies so perfect, even for the best of the best is that it not only illustrates a great, classic, classic and intelligent comedy, but also expands the horizons, reflecting - flawlessly, gently and in every details - a great social change that took place in Great Britain in time. <br /> <br /> I remember watching this program as a teenager and be delighted with all this. The presented lifestyle was unusual. This was the first time I saw real people using wireless phones. And the wardrobe of all the characters was far from the outfit of the seventies, which was still visible in North America. Then there were decors, shop windows, cars. These people - even lay sons, with their philosophical approach to life and epigramatic humor - were sophisticated. These were examples of "New Europeans" who were to influence life and style around the world in the coming decade (1980s). <br /> <br /> Of course, the premise was strange and fantastic. The idea that someone who lived in a suburban dream may be so dissatisfied and restless was revolutionary, especially for Americans from the North, for whom happiness was always defined as money and things (certainly the situation was depicted in American films and television, but not with the intensity of Butterflies or Montenegrin film). And if the premise was not surprising enough, the means by which it was expressed led her to extremes. A potential romance that did not involve sex or even romance? Butterflies dazzled many, but it must have made some people look incredulous at the forehead ... at that time. <br /> <br /> Butterflies have been prophetic in many ways. He documented, ahead of his time, postmodern boredom, omnipresent lifestyle, the concept of emotional infidelity and the disconnection of generations and male dissatisfaction (perfectly presented by the tense father-son relationship). It is a pity that this series was not rediscovered on a large scale, and all involved admitted that they created a sensible snapshot of a certain time and place, and anticipated all traces and anxieties that were to come.
