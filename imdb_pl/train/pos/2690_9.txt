La Teta and la Luna (Breasts and the Moon) describe the life of a 9-10-year-old boy named Tete, who is obsessed with the breasts growing up in Catalonia. I love this movie because the characters are very honest and very human, like all the characters in Bigas Luna's films (also by Jamon and Jamon). Tete reminded me of how intriguing and exciting life can be in this age. Also from Catalunya (north-eastern Spain) reminded me of many memories. This movie shows how beautiful Catalunya is, nice people, nice life and especially many not too tense people.
