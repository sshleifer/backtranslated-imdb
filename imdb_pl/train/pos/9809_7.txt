Randolph Scott is going to Albuquerque to work for his uncle. However, the scene is stopped on the way - even if they do not carry a safe. However, a nice lady on board hides $ 10,000 for her and her brother's interests ... and the robbers seem to know about it. <br /> <br /> After arriving in town, Scott goes to his uncle. Soon, however, he learns that this uncle is a jerk - a typical bad guy from westerns. You know, rich guy who wants to get richer, cheating, stealing and threatening until he's the owner of everything. And it so happens that this jerk was behind theft. Scott demands that my uncle return the money and then Scott becomes interested in the nice lady and her brother. <br /> <br /> No wonder it's NOT the end of problems - just the beginning. There are many intrigues of various types that try to destroy the uncle's opposition. One trick is to bring a pretty lady to make friends with Scott and his partners. She is shot and looks bad for Scott - until she understands why she came to the city. <br /> <br /> Unlike most of Randolph Scott's later films, this one shows Scott as a bit more stubborn man. Too often in his films, he suggests violence as the last one, but in this film he will promptly suggest lynching (break the law, let's hang around), and then quickly threaten the uncle. What a surprise when I see him as so delightful - though in many other respects he is the same old Scott that one can expect. <br /> <br /> As for the movie, there is nothing extraordinary about it. Gabby Hayes plays an ordinary character, Scott is a hero, an evil spirit can not be justified and is eventually destroyed, and Scott gets a girlfriend. Despite this very typical story, everything is very well served and as a result is worth your time. <br /> <br /> By the way, there are two strange scenes in the movie. First of all, there's a battle between Scott and his boss # 1, Lon Chaney, Jr. late in the movie. In this, Chaney smokes as he fights - something I've never seen before and I admire how he could swell away when he kicked him in the ass . Second, take a whip from this fleeing scene with a pram - now THIS was one thing impossible!
