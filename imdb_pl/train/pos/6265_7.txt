Nick and Kelly are ready for the wedding, but Travis (Kelly's dog) leads Nick to a strange blue wall that will change the honeymoon for Kelly. Richard Burgi and Susan Walters play Nick and Kelly and create a good pair. Nick loves to drink, smoke and play billiards with friends for fun, but Nick suddenly abstains from this kind of fun. Sex is the only thing he loves because he wants a child. We learn that an alien race dies and must cross with women from Earth to save its population. It becomes a struggle for survival between humans and aliens, in which the dog population is also involved. Great movie.
