EDDIE MURPHY DELIRIOUS is the funniest concert movie I've ever seen. Most stand-up acts usually have a standstill at some point, but not this one. For 90 minutes, there is no one moment that would not be fun. From the moment Eddie makes a funny impression Mr.T, laughter is endless. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it was done in 1983, and Eddie did not do anything so funny. it's unbelievable that a man who wrote this phenomenally brilliant program wrote a movie called HARL NIGHTS, which was not at all funny. <br /> <br /> Eddie, if you're there, come back and make a gig in a DELIRIOUS style movie. Believe me, your fans will love you for it. And I think you know it.
