It could have been a good, final film noir of all time, if Columbia Studios did not cut out much of Orson Welles's original. What's left to us is a flawed but brilliant movie that shows Welles's overwhelming talent as actor / director and Rita Hayworth as a serious dramatic talent. <br /> <br /> "Pani z Szanghaju" is a noir movie, the most sizzling and confusing. Welles, with an uneven accent, presents Michael O'Hara, an apprentice of the Irish, who after a disastrous encounter with the seductive, dangerous Elsa Bannister (Hayworth, in a GREAT performance) is practically forced to accept a job as a crew member on her yacht and her crippled husband (Everett Sloane). Elsa or Rosalie, as Michael likes to call her, plays a very innocent, helpless doll, captivating O'Hara in her network. When lovers have an unseen affair at sea, Arthur Bannister's partner appears on board in his law firm George Grisby (Glenn Anders). He is a strange, incredible character who offers Michael a unique proposition: he'll get $ 5,000 to help Grisby pretend Grisby's death, so he looks like he's murdering. The plan is that Michael will leave the technique and escape into the sun with Elsa. But everything is not going according to plan. <br /> <br /> Hayworth provides us with one of the best femme fatales of all time in a very ambiguous way. Sometimes it seems sincerely sensitive and childish, in others brutal, weary and hard. She is always brilliantly beautiful, regardless of whether the situation makes her drip wet in a bathing suit, or dress in black, waving a pistol. Hayworth is beautifully photographed here, and she is far from her famous role of "Gilda." Her then husband, Orson Welles, cut off her characteristic auburn castles for a dyed blond crop (angry head of Columbia Harry Cohn). It was a great marketing game, and he changed perfectly in her changed attitude. She is not a nice femme fatale, which is "Gilda", here she is a predatory, black lady who sees murder as a very useful option. <br /> <br /> The pairing of Welles and Hayworth took place when the couple had great difficulties in marriage. They would be divorced after making a movie, so it's also a curiosity when it comes to presenting a complicated relationship. They are hateful, not romantic lovers, so it's hard to judge if they had real chemistry on screen. Certainly, every meeting is powerful and full of raw sexuality, and Welles as a "fall guy" (even admits it himself in the movie!), And Rita as a double babe. <br /> <br /> Welles's character is a typical noir "ramble" without any sense. As lecturer of Welles, O'Hara really does not use his brain, he "expects to think about her (Elsa)". Welles usually played intelligent, charismatic companions, so his turn here, as a wicked Michael, is unusual and very interesting. Indeed, Welles was an actor of great talent and pulls him out well. <br /> <br /> Everett Sloane is slimy enough like Hayworth's husband, crippled. One wonders why he hires Michael. It is obvious that his wife is interested in him romantically, so why he invites "a threat" on board? One of the interpretations may be that Michael provides a "service" to his wife, whom Bannister can not in his crippled state. There is definitely something in this theory, with many implications for Elsa's behavior before she met her husband (was she some prostitute?) And Grisby's knowledge of Bannister's most intimate mysteries pointed out in several scenes. <br /> <br /> This is a confused, intricate movie with a story that is ultimately flawed. We're more interested in a love triangle than a murder plot, like most noirs. Welles provides us with many of his wonderful cinema accents, including the rightly famous "mirror room". It's a great scene, one ending that can almost completely destroy the mistakes in the film and raise it to splendor. This stage in the amusement park is visually stunning, with a dala-similar style for painted sets (apparently, Orson painted them himself). The subtle visual images used throughout the film by Welles improve the story and make it a stimulating experience to think about. <br /> <br /> Dialogue is burning and confusing, delivered excellently by Rita's alternately breathing low voice and helpless, high-pitched little girl's voice. Hayworth proves his acting skills in this and proves that SHE is the ultimate femme fatale "noir". It's a pity (only a small one because Rita was a great dancer) that she did so many great, but foamy and often forgotten musicals for Columbia in the '40s, instead of dark-themed noirs. She was a great actress when she had the opportunity to show her talent. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
