I will never forget this movie or the events that led to Jonestown in Guyana. It seems so tragic, but you have to say it. Powers Boothe give command as the leader of Fr. Jim Jones from the dark to the point of total madness. He would easily have won the Academy Award if it was released in cinemas. It's a kind of mini-series that you will not forget. You will not forget about the images of the brutality, control and obsession of the iconic leader. His growth and fall and the threat from the outside world to destroy what he considered a paradise. Mass suicide is frightening, almost unreal to anyone's imagination, why so many people (900+) willingly went or resisted JOnes orders. They do not make such mini series in which we leave our mouth open and we are hungry to know what happened to others.
