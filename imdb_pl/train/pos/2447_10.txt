George Lopez never got interested in my comedy, and he still has not. But this performance is a work of art. It never shows where jokes make you laugh every time you remember it (and the jokes that are memorized at the moment). This show has only an optimistic look, and the characters have from an old, short drunkard to a dyslexic teenager. I do not know who is writing this series, but this person does a great job. If they just continued the show, I'm sure that he will get a positive response from the critics of this wonderful country. If you're looking for a good, traditional comedy, George Lopez is the program for you! The only bad thing is the title. George Lopez? Really? Imagine that Fresh Prince of Bel-Air is "Will Smith". Come on, man! But besides, this show is brilliant! 10/10
