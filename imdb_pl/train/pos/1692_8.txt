Like the wonderful classic Bugs Bunny cartoon, this movie has humor on different levels. I just introduced it to my 10-year-old daughter and 11-year-old son. They both liked this movie - laughing a few times ... and my daughter is not a science fiction fan. The film allowed me to laugh, despite watching several times ... humor for adults (that is, the humor that adults will get simply due to greater life experiences, lack of baudy or things with an R rating, which can be found here) keeps the film equally enjoyable for adults. For example, humor on an adult level, Martian voices are based on characters from different movies / actors. The Martian pilot, Blaznee, has the voice and mannerisms of Jack Nicholson; scientist, Dr. Strangelove of Peter Seller. Special effects are surprisingly good for this movie. The lack of the top 10 actors actually works for the benefit of the film, and the actors / actresses are good - in fact, I would say that producers chose actors and their skills for roles compared to the draw power (the great example is the character of Vern Wayne Alexander). I had to write this review ... children play now for the third time in 4 days after dinner. Good for a rainy day or for a late evening there is no boring movie.
