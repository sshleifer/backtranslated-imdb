This shortcut was nominated for an Oscar and I would like him to win! Essentially, the filmed jam session between very talented musicians, including Lester Young and Joe Jones, the music is amazing! Hollywood quite often took Jazz (especially animation, believe it or not), but it is a rare look at the film during improvisation. This has been added to the list of Movie Behavior and deservedly so. TCM periodically launches this program as a filler and launches it every March in tribute to "31 days of Oscar". From the center in the buzzer, the whistle, nothing but the net and the shot is so smooth, the net is barely moving. Most reliable and highly recommended !!!
