Seeing Charley Boorman in Long Way Round with Ewan McGregor, I really wanted to see Charley participate in his program. I thought Charley was a lovely guy who is very grounded and on the ground. It's nice to see that the stars are fighting with their weight and condition, they just show that they are also human! I do not know much about bicycles, but this show immediately caught me. The preparation and organization of this event seems enormous. The party itself seems very dangerous and it fascinates me why Charley and everyone else are doing it and how far they are. I love the tempo of the show and fast optimistic music. I can not believe he broke his collarbone, I really hope it's not over, I can not wait to see the next episode ...
