Amazing English movie for many reasons. At first, this is the rare appearance of Laurence Olivier in a light comedy. While his performances are not as high as he would describe as one of the greatest actors in the 20th century, he is completely credible as a cheated lawyer. Historically, this movie is very interesting because of where and when it was shot. As English, he did not have a large budget for Hollywood movies from the same era and often shows up, but the more interesting is the fact that the film was shot just before the war and shows England, which will soon disappear. When we look at it today, we think in terms of contemporary morality and look at the fact that this film and its closest American part of "It Happened One Night" was in their time as a risqu√© as "Fatal Instinct" was in our time. But after watching and enjoying this movie for the first time, I can not stop my sadness when I watch it today. Because half of the film shots passed before the 1950s, saving the remaining films means a difficult choice, and unfortunately films such as these are often overlooked, to save films that we all consider important. Color shift, lack of contrast and generally poor quality of the most common printout is painful. This movie along with "It Happened One Night" are perfect for falling in love in the cool and cool evening and watching, and even better, why there is no double function.
