I liked the movie. I thought it was a great political thriller about something that had never happened before - the Secret Service agent who is angry and involved in a murder plot. Unfortunately, for the character of Michael Douglas, "Pete Garrison", they think he is a mole, but he is not. <br /> <br /> He is just a morally flawed agent having an affair with the First Lady! Because he does this, he is unable to give an acceptable polygraph examination and this makes him the number one suspect, when a conspiracy to kill the President is revealed. <br /> <br /> "Garrison" is forced to go to the lamas but at the same time he is still trying to act properly, protecting the president. Douglas does a great job in this role. I do not always care about the people he plays, but he's a great actor. Keifer Sutherland ("David Breckinridge") is equally good (at least here) like a fellow SS who hunts Douglas until he finds out he's telling the truth. When he does two of them, they work together in the final to discover and then stop, if they can, the storyline. By the way, fraudsters are also interesting. I will never - and never will - unfortunately I will see the First Lady, who looks as good as Kim Basinger <br /> <br /> It is just a slippery movement that entertains from the beginning to the end. Are there holes in it? Of course; probably a lot of them and the reason you see so many critical comments. However, this is unfairly treated here. It's just not smart enough for the geniuses here on this site. My advice: chill, just go for a ride and enjoy all the actions and intrigue. Yes, at the end he gets a bit of Rambo-ish, but otherwise he gets high marks for entertainment ..... what's going on in the movies.
