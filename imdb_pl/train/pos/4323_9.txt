It's a great adaptation and great miniseries. Limitations of the plot may disappoint the fans of the book (but in fact, how many modern readers have read Bleak House, not seeing the movie version first? I know only a few). <br /> <br /> I think it's very scary when we see critical reviews for a series that were clearly written by people who have no idea about history - did you actually see the series or if you just packed BBC Production because Gillian Anderson was in a newer version? <br /> <br /> The cycle captures the mood, tempo, characters and plot drivers (cutting Dickensian swirls that are not needed and distracting from the movie like the Turveydrop story, the dynamics of the Smallweed family and additional lawyers - Tangle, Vholes etc. are very condensed). The only omission that I wanted to keep was the incident in Jellyby, but because the first episode is a bit slow (after the first episode the pace is perfect), I see that he had to leave. <br /> <br /> The only other criticism I have is the fact that Jo's death could have been more faithfully made. I see that he practically canonized Woodcourt, and he was a little more human for not having this scene, but I really think that Jo's death is one of the most poignant points in the book and I missed her, even though it always makes me cry . br /> <br /> Did the theowinthrop actually see the series? HOW he thought Esther was brought up by his aunt and UNCLE ?? Who is this uncle? I suppose that someone who would mistake the name DENHOLM Eliott with Desmond is not really appreciated in English art (film or literature). <br /> <br /> I also think that he is wrong with treating the law. YES, the law is VERY wrong in Bleak House. The descendants of Jarndyce, whose valuable heritage is absorbed by the costs of court proceedings, fail to succeed the dead Tom Jarndyce and Rick Carstone and all who believe in the suit. This is Miss Flyte's disappointment. In a sense, Captain Hawdon also fails, who is brought to death by the monotony of the copious law. Yes, feeds scavengers Vholes and Tangle. But it also makes men like Guppy and Kenge able to go beyond their place in life. Although Dickens is not kind to climbers with a social status, he would prefer that they would not be forced to get stuck in the station they were born on (opposing Jo and the brick families' climbing out of poverty by Charley Neckett). <br /> <br /> In addition, the law, though abused by Tulkinghorn and the chancellor's vultures, is in fact a source of security for the districts of Ada and Richard, and for Estera, who is simply Jarndyce's ward. Their safety was assured by the law that supplies them to Jarndyce. <br /> <br /> I do not see how anyone could have trouble following the story - remember that you should not be aware that Esther is the daughter of Lady Dedlock just at the beginning. You should not immediately "get" all calls. Immediate gratification simply does not occur in Dickens. <br /> <br /> When it comes to "seeing clearly" through fog - wounds, Gillian Anderson had such an unpleasant edition that I could not follow her and I already knew the plot! <br /> <br /> I found Diana Rigg absolutely genius (abuse and drama are not good Lady Dedlock, but if you think you are trying a version of Gillian Anderson). <br /> <br /> It's ADA and Rick not "Kate"! and you'll get everything you need from Rouncewell.
