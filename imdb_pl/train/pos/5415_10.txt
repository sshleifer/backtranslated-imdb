Early Hollywood at its best !! Kipling's classic poem transforms into an epic adventure with unforgettable performances by the stellar cast. I think the measure of a good movie is how many times you can watch it and still enjoy it. I saw it a dozen or so times and still cry at the end and, admit, you do it too !!
