It's the story of two dogs and a cat looking for a way back home. Old and wise Golden Retriever Shadow, a young American bulldog Chance and a Sassy Himalayan cat escaping from the ranch and going to the desert to re-connect with their family. Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey (1993) is a family adventure directed by Duwayne Dunham. This is a remake of the 1963 film. This movie received a sequel three years later. Michael J. Fox is the perfect man who will read for Chance. Fox has some of the youthful energy he brings to this role. Sally Field is doing great as Sassy. Ameche is fantastic like Shadow. That was the second last movie of this veteran. Also visible actors are great. Robert Hays to Bob Seaver.Benji Thall plays Peter Burnford.Veronica Lauren to Hope Burnford.Kevin Chevalia to Jamie Seaver.Jean Smart introduces Kate. It's amazing that these animals are trying to survive in the desert. We see Sassy made by the river and it seems that she is in. The scene of the bear is exciting and fun. Chance has no chance with this big, hungry bear. His meeting with the porcupine looks painful. It's great fun for the whole family.
