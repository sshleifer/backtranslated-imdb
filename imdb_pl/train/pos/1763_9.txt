it's one of the funniest movies I've seen. it had a primitive time, but it was full of charm. this is the Altmanesque scenario, the genius of physical humor and free friendships were a pleasure to watch, and most of us can relate to a piece of life. and I can say honestly that I was scared of Steve Carell's nipple ... I really was. surprisingly, it is a good-hearted, steadfast comedy that basically involves love and many relationships in which we can be found along the way. Catherine Keener was great as Trish, and all friends of Steve Carell were flawed, but friendly and very funny. the idea that they suspected Carell was a serial killer is a funny metaphor for a forty-year-old virgin. but the simple truth was that he wanted to be in love first. original, charming and very funny. highly recommended.
