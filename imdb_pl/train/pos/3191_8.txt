Director Edward Sedgwick, an old-fashioned visual comedy, successfully conducts this road show Hal Roach, which presents a rapidly changing scenario and excellent casting, employing a large number of reliable Roach performers. Although the movie was originally designed as a vehicle for Patsy Kelly, the sunny Jack Haley plays Joe Jenkins, a young Kansan who sells his car repair company and travels to Hollywood, where he tries to guess the role of the screen for the girl he loves, star Cecilia (Rosina Lawrence ). Sedgwick, who prefers to use the whole MGM studio as his kit, does it here, because Cecilia, always ready for interrogation, is treated by a would-be lover, Rinaldo Lopez's star (Mischa Auer), for action behind the scenes from natural musical comedy with Lydia Roberts from Broadway. Laurel and Hardy provide some nice interludes, including a well-known skit with a small harmonica, and we watch gentle corners like Joyce Compton, Russell Hicks and Walter Long. In summary, it is necessary to convey the bays of Mischa Auer, who clearly steals the image as an emotional movie star, a role he largely creates, and the director for a clever tribute to Busby Berkeley's film spectacles.
