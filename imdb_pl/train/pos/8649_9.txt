I bought it some time ago, but somehow I neglected to watch it until the last night. I like Juliette Lewis, although I'm indifferent to Brad Pitt. After watching this, I must admit that he is a perfect actor - his character was completely reliable and I did not think "Brad Pitt" at all. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I can not say the same for David Duchovna. I'm a fan of X-Files and I had to look twice to confirm the date of this movie, as I thought it was made a few years later. I like Duchovny, but his character is a bit two-dimensional here, except for the situations in which he makes lectors. This part was strong, it looked like a character, good intonation, etc. Otherwise I was thinking "Agent Mulder", which is a pity. <br /> <br /> Michelle Forbes was a feast. Why did not I notice her before? (I will look up to see what other roles she has done and see them as soon as possible). I am a bit worried about stereotypes about Lewis, this movie and "Born Assassins" (favorite favorite). Interesting, however, to see the contrast of the figure - in NBK is a willing partner, while here he abhors violence and tries very hard not to recognize the dark side of Early until it is pushed into her face. <br /> <br /> I liked the film almost without reservations. Aside from the fact that Duchovny's character did not seem fully formed (and perhaps "washed away" by Pitt), it was perfect. I was also happy with the ending - I'm glad that the innocent heroes did not die, but they had to suffer first. It was realistic, tense, disturbing. <br /> <br /> If you like NBK, you may like this movie and vice versa.
