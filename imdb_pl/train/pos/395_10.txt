Stunning visually and full of eastern philosophy, this amazing fantasy of martial arts was presented by master Tsui Hark, the man behind the best films produced by the cinema in Hong Kong. The special effects are beautiful and ingenious. The plot is slightly on the brain side, but it is a refreshing change compared to films that treat the audience like morons. However, if thinking is not your strong point, it may not be your movie. Maybe you should see the latest Hollywood movie without a brain club, but if you're looking for something more, then you'll find it there.
