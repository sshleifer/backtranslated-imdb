I remember seeing this movie as a child. I do not remember where I saw it. I had to be around 14 years old. I thought the movie was amazing and I wanted to see it again. Once he went to the Kung Fu channel, but missed it. I was really stunned. This is the best Kung Fu movie with special effects that I have seen so far! I highly recommend it, and now, when I discovered where to get it, I can enjoy it again and for many years. I also need to check the film Return of Yad, which some people have said so much.
