Yakitate! Ja-pan (translated as Fresh Baked! Japanese Bread) is the story of a young man named Azuma Kazuma and his journey to create the perfect Japanese bread or I-pan, for Japan and for the Japanese, who will be recognized as the whole world. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's just outside. In fact, Yakitate! I do not really mean bread, but the reaction that comes after eating bread and the pun that accompanies the reaction. The series is nice because of these word games. From popular anime titles such as Naruto, Detective Conan and Dragon Ball to hit movies such as The Matrix and Lord of the Rings. That's all. <br /> <br /> So what makes this title different from other titles of the same genre, such as Cooking Master Boy or Mr. Ajikko? Well, unlike others who use cooking to dominate the world, Yakitate! You-me is a pure comedy. Sure, sometimes history turns into drama and even murder, but the comedy atmosphere makes you laugh at them. You will laugh at your own view of the sky. Just watch it. <br /> <br /> Just remember that this is also a fiction, although some bread made here is based on real bread, eating Japanese homemade No. 2 will not change you into Super Saiyan or turn your body into a gum.
