I've watched a few episodes of Cold Case since its premiere (especially now that the Amazing Race follows immediately, but it was one of the best examples of writing and acting I've seen in Bruckheimer's house.) Casting, especially junior officers, were in place, and the script and editing soundtrack and acting made this episode a tour d'force.The portrait was from Coop and Jimmy as part of a 48-minute episode that takes away a lot of talented people who do everything in my power. I noticed this the first time.
