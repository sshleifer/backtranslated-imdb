Pinjar is one of the few films that really leaves a trail and makes you think hard. This film, embedded in Partition India, shows the real reality of the division of India. Urmila gets full marks for her beautiful and deep emotional portrait of a suffering woman who has no way out. Her freedom, personal identity and respect for her family took a terrible controversy over the land from day to day. Manoj bajpai is simply brilliant as her contrite hijacker. There are several moments in the film where tears come to you. The film in the points is deeply traumatic. Some splitting scenes are chilling, but Urmila's endurance and survival are extraordinary. From a woman deprived of liberty to a woman who gave freedom to women in similar situations. An extraordinary film that should be rewarded for intelligent characters and story telling.
