This Batman movie is not as good as the Batman mask from The Phantasm, and Batman and Mr. Freeze subzero. But it's still a good round of Batman cartoons. I say it's as good as Batman Beyond The Movie. This movie is good for the same reasons. The plot is good, not as good as the other one, but still quite good, it has many actions in it. The cartoon effects are good. The voice of the actors is really good, like Kevin Conroy as Batman / Bruce Wayne, Tara Strong as Barbra Gordon, Efrem Zimbalist Jr., Eli Marienthal as Robin. Black characters are good, such as Kyra Sedgwick as Batwoman, David Ogden Stiers as The Pequin, Hector Elizondo as Bane. So I'm sure you will not be disappointed by Batman Mystery of The Batwomen. So make sure the movie you rent or buy is really good. <br /> <br /> Overall result: ******* from ********* * <br /> <br /> *** from *****
