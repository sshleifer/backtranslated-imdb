THE GREAT CARUSO was the biggest hit in the world in 1951 and broke all the box records at Radio City Music Hall during the year when most of the "movergoers" remained at home, watching their new 7-inch Motorola TVs. the numbers are false - because they do not adjust inflation. Of course, today's movies will dominate for 10 USD. In 1951 it cost 90c to $ 1.60 in Radio City; 44c to 75c for the first time at the Loew's Palace in Washington or 35c to 50c in the neighborhood The number of people who react to this image and not the uncorrected "media turnover" counts. GREAT THE GREAT CARUSO genius consisted in the fact that the creators survived most of Enrico Caruso's life (in fact it is not a great story) and 90% of the film focused on music, so MGM gave us the best live opera singer, MARIO LANZA, who creates the best music in history of the opera singer ENRICO CARUSO. It's a pity that LANZA will quit his life and leave his career overeating. Too thick to play the PRINCIPLE, Edmund Purdom took his place - with the voice of Lanza baptized and with the former handsome and not too greasy Lanza in the commercial. If you want to see THE GREAT CARUSO, it's almost always on eBay for $ 2.00 or less. Do not be discouraged by the low price, because it reflects only the easy availability of copies, not the quality of the film.
