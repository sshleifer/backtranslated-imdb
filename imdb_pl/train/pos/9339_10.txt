For those who do not, clubberin was 4 fists hitting one body ... <br /> <br /> In any case, for a review. <br /> <br /> I miss WCW Saturday Night. Some of my favorite wrestling moments took place at this stage. I remember watching Stunning Steve Austin, Rick Rude, Brian Pillman, Cactus Jack, Dustin Rhodes, Johnny B. Badd, DDP in his days of work, Lord Steven Regal, Harlem Heat, Ricky Steamboat, STING ... listing everyone. Point to WCW had an amazing inventory in the days before Hogan and produced entertaining TV. Dusty Rhodes in a comment in later years gave me a whole new reason to watch, when I started to smoke a jug as a teenager ... I really want Vince to put him on the microphone for a show or two, maybe the next Great American Bash? They are CLUBBERIN! DA PLUNDA is coming! He was great. <br /> <br /> -DirrTy
