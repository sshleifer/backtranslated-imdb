This production of PM Entertainment contains so many balls that John Woo would say, "Enough!". Of course, this is not as beautiful as Woo can provide, but performs a maintenance task within 90 minutes. Eric Phillips (Don Wilson) is a secret policeman in the near future. When his wife is framed for murdering the governor by a team using a cyborg-like, Eric must clean her name. Wilson must pull Van Damme for playing the heroic trail and his evil doppelganger. Why the Academy has not noticed is beyond me. Being a producer of PM, there are plenty of car chases, exploding cars (4 in the first 5 minutes!) And shootings. I particularly liked the van that goes through the air before it even approaches an exploding truck. My second favorite piece was that the girl from the neighborhood started to improve karate in the simulator Don. This is just an opportunity to show some of the cheap effects of LAWNMOWER MAN around 1995.
