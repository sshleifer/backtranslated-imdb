S. S. Van Dine must have been a clever businessman in dealing with Hollywood. Most film series from 'study days' were usually limited to one or two studies. But apparently Van Dine had to sell his rights to every book about Philo Vance in turn. Note that Paramount, MGM, Warner Brothers and many others have released Philo Vance movies. Only Tarzan seemed to be moving around Hollywood more. <br /> <br /> MGM produced the murder case in the garden and played Edmund Lowe as a fashionable detective. Of course, MGM had a contract with the original Philo at the time, but Bill Powell was then busy doing Thin Man and probably Louis B. Mayer decided to concentrate there. <br /> <br /> Edmund Lowe is quite acceptable Philo Vance. Lowe began quite well at the end of the quiet era of What Price Glory, followed by a series of films with Victor McLaglen with their characters Flagg and Quirt. But after McLaglen received the Oscar for the "Guide", Lowe seemed to disappear in the B picture market. <br /> <br /> The murder case in the garden concerns three separate victims: Douglas Walton, Gene Lockhart and Friedy Inescourt. The sinister atmosphere around the perpetrator distances him a bit, the secret lies in how all the killings are connected and how they are achieved. <br /> <br /> I will say this however. Vance has a very good chance of revealing a villain, and the last 15 minutes are worthy of Hitchcock.
