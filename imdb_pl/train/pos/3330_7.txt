I was not just an addition in this movie, but I saw him in Boston for the sold-out movie theater. Over a thousand Boston Red Sox / Farrelly fans entered the cinema near Boston Common to watch a comedy ... about them ... Red Sox fanatics! Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon are a lovely comedy about love and lust. Love is between two young lovers. It is for Red Sox to win the world series. Although Fallon is not a great actor, he is the best actor for this role. It's fun enough and laughs the most. Barrymore, on the other hand, is the same old Barrymore. Sometimes I felt that the actress supporting Ione Skye would be a better actor in this role. All in all, Boston Red Sox fans will love this movie. For the rest of the world it's just a funny movie.
