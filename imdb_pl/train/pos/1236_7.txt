Eddie Murphy spends time searching for missing children, so when a very special magical child is kidnapped in Tibet, the sexy Charlotte Lewis asks him to help save this child from the clutches of evil itself. <br /> <br /> Although the story is a bit stupid, it never seems banal, despite the mirth of the comedy throughout the movie; Charles Dance relieves the comedy with his very serious and dark character of evil, which holds the child as a hostage. <br /> <br /> Golden Child is very funny, full of action and really addictive in a charming, almost magical way. <br /> <br /> 7/10 Great for all generations.
