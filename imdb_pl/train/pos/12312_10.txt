I can not believe a movie that can be done so well in 1987 and is virtually unknown in the west. Do not repeat other reviews here. The result is very good and moving. Literally, this means "dawn, please never come" - when it arrives, the beautiful spirit and lover will be forever separated. After 24 years, Joel and Leslie still look great. I liked Joel in God of Gamblers and many Leslie movies, including Better Tomorrow.
