Nicely done, and with "New Travels" is a great continuation! Great to see James Cawley in the latest episode of "Vigil" Check it out! <br /> <br /> I like the growing characteristics and I think we have good replacements for TV actors in a piece made by fans. This program pretty well captures the feelings that are talking about ste, improved over the years with experience and I hope with some experience, a strong script editor and boost of time and CGI, which HF will become more unusual than it really is! <br /> <br /> Good job for everyone interested! <br /> <br /> (I have a HUGE weakness for Lefler and McFarland (GREAT acting), although I'm 'a bit tired' with Lefler's laws. "STRONG now! Shelby is great (if a little tense) and it's cool that she got a ship too pleased with herself, the Doctor, Counselor and Rawlins are right in money in my eyes, just like GREAT Neczayev (what a beautiful accent - TRUE Russian! (Well, I'm guessing that Rene is from the Czech Republic).) <br /> <br /> He has my voice, and CGI is kewl. Some of the obvious greenscreens, but in a small budget whaddayagonndo? <br /> <br /> I'm really happy that und it! <br /> <br /> (OK some games are not great, but they are created by fans and that's why they can be change - sorry Cmm.) Cole) <br /> <br /> Gay material is too thick (Graham Norton would be embarrassed) Trek does not attach so much importance to hetero pairs, so why do gays with signposts play all the time? Not someone's sexuality in this area - I hope they will calm her down and let Aster and Zen be human, not tokens - I do not treat my homosexual friends differently, they are just ordinary guys. <br /> <br /> Musically it's a mixed bag. I can tell you everything that is in the Trek OST magazine and it works most of the time, but time can fall now and then (the end of "Worst Fears Part 2" passes with crunching and editing.) I love the fact that they use "Galaxy" Quest "music! <br /> <br /> Certainly I can not wait for more! Dazza <br /> <br /> "Never give up, never trust!" <br /> <br /> Viva les frontie
