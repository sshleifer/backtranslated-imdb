This movie is wonderful. What sets it apart from science fiction in the 1950s is that the alien has no features, no faces, no eyes, nothing, but he can not be killed. I especially like the idea that this movie will not take place in a few days, it takes place in one night, probably after midnight. It is also horrible that when a droplet comes across you, you can not do it. you are stuck in it because it dissolves your body and slowly devours your body. My favorite sci-fi movie from the 1950s and what is sometimes considered the quintessence. I see why it caused Steve McQueen to become famous. All this and a catchy theme song! How can you be wrong?
