"Roman Troy Moronie" is my commentary on the film. What else can you say? <br /> <br /> This character really brings out moron in Moron. A tough gangster with an inability to pronounce blasphemous words, well, it would be frustrating to be tough and not be able to express yourself intelligently. <br /> <br /> Roman Moronie will go to the chronicle of film history as one of the greatest morons. <br /> <br /> There is of course a great comedy among other characters. Michael Keaton is F.A.H. like Joe Piscipo. <br /> <br /> I like the fact that Moronie kept the film from the "R" rating because he could not pronounce profanity.
