It is a pity that many people did not understand this and the next episode. <br /> <br /> But do not worry! bad to explain it too :) <br /> <br /> This episode is divided into 2 parts. <br /> <br /> the first part is Tony's "Sleep" in his coma. The second part is what is happening in real life. <br /> <br /> Now people did not understand that Tony's dream is more than just a dream. in this episode, he talks about preparations for death. He loses his own identity and eventually even forgets about himself, that is why he disconnects all his ties with this world. You'll notice what I'm saying on the doctor's stage, where Tony says he has lost his file that contains "his life". The creators really did a great job, interpreting their own thoughts about what happens when you die. <br /> <br /> If you understand the entire story, you will find that this and the next episode is unique, with great spiritual meanings. <br /> <br /> Like every episode of sopranos, acting and filming are great. <br /> <br /> The only thing I did not understand was the role of the monks. I will watch it until I get it. <br /> <br /> in any case, this episode really moved me and I do not think that anyone else could better understand what is happening in the almost death experience. <br /> <br /> 10/10 without a doubt.
