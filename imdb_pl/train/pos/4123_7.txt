Freedom to own a boat with the power of sea, the excitement flowing from the adventures of a raw man with an adventurer and charming (and so well equipped!) Assists in great Bikini were the definitive sales points of "SEA SEA" (1958-61). <br /> <br /> What was the reason for producing the "gun for rent" series *. Let's take a closer look now. There must be some hints. <br /> <br /> If only we looked back a bit, we will see the production of Radio Pictures UNDERWATER! (1955). It featured Jane Russell, Gilbert Roland, Richard Egan and Lori Nelson as a quartet of very attractive Scuba Diving Adventurers working on saving in the Caribbean, including Cuba Pre-Fidel. The film turned out to be moderately successful and did not forget about history as the appearance of swimsuit directors. Great, shapely Folk women in really interesting two-piece swimsuits (Woo, woo, woo, woo!) Are always a plus for the Guys; and the presence of rough, athletic men who present their best "beef" in the shape of beef is equally enjoyable for Gals. <br /> <br /> And there is one item that is the real legacy of this old RKO Feature. It is on the soundtrack between the music queues and themes. This is the recording of "It's Cherry Pink and Apple Blossom White," written by Louiguy and Jacques LaRue, performed by Damaso Pereza Prado and His Orchestra. <br /> <br /> Anyone who hears this Insturmental or Song (with the text) will soon forget about it. His Carribbean Beat is very lively, and his extensive use of the Brass Section of Orchestra is powerful and immediately gives the impression of immediate memory. The 45 RPM record of this song was in the top ten most popular songs of the week for many Saturday nights in "YOUR HIT PARADE" from NBC television. We do not remember how many weeks or how high it has been. (Maybe someone can fill us with this one item, please!) So we came back to "SEA HUNT" and our own odyssey to get to "the Tube". Public opinion approached the PODWODNA! Okay, but would they go to the TV series. <br /> <br /> ZIV TV Productions has gained a reputation for issuing products, most of which have not been registered by networks for multi-station addiction treatment. But they were very successful with Television Syndication. ** We mean offering the Series for the Station for shows on one TV station for each Market Area. (Like various newspaper syndicates, they sell comics to various documents around the country and even around the world. <br /> <br /> So we have Mike Nelson, Lloyd Bridges alone in the physical presence Mr Bridges was around 15 years old and appeared in several very memorable performances in most supporting and very different roles in several Boston Blackie films (with Chester Morris) for THEY STOOGE TO CONGA (3 Stooges 1943), SAHARA (also 1943), HOME OF THE BRAVE (1949) and THE WHISTLE AT EATON FALLS (1951). <br /> <br /> Lloyd brought a very convincing way to his characteristics, together with a beautiful, convincing athletic figure, looking like a guy who earns a living thanks to his physical abilities, he took very well as Diver, regardless of whether he performs duties aboard the ship or drunken seas. <br /> <br /> And Lloyd did take the role quickly, but contrary to many disinformation, he was not known to SCUBA *** before landing at Mike Nelson's concert. But Athletic Mr. Bridges proved to be a fast-paced student because many close-ups under water revealed that there was no doubt that it was Lloyd with a mask, a mummy (air tank) and fins. <br /> <br /> Stories almost always consisted of helping a client get paid, just like a private investigator. So what if the client was a charming lady who looked good in a swimsuit, the better. <br /> <br /> Like many other television productions of ZIV / UNITED ARTISTS, "SEA HUNT" had a fine, haunting opening and closing theme, along with original accidental music and queues. <br /> <br /> At some point, I believe that "SEA HUNT" was the most popular TV series that was known from the ZIV series such as "SCIENCE FICTION THEATER" and "HIGHWAY PATROL". As for the place of the show of this underwater saga, here in Chicago it was shown late at night (after 22:30) on WNBQ TV, Channel 5 (our NBC branch, now known as WMAQ TV). <br /> <br /> And I remember who was the original sponsor in this particular market. And there were even advertisements made by Gwiazda! How well we remember and visualize Lloyd as Mike Nelson riding his speedboat. And because we were invited to come back next week and watch "... the next adventure" SEA HUNT ", sponsored by the company G. Heileman Brewing Company of LaCrosse, Wisconsin" creators of Old Style Lager Beer! "While Mike looked after us, picking up a bottle of old style. (Be ashamed, Mike, you're drinking beer in your moving boat! We're talking Coast Guard!) Then the boat will leave the dock, accompanied by the sea hunting motif and roll the loans. <br /> <br /> NOTE: * More vividly than literally, Mike was for rent, and things worked very much like Deterctive Story. <br /> <br /> NOTE: ** The successes of the ZIV syndicate included "SCIENCE FICTION THEATER", "WEST POINT" (and its clone "MEN OF ANNAPOLIS"), "SEA HUNT" and "HIGHWAY PATROL". <br /> <br /> NOTE *** And of course SCUBA is an abbreviation of Self Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus.
