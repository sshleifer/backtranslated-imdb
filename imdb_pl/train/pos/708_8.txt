The movie is about the fall syndrome. The mother has twins, one is very sick, the other is good, but she has falls. Mother does not think she can bring him up, so she gives him to a few people who have 15 children, 11 have falls! mom does not like this and thinks he should be with his family (I also agree), so they take him to court, and the family is broken and the grandparents lose, never really say whether the makeup of mother and daughters? I think this movie is good, but the plot is familiar, it's still good and has some unintentional laughter!
