I just saw this movie in the preview and all I can say is ... "What did I watch?" "I mean it in a good and bad way. <br /> <br /> The plot is really simple. Stiller and Black are playing friends / neighbors. Stiller is focused, hard-working, while Black is a dreamer. Black invents this idea to create a spray that erases the pile. The idea becomes very popular, and Black becomes very rich. The extravagant lifestyle that Black draws, and the fact that he's still trying to be Stiller's best friend, makes Stiller mad with envy. <br /> <br /> As I said, the plot is simple. Everything else is strange. The direction is odd, with a strange rotating shot that opens to sequences of increased speed. Dialouge and acting are very strange; strange in a chaotic way. The soundtrack is the weirdest thing in the movie, from the weird "Envy" song, which still reappears in the scene where you think you'll hear the classic 80's song, but it will suddenly appear in Japanese. br /> So the real question is ... is it weird funny? It depends only on the individual. I was shattering about the steadfastness of this film. After the screening, I heard people call it terribly distasteful and are happy that it was free. Oddly enough, I understood their point of view. There are no jokes, so if you are not addicted to the uniqueness of all this, you will hate this movie. I absolutely hate him. <br /> <br /> This movie is designed to lose a lot of money at the box office and become an iconic DVD classic. If you can laugh at a movie without real jokes like Cable Guy or Punch Drunk Love, then I suggest that you see it. If not, run away from this movie. It will only drive you crazy.
