I think that it is so much affair / drama that has a nice ending and a generally pleasant feeling. This is not a Hallmark Hall of Fame family movie in which sleeping before marriage is considered "normal" behavior, but considering the stars Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro, I would expect a much worse film, at least in terms of language. <br /> <br /> The most memorable part of the movie is to show how difficult it is to learn to read and write when you are an adult. This is the theme of the film and includes several touching scenes, but to be honest, the film is not so memorable. <br /> <br /> It's still a pretty gentle, nice story that I would gladly recommend.
