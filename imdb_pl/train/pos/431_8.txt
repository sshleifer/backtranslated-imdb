It starts slowly, showing the grim life of two housewives who decide to rent a castle in Italy for the month of April, but do not give up. Nothing is happening, but time passes brilliantly, and there are many cunning jokes (my favorite is a ride in a storm which I consider to be fun). The film is wonderfully romantic in many respects of the word, the scenery is beautiful (just like Polly Walker), and the resolutions in the film are very satisfying. <br /> <br /> The movie has some freedoms from the book, the biggest being with the activity of Arbuthnot / Briggs / Dester, but I really preferred the version of this movie (it may be more sentimental, but I felt it was more consistent with the tone of the story, and besides, I like the sentiment when it is well done). <br /> <br /> An excellent movie, especially as a movie with a date during bad weather.
