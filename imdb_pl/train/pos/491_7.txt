Take 4 pairs, whose relationships were already on the rocks and place them on the paradise island, where they will be tempted by 26 singles. It was the premise of the show, simple but outrageous and funny. Leave it to Fox to let morality out of the window and let him dissolve. It was like the real version of Melrose Place. The good thing about the show is that it was not about people who connect and manipulate each other to get a cash reward. It was about lust and temptation, clean and simple, and the final test of the relationship. <br /> <br /> People either liked the show or hated it. It was a bit like slowing down to look at a terrible road accident. You know that you should not watch, but you can not look at it. Apart from the drama, there was a lot of sweetness.
