A young girl who survived as a prostitute. <br /> <br /> Cheap hustler, who wants to get the most points. <br /> <br /> They meet in Thailand. Perhaps you are thinking about the title opening the movie, that it will be a brutal movie, but it is also a story of love with two people in their own struggle to get money for a better way of life. This film sometimes seems an essay because of changes in images, but still refreshing. This story also applies to Eros and Thanatos. "This is not an original joke, but it is well said," says the character, and this also applies to this: we have seen the story, but in this way we see it. Thailand appears in hot tones, and the photo goes from one place to a colorful one. And it captures the city as a cage of these imperfect people. Music is also well used to touch the action.
