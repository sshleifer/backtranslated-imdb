Let's keep it simple: My two children were stuck to this film. It has its drawbacks from an adult perspective, but buy some jelly and just enjoy it. <br /> <br /> And Pepsi's girlfriend was perfect! <br /> <br /> And Kimberly Williams was quite deliciously hot, although she's not in the movie, so do not be too excited. <br /> <br /> No, this is a really bad thing, but it's a kind of movie that you watch only once. Do not buy a DVD. <br /> <br /> Enjoy! <br /> <br /> Did I mention Kimberly Williams? (It was for fathers.)
