My God. This movie really shows the talents of the actors. Billy Connelly flexes muscles. A really awesome man, if you look at him in Relief as a rebel, Saints Boondock as a madman / killer, and finally in Fido as a zombie! His character in Fido looks charming and frightening, absolutely fantastic! Cariie Ann Moss is not a hack either! Jumping in a career from Matrix and Momento as a darker figure, to a hearty housewife from the 1950s! Rarely do you see that actors can not be filled. <br /> <br /> Now in the story (No Spoilers, do not worry). This movie will make Max Brooks (author of the Zombie Survival Guide and World War Z Guide) happy with joy! Finally a well-made twist of zombies and comedy. <br /> <br /> If you like zombies, if you do not like zombies, if you are bored or too busy, go see this movie!
