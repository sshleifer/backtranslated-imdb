Year 2000 was a bad year for Indian films due to the lack of quality and imagination of film directors. Besides Mohabbatein and Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai, nothing stood out. CCCC had many contraindications for film financing, and due to the lack of knowledge about what the film is about, it caused good publicity and advanced sales of movie tickets in India and abroad. The only information was that it was a suspense thriller. The film was released in 2001, and the film was surprisingly good. The main story is related to surrogate motherhood and is treated well. Salman and Preiti give good results, in which Salman does not really take a T-shirt, there are no special effects at all! He hurts Salmans's wife, but it's a slightly less challenging role compared to Preiti, who plays a prostitute who eventually becomes a substitute mother. The three main tips confirm, after Har Di Jo Pyar Karega, that they have solid screen content and screen chemistry (apparently). Outstanding Salman Khan plays an important role in the film as a successful business man and it's a shame that he is being used as a would-be comedian in his other films because he is underestimated in the movie industry in Mumbai, partly because of the films he chooses. Rani does not know that Preiti is a prostitute to the end ... kept away from her and the rest of the family ... you should find out the rest because he will destroy the movie if I tell you. All songs are well-illustrated, especially the dekhne walon and the main cover song. The other supporting actors make a minimal but great effort as a loving Salmans family. Abbas Mastan produced the hit and tactfully coped with the theme of the film. I say: go and look at it or rent it as you like!
