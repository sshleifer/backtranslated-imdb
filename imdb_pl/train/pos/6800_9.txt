His performance, allowing him to show how he can react, if he discovers that everything he knew could be a lie, he was quite credible. <br /> <br /> Welling has great opportunity. <br /> <br /> As always, Michael Rosenbaum, as a "handicapped" Lex, provided, like Kristen Kreuk as too sweet Lana. Allison Mack, the ubiquitous Chloe, also included the off-rocker version. <br /> <br /> The use of annoying background noise added a ton of installment and was created for an immersive drama.
