Unlike another user who said this movie is useless (and that Olivia Hussey was horrible), I do not agree. <br /> <br /> This movie was amazing !!!!!! Olivia Hussey is amazing in everything she's in! Yes, she can be older now, because many remember her from Romeo and Juliet, but she is wonderful! <br /> <br /> This story can be used quite often, but it is a unique movie and I will fight anyone who disagrees! I liked this movie the same as any other Olivia Hussey movie. "My girlfriend" Olivia and I love her work. <br /> <br /> I saw it for the first time on Saturday (14/04/07) and I fell in love with it. Not only because it is Olivia's film, but because of the unique story and great direction.
