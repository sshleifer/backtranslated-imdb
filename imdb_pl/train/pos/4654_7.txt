It's about misappropriation, Peter Ustinov, who infiltrates the British company Texa-Conn or something like that, pretending to be an expert on computer thief and security. He secretly finds out how to break into the computer, at the same time gathering the admiration of his boss, Karl Malden, the hostility of his rival from the office, Bob Newhart, and the love of his inept secretary, Maggie Smith. <br /> <br /> Some business data has been a little confusing for these non-professional eyes, but they are reliable enough and I have a general idea. Ustinow, the peculiar Peter, assumes false interests in Paris, Rome and Stuttgart and uses the Texa-Conn computer to send all kinds of money to these institutions. Foreign companies, of course, consist exclusively of themselves, Ustinova, and addresses are the abandoned loft artist in Paris, a hairdresser in Rome and a bakery in Germany. He simply visits them to collect the checks he sent himself. <br /> <br /> I did not think I would like it for the first few minutes because it seemed rather slow. I was expecting something with a faster pace and greater indignation, like "The Pink Panther" or "The Lavender Hill Gang." But this film enters your favors when you appreciate discreet humor in the plot, characteristics and dialogue. <br /> <br /> It would probably be a bad idea to give away too many relatively subtle gags, but here are some more noticeable examples. <br /> <br /> Ustinov to Smith's secretary: "Let me have the fortune of these companies." Smith: "Assets? Ustinov: "Small female donkeys". Nothing is happening now with this small exchange. Fast laughter and no delay for any laughter, which is right, because the human reaction is more of a smile than a laugh. <br /> <br /> Ustinow is looking for this dark dovecote in Paris. It is covered with spider webs. Bricks are scattered and several images of the former occupant have been left behind. The owner does not speak English, and Ustinov does not speak French. Ustinov shows the childish picture of a naked woman and giggles: "Ah. The owner also laughs, says: "Vous le prenez pour une anee?" Ustinov: "Oh - ANNIE, that's her name!" Owner: "Oui?" Ustinov: "Entente cordiale!" (Mes amis, if I misunderstood these sexes , je m'excuse.) Bob Newhart as Willard Gnatpole (!) He has enchantments for Maggie Smith and should go home, but he tells her that he takes a "scenic route". There is an immediate sequence of suggestive road signs. "Attention." "Lay-By". "Give way to." "Efficiency." End with the imperious "STOP / CHILDREN". There is another assembly, when Ustinov's plan is to be discovered by the board - fuzzy roofs, patrol cars, Maggie's farewell hug, finished with the sign: Prison, Wormwood Scrubs. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe one more. I still can not defeat Malden as the boss, declaring decisively: "I never bother with decisions," and then I sip a handful of tablets and wash them with a glass of water. <br /> <br /> Acting is unquestionably good. For example, the best role of Bob Newhart. Not that he had so much, and not that his range was not limited, but he is perfect in this part. Laurie Johnson's musical score obviously had a lot of effort. It seems that she wrote a short concert on the flute. Ustinov's passion is music, and his foreign establishments are directed by fake names such as Claude Debussy and Giacconino Rossini. The crafty president of Stuttgart is someone named Schmidt, and he is an anomalous clinker. Maggi Smith is pretty, sexy, bourgeois and it turns out that she is not as stupid as it seems. <br /> <br /> Gorgeous, in your own quiet way, but do not expect comic fireworks.
