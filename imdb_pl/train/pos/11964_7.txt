In the afternoon I went to the cinema, expecting to be disappointed by Scoop. Fortunately, the film exceeded expectations, at least a bit. It's nothing heavy, nothing deep - or anywhere as good as any number of Allen's real masterpieces - but it's also quite pleasant as a light, joking comedy. There is something simple and sweet in it. "Cute" was a word that I heard from people in the audience when they left after the concert. I do not think that Allen decided to create a masterpiece, as if he wanted to make a small comedy and have fun. Compared to almost everything Hollywood produces, Allen's things tend to be spellbinding. Even fluffy things. Nowadays it is simply a refreshing follow-up to a movie created by a real man.
