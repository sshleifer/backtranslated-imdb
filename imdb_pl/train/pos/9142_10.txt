Purple Rain ... what else can I say, the title speaks for itself. But I think all the actors were well matched. The film had a great story. I love it! Ever since I watched this movie, I was stuck in the eighties, and I'm only 13 years old! My favorite part of the movie was when his father died, and he collected all his musical compositions, and Apollonia was sitting in the stairwell with a hand in his hand. Critics say it's a drama, but I think it's more of an affair. Murphy Brown also did a great job in the movie, he really acted like himself. I'm glad I saw this movie. The song Purple Rain, beautifully sung, was so cordial. I cried more than once.
