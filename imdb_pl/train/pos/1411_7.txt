Greetings from the dark again. Stunning photography highlights this Disney documentary and gives an insight into the harshness of animals living in the desert. For anyone who is over 40, Disney and Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom have provided us with a lot of information about wild animals from childhood ... when there was no National Geographic or Nature or Animal Planet channel. <br /> <br /> What is always fascinating is how difficult the circumstances are for many of these majestic creatures. Watching elephants wading for a few days, almost delirious for lack of water, is so painful. But their night battle with lions is exciting. <br /> <br /> Some underwater shots are breathless. Mum and baby humpback whales are beautiful and watching a white shark attack, his prey is as cool as "Jaws". The most amazing scenery for me were the breathtaking views of the Himalayas. I have never seen such a detail about the magnitude of this range. <br /> <br /> Do not think that most young children will be too excited today, but it is certainly one of the most beautifully photographed movies that I have ever seen.
