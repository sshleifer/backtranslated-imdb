I think that when "Beat Street" appeared on the national scene, "Flashdance" appeared at the same time. The problem with Flashdance is that there was only one break dance scene, and the rest is jazz dance and ballet. That was one of the reasons why "Beat Street" was better. The only movie that could compete with "Beat Street" seems to be "Footloose" because both films focused on how people used dance to express their highest feelings. <br /> <br /> Break-dance scenes in "Defeat Street" come just before the middle and at the end of the movement. And I loved them all. Almost all the tricks with breaks appeared in the stages with breaks: pneumatic hammer, flares, head rotation, suicide, crazy legs, mortal, forward cue, fourth figure - almost everything. /> <br /> Like "The Warriors", "Beat Street" has violence related to gang life in the hip hop world ... but in a much less brutal way than the previous one. The only serious scene in the Beat Street fight was when the graffiti artist Ramon (who was shortened as "Ramo" in the film) is being hunted by a competitive gang member on the New York subway tracks ... fighting the third rail and both die due to electric shock on this turn. Well, although this chase scene ended tragically, it's better that they died in this way than if the blood exploded from the gang shot. <br /> <br /> Most of the things gangs in the movie are graffiti related to hip-hop culture and rap music. There was a lot of rap music in rap, because hip-hop members used rap music to reverse the negative aspects of gang life. Even the thematic song of the film, which closed the curtain, was not just a tribute to hip-hop culture - it was also a tribute to Ramon's death. <br /> <br /> By the way, during the dance stage "Tango, Tango", probably the drummer from the orchestra pit led by actress Rae Dawn Chong was Sheila E. appearing in the episode.
