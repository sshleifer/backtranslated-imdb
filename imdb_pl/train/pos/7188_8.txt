Along with the "King of the Rocket Men", it was still repeated on the BBC television from the beginning until the mid-eighties. If I were to load the time capsule of this period, both series will certainly come. <br /> <br /> Someone who watches it for the first time will think it's stupid, but this is one of the best examples of "Serial". Don Del Oro will make you laugh (when I was a little nickname for him, it was Mr. Dustbin head) and it was funny when he was shot, says: "Your balls can not hurt me" and then stumbles, seemingly less than happy. I also like the way he gave up Sebastian in the first episode. <br /> <br /> I watched it again, because I had good memories of years back, there are good acrobatics and good music, I have ingredients for expecting water, rockfalls, runaway carts ... Apart from the first episode (with Ralph Faulkner) fencing she was not nearly as good as I remembered her, and yes, it's an inseparable "flashback" episode! He gets 8 out of 10 because he still suffers from slow pace, padding and other tricks. If you are interested in these series, I recommend William Witney's book "In the door, in the fight, in the door, in the pursuit", although there is only a small entry about this series.
