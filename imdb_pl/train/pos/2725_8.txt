"In Cold Blood", adapted by Richard Brooks from the famous novel Truman Capote, deals with the brutal and senseless murder of a family of four by a few unfortunate criminals. The film stands out as a study of the characters of the killers, in particular the trigger of Perry Smith (Robert Blake). <br /> <br /> The cast contains several recognizable names, but still bring history to life with ease. Robert Blake and Scott Wilson are great together as two criminals with different personalities. They play with each other effortlessly, while Blake also has many opportunities to discover the idiosyncrasies of his character. The rest of the cast is mediocre and not worth attention. <br /> <br /> Richard Brooks received Oscar nominations for both screenplay and direction. In my opinion, both were excellent, although the scenario is badly recalculated with some ill-advised narrative in the late stages. The Oscar-nominated photos of Conrad Hall are also top-notch, just like the montage. It is also worth paying attention to the jazz result of Quincy Jones, who provided the last of four Oscar nominations in the film. <br /> <br /> Unlike many other crime movies, this movie does not impress with violence. Brooks turns assassins into pathetic characters, and he does not condemn them. Regardless of whether you agree with this sentiment, the film is an interesting alternative to the usual Hollywood approach. For this reason, I recommend a film, as well as professional knowledge, which are related to technical aspects.
