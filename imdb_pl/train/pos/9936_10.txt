It was one of my favorite series when I was a kid. The Swedish broadcasting company decided to re-broadcast it a few years ago when I had just finished the first semester of the medical school. I was surprised to see the depth of explaining the organs. Sure, some things are simplified, but most of them were correct (even though it was done 22 years ago!) And quite understandable. I would suggest that all future medical students look at it. This is a very good way to learn some of the basic medical words, for example. Now I am in the seventh semester and I think I will watch the series once more, as soon as I buy a DVD :-)
