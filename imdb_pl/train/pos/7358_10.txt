One of the most provocative movies with excellent photos supported by secretary McKenns and a stunning quote "do you believe in love on the front page?". <br /> <br /> In this picture, there was a trace of expressionism, further Catapulting films without complaint. Gabby (AKA Joey) played by Eva Longoria clearly adored the film and the role she played so much that she could not even be disturbed by her memory in her filmography. Lol. <br /> <br /> the best part of the film would have to be undoubtedly, a heroic rescue by the MC cluster, who saved the young "handicapped" child with a speech disorder. it worked perfectly! The use of the sound effects of James Cahiil is unmatched even to this day. The bust of drugs he performs at the beginning of the film is a realistic pain. When I first saw the movie, I was so enslaved by the intense disrespect for the brothers Gang Inthused from Southside gang and CTM (Cut Throat Mafia). It was one of the most encapsulating gaps Cahill devoted to filming. <br /> <br /> Personally, this movie has a sentimental value for me and I will download it in the near future. That is, if I can find it anywhere, LOL!
