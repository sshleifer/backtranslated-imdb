Usually I do not like Emma Roberts so much, but after watching Nancy Drew it changed my mind a bit. Actors in the movies made the whole thing exciting and fun. Most of the time, when you watch a mysterious movie, you can solve it before the end of the show, but in this movie it's like you're there. The tips must match each other until you finally understand the whole crime. I'm still amazed how she discovered it. The whole movie was really clever, and people who watched it with me also loved the movie. Clothes were my favorite part of the movie, they were so sweet. I do not think there will be such a movie until the sequel comes out. I give him a nine, because popular girls really do not seem to be right, but they still make me laugh. It was a really great movie and a great secret. I definitely recommend watching.
