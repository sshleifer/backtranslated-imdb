12. Disney's animated classic is a sensible film telling a simple story. Although it is a bit outdated, it deserves a place on the Disney classic list. <br /> <br /> Not one of Disney's best works, but it's satisfying. One of the most "simple" works of Disney, yes, but it retains a certain magic and charm (from which old Disney is known). It was an important movie because it saved Disney from a delicate situation. If it was a defeat, there would no longer be Disney's classics. <br /> <br /> "Cinderella" is like returning to the first animated Disney movie ("Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"), because it brings back the fairy-tale genre. It is not clear where this story is going, but I suppose it is somewhere in France because it is based on the story of Charles Perrault. <br /> <br /> There are many nice characters, such as Cinderella, Prince, Bruno (dog), Jaques and Gus (two main mice), Fairy Godmother (for some fairies it is fun), birds, King and Grand Duke. <br /> <br /> Jaques is very smart and fun. I love his voice. It really has a quality similar to a mouse. Gus may not be so smart, but he's funny. <br /> <br /> The king is hilarious, but I think what makes him so funny is his temperament. Grand Duke is very cool and funny. They are two of my favorite characters in this film and are responsible for many of the most fun moments. <br /> <br /> The prince is certainly one of the most enchanting in Disney. No doubt, Prince Philip of "The Sleeping Beauty" was inspired by this prince, because they look very similar. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Lady Tremaine (stepmother) should not be sympathetic because she is cold, jealous, bitter and cruel. Her daughters (Anastacia and Drizella) are not much better than her. However, the stepmother is not as annoying as her ugly and selfish daughters. Cinderella, the main character, has nothing to do with them. Cinderella is gentle, nice, nice and nice. By the way, I think that her beautiful pink dress is much nicer than the one provided by the Fairy Godmother. <br /> <br /> Lucifer (cat) is fun to be malicious. The way he goes, putting his nose into the air and those arrogant and snobbish facial expressions make him funny. Ironically, he is very much like a stepmother when it comes to personality. She always agrees with her stepmother's attitude towards Cinderella. Lucifer has the right name for him because he is such a devilish and mean cat. However, there is nothing annoying in it. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is simple but pleasant, although it is not one of the best Disney. The best song in this movie is "Bibiddi Bobiddi Boo". <br /> <br /> There are many well-known talented voice actors such as James MacDonald, Marion Darlington, Eleanor Audley, Verna Felton and Luis Van Rooten. <br /> <br /> Despite the simple look, the film has good works of art, as well as nice details, although it is never something "out of the world." The royal palace, however, is a spectacular masterpiece, majestic and colossal.
