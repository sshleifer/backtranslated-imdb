"Magic" is not a very strong word for the spell that this movie splits. You relax and see others in a friendly light ... Any movie in which a civilizing impact on viewers deserves serious attention. We are rarely soaked with beauty. If that was not enough, it was fun. The performances are exceptional without exception, but you should mention the wonderful Miranda Richardson and the great Josie Walker - both open like roses. <br /> <br /> Why is not this movie on DVD? He deserves eternal life.
