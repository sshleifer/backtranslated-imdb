If it is to be a portrait of an American serial killer, it turns out that it is definitely average. <br /> <br /> A journalist [Duchovny] travels to California to document America's most famous murderers, unaware that his white trash trailer accompanies the journey [Pitt] is a serial killer. <br /> <br /> Rather predictable all the time, it has its own moments of action, and Pitt and Lewis are good at portraying their roles, but I would not bother about it again.
