Directed by the duo Yudai Yamaguchi (Battlefield Baseball) and Jun'ichi Yamamoto "Meatball Machine" is apparently a remake of the movie Yamamoto from 1999 with the same name. I doubt if I will ever see the original, so I will just comment on this one. First of all, what is the "Meatball Machine"? A simple, yet pretentious, low-budget industrial splatter full of great makeup and gore effects. It's not something you write about, but it's still fun if you dig up this type of cinema. <br /> <br /> "Meatball Machine" follows a well-known plot. The boy loves a girl but is afraid to ask her about a date. The boy finally meets a girl. The girl is infected by a parasitic alien being who turns her into a murderous cyborg. The boy, in turn, transforms himself into the thing he is about and sets off in search of saving his love. Will it succeed? Whoever is damn, if it's slaughter and death, I'm happy. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple, relatively clich√©d, but it does it well, setting the course of the film straight into a bloody confrontation between the two leading characters. There is a subplot focusing on how the parasite that infected the girl came to their lives. And, fortunately, it shows more violence. I'm happy. Acting is what you can expect from a seamless splatter movie. It is not painful for the ears, but it is also not good. <br /> <br /> The main attraction of the film, apart from violence and gore (as I have not already mentioned) are the cyborg projects. Done by Keita Amemiya, who's working on creating bizarre creatures and costumes for both movies and video games. Nekrobordzi, as they are called in the "Meatball Machine", they look stunning in detail. Without the use of CGI projects, Amemiya is a breathtaking combination of body and metal, painfully amazing in their appearance. Capable of transforming different parts of the body into cool weapons, such as saws, rocket launchers, blood-shooting guns, and so on. Although it is easy to recognize the cheapness of this movie, necroborgami are A-movie class. <br /> <br /> "Meatball Machine" is "Tetsuo The Iron Man" mixed with "Alien" all in a low budget and additionally ketchup mode. This is an extremely entertaining film that does not include contemporary special effects and proves that the species of splashes still lives and copies.
