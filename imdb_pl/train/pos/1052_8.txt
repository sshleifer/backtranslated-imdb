An extraordinary document about the breakthrough achievements of the Women's Lawyers Association (WLA) in Kumba, in southwestern Cameroon, in the legal protection of women's and children's rights against acts of domestic violence. In this Muslim culture, where men have always been sovereign towards women, according to the Sharia law, one can imagine the difficulty of imposing secular rights on women and children. After 17 years of unsuccessful efforts, WLA leaders have recently begun winning several victories, and the goal of the film is to share the winning stories. <br /> <br /> The leaders of this reform movement are Vera Ngassa, prosecutor and Beatrice Ntuba, senior judge (president of the court). They both play in this film, which may contain spontaneous footage, although I can imagine that many of them, if not all of them, consist of subsequent replays of real events for the camera. Four cases are reviewed, and all plaintiffs also play in the film. <br /> <br /> Two things involve repeated beatings of a wife, with forced sex in one case; the other is forced sex with a 10-year-old girl; and another concerns the repeated beating of a child at the age of 8 by his aunt. One of the beaten wives is also looking for a divorce. We follow cases from examining complaints to test results. The results in each case are beneficial for women and children. The perpetrators receive severe prison sentences and / or fines; divorce is granted. <br /> <br /> The aggressive prosecution of the aunt who beat the child shows that these criminal justice officials are genuinely gender neutral when it comes to law enforcement. Noteworthy is also the respect with which all parties are treated, including persons found guilty. This is a very important and well made film. (Interestingly, one of the directors, Mrs. Longinotto, also co-directed a 1998 film, Divorce, an Iranian style that dealt with related topics in Tehran.) (Broken English with English subtitles).
