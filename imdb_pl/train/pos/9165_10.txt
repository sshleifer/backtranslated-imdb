It must be the best adaptation I've seen, it's my favorite and I think it remains very close to the book. What really makes you see it is the cast of two main actors. Wonderful Timothy Dalton is the best Rochester and I saw meditation and tragedy on screen, while Zelah Clarke is a perfect combination of strength, courage, shyness and gentleness as Jane. The story (as I'm sure most people know) is that young and simple Jane Eyre is a teacher at a girls' charity school in 1800 who advertises her services as a governess in the newspapers. a governess at Thornfield Hall's grand residence to teach Adele a young lady in the corridors of the mysterious and respected owner, Mr. Rochester. As the months go by, she falls in love with Jane and implements a few situations to see if Jane is so madly in love with him as she is with her. However, there is still a secret in Thornfield Hall and when it happens, the effects are devastating. It is a moving and well-played drama with nice places and great costumes plus, as I said before, great acting, especially from Zelah and Timothy.
