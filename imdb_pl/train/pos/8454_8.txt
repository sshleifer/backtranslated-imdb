The second alternative story about the Gundam universe (G-Gundam as the first), Gundam Wing is another different view of the Gundam verse. Known elements are found, but the Gundam Wing is actually different than its counterparts. The biggest of them, Gundams, are nothing but terrorists fighting against one solitary organization. In fact, the series is not really a war series up to episode 7, but actually a real conflict, Eve Wars, does not happen until later episodes. <br /> <br /> The biggest positives of this series are the characters. All the main characters are developed throughout the episode 49 episodes and you can really feel for each of their roles. Another great plus is the fantastic character and the mech design of the series. The designs made some of his other counterparts in Gundam ashamed. <br /> <br /> One of the biggest critics of this series is how many die-hard UC fans say they break with the original UC saga. Why Gundam Wing gets this rap when the more visible UC clone Gundam Seed is beyond me. It is true that many moments have been abolished, but their stories are in new ways and there are also clear differences. <br /> <br /> Let's take an ordinary comparison of Zechs Merquise and UC Icon Char Aznable. In the whole series, Zechs is more an outcast in the Alliance and in the OZ way, and the Red Comet shines with the Zeon symbol. Another big difference is the fact that Zechs loses a lot of soldiers under his command, hence a different pseudonym, which he gave in the early episodes: "Killer of their own people". Char does not have this label. <br /> <br /> Problems with this series are not a mumbo jumbo philosophy, but two problems. The first of these is the re-used animation from the Gundam attacks. It's probably cool to see the heavy arms attacking tanks, MS and airplanes the first time. But on the fourth re-use scene like this, they get old. <br /> <br /> The second problem is that the whole series is to take place throughout the year. If you really think about all the events in the series, a lot happens in one year. <br /> <br /> But I think you can easily reject this fact by ignoring the first lines of the intro so often. In the ranking, this is probably the best of the Gundam stories about the alternative universe and a great introduction to the world of Gundam. In the end, it was the first Gundam anime on American television.
