My three-year French lessons have always been very popular with this film. In a multicultural high school in the city, the film contained many topics for discussion (French in class, but I know that many discussions were in English after classes). The most obvious is the relationship between Protée and Aimée compared to the relationship between Protée and France. <br /> <br /> I've always mentioned that I felt that this movie has one of the "sexiest" scenes I've ever seen in a movie. One year, a 17-year-old African-American man shouted "Yes!" When he discovered the scene: the one in which Protée helps Aimée to lace her evening gown while both examine the reflection of the other in the mirror. Directors use the "mirror technique" when they want to focus on the internal conflict on the part of one or more characters in the scene: it is a perfect example of technique and is "sexy". <br /> <br /> Most students had problems understanding the end of the movie. One suggested that one of the themes of the movie is "Africanism" and that no matter how much Africa or Africans were loved, you can not become African (as the driver tried): you have to be an African.
