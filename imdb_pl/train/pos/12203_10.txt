"The Lady From Shanghai" by Orson Welles does not have the genius "Citizen Kane" scenario, eg Charles Lawton's Cinema, Jr., unforgettable scenes (such as the scene in the aquarium, the seafront scene with stunning Rita Hayworth with blonde hair, singing "Please Don 't Love Me' and the truly amazing climax of the Hall of Mirrors), and a wonderful cast (Everett Sloane in his biggest performance, Welles in a beautifully played role, the previously mentioned Miss Hayworth - wife of Welles at that time) - in her most beautiful form filming is an unforgettable experience.The bizarre plot of murder is fun and convincing, it is not impenetrable at all, the viewer is surprised by turns and corners, and Welles's closing line is an impeccable classic. "The Lady From Shanghai" gets four stars from this impartial arbitrator.
