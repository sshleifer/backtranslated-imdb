I have never seen a silent movie until July 24, 2005. I never saw a movie with Mary Pickford in it. I've seen thousands of movies. There is very little hypnotic for me. I think that Last of the Mohicans and Unforgettable (Ray Liotta) are hypnotic, so take it into account when reading. I started watching Tess of the Storm Country on TCM just to see who Mary Pickford is, which has been recognized by many as the introduction of Hollywood. I had no idea what I was getting into. Two hours later, I broke out of him and realized that I was watching one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen playing a role that suits her perfectly. Imagine a movie fan in 1922, who has never seen anyone so great and expressive. You would have to see her again and again. The setting was perfect for the girl who expressed herself. She was a poor squatter, she could not speak the king in English, but you had to admire her. What a movie ... it's time to start a Mary Pickford movie collection!
