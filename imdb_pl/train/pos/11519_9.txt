The only reason I did not give this 10 stars was the DVD format - no menus, add-ons, etc. However, if you've ever dreamed of doing something with your life, this movie is for you. If you believe in yourself and your dream, do not let anyone or anything stop you. This is one of the most life-affirming films I've ever seen. And magical. Acting is great, the story serves, and the opening sequence is fantastic. This is one of those films in which the status was "cult". I recommend this movie to all my friends. Some people love it, others can not finish it. Whenever I think or feel that something is impossible, I think about the role of Alan Arkin in this film. Sure, he would like to do more films.
