I had the honor of watching "Holly" at the Edinburgh Film Festival last week. What a powerful and moving story! Holly is a 12-year-old Vietnamese, who is sold to prostitution by her own family and lives in a brothel in Cambodia. Patrick (American) enters Holly and decides he wants to help her. When Holly is sold again, Patrick desperately looks for her. We follow a difficult journey through Cambodia and hope to meet them again. <br /> <br /> Holly is one of the millions of children who are sold and sold every day. The film presents this difficult problem without crossing the line. I left to find out more about the problem of child trafficking and ask how can I help? This film should be watched by everyone because it is a beautiful story and reveals a problem that we should no longer ignore.
