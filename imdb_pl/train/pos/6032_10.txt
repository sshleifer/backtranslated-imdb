Antonioni really showed "cojones" when he made this film. He went to America, working under a contract with the richest studio (MGM) and created the most accursed portrait of American society I have ever seen. Seeing LA first-hand, this is the most accurate picture of a crowded, overheated and impersonal city. If only Antonioni met Bill Hicks ... <br /> <br /> Later burial in the studio is understandable, after such a huge investment and a gloomy return. It's sad that people can not see this movie anymore because I believe that Antonioni was right. Here, the end of the hippies / civil rights movement in American politics is foreseen. Everyone is more interested in what goes into their pockets and the constant expansion of their living space into an inhospitable (though beautiful) desert and beyond. How much would I like to get interested in this movie again and release a rich DVD. <br /> <br /> I am begging people to watch Zabriskie Point with an open mind and an open heart. We have a truly unique film commenting on the turning point in the history of the most powerful nation in the world and we forgot about it. <br /> <br /> An unexpected gem.
