This interesting documentary tells an amazing story about an expedition in which blind Tibetan children wander the Himalayas; but also the clash of personality between two extraordinary people. On the one hand, Erik Weihenmeyer, the first blind who climbs Everest, and a team of (sighted) mountaineers who lead the children. On the other hand, there is Sabriye Tenberken, a blind woman who runs the first school for blind Tibetans who agrees to the expedition but later has doubts about her progress. At a certain level, Sabine simply does not understand the climber's philosophy (with emphasis on topping); she is probably right in recognizing the discrepancy between the alpinists' goals and the desires of the children, but her confidence in her own correctness makes her a difficult person to sympathize, especially since she has an effective veto. In the background of this (fairly well-mannered) clash, we have an insight into the lives of the children themselves. I liked the movie, although it provides a message that is clearly designed to lift the spirits - although this is the details of the argument, the film somewhat relentlessly confirms how amazing all those who participate in it are. However, it is difficult to argue with this assessment, even if it is presented to the viewer somewhat incorrectly.
