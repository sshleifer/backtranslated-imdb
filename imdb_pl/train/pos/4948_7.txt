It is a superbly made, simplified movie that explores the subject and gives each viewer something else that takes it. The assumption is simple: nameless star actor (Morgan Freeman) decides to investigate the upcoming role, visiting the store and watching people. He is particularly interested in the cashier on the belt "10 items or less" (Paz Vega), who finds a nice, strong and interesting presence. <br /> <br /> Both actors are playing great and bring a solid dimension to the characters in the character's examination. Not a conventional character examination; everyone represents entire worlds. The life of the cashier is immersed in a harsh and frustrating "real world", while the actor is so entangled in his fantasy that he can not perform simple tasks such as remembering phone numbers. He gladly admits that he faces when he talks with people, and the whole point of researching real people shows that he is not one of them. <br /> <br /> But the actor is not only inspired by real people to work; we also see the reverse process. Several characters recognize "Go" and refer to how he inspired them with his film roles. <br /> <br /> Favorite cashier's song "Al Pasar la Barca" about how a girl refuses to hide behind beauty and she prefers to pay (ie do a fair job) for a ship, it was not possible to choose it better. This is parallel with the figure of Vega, the only store employee with all the minds or ambitions who wants to work hard to succeed. (It's quite ambitious, for someone who looks like Paz Vega.) It's a strange little movie, probably made on a string. If you do not mind free stimulation and a "talkative" approach, this movie will be fun. Characters are perfectly contrasted, and effective action makes them captivating. Nice watch.
