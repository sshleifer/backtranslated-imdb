Watching this movie again brought great memories from childhood. I am now 34 years old, I have not seen this since I was 12-14 years old. I almost forgot about this movie, but when I watched it recently, some scenes literally brought a tear to my eyes! This little robot "Jinx" (friends forever!). It was like a return to my childhood. It was an absolutely amazing experience for me. For this reason, I will always cultivate this film. I hope that some of you readers can refer to my experience, not to this particular movie, but to any movie you have not seen for a long time. Bardzo nostalgiczny ... <br /> <br /> -Thank you for reading
