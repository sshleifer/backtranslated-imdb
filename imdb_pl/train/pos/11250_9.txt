After watching the A Perfect Spy mini series in one fell swoop, you can not do anything else but take off your hat - a clean masterpiece, which in comparison with another Le Carré minis about Smiley has completely different characteristics. <br /> <br /> In the ministry about Smiley, Alex Guiness, as Smiley, steals the show - the rest of the actors only support him, you can say. <br /> <br /> Here is an important team and history, just like the main actor, greatly played by Peter Egan in the last episodes, is not charismatic at all. <br /> <br /> Egan just plays a guy named Magnus Pym who, through lying, cunning and telling people what they like to hear, is very liked by everyone, big and small. The only one who seems to understand his inner self is Alex, his Czech guide. <br /> <br /> There is never a better word for a spy and / or traitor! After following his life from an early age, we fully understand what makes him a traitor. His ability to lie and falsify everything makes him a "perfect spy," as his Czech guide calls him. <br /> <br /> And, following his life, we fully understand how difficult it is to return to the straight and narrow path once you get off. It goes on even if it never gets anything economical out of it, with the exception of promotion from MI5 espionage masters. Everyone is happy as long as the flow of false information continues! <br /> <br /> Magnus' father, played splendidly by Ray McAnally, is not a good confrere who always dreams of making plans to get people out of their money. In later years his son must save him. But on the example of his father and uncle, who takes over, when his father goes to jail and his mother is sent to asylum, Magnus quickly learns that lying is a way of survival, not telling the truth. At the beginning, he exaggerates a little, but he will quickly learn to tell the right lies and be constant, without changing the stories from time to time, which he tells to those who want to listen to themselves and dad. <br /> <br /> His Czech handler Alex, professionally played by Rüdiger Weigang, creates, with the help of Magnus, a network of non-existent informers that provides British MI5 with false information over the years and years, just like the British did with the German spies who acted in Britain, before and during the war, they sent false information to Das Vaterland long after the agents themselves were reversed, liquidated or simply replaced by MI5 men. <br /> <br /> young boys who play Magnus in their younger years, they do it wonderfully, and most of them are more charismatic than older, a little more cynical and tired, Pym, played by Egan. But you can easily buy the difference, because it often changes through life, from enthusiasm to sadness or indifference. <br /> <br /> Really worth the money!
