I saw this movie when I was a little girl. And I liked it every time. Of course, the graphics are a bit cheesy compared to now, but in the 70's it was great. I only saw it in the original Spanish version and thought it was wonderful. In this way, I remember that my holidays were with my family - magical. Santa was amazing and I could not wait to come back every year. <br /> <br /> If you have a child / children and speak Spanish, bring them by watching the old-fashioned version of Santa Claus. It's a different version than the one we're used to today, but who says there's one way? <br /> <br /> It's a nice movie to watch. He teaches good and bad children. I do not know how the English version is with subtitles or if there is an English version, but Spanish is the best. Enjoy and Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
