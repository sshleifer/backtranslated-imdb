This is a video "straight on video", so I should say that it will not compete with the first Lion King, but it said it was pretty good. <br /> <br /> My children loved it, but it is given, they love everything that is cartoon. The big shock was that * I liked it too, laughing loudly from some parts (even fart jokes *), I had a lot of rather creative connections to the first movie, and even some jokes you had to be older to understand (but not being risky as in Shrek ["do you think he compensates?")). <br /> <br /> Special note about fart jokes, I was surprised that none of the jokes were just noises in the toilet (in fact there were almost no sounds / images, the testimonials were actually rather subtle), actually they had settings / punchline / etc and they were almost in good taste. I would like my children to think that humor is more than going to the bathroom, and this movie is okay in these aspects. <br /> <br /> Hmm what else? The music was so-so, not as creative as in the first or second film, but lots of fun for children. No painful moments, which was a blessing for me. A little action, but nothing terrible (The secret of NIMH gave my children nightmares, I'm not sure if the rating of G was right for this ...) <br /> <br /> In total, I would say that this is a great movie for children of all ages which is 100% safe to let them watch (I try not to be too sensitive, but I had to jump and turn off the TV during a few movies that were less suitable for children than expected) - but you can safely get out of this room. I would say that I am sticking to it anyway, it may turn out that you like it :)
