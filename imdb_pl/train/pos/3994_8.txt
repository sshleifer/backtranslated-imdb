I went to this movie only because I was drawn in and I would leave immediately because the audience consisted mostly of older people and I felt out of place. The film, however, was completely fascinating and was not aimed at the elderly. All characters were very real and reliable, and for many hours I discussed the film, characters and story. There are some pretty engaging scenes, but they are necessary and will help you better understand the situation. In summary, it's a great and valuable movie - a bit out of the mainstream, but that does not mean that this movie can not be viewed by people who prefer mainstream. It's an exciting and interesting movie experience.
