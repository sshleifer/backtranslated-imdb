I like this presentation - I read Bleak House and I know it's so difficult to present the whole book, which should be, and even others, such as Little Dorrit - I must admit that they made a very good concert with Nicholas Nickelby staged. I love Diana Rigg and I've seen Lady Dedlock's pain, even through the arrogance of the aristocracy. I'm sorry, I think she's the best Lady Dedlock ... I'm not sure who could do better Jarndyce, but I'm fine with Mr. Elliott. It is not easy to present these long Dickens books - Oliver Twist would be easier - it is long, and if you do not care about everything, the legal situation may be bleak or boring. I think this presentation is fun enough not to be boring. I loved Mr. Smallweed - it can be fun. There is always a child - Jo will break your heart ... I think we should have a chance to judge herself ... <br /> <br /> I must say that I loved this program. Maybe if I read the book again, as usual, after watching the movie, maybe I'll be more critical. Meanwhile - I think it's a good presentation.
