The origin of bears and their cousins. If you see the original movie, you'll notice a discrepancy. Cousins ​​are raised with care bears and do not meet them later. I have no problem with this, I prefer to treat films as separate interpretations. Infants are cute and it's great to watch them play and grow. My favorite is Swift Heart Rabbit. The villain is a charmingly dangerous shapeshifter. I could empathize with three children because I have never been good at sport. Cree Summer is perfect as Christy. The songs are sweet and unforgettable. If you have an open heart, you love toys or you like the original, you can not miss it. 9/10
