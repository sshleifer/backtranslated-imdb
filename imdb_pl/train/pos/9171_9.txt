I'm lover Jane Eyre and a purist, and this version contains almost all the important details of the book, and the characters are presented as I imagined. Jane Eyre is a complex story of great wealth and can not be delivered properly in full-length format, so she needs a mini-series. Timothy's Dalton Rochester is probably the best in history. There were many discussions about his attractiveness and age. In the book, Jane (narrator) describes him as "about 35", not young, but not yet middle-aged. I think Timothy Dalton was around 38 when he did it, so it's good. In addition, we only have Jane's opinion if Rochester is handsome. She just met him and asks her bluntly what she thinks. As an inexperienced and modest girl, I can not imagine that she would say that she considered him handsome. The actor playing in Rochester must show us the character of this man, and this works to perfection. I love the relationship between these two tracks, which is crucial in this story and the humor of their meetings. Other versions have destroyed it, but it's good. The 2006 version of Toby Stephens (aged 37) is in progress on BBC1 and is very good indeed, so I will decide if this is my favorite when it is completed. <br /> <br /> After revising this series after watching the 2006 version, I decided that this version from Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clark is the best! Charlotte Bronte's dialogue is preserved, and this is essential to the power of history. Modernization simply does not work - it's Victorian history and archaic poetic speech fits the character. This version has an excellent cast - Zelah Clark is tiny, and the difference in height between her and Rochester is important; Timothy Dalton has a real presence and is an amazing actor. There are no additional scenes that could redirect from the story, and the script contains all the important scenes, but skips unnecessary details, reaching the point and grabbing. I recommend it to all true Jane Eyre fans.
