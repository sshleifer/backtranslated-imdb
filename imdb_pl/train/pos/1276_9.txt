I love this movie. Noir images combined with the pointless character Spillane Mike Hammer wonderfully create a mood and atmosphere rarely seen in low-budget detective films from the 1950s. It may not be "The Maltese Falcon", but this movie makes it have its own solid contribution to this genre. Spillane is often criticized for alleged misogyny, etc., but his "ladies" are much better than male counterparts in terms of cunning and intelligence. Poor old Mike Hammer, how effectively Biff Elliott plays, is blinded by the beauty of a mysterious psychiatrist whom he encounters while investigating the death of a buddy from the army. When the penny finally drops his face, it's a photo. It's good to see that the censorship of the 1950s did not force filmmakers to miss the famous last line. A real low-budget classic.
