I know that many people do not like this movie, but I think it is charming. I can not say much, but this movie is probably a good movie. The songs are beautiful, the costumes are beautiful, the voices are beautiful and there are many fun lines in the film, especially since Briggitta is learning about society and not. If you like musicals, I'd say you like this one!
