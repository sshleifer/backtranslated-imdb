This movie is not great, but it is good and enjoyable. It feels like an independent film made from a script. Morgan Freeman basically plays alone, although the director swears that the script was not written for him. And there is little irony that an actor who goes to the supermarket to do research for a film that he has not yet committed. I mean, he finally made the movie and watched it. <br /> <br /> I found this dialogue a bit too positive for my taste, but still refreshing. It is a film that inspires the viewer to look at his own life and choose the direction in which to go. A little too much emphasis on the look, if you ask me about it. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: a nice little film, made in two weeks, with two actors and a few additions, driven by dialogues, makes Morgan Freeman look good :)
