A HOUSE THAT REPAIRED BLOOD is the third of a series of seven anthologies of the horror of Amicus. If THE MONSTER CLUB were part of a series, eight films would be made. Although this movie is very different from the others. <br /> <br /> I look at the Amicus anthology with great memories of how I once loved them when I was a teenager. My feelings for them are just as strong today. <br /> <br /> I spent many years trying to track down this movie. The summary of the story was so appealing that I went to pay a considerable amount for it when I finally found a copy. Just like in the movie, I felt disappointed when I finally saw it. It was not as good as it was thought. Although he is better than his two predecessors, he is not as good as his four successors, as I will show. <br /> <br /> The story of the relationship sees John Bennett as a police inspector tracking a missing person who lives in a mysterious old house. His journey begins at the local police station, where he meets the stories of previous residents. The link story shows that he is visiting a real estate agent who sold the house. Although this connecting story seems tempting on paper, in practice it is flat and deprived of life and easily the weakest of the Amicus anthologies. I could not resist the impression that John Bennett is a poor man in the version of Donald Pleasance or Ian Hendry. I would rather see one of the two actors in his role. We could even have both of them here - one as a police inspector and the other as a real estate agent. They could, and I believe that they would revive this weak element of the film much better. <br /> <br /> The film contains four stories, each of which focuses on the inhabitant of the house. <br /> <br /> The first story presents Denholm Elliott as the author of detective stories. He is immersed in an exciting strangler story, even going to draw a sketch to help him write. Shortly thereafter, he begins to see visions of his own creation. Peter Duffel's perfect direction, especially when choosing camera angles, helps to reverse the restrained scenario. Elliott's performance is excellent as a tormented writer, and helps to raise the story. The story ends with a semi-twist, but I could not fail to understand the meaning of the script that would not allow it to fulfill its potential. <br /> <br /> The second story shows that Peter Cushing moves into the house. He is a lonely man who is still looking for a beautiful young woman who once abandoned him and who keeps the picture. Cushing's performance really animates this emotionally moving story. He is assisted by a director who chooses to constantly focus on Cushing's loneliness. This is continued thanks to the great hallucination scene that helps us see Cushing's mind. In any case, Cushing sees a figure in a nearby wax museum that looks like his girlfriend. Obviously, his obsession is growing, but this seemingly romantic story has a worrying turnaround at the end. Joss Ackland plays Cushing's rival, but his performance is heavily eclipsed by the late great Peter Cushing. <br /> <br /> The third story and without a doubt the best game of Christopher Lee - my favorite horror actor of all time - moves home with his daughter. Mr. Lee gives here his excellent performances on the ice. He does not show love or attention to his daughter at all. She even brings in a school governess to educate her. The governess, played by Nyree Dawn Porter in another of her wonderful performances, is trying to figure out what's wrong. Not giving too much, I can reveal that spells play a role. Christopher Lee's presence is really electrifying in every scene he's in. Chloe Franks deserves special recognition for the massively underestimated performance of a little girl who is easily the worst figure in the whole film. The film is worth seeing, even to see just one story. <br /> <br /> The last story is played almost exclusively with laughter, but it is certainly fun and that counts. Jon Pertwee plays the horror actor who moves into the house. He is very dissatisfied with the approach his producers approach films, perceiving everything as cheap and false, especially costumes. He decides to buy an authentic coat for his last vampire role. Geoffrey Bayldon has a great episode as a dealer who sells Pertwee an ancient coat. When Pertwee puts on a coat, he begins to develop fangs and essentially transforms into a vampire. Pertwee's efficiency must be seen as faith. It's really fun. Ingrid Pitt is also in this story, but her talent is wasted in a role that should be much greater. <br /> <br /> The connecting history ends with a loose connection to the last story. This is particularly appropriate because the inspector was looking for Pertwee and naturally chooses to visit the house. You will be able to try the rest yourself. As weak as the connecting story, it has a decent, if somewhat unintentional comic ending. <br /> <br /> I am convinced that the fault for the shortcomings in what should really be a great movie does not lie with Peter Duffell, the director who really does everything in his power. I think the scenario was just too restrained and lacked the ambitions that can be found in the four later films. <br /> <br /> In general, HOUSE THAT HAS BEEN DOWNLOADED BLOOD, despite the disadvantages is a must-see for fans of Anthologie Amicus, fans of other Amicus movies or fans of portmanteau horrors. If my summary provides a movie with sufficient attractiveness in the eyes, check it out. You'll love it!
