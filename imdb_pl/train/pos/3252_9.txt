The story "Women from nowhere" is quite simple and quite well adapted from Eastwood Spaghetti Western: a mysterious stranger enters an illegal city led by a king and begins to shoot at this place. Even the initial subtitles and music give the impression of spaghetti: Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone would be proud. It is really interesting that a stranger is a beautiful (!) Woman, Saki (Ryoko Yonekura) on Harley, and the location is in a city somewhere in Japan. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of shootings in this action, some good ones, some predictable ones, some others a bit hokey, but it's a lot of fun. Ryoko deals with his weapon with faith and serenity and gives opponents the money they owe them. It was not a great acting challenge for her because it was a physical challenge, but she did very well. Shows her acting skills more as Otsu in the drama NHK "Musashi." <br /> <br /> I highly recommend the film if you're a fan of Ryoko Yonekura (which I love) and / or Movie lovers "girls with weapons" and withstand repeated viewing. For me there is something unusually and inexplicably attractive in films about "girls with weapons", such as "La Femme Nikita" and "Long kiss goodnight." And to have a great gala like Ryoko, in which he performs, is simply icing on the cake.
