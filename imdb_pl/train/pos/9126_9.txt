This film is outstanding and wonderfully conquered. Prince's praise for the music was very well deserved (many people do not know that he won). I think it is one of the best movies that can be watched as a couple late at night on DVD. Incredible surprise: Prince does a great job and is pretty good at communicating pain with the camera. Morris Day, Wendy and Lisa are good at their supporting roles. Very nice spot movie.
