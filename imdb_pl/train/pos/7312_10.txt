It took me a long time to really appreciate John Carpenter's Halloween. As a child, I remember that I loved the sequels, especially The Return of Michael Myers, which I still think is the best Halloween sequel. But I thought the first one was slow and it took too long to get to the bottom of it. Recently I watched it several times and I know I was wrong. Today I really understand this film, its meaning, the whole feeling of this masterpiece of horror. This is not about blood and blood. It's not about naked chicks and lame jokes. It's about the worst night in the short life of Laurie Strode. This is the night when his mad brother returns home to finish what he started 15 years ago. This movie is going to be frightening and I think he is successful. This is also one of the first slasher movies, a subgenre of horror that I have always loved. Halloween has a very dark atmosphere, frightening music and talented young actors such as Jamie Lee Curtis in her first role. I have to say more? Anyone who has never seen him, a horror fan or not, should now do his own homework. I highly recommend it!
