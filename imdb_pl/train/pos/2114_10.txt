Two fighting shopkeepers in a store with skins turn out to be secret lovers, because they answer under pseudonyms. As part of this simple idea and everyday surroundings, Lubitsch produces a rich tapestry of wit, drama, takeover and irony that never goes away. Stewart and Sullavan are ideal as an average couple with real emotions and tensions, and the rest of well-developed characters have their own threads and jokes. Although unfairly eclipsed by Stewart's 39/40 movies (Destry, Philadelphia Story, Mr Smith), it is equally and we enjoy the whole range of acting subtleties invisible in other movies.
