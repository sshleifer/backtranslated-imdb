This is a great movie, suitable for everyone, but for the youngest, although the availability for younger people was distorted (at least in the print I saw) using some unfortunate choice of English subtitle! For most of the film it is almost impossible to guess at what period it is set - there is no modern technology shown, not even the ubiquitous Chinese bicycle, only gray, almost monochromatic, everyday life, which contrasts with the dazzling exhibition of the Sezuan Opera and ceremonial fireworks. Even if a group of soldiers refers to their imminent departure to the theater of war, it can be at any time during the last 150 years. <br /> <br /> But then we briefly see the car - the late 1930s, early 1940s - and we are aware that we are watching China on the verge of great shocks and that much of the world we see will soon be it will be swept away in the cataclysm of the Second World War and the communist revolution. <br /> <br /> What makes the main character's desire to adhere to old customs and traditions is all the more moving. <br /> <br /> But the film also touches on issues that are of great importance even today, both in China and other parts of the world: inequality between boys and girls, men and women; trade, for various purposes, in young children; corruption in society; injustice; meaning of friendship. <br /> <br /> Maybe I read too much in this movie; but I do not think so! I also think that the scandal is that films of this caliber are often not shown in the UK, while the slag is passed as high-quality material. <br /> <br /> But do not start with this ....
