No Strings Attached presents the performance of Carlos Menci, who makes us laugh and think. He not only jokes about racial problems (as many hate), but also talks about the best way to get illegal immigrants out of the country ... what women mean when they say they want to be treated equally ... why Americans are more crazy than Arabs Terrorists ... why no one has to pray for the Pope - and he hopes that he is doing it in heaven ... a theory about how the Easter traditions began (called the Big Ups to Jesus Day) ... his watching the movie Passion Christ - and his sub-sequential dispute with a woman about whether Jesus touched him or not ... how society should treat people with physical disabilities ... and even if you have the right to be joking or not. <br /> <br /> It never ceases to remind us that each of us has a voice. So we should use it to tell the truth, say what we think, and do not be afraid if others are offended. <br /> <br /> Carlos is a bomb.
