It was quite a decent movie. This movie is good to just sit and watch and be entertaining. Just a typical Hollywood movie. This movie will never win an Oscar or anything and definitely does not deserve one, but I thought it was pretty good. It's a bit like show 24, but set to the movie format. If you like the fact that we have to stop the terrorist from killing the president's film, then you'll like this movie. Personally, I think the plot was made TOO MUCH, but The Sentinel adds a bit of a mole to the Secret Service. In conclusion, this movie will not leave a jaw on the floor or change your life, but who said that every movie must be such that it would be good?
