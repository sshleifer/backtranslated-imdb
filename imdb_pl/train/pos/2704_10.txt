I was disappointed, if not surprised, lack of appreciation for this movie. Once again Billy Zane proves that he is more than just a nice Hollywood boy in a quiet game that combines spastic slapstick with discrete pathos. Calling this silent movie is inaccurate because there is a lot of music and sound. It has a maniacal pace and is full of stupid ingenuity, for which Ed Wood finally begins to appreciate. Look at the list of throws and realize that everyone is shining. Nobody is there just to show their face. I think everyone is in the movie to show their appreciation to Wood and do a wide, physical kind of acting that we have not seen in these days. <br /> <br /> But today's reviewers are trying to guess to become a hit much more than they show any aesthetic appreciation for the film. I IUUETDID has no visible target group. It was made mainly for the love of Wood's script. Even after his death fashionable social parasites inflicted another serious blow on him and deprived the world of a small classic. This is a very funny and truly experimental movie that really deserves to live, at least on DVD.
