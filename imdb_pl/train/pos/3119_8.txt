"The Bourne Ultimatum" begins recklessly in the middle of the chase, and the pulsating fashion explodes from there when Jason Bourne (Matt Damon, absolutely wonderful) is tracking the creators of the black CIA operations, which in the final attempt turned him into the ideal killer to know his true identity. The devastating ice David Strathairn as a "man behind the veil" is added to the returning cast of regular players, including Joan Allen (excellent) and Julia Stiles (non-existent). <br /> <br /> Like the second entry in I would like the shaky Paul Greengrass camera to be static for at least a few minutes of downtime. However, this is a great way to capture the tight, claustrophobic atmosphere of intimate hand-to-hand combat scenes and works equally well in the pursuit scenes, which are mostly on foot and on the roofs with an occasional large stack of cars-up. Part of the fun of the Bourne series is the continual skipping of the globe and the manipulation of technology and communication that seem to contradict the laws of physics and current capabilities. Bourne's films seem to exist in some rough hyper-reality full of technological magic. It does not make sense that everyone seems to be in the right place at the right time, but damn it if it's not cool to watch them get there. <br /> <br /> In the absence of emotional and committed Frank Potente, the writers are trying to create an emotional relationship between Damon and Stiles, but she is as empty as an actress who never leads. Even so, you can forgive this because, unlike "Identity" and "Supremacy", "Ultimatum" reveals everything and finally we learn the truth about Bourne's past. It's a fun and satisfying end to the series, and if they make any sense and Damon fulfills his wish, it will be the perfect ending.
