It's a great movie ... The first impressions of cynicism and snortiness are soon dispelled by funny demonstrations of discrepancies in the motivation of men and women (difference Vive la!) <br /> <br /> You can love people despite and sometimes because of their weakness. Human beings are really a bit dirty, but we have big hearts and we try our best despite the temptation. It's not our fault, when sometimes you can not resist temptation, it's just who we are. <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end is a consistent style; clear photography and sharp composition, very pleasant watching, when you add provocative content, well-matched music and laughter of loud scripts. <br /> <br /> Watch out for a very young "lonely wise voice" ... genius; the wisdom of innocence balancing the comedy of the human condition.
