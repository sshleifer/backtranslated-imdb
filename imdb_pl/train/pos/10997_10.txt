WOW. One of the greatest movies I have EVER - EVER saw. <br /> <br /> I absolutely loved it! Before I finished writing, I glued myself to the screen. <br /> <br /> It's a science-fiction thriller - And the edge of your Whodunnit seat. Incredible. <br /> <br /> I would like it never to end. <br /> <br /> Lucy Liu is a one-off role. Everyone could play it. The main actor, Jeremy Northram, was an excellent geek. <br /> <br /> This movie appeals to me who loved War Games, Sneakers and Track Down. <br /> <br /> Incredible! <br /> <br /> 8-22-06.
