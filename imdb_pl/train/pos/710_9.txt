Although I do not agree with the decision of Bob and Tammy to give up Jesse's child, which I would never do, they tried to do what's best for the child. The way the movie is written, you see how you sink into history and you ask yourself what you really believe in from different aspects. Patty Duke? Antagonist? Almost unheard of, as far as I think. But during the movie he really convinces you that he is psychotic, or at least that he is something serious with her. Her character is the meaning of "emotional disorder". The film seems to end quickly, leaving matters somewhat unresolved. But besides, this movie is really great. It really makes you think. This is not a movie to watch when you want to break away and relax and watch something charming, which will make you laugh. But it's a good movie to see when you want to challenge your beliefs, see things from the perspective of others and discover something about yourself. Note: you can even grow while watching this movie! And at the end it's worth it.
