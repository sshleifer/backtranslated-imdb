OK, I'll be honest when I saw the program trailer for the first time, I thought it was an advertisement for a product with a solar screen. With all the people walking on the beach. Even so, I decided to watch it, thinking it would be a new program that I could laugh at. But I was seriously surprised. <br /> <br /> From the first 10 seconds of the program I was addicted, why is lying on trees, why airplane crash, etc. <br /> <br /> Not every day comes a program that combines intelligence, humor, action and tension. But "Lost" manages all this. With a great cast and crew, beautiful locations and quite decent special effects, "Lost" will catch everyone who turns on, and is a must for anyone who has enough bad comedy series and bad television. > Lost on Tuesdays at 10 on channel 4 (UK) 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42 = O
