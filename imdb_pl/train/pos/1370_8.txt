I remember seeing it years ago when it first came out, and I was delighted with Parker Posey's performance. And the movie was pretty good. For anyone who has spent some time in the nightclub / after hours, this movie will have a special charm for you. Not serious, mostly funny, and Parker Posey definitely promotes his talented path in this independent jewel. <br /> <br /> I especially liked the character of Diaz (I remembered every DJ fighting I ever knew). And many other movies can take the signal from this movie, how to proclaim the virtue of responsibility without boredom and vagueness in this topic. <br /> <br /> Babaganoosh!
