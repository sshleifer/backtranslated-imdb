I've seen this movie on Comedy Central several times. This movie was pretty good. This is an interesting adventure with the life of Sunny Davis, which is prepared to marry King Ohtar, so that the US can get a base army to balance power in the Middle East. Good jokes, including "Sunnygate". I also loved the final topic. It gave me a great political spirit. Ten out of ten was my assessment for this movie.
