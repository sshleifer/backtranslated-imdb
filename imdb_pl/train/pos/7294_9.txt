After reading a few comments, I felt that I must also add my two cents. "Sorrow Lost" is one of the most memorable movies I've ever seen. I had the opportunity to see it at the New York Independent Film Festival. I felt that this movie was incredibly beautiful and emotional. The story was beautifully complex - especially for such a short time. The story focuses on a young girl who is the victim of her abusive father. He will soon be able to "stop" him by the demon played by Eric Etebari of Witchblade. After watching the show I was very impressed with how he played such a unique and different character. I never knew it could work so well! His character was deeply complex and very convincing. Acting was absolutely amazing. The girl was fine and my father was decent. There is also death that follows the girl until she can escape her future. The effects and photos were absolutely exciting. I wonder if they had at least one hundred thousand budget for it. You can rarely see such high quality. The opening was absolutely breathtaking comparable to any important feature film. It does not mean that it is not without flaws - I thought it took some time and the intro was a bit too long. But it stuck in my head after seeing. There are very few shorts with this quality level.
