they are the distinguishing features of this function from 1917. The Pride of the Clan tells the story of a young girl who becomes the leader of the clan after her father's death. On the island off the coast of Scotland, the villagers live a simple life of "fishermen". My copy is very dark and sometimes difficult to read, but the movie can boast of a stunning ocean scenery, and camera work on boats is great. Maurice Tourneur directed Pickford to this nice movie. Pickford was already the main star in 1917. And it seems that this movie was written just for her: a brave young woman was successful. Pickford's whip sticking lazy villagers towards the church is very funny. And the last scenes on the sinking ship are very well made. This is not a great Picford movie, but it's worth seeing. Matt Moore (Pickford was married to his brother, Owen Moore) is a love interest and is good as a boy who attaches himself to the island. Leatrice Joy is one of the villagers, but I did not notice her either. My copy interleaves with many bells and gongs and adds an amazing feeling when the warning bell rings. Very effective.
