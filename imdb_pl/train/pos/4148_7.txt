Let's establish one thing: this film is not intended to redefine the genre, it is not Dr. Strangelove about Young Frankenstein. It's a stupid movie, with three great female characters (I do not remember any other comedy with similar traits), Rachel Dracht and Amy Poehler with SNL and independent queen Parker Posey, cute as always. The story is basic: three girls were "lost" in college and are still after him. Poehler is a dog trainer (who can not even make a date with a blind man), Posey is an assistant senator (who "has not been touched by a man since Clinton was in the office" ... a few minutes later ... I'm a bit slow, OK!), and Dracht has a gay fianc√© (Seth Meyers from SNL, funny). They must prevent the "dishonest" daughter of a senator (always sweet Amber Tamblyn from the TV series "Joan of Arcadia") to embarrass her during the spring break. So, of course, they have to watch her, which causes some hilarity. All in all a light, simple comedy, quite short and quite pleasant
