First I saw it half a century ago on a black and white TV in a small village called Samoan and found it funny. Now, seeing it a second time, much later, I do not think it's fun. I do not think anything is fun. But it is a witty and light comedy that moves quickly, does not stumble and I really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> It's 1945 and Fred MacMurray is 4F, who dies to get into one of the armed forces. He picks the lamp in the junkyard he manages, and the genie seems to give him a few wishes. (Ho is boring, is not it?) But although the introduction is fine, the fantasies are quite alive.) MacMurray tells the genie that he wants to be in the army. Poof and marched along with Washington soldiers in an exceptionally warm and encouraging USO, where June Haver and Joan Leslie are wearing a lot of lace napkins or whatever they are, and lavender wigs. Washington sends MacMurray to spy on the enemy - a red shell, German-speaking Hessian, not British. Hezians are interjected in Bierstube and sing a very funny song drunk, extolling the virtues of Vaterland, "where the white wine is more or less Rhinier's rhier / and sausage is milder / and the yellow hair is yellowish / and the Frauleins are jucier / and the goose steps are more dense. " Something like that. The characteristics are fantastic, as good as Sig Signa. Otto Preminger is a suspicious and sinister Hessian general. "You know, Heidelberg, vee have 241 to 1 against you - but they are not afraid." <br /> <br /> I can not go too long with these fantasies, but they are all quite fun, just like the lyrics. When he wants to be in the navy, MacMurray ends with Columbus and fantasy is portrayed as a great opera. "Do not you know that sailing to the west meant a terribly expensive investment? And what do you think, who provides funds / but Izabela, Queen of Queens. " When they see the New World, someone notices that it looks great. "I do not care what it looks like," murmurs Columbus, "but this place will be called Columbusland." <br /> <br /> In any case, everything is finally straight, although the genie is quite drunk at the time, and MacMurray goes to Marine Corps with the right girl. <br /> <br /> I made it sound too charming, but it's sweet. Children will enjoy smoke, magic and a banal love story. Adults will be able to challenge the more demanding elements of the story (who are the Hessians?), Unless they are college graduates, in which case they may want to stay with the legend and say: "Wow! Incredible!"
