Hayao Miyazaki is second to none when it comes to using hand-drawn animations as a form of storytelling, but is often compared to Walt Disney. This is simply unjust because watching Miyazaki's films becomes an obvious artist. It really has the gift of excitement for both adults and children, and Laputa is a really amazing ride. <br /> <br /> But where can I start describing a movie so magical and breathtaking! Miyazaki's work has never ceased to amaze me. Laputa is a large-scale adventure and I wonder how a movie can be so full of details and imagination. Ask yourself this question: if you are a child dreaming about an adventure as great and as magical as it is? The answer is: fasten the seat belts and watch Laputa, because it is a real fantasy from childhood. Every minute of the movie is rich and captivating ... from the pursuit of amazing sequences of flying with air ... and a wonderful view of the floating castle itself. Not to mention the great result of Joe Hisaishi! Everything you want from an adventure movie is here.
