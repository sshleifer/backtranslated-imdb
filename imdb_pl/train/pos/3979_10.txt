I would like all fans of this movie to learn that Martin Torgoff is my uncle and I'm proud of him. This mini-series shown on VH1 is a great look at the culture of drugs over the past 30 years, and my uncle worked very hard on it. The amount of time and effort that I've watched, put in this documentary and the book where it all began (Can not Find My Way Home), makes watching it on TV is much better. I know that he loves what he does and he does it well. His eloquence is shown in the interviews he has done himself, and the incredible additions that he himself adds to the commentary. From music to movies and everything in between, this is a great document that really shows the experience of drug culture through the eyes of someone who survived. I appreciate any comments from those who liked it (or not) and would like to hear from the fans! Three cheers for Uncle Martin !!!
