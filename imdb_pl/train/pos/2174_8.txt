I think I really love this movie. "Prix de Beaute" was originally a silent film, but was later called French in 1930. Despite the fact that someone else called him a voice, it remains a staggering tour de force for Louis Brooks. The fact that her voice is called by the legendary Edith Piaf helps us appease the purists of the dubbing fraud. <br /> <br /> This is the story of Lulu and we first see her in the center with her boyfriend macho, Andre (Georges Charlia) and their friend Antonin (Augusto Bandini). Lulu enters the frame as a pair of legs: we see her in a car that changes into a swimsuit. Lulu is very free, showing her body, and this does not match Andre's annoying. When Lulu is considering applying for the "Miss Europe" title, we know that a happy ending will not be sitting at the end of Easy Street. <br /> <br /> The film seems to focus on men who are watching beautiful women. We see a lot of beautiful baths and the reactions of men staring at them. But in the center of it all is great Louise Brooks. <br /> <br /> If you do not mind watching movies from past eras, consider this. Louise Brooks is not a name that most average cinema buffs can easily get to know, but once you see her, you'll be mesmerized and you'll want to know more. Check it out also in "Pandora's Box" if you can find it. <br /> <br /> Be careful with the release of DVD US Cinema. I do not know if their projection speed is correct. Many scenes appear to be displayed too quickly. It could be the way they were shot. I do not know. But because this is the only way to watch this movie, it's worth swallowing this one little bitter pill.
