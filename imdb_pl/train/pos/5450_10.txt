Barbara Stanwyck plays Lily Powers. She is a waitress for her husband's husband in a small, meager mining town. He also sells it to people. He escapes to New York and literally sleeps his way to the top. <br /> <br /> I originally only saw the 71-minute version, but it is quite extreme - for my time. Currently, it is quite tame. The film moves very fast and has a lot of sexual innuendos - some of them are quite stupid (but fun) today. It moves so fast that you can easily ignore that most of them could never have happened - even in 1933. There is nothing classical or monumental about it - it's just a quick, joyfully dirty movie that makes a lot of fun. It falls apart only at the end with a small "moral" ending, which censors demanded. It looks unbelievable and stupid (I saw it in the theater, and the audience laughed at it - one guy quite rightly said "No way"). I just saw the uncut 75-minute version, which has a different, somewhat tragic and MUCH better ending. This version was considered missing until 2004, when it was discovered by mistake! I believe that this is the only one released - but be aware. <br /> <br /> Acting is good - Stanwyck jumps into her role and plays WAY at the highest level. It makes you believe that she likes to be cruel and sleepy. There are also strong supporting performances by the handsome Donald Cook and George Brent. Also, look for John Wayne in a fun piece as a gentle and gentle office worker! Funny, dirty and fast. I give it to 9.
