Is it really time for a different one for all the recent films dealing with the British monarchy? Answer: YOU ARE PLAYING! The Young Victoria is another contribution to the cinema from the UK dealing with the royal family. In this case, it concerns the early life of Princess Victoria and the events that led to the coronation of her queen throughout England, as well as her romance and possible marriage with Prince Albert. The film also deals with the stormy life and career of the English queen and prince, as well as several other events (political turbulence, etc.). Emily Blunt plays a radiant Victoria in her youth, while Rupert Friend is her beloved and best friend, Prince Albert. The rest of the cast is completed by Miranda Richardson, as Dutchess of Kent, and always welcomed on screen by Jim Broadbent as King William, as well as the cast of others that shine on the screen. Jean Marc Vallee (C.R.A.Z.Y., Loser Love), director of the winning screenplay by Jullian Fellowes (Vanity Fair, Gosford Park, Separate Lies). I absolutely left my head over the visual appearance of the film (cinematographer Hagen Bogdansker), which gave each frame a painting look (with the help of the set designer, Patrice Vermette), as well as a strong edition (by Jill Bilcock and Matt Garner). In the Fellowes scenario, I also appreciate the use of chess as a metaphor for some political motivations of the film (characters in the film move like pieces on a chessboard). It's smart, well-written, directed, filmed, assembled and acting as entertainment (and enlightenment) that makes a well-spent evening in the cinema. Rated MP by MPAA for several scenes of sensuality, short violence (a bit bloody, though nothing too bloody), naughty tongue bursting, and some on the screen
