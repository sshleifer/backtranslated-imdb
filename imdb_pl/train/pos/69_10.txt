One evening I went to the late channel and ran into the movie for about 10 minutes - every time I even thought I would go to bed, something kept telling me to keep watching, even though it was far ahead of my bedtime. <br /> <br /> This movie could be another easy slam dunk anti-gun movie, but instead decided to investigate the effects of the shooting. And even better, the film was continued in real life - just when you think that they will make an easy and obviously invented output, the turn of the action appears and changes the whole world of the film. This film is not only incompatible with the formula, but shows how other events often lead to and / or influence what happens later. <br/> <br /> I would just like the filmmakers to investigate the problems associated with antidepressants more - children with Columnbine who have been shooting have been on them for years and it has been frightening to watch the way Deanna cast them every time nightmares began. Until recently, they have published things like sweets and are only now beginning to understand the long-term effects of drugs. It was very refreshing when I saw that the aspect of mental illness in this story got quite a lot of film, having a relative who suffers from a mental illness, I can say that the film was dead in every aspect of mental illness. Well done to the director and writer who apparently did their homework in these matters. And for those who think that certain things can not happen in the hospital (I do not want to give any details), in this case too, you're wrong - I was there. The script was so real it was amazing. <br /> <br /> Go BUY this movie and show it to your teenage children before it's too late. One day they'll thank you for that.
