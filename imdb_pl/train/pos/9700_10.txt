In some way, this movie is invigorating, bitter and sweet at the same time. Stars like Tony Shalhoub (from Providence) bring history to life. The story itself is inspiring. We see a desperate, rising life thanks to the most innocent eyes imaginable: to the bird. <br /> <br /> Paulie begins his life as a small parrot given to a little girl (played by Hallie Eisenberg, also known as Pepsi's girlfriend) with a speech disadvantage. While he learns to speak correctly, just like Paulie. However, unlike most birds, he can speak and understand everything that has been said. The military father does not like the bird, so he is sent to the pawnshop and bought by an aging artist, Ivy. He teaches him manners, etc. When traveling around the country to find Paulie's owner. The film continues a few twists of fate until Paulie goes to the laboratory, where he is finally hidden in the basement and found by a Russian guardian, who is moved by the story of the bird. the plot is consistent with the simple, metaphorical motive that language is a gift and a curse. I would like to say that the soundtrack is amazing. A beautiful blend of the flute, digital base and horns strengthens the film to the level of pure ecstasy. The wide angles of the camera and the breathtaking scenery embellish the story. And, as a last remark, puppetry is completely reliable. (Unlike star wars, where Yoda resembles Muppet) This movie is one of my favorite movies, with additional attention that my wonderful parrot of four years has recently died. Generally speaking, I give this film **** with four stars, two thumbs up and a big hug.
