If the very thought of Arthur Askey shakes your insides, do not worry, you can still watch and love The Ghost Train, just like the equally wonderful Back Room Boy, is just a movie that's just damn good to be sunk by one performance even the main actor. Personally, I love Askey, maybe because I'm entering his world, and I'm not unreasonably expecting him to come into mine, which is a mistake for too many people. The Ghost Train is so intensely moody that you could not be watched without surprise by the deep, dark world to which it moves you, is engaging in a way that few cheap and cheerful flags succeeded in the desperate early '40s movie, which, as I imagine, few people have seen only once. The cast is, without exception, exceptionally good, perhaps Linden Travers puts it a bit thick, but against the background of a lonely train station during the war it was difficult to play a step further and not stand out. The sad departure of the charming Carole Lynne at the beginning of this year broke the last link we had with this amazing movie, and now it really is in the past, but we are patiently waiting to press the play.
