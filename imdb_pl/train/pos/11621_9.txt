I was bored one night and the Red Eye was turned on and I was thinking why not. <br /> <br /> Red Eye is one of the best films from a long time. <br /> <br /> I mean, I just got in a movie is just genius. <br /> <br /> The story is new and different. <br /> <br /> The film also has two great roles in the movie with Rachel Mcadams as Lisa Reisert and Cillian Murphy as Jackson Rippner. <br /> <br /> Acting is simply brilliant and you have a sense of people in the movie. <br /> <br /> The music is just perfect, it gives you chills and it can also make you feel relaxed. <br /> <br /> I love the fact that the movie was so well made and it is never boring. <br /> <br /> The Red Eye is simply phenomenal. Nothing more and nothing less. <br /> <br /> It's a great thriller. <br /> <br /> In general I'm happy about the Red Eye so much that I can watch it repeatedly. <br /> <br /> If you like Red Eye, I recommend Elektra and Cry Wolf. <br /> <br /> I give Red Eye 9 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Great movie
