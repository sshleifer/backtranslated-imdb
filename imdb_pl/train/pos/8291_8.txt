"The Lady in Question (1999)" starring Gene Wilder is a well-played mysterious drama that reminds me of the old black and white Raymond Burr series Perry Mason. Both Perry and "Cash" guessed me to the end. There were many suspects with the motive of murder, but I had no idea what character it would be. <br /> <br /> Gene Wilder has a special charm, even in facial expressions and voice inflections that make it ideal for the role. The fragments of the film that portrayed the acting actors were done very well. I'm sure it's an additional challenge for the cast. I am not surprised that he did some screenplays for the film. Even his singing was a delight. I like him in this role more than his previous "sillier" roles such as "The Young Frankenstein" and "Willy Wonka". I hope that A and E will continue this series. They should call it something like "The A & E Gene Wilder Mysteries". <br /> <br /> Music fits the period. I liked the cool live combo and swing tunes. At the beginning I was a bit vague, did we see a flashback or if the action took place during this period. And I do not agree that including profanity is necessary for the flow of the scenario. For me it always distracts. <br /> <br /> In general, my wife and I loved this second on a well-prepared start in what, we hope, will be many more - just like one of our other favorites: Raymond Burry's Perry Mason .
