Dahl seems to be influenced by Wenders' The American Friend. Innocent Nick Cage is recruited to hit. Dennis Hopper plays real Hit Man. Lara Flynn Boyle is dangerous. The hero becomes more entangled, the more he tries to disentangle himself. And a small town in America does not seem any safer than the Grand City. Like this predecessor, this movie has many twists and turns that seem unlikely, but all lead to a cathartic discovery of itself.
