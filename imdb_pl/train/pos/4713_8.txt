One movie is not perfect. It does not "work well" because the plot is basically a set of hooks in which you can hang jokes. <br /> <br /> Some of these jokes are a little "for the 80's" and tend to date the picture. br /> <br /> But some of these jokes are classic. <br /> <br /> You know that the movie has something special when you and your friends are still appealing to stupid quotes from it over two decades later. <br /> <br /> Plus, there are a few face acquaintances; Michael Keaton, Danny Devito, Joe Piscapo, Peter Boyle, Marilu Henner, Maureen Stapleton, Bob Eubanks, Griffin Dunne and one of the last roles of Alan Hale Jr., Skipper from Gilligan's. <br /> <br /> There are also great absurd moments, for example when Johnny labels the puppies with a price gun, or the pope appears in the neighborhood of Johnny. Also the scene in which a false priest makes many words in Latin is perfect. ("Summa cum laude, magna cum laude, the radio is too loud ... Post meridian, ante meridian, uncle meridian"). <br/> <br /> Other classic scenes include Ramone Maroney of English slaughter Danny Devito calling Griffin Dunne to "Play Ball" Peter Boyle thinks he lost his masculinity Fake movie VD <br /> <br /> This movie is not a home movie over. But like "Porky's", it has enough classic comedic pieces to make it unforgettable.
