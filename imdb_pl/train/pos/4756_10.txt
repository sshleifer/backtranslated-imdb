This is one of the most charming episodes of the Twilight Zone, with funny dialogue and funny characters that break the tension of some terrifying moments. There is an ordinary blonde dancer "vampire" (what happens with Serling's liking for this kind of character, so that it appears in different episodes?) And other different characters, but it is an "old man" of Jacek Elam, who steals the show completely. I think it's a fun, easygoing version of "The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street" - or maybe a 20-minute parody of "The Thing" in Twilight Zone. Another remark: I thought that the young lover of the episode might be someone who would eventually switch to other things - he looked familiar - but it seems that "Ron Kipling" disappeared after only two TV credits to his name.
