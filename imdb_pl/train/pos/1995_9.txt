I just saw it recently, after almost forty years. He keeps up well, especially the excellent songs of Lionel Bart. ("Who will buy" with his magic counterpoint, just one of the many distinguishing marks.) <br /> <br /> I do not agree with the second post that condemned grade G. The rating system, completely new at that time, never assumed that the G (general) grade means "completely devoid of conflict". <br /> <br /> Characterizing it as unsuitable for children reminds me of a description that once saw a wizard from the land of Oz: A girl comes to strange land and kills the first person she meets. Then he goes on a journey with three companions and kills again.
