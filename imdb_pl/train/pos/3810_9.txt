this is my first review on IMDb, I did not really want to write it, but because in this great movie there are only 2, I feel compelled to add my perspective ... and no, I'm not related to the filmmaker in any way (yes, yes how often did you do it here ;-)) FYI I'm in the late 20's <br /> <br /> firstly I have to admit that I like animated films very much, because what you see is limited only by the imagination of the creators and they were very idea for this. Not so much when it comes to history, what about the unique and fresh visual style. The characters look good, but they are not real and work well in the movie, in the end it is a fairy-tale world. But the background and the world in general is full of amazing visual effects, which my jaw dropped a few times while watching. The blue, mini-dragon-like mini-dragon strides the show and easily has one of the funniest moments of the movie, is already a classic, just like the Scratches from the Ice Age. The story is not too surprising (a group of anti-heroes must go out and kill the biggest dragon you can imagine), but who cares if the movie looks and sounds SO good ;-) 1 thing I must point out, the movie is not suitable for VERY small children, because it has some darker scenes in it and maybe terrifying for children under 6-8 years old, I would say that these are only a few scenes, but it's worth mentioning imo. Anyway, I had a great time watching it and I can not wait for it to go to high resolution stores to watch it over and over again, just for its beauty. <br /> <br /> 8.5 for me
