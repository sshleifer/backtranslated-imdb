On the attention of Chuck Davis and Emephy: I saw PHANTOM LADY many years ago when I was not yet a jazz fan. Until the end of June, an exhibition called LE SIECLE DU JAZZ will appear in the new Parisian MUSEE DU QUAI BRANLY, which you can not miss, with special fragments of NINE from jazz films, including the famous PHANTOM LADY drums sequence. I've seen Gene Krupa - and Elisha Cook Jr - in almost all of their movie appearances, and I can confirm the following: 1.Elisha Cook Jr. was DUBBED in the movie. It was some progress, because in most of the other performances he was KILLED (mainly in THE BIG SLEEP by Howard Hawks). 2. Krupa probably named Cook in PL. I could recognize his style because he had already graduated from the tom-tom used (and abused) at the beginning of his career - namely the SING, SING, SING in Hollywood in 1937 - and eventually got everything that was possible from what we call after French "la caisse claire". 3. The sequence from the PL, at least as shown in the Museum, is not censorship.harry carasso, Paris, France
