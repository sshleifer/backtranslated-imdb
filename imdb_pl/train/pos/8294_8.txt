This movie has great battle scenes. Now it's true that acting is a bit rough. But if I wanted to see a movie based on acting skills, I would watch "Cheesy movie Like American Beauty". But if you want to see a movie with real martial arts and amazing acrobatics WITHOUT using wires and flying, he threw up as many films around that are already over killing the matrix. So look at it. Now it's true, the two main stars of the series in which kids show power rangers, and another cast member of this series has their share in this movie. But hey, fight scenes are enough for Jet Li to sleep. And the acrobatics are worthy enough for Jackie Chan to sit up and admire.
