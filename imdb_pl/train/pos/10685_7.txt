This movie has a bright storyline that is quite unusual for a musical genre. "Cats", "Phantom of the Opera" and other musicals by Andrew Lloyd Webber can be considered metaphorical because they use literary works. The story "Biarkan Bintang Menari" (BBM) touches on the essence of interpersonal relations, especially the Indonesian ones. Despite the fact that the film was based on the "supposedly" fairy tale, it is actually a fantasy of a "child" of Indonesian adults. Dance sequences are not perfect, but the songs show how Indonesians express themselves. I think that the choreographer should discover the Indonesian way of dancing, without worrying about the fact that the dance development in Indonesia is more western. Dance sequences seem somewhat awkward and not synchronized with songs and / or music. I still love this movie and think it is a new wave of the Indonesian film genre, which I hope to improve in the future.
