The American vehicles of director Paul Verhoeven have different qualities, but most of the films he made in his native country are unquestionable masterpieces. This is the story of an alcoholic (and bi-sexual) writer who introduces himself to a beautiful, rich and very strange woman. But you do not know that he's only interested in meeting a handsome woman's lover. In the meantime, the writer is plagued with strange visions - at first they look like hallucinations caused by alcohol abuse, but soon he begins to realize that he is actually experiencing some kind of foreboding. Fascinating Hitchcock thriller, very original and provocative. I love movies that make you think of something, but you realize that they are about something completely different. It's one of those movies; a thriller in the first half and a quasi-religious surrealist saga in the second half. Very erotic, original and blasphemous, not for children and people who go to church every Sunday. Great photos of future director Jan de Bont. I would highly recommend!
