I really enjoyed this movie for two reasons. The first is that it gives an insight into the world of loyalty in Northern Ireland, which is very rarely seen in films, most of which tell us about the republican struggle. The second reason is the performances of the actors. I thought that they give very honest and convincing portraits of a very dingy underworld, about which few people can hear beyond my native shores. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a fun ganster movie with amazing performances by someone who's who in the Northern Irish actors cast. It will not move the earth, though it may open some eyes of some people to the dark world of paramilitary loyalists.
