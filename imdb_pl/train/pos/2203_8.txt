I also loved this series when I was a child. In 1952, I was 5 years old and my family always watched this program. My favorite character was Marion Lorne as a rather stuttering, clumsy and very nice person like "aunt". I can still remember her "ubba bubba um um" when she tried to say something important. And then when she came back and played Aunt Clara in Bewitched, it was a great casting! <br /> <br /> It was the first time I remember seeing Walter Matthau, whose career I followed as a fan for many years. <br /> <br /> I have a question, can anyone verify: there was a title or subtitles of the music "Swedish Rhapsody" Hugo Alfvena? Every time I hear her playing in my classic radio station here in Southern California, she brings back memories of Mr. Peepers' image going back to the camera. I'm not even sure if this picture is correct in my mind.
