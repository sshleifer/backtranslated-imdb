No, this fun frightening clinker from the 70's is not a demonically possessed dessert dessert. Nevertheless, this exceptionally horrible, but undeniably funny, and thus pleasant cathode ray variant achieves a breathtaking peak of absolute, constant stupidity and monstrosity, which is quite tasty in such a weird, horrific way. Richard Crenna, looking haggard and probably drunk, and Yvette Mimieux, who behaves as if she has never overcome the brutal rape she experienced in Jackson County Prison, sluggishly depict a disgustingly nice and respected suburban couple whose charming, boring, sleepy the town of existence is torn apart when the lovely German Shepard, whom they accept as a pet, turns out to be some ancient mortal evil spirit. Soon afterwards, Mimieux and her two very repulsive children, Kim Richards and Ike Eisenmann (psychic foreign moppets from "Witch's Witches from Disney") worship the raw pencil drawing of a nasty, ugly canine creature in a cave. Boy, does not that sound really scary and disturbing? Well, terrifying and disturbing that this ridiculously funny spank is not, but it is certainly funny, thanks to Curtis ("Night Tide") hopelessly poor direction Harrington, cartoon (not so) special effects, almost painfully reckless "n'ridiculous" plot and the cast of the game, which fights bravely with the absurd story (in addition to the leaders, Martine Beswicke and RG Armstrong briefly appear as members of the satanic cult, and Victor Jory has a nice episode as a helpful native American shaman). Favorite scene: the mischievous mutt Mephestophelion lays on Crenna, virtually forcing him to put his hand in the wildly rotating blade of the mower. While fans of horror can snatch their noses in the perfect, smelly stench of the truth of a stinky cord, devout fans of TV trash should consider it disgustingly disgusting as a boofl lamp corresponding to Alpo.
