Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker reunite to play all their songs from 35 years ago when they founded the "Cream" trio. They were psychedelic days of England and America, and these guys watched: all skinny, very long hair, wild clothes and loud music. They played a combination of rock and blues and that was mostly good. <br /> <br /> Well, these guys are 60 now and they can still sing and play at a high level like this great DVD. I've always been very familiar with Clapton, who was never out of focus, but I did not know what to expect from Bruce and Baker, none of whom I've seen in decades. They surprised me. When he was young, Baker was so skinny that he looked like a crazed man near death. It looks healthy now, it has a shape and the drum is solid. Bruce looked a little haggard, but his voice is great, as good as ever, and pleasure to hear in those old songs. It's just the perfect material and performances of the guys who know what they're doing. <br /> <br /> Some people criticized this program for being weak. I do not agree with that. I do not have any complaints. The concert sounded very good. The second song "Spoonful" was outstanding, the most important for me. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it.
