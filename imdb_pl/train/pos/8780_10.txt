This is one of the largest sports films in Hollywood history. What a great story about one of the great sports figures in American history. Of particular interest is the story of James J. Corbett that Mr. Corbett presented the style of boxing that continues to this day. In this respect, James J. Corbett was really innovative. But back to the movie, all the performances were excellent. Alexis Smith was beautiful. She actually looked like Nicole Kidman. And although it is a piece from the period, history can stand the test of time; it will not get old. The presentation of John L. Sullivan by Ward Bond has to be one of the great performances of a real sports figure in the history of films, and boxing scenes are realistic, well-directed and highly effective. This, combined with a great script, makes this movie a necessity.
