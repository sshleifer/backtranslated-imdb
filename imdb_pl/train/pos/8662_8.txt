I liked it very much. In fact, if I see it again (and plan), I can just love it. I will repeat to other reviewers that this film really grows on you, as you look. It starts slowly, but the path in the enfolds is very natural and has a mood. You just go into it. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the summer atmosphere of the movie and thought the movie was very moving. The characters have a strong element of realism, and the film slowly and gently rolls the spell as you engage in different interactions between them and want to know how it will end up and what paths will the characters choose. <br /> <br /> I am very surprised that there are fewer than a dozen comments on this topic - there are unclear TV movies that have more comments than Rich In Love. <br /> <br /> One thing that I will say is that I missed the ending that drives me crazy and I MUST watch it again. This is a movie that may not be for everyone, but I think it is strongly underestimated (even some of my most purist friends who have seen almost every movie I have not seen before) and even does not seem to have much of this forum, but I really enjoyed it and all those who like family dramas that are warm in the scenery, atmosphere and slow, drowsy pace should be looked at. Particularly noteworthy is that it takes place in South Carolina, so for those (like me) who love the south, and the movies that take place there, it is a real gem. I will add my voice to the pitifully few comments and I recommend this little-known film.
