I expected that this film would be a classic romance from the 1930s. The boy meets the girl, they fall in love, the boy loses the girl, the boy finally wins it. It was not like that at all. Clark Gable plays Eddie artist with all his usual charisma and mischievous raising eyebrows. He hides from the cops when he enters Ruby's apartment (Jean Harlow) so that no less than she covers herself with bubbles in the bathtub. Instant chemistry. For some time the game is hard, but the girl can resist only such a smile. The heat between them is obvious and there are certain scenes that are definitely pre-production code! When the blackmail job goes wrong, and Ruby goes to the pension for "worried girls", she is unhappy and, thanks to the gifting of her roommate, begins to believe that Eddie will never come. Harlow plays very well, Ruby talks quickly. He never lets Gable get all the good lines! There is a particularly moving scene in which she plays "her song" on the piano, which is perfectly preserved. The last fifteen minutes make me cry every time. A really sweet affair.
