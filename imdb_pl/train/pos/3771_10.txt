In 1991, the two best continuations of all time were published: TERMINATOR 2: DAY OF COURT AND BOGUS JOURNEY BILL & TED. Of the two, I've always liked BOGUS JOURNEY BILL & TED. TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY is better, but there is nothing like Bill and Ted. In addition to Chris Farley and David Spade in TOMMY BOY, it's hard to come up with a bigger comedy duet than Bill and Ted. They are one of a kind. <br /> <br /> Seemingly influenced by National Lampoon's O.C. Stiggs, Bill and Ted were created by Ed Solomon and Chris Matheson, two extremely talented writers who invented the duo during performances at the local Los Angeles theater in the 1980s. They both quickly wrote the script about two and before BILL & TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTENT was born. The film, made in 1987 and released in 1989, has become a great box office success and an instant cult classic. It did not take long before work on the continuation began. Stephen Herek, the director of EXCELLENT ADVENTURE, was not eager to work on the sequel, because he thought he was too crazy and unlike the first, Peter Hewitt, making his debut in the feature film, was directed to continue. There could not have been a better director for work. BOGUS JOURNEY BILL & TED is wonderfully focused. It is filled with its own unique style and energy that can not be adjusted. <br /> <br /> What makes "BOGUS JOURNEY" one of the best continuations of being darker than the original is just how fun. It does not change form, like most sequels. Bill and Ted are the same nice characters that were in the first movie. This is because it was written by original writers. Most of the sequels are not written by the same writers as the first, but because "BOGUS JOURNEY" had the same screenwriters, it turned out that it was just as good as "EXCELLENT ADVENTURE", if not even better. Like the first, "BOGUS JOURNEY" is completely funny, well-written, funny, and above all original. It is full of spectacular special effects and fantastic comedy performances by Alex Winter, Keanu Reeves and William Sadler. It is an unforgettable "journey". 10/10
