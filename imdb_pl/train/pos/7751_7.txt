I really liked AWTWB Tom Barman. You just have to let it happen to you and enjoy it as long as it lasts, and do not expect anything. It's like sitting on a caf√© terrace with beer, in the summer sun and watching people passing by. It certainly will not wonder you, it's true, but it is not a condition for a good movie. It's just a great experience during the movie. <br /> <br /> I felt that there were several threads that could have been developed a little more, but being a Lynch fan I do not care anymore :) <br /> <br /> I * loved * the style or talent of this movie . It is slippery, but fresh, and the soundtrack is beauty. Any music lover will get his copies from AWTWB, I can assure you. <br /> <br /> Dam him 8 out of 10. <br /> <br /> (in terms of music 10 out of 10)
