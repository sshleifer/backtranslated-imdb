Rod Serling was of course a genius, and his wonderful, playful, creative mind left something out of the period in which he lived and examples of television in this state of development. Currently, there are no such concerts, but rather "housewife" whores Eva Longoria or Terri Hatcher, or pathetic quarrels with humor and witty banter, which clutter our modern screens. <br /> <br /> Jack Elam entered an episode with such extreme precision and his usual madness that I can not resist the impression that Rod Serling was the tailoring of this long-time weekly show around Elam, despite being an auxiliary in the flow of history. This episode ends as usual with a twist of action, but the shock and humor mix with the agility of "Serlingesque". <br /> <br /> Rex Lewis Field
