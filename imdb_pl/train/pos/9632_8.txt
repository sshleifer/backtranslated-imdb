The concept of having Laurel & Hardy this time as a chimney sweep turns out to be surprisingly fun. It guarantees fun situations and stupid antics, especially with Stan Laurel, of course, as usual. <br /> <br /> The film also has a topic with a professor who is working on a rejuvenation formula. It does not really sound like a logical mix of plot and incoherent, but both fictional lines perfectly match the unforgettable ending. It is still a bit strange, but still fun, so it works for the movie. <br /> <br /> The cast of the film is surprisingly good. Sam Adams is great because the stereotypical butler and Lucien Littlefield are delighted to be a lean professor. <br /> <br /> The film is filled with excellent sequential and funny sequences that are quite predictably observable despite the comic thanks to the way they are performed. All this helps to make "Dirty Work" one of the better shorts of Laurel and Hardy. <br /> <br /> 8/10
