Seeing this movie once again, it turned out that this time it surpasses me infinitely more than the previous times. Acting is stunningly great. The characters are very clear. Brad Pitt is simply wonderful as a stray son who is rebellious. Other actors and actresses are equally worthy in every respect. Robert Redford creates great art from the 1920s. The scenery is incredibly beautiful mountains and streams of western Montana. In summary, this is one of the best films made in the 90s. <br /> <br /> You must see this movie! <br /> <br />
