Honestly, I do not understand why this movie was such a big "flop" in advertising. Sharon Stone certainly has not lost anything of her charisma and "touch" from "basic instinct". I voted for this film 10 and I will tell you why: this time the game opens in London. London is the city where Catherine Tramell moved from the events in BI1. Again proves that he is mastermind manipulator of his own class - called. She "screwed your brain" as Catherine with such skill that in the end you are not sure who the real villain is. <br /> <br /> Regarding the technical part of the movie: Only the real defeat is the B-rate crew. Sharon Stone is the only really big name in the cast compared to her and Michael Douglas, etc. In the first part. I also think that BI2 would be better if Sharon Stone was a little younger, but she is still stunning in her appearance and only improved in terms of charisma. Her B-rate "assistants" are not so bad either, although I would like to have more names for the cast. <br /> <br /> I think that the basic story is quite good improvements. I think it's a much better thriller than much of what Hollywood is spreading so easily these days. The plot is great, technically easy to see, you do not snore in the middle of the movie and most importantly - the heather is on.
