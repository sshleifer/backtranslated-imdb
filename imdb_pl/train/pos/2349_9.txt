I am happy to see such creativity on TV again. It is a poetic, artistic and fun performance. Characters are good and writing is not bad (I think it will improve when they get their feet). It's definitely worth a look. <br /> <br /> The girls have been stealing the show in this series so far. Chuck is charming, just like Olive. Two aunts are a delight. I sincerely hope that they will write them in larger parts because they are magical. <br /> <br /> Well, that's all you can print. Make yourself a large bowl of popcorn and enjoy the fun in an old fashioned way. It is like Dr. Seuss for adults.
