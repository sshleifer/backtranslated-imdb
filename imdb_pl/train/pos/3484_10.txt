This is the best movie of all time! I'm sorry, Hollywood! I saw it in the early 70's, when it appeared on Bulgarian television, and I immediately loved it (I was 14 at the time). 25 years later I bought it on a video tape and a few months ago it finally appeared on DVD in Bulgaria. I've been living with this film for 35 years, just like all my friends and my family. My son was a teenager when he saw him for the first time, and he immediately adored him (and this generation grew up, watching practically only Hollywood movies and not speaking or understanding Russian!). What makes this Danelia's masterpiece so special? It's hard to say, because it's hard to describe what beauty is ... But the fact is that you can watch the movie dozens of times with the same pleasure as the first time. I do not remember any other such film, no matter how many millions it cost or how great the cast was ... Chapeau, Maestro Danelia! Bulgaria loves you!
