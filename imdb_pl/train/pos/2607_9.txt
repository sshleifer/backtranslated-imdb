The season's finale sent out mixed messages, I felt joy, as well as feelings of being lied to and cheated. Roseanne tells all her viewers that the entire ninth season was a lie because her husband Dan died. He also admits that the family has never won the lottery, and what season 9 was a lie, just because she wished it or wanted it. I'm still confused when she said that Becky finished with David and Darlene and Mark because Becky and Mark admit they're pregnant. So I believe that's what she wanted, but it was not. So the season finale was good, but sent mixed feelings. I will always be a fan of the series. :)
