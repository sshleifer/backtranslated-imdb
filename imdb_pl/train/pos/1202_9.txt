I really liked this documentary about Kenny and Spencer's attempt to break up The Dawn. It was great to look at how outsiders try to get inside to make him big. <br /> <br /> The story was well prepared and organized in an interesting way, thanks to which the film worked well. It's definitely worth watching. My only complaint is that they were not closed. Perhaps this is part of this point. We expect it, but in reality it did not happen (or it usually happens). <br /> <br /> The film is also a great way to see the personality of Kenny and Spencer outside the Canadian television program. You can see some of what is to come. <br /> <br /> I am looking forward to seeing the Papal chase.
