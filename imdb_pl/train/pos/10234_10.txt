<br /> <br /> "Burning Paradise" is a combination of the neo-Shaw Brothers action and the urban cynicism of Ringo Lam. When you watch a movie, you may feel that the fight scenes are just average, but it does not matter, his attitude and atmosphere matter. This great movie has both !! Always trying to be different than his peers, Lam gives us traditional heroes (Fong Sai-Yuk and Hung Shi-Kwan) and places them in the "Raiders of the Lost Ark" setting. However, these are not the light comedian incarnations that can be seen in the movie Jet Li. Instead, these people are fighting to death with brutal results. What makes a movie even better is that everyone can die at any time without restraining themselves. It is a pity that they do not make such films more often.
