The stories in this film are very fun and definitely worth seeing! The first concerns a young couple being harassed in the forest by two rednecks, with a great but unexplained twist of action at the end. <br /> <br /> The arrival is the best of many, and the same thing makes this value watching - a man is attacked by a dog who is afraid to be angry - finds refuge in what seems to be a hospital, but he learns that employees are not exactly what they seem to be ...... a great twist at the end, and the episode itself scores 10/10! If the others were on par with this, we would get 10/10! <br /> <br /> The third is the weakest of the whole group - the girl meets with the boys and has wild sex! It seems that history does not make sense to the end, with a good little twist, but it is spoiled by the terrible first part! <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, this is a great movie that will not make you wrong at all! It is worth to rent!
