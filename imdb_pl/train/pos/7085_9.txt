I just bought a DVD and I have to say (after watching Brazil and the fear of disgust in Las Vegas) Terry does it again. Terry Gilliam's genius, in addition to being a fan of Monty Python's films, accompanies this sci-fi thriller, in which Bruce Willis plays a great role as James Cole, and (perhaps my favorite character) Brad Pitt who played the madness of Goeef's Jeffere. It must be for science fiction fans, or cinema fans of any kind, because it contains suspense, drama, action, etc. <br /> <br /> any thread, In the future 1% of the world's population is going through a disease aimed at destroying the human race that has been in the past freed by the "army of twelve monkeys". James Cole (Bruce Willis) is sent back to 1996 (When the virus was released) to learn about the disease, so scientists can find a cure in their day. Before I go any further, James Cole lives in an underground society, and animals rule the world on the surface because of a disease that will kill people. in any case, when he is sent back in time, he is sent back to 1990, where he is sent to a psychiatric facility because of his statements to the people of the virus. During his stay, he meets Jefferey Goins (Brad Pitt), who later is mainly responsible for erasing the human race. He also meets with his psychiatrist (Madelein Stowe), who ultimately works with Bruce to save the world (because he sees that he is right in his statements), is sent back and forth from time to time and finally sent to 1996 where he then challenges his own mental health, but then stops to reveal the full-fledged end of the movie, and then relies on a somewhat shocking climax in which he tries to stop the virus-carrying man (not Brad Pitt) and instead he is shot by the police when the killer runs away.
