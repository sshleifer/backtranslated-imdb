This movie is as good as it is difficult to find. The protagonist of the film (as well as the writer and director) is Simon Geist - a man with a program. It creates a fake magazine just to have the right to hear pigs from Los Angeles - actors, models, musicians - who believe that their own defecations do not smell. Thanks to clever dialogue, Zucovic is successful. Of course, the budget for this movie was probably what he paid for the used car, but this movie is so solid and so well written that it works very well. Anyone who can play Edward Munk's "Scream" in the reflection of the silver trash can at the local coffee shop should be nominated for the prize. Give this movie a chance and listen to what it says ... because they make the same car since 1986 ... it's called a "car". Well done, Zucovic, bravo!
