This is the best film ever made to deal with the topic of AIDS. It is a documentary about two men living with this disease and dying. The film is beautiful, poignant, funny and incredibly moving. Above all, it is an amazing real love story. Make sure you have a few hankies ready before you watch this movie - you'll need them. Unusual.
