Another example of what British cinema can achieve: a simple story, told and well-preserved. Brenda Blethyn gives a layered and warming game as the recently widowed and financially deprived Grace, assisted by a solid cast. The "bizarre little city" card is played in the same way as in many TV series and films that have come from the British Isles in recent years (Ballykissangel, Hamish Macbeth and others come to mind). Like the above-mentioned film, it uses some of the stunning countryside landscapes, in this case the wet and wild coast of Cornwall. <br /> <br /> Some viewers may find acceptance of marijuana use a bit difficult, others may find the ending a bit sweet and safe. But it is definitely a nice cliff.
