Starring: Jim Carrey, Morgan Freeman, Jennifer Anniston I was very skeptical when I first saw the movie. I mean, what a conceptual NIGHT. Jim Carrey playing God? Nothing is sacred anymore. <br /> <br /> Well, this movie is not holy, but it's also not sacrilegious, at least not in any way. Yes, Jim Carrey has God's power for some time, but he is not God. Confused? I'll give you a lower level. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a reporter who is unlucky and feels unsuccessful. He lives with his beautiful girlfriend, Grace (Anniston), and you can immediately say that they love each other, but the relationship is quite shaky. <br /> <br /> Then Bruce gets a shot to the presenter, just to let Evan Baxter trick him away. Of course, I am not asking you, Bruce shares her thoughts with the world through television in a way that is comical and definitely worth the job. <br /> <br /> Bruce, complaining and grabbing God, gets a page. After some time, he will get tired of calling, so he answers and goes to the Omni Presents building (heh). There he meets God (Freeman) who is the boss, electrician and caretaker of the building. I found it very funny. God is the boss, the Holy Spirit is an electrician, and Jesus Christ is a caretaker. Think about it. Boss, obvious. An electrician, a guy who holds everything. Janitor, the guy who cleans the mess that left the world. BRILLIANT. <br /> <br /> In any case, Bruce is a bit skeptical about the actual encounter with God, but when God gives Bruce the power and gives him a chance to play God, he begins to believe a little. Wondering why. Get into gross abuse of power for personal gain and abuse your enemies. <br /> <br /> Because this is Hollywood, Bruce eventually gets better, learns his lesson and starts using his powers for the good of the world. In the end, he cries out that God will take him and pray that His will is done, not Bruce. <br /> <br /> Because this is Jim Carrey, the movie is quite funny, and certainly there are very funny moments in it. The film is not an ideal theology, but for Hollywood it is definitely a good test. Many of the statements in the film can be very provocative and even demanding, and I applaud Tom Shadyac for his effort in this film. <br /> <br /> So, although far from perfect, definitely a funny popcorn movie with a bit of thought behind it. <br /> <br /> Lower line: 3.5 out of 4 (worth seeing or two)
