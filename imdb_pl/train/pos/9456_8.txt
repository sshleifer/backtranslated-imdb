Unlike many other films that are disturbing either because of their unpleasantness (Man Bites Dog) or their sheer violence (most of Peckinpah's films), Delivery shocks with its credibility. Surely the buggery scene is quite simple because of its unpleasantness, but the effect of the film is much more of its slow gathering and tangible sense of isolation surrounding the four wires, both before and after everything that begins badly. The moment when canoes pass under the child on a bridge that does not even recognize people with whom he previously played music, let alone any human feelings about them, is one of the most sinister in the modern movie. Tension increases gradually during canoeing and lasts even after the final credits - the ending makes the meaning of heroes' attempts terrifyingly real. The credibility of the film is greatly assisted by the playing of the leaders, especially Ned Beatty and Jon Voight as a victim and reluctant hero. Burt Reynolds has never been better either. The cultural influence of the film can be demonstrated by the number of people who understand the reference to the "banjo territory" - perhaps only Get Carter has done such an effective job in the tourism industry in the region. I can come up with only a handful of movies that have led me to such a serious depression after they have finished - the overwhelming atmosphere of Se7en is the best comparison I can imagine. Although so many of them are perfect, Deliverance is first and foremost a classic, because there are no corresponding comparison points - it is unique.
