In the 1950s, age restrictions for films in Brazil were as follows: unlimited, 10 years, 14 years and 18 years. Usually westerns were allowed for ten years, when they were more violent than 14 years old, but it was rare for a western to be limited to the age of 18 very well, as this film was considered different than average. The hero James Stewart fought with his brother who killed their father. He was looking for revenge and seemed quite traumatic, away from the average good guy. Anthony Mann tried out variations on this type of character in the subsequent films he did with Stewart. Shelley Winters, the leader, was far from virtuous, following the man who was left with the rifle. Dan Duryea as Waco Johnnie Dean is one of those great villains who will always be remembered. The story of the film, which always follows the man who stays with the rifle, is one of the best adapted to the western. It was supposed to be made in the film by Fritz Lang, who did not enter the screens. When he was offered to Mann, he decided to start again from scratch and not take anything that was prepared for Lang. At Winchester, Mann created a different western concept, but he still kept all his traditions. Winchester is still a great movie that you can watch again and again, but nothing will be compared to the impression that has had on those who saw it when it was released.
