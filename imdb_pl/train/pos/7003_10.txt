The emotional influence of this movie defies words. It is elegant, subtle, beautiful and tragic, and all this takes two hours. This is Will Smith when he matures to his acting ability to the full extent. Who knew? I saw The Pursuit of Happiness and thought it must be a fluke for a hit, a super-actor, a Smith. His performances in both films show Smith a different dimension, sophistication of talent, selectivity of scenarios, I'm not sure, but now I look at him differently. Seven pounds is one of those movies to fully enjoy its essence, you have to suspend your faith. Do not watch it on the story, watch how fragile the state of the human heart is, both literally and metaphorically. It is a story of human guilt, penance, love and sacrifice.
