I watched it a few years ago. I remembered it as very mysterious situations and a mix of melancholy things, such as the fate of Dorothy and Bogdanovich's personal future. <br /> <br /> I turn to look at my copy of VHS, and then I look at it and more. Now I am waiting for the DVD version, at all costs, please! <br /> <br /> The country and easy music to listen to are very well selected from the first second, a little bluish, but also happy. <Br /> <br /> All characters are great for me, with funny situations, great acting and many dialogues that changed me as a cult movie and many people I met on the Internet or cinema clubs. It may not be a sacrifice. <br /> <br /> I think the title is a hope for life! You must be happy and laugh as much as possible <br /> <br /> I know that this may be a special commentary to the film, but the fact is that I like it very much, I think this movie marked me and I will never forget it.
