[WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS] <br /> <br /> I have this adult friend for whom the belief that her parents have sex makes him terribly restless. She remembered when I was thinking about the audience's reaction to "Mother." <br /> <br /> People gasped when May (Anne Reid) wandered passionately in bed with a younger lover handsome, Darren (Daniel Craig) or later saw sexual drawings until May. I doubt that the audience would be horrified by the content of nudity or drawings, just as uncomfortable seeing a woman in her sixties with a stunning sex. <br /> <br /> Screenwriter Hanif Kureishi ("My Son the Fanatic") again proves why he is one of the most talented storytellers on both sides of the Atlantic. His story is not easy to accept. This thrilling family drama is not a movie that can be considered a pleasure to watch because it is raw, complex and often makes us feel very uncomfortable. Nevertheless, it is a very good material. <br /> <br /> Kureishi and Roger Michell (who directed "Notting Hill" from all things) create an unsentimental, frightening and splendidly played portrait of an older woman who, despite everything, realizes in these years can and should enjoy all the pleasures life. In the wonderful epiphany moment when her son, Bobby, asks her not to be difficult, May shoots back: "Why not?" <br /> <br /> Why not. <br /> <br /> Anne Reid deserves an Oscar nomination for her turn in May. It is subtle, restrained, powerful and sad, often all at the same time. See Reid when May watches Darrena and Paula (Cathryn Bradshaw) in a seemingly passionate clutch in the pub. Or when she begs Paula to open the door after a catastrophic date. Reid's eyes and face reveal Maya's distress and despair. In the most destructive moment of the film, May falls to her knees in front of Darren, ready to do anything for him, just asking him to be nice. It's an incredibly brave act of an outstanding actress. <br /> <br /> I liked using Michelle's natural sound, especially when May and Toots come to Bobby for the first time. This perfectly illustrates the cacophony around May and Toots, the nonchalant way their family welcomes them. <br /> <br /> This movie sometimes reminded me of the honesty and severity of Mike Leigh's work, with the exception of "The Mother" holding a slight optimism to stay afloat. <br /> <br /> My one doubt: Michell's decision to give May and Darren the first love scene with an almost tacky sensibility. Lovers remain out of focus, while in the foreground the white curtain gently flutters in the wind. The only sound is May, in the fervor of passion. <br /> <br /> The problem with Michell's approach is that both Reid and Craig, who completely embrace the role of Darren, carelessly take on these roles, which is not fair enough to conceal the almost primitive energy of their heroes in front of the audience. Especially since Michell has no qualms about creating later sexual scenes. <br /> <br /> This movie does not have extremely nice characters. We sympathize with May, but she also causes her daughter's suffering. But I doubt Kureishi was going to tell people his story with a nice people. I believe that his goal was to expose the family, which is already breaking when something cataclysmically emotional happens. It is unwavering in its sincerity and ultimately unforgettable.
