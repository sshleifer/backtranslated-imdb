Homicide: The Movie turned out to be a good summary of a well-written, well-directed and well-played series. Loose ends were tied, which were not properly addressed at the end of the last season. The whole series, especially the film, provided a realistic look at life (and death) in Baltimore, a culturally unique city with an exceptionally high murder rate. My attractiveness for the series began long before I moved to Baltimore, but when I experienced life here for myself, I realized how realistic it is. And the movie certainly retained this spirit. I will certainly miss the new original episodes of the series, but I am very grateful to NBC and producers and cast for giving us the last look at the dark side of Charm City.
