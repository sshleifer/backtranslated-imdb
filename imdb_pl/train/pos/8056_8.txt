This picture from 1935 went away with all kinds of Ocars for the best director, John Ford, actor Victor McLaglen and music by Max Seiner. Victor McLaglen, (Gypo Nolan), "Call Out the Marines", 42, gave an excellent performance to the Irish rebel, who belonged to a rough and tough crowd who fought for the cause and at the same time became poorer and poorer with a lot of drinking. Gypo Nolan made a bad mistake when he decided to become an informer for his best friend to make a trip with the gala to America and a new way of life. Preston Foster, (Don Gallagher), "Official Guadalcanal", "43", gave a great supporting role as the leader of the Irish rebellion and wanted to capture the informer of his group. Gypo Nolan persecutes his betrayal of a friend and begins to feel like Judas. Great movie for 1935 and great acting of McLaglen, but rather depressing in every aspect of the movie.
