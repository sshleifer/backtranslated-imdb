As a forty-something-year-old discoverer / photographer and a longtime fan of the original Kolchak series: Night Stalker from early childhood, one of the aspects not really mentioned is the amount of urban exploration Carl took on during the series. He always managed to get into one big abandonment, channel or tunnel after another. Armed only with his faithful flashlight (well, so he had several flares in the original episodic monkey tunnel) and his camera, he never wore any other equipment to either protect himself or facilitate exploration. <br /> <br /> many here, recently I bought a set of DVD boxes with two pilot films and subsequent TV episodes and slowly returned to all the shows. And although I remember watching them in the early 70s, when they first aired, over 30 years have passed ... so many of them seem new again. Camps, outdated and bad - but charming and very funny. They just do not do these things today. Now all the recovered spin-offs with predictable characters and plots. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, my 16-year-old daughter is sitting with me and watching episodes with me and has recognition for them (enjoys the genre). It gives me hope and faith that the series will be continued by successive generations of fans for many years.
