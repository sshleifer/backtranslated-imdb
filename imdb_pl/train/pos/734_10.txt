This film is a shock of punk rock fun, from the beginning to the end. The Ramones, the reigning princes of late rock from the 70s, appear as themselves. PJ Soles acts as Riff Randle, a rebellious high school student who lives and breathes rock'n'roll. Riff is obsessed with writing songs for The Ramones, her favorite rock band. She keeps rockin 'at school and encourages her colleagues to join her in her joyful antics. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the school that Riff attends has just hired a new director, named Ms. Togar. She is a tall, intimidating Amazon woman. And he vows that the students will become "equal". He even has several students who act as monitors who report to her with dirt on their classmates. Mrs. Togar is particularly determined to catch Riff and put an end to Riff's anarchic insanity. But Riff has smart ways to defeat Togar, at every turn. <br /> <br /> Kudos for the wonderful performance of Mary Woronov, in her role as Togar. Mary is the legendary film actress B. In this film, she plays a fascist woman, Mrs. Togar, with a mocking taste. PJ Soles as Riff, turns into an electrifying performance. Clint Howard as a two-faced Eaglebauer, has a great time with his role. <br /> <br /> Ramones perform many of their hits in this movie. Viewers see why the Ramones were so influential in the punk scene in the '70s. This is certainly a good movie for Ramones fans. But even if you're not playing in Ramones or Punk Rock, this movie is a great explosion (literally) of energetic fun.
