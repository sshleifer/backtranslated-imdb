I am far from fan of Sylvester Stallone and I think that the only time I really appreciate his appearance was in the French movie Taxi 3, which is almost non-existent small role. And yet I must admit that this movie was not really that bad, although I was worried about the worst. <br /> <br /> When Gabe (Stallone) fails to save the girl of one of his friends, and she is plunged into death from a mountain of 4,000 feet, she is unable to force her to work as a mountain guard. For almost a year, he does not put food in reserve, but he returns. Soon after returning, they get an emergency call from a group of tourists who were trapped in a snow storm. At least that's what the guards believe. In fact, it is a group of thieves who crashed their plane in the mountains after their bold plan to steal money boxes from a flying government plane failed. The enclosures are spread throughout the reserve and need the help of professional climbers to retrieve them ... <br /> <br /> This is obviously not one of the most intelligent films in history, but in its genre it is a pleasant one. I especially liked John Lithgow as the mind of the evil master and the leader of the band of robbers. I know him best from the series "3rd Rock from the Sun", but I also liked his performance in this film. In summary, acting is fine, it offered a lot of actions and of course also some liners, but it also offered a very nice decor. This movie was filmed in a wonderful natural environment. I loved the snowy mountains and valleys, mountain rivers and forests ... Perhaps that's why I give the film a higher score than the one that normally gives me this action / adventure movie. I give him 6.5 / 10. If you do not expect too much, it's a nice movie.
