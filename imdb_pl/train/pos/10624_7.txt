I thought I should qualify my position after reading other reviews. The film is not great, but it has many great elements. Lighting and scenes along with camera work are great. The story is slow and weak, but fun. Acting is bad, but not worse than on the SyFy channel. The music is pretty good and the gore is good. The film has a great skin and is produced by Bruce Campbell. I watched the whole movie and although it was predictable, it was still pleasant. Women are attractive enough, and the main actor is having fun because he is deliberate and frightening. The film was extremely clean for a modern movie and violence appropriate for children aged 13 and older. There were no sexual scenes. I gave him 7 out of 10 and I think it's fair. I would watch it again if I had nothing better to do. The gay-sounding angel was the most annoying aspect of the movie, the devil is quite scary.
