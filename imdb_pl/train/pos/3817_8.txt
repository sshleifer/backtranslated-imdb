If you've had a drama in your life, both yours and someone close, the pain stages that this woman goes through (but, in my opinion, it could easily be a man), they are very real. It is a film about how you can not cope with the pain, that you do not know what to do to deal with it. Of course, this is also a film about how not to know how to help someone get close to their pain. It is a film that makes everyone aware of their suffering. It's a movie that can push someone to the edge ... which does not sound like a recommendation. I'm not sure if I would recommend someone to go see this movie, especially someone close, but for me ... it's a movie that presents things from perspective, which shows real pain and is therefore very important for being alive. It makes you realize that hey, you or a person who is living near you through pain, hey, all the things you're worried about right now are so little important
