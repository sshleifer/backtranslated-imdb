"The Luzhin Defense" is at first glance a story about an idiosyncratic scholar in chess (Turturro), which is absorbed by the game, and in the background by retrospection, his boyish life and forces that created the man he became. You play as good and evil in the form of his love interests (Watson) and former "mentor" (Wilson) and you have a pathetic drama full of poignant and gentle humorous moments mixed with the rich scenic beauty of the Italian Lake Como and the intensity of high chess game. An excellent film for those in period dramas, euphemistic metaphor of chess for authors to orgasm is a sign of a subtle joke behind the film.
