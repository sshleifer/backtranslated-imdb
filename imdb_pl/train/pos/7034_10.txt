when you sum up all aspects of the film --- dance, singing, acting - the only one that stands out as best in the cast is Vanessa Williams ... her dedication, energy and timeless beauty make Rosie an ideal role for her. I've never seen anyone introduce Rose with such energy! Vanessa's singing talent beautifully shows all the songs she performs, and Rose and her acting skills never cease to amaze me! Her dance is so amazing, even if some say that the choreography was bad - her dancing skills were displayed better than ever before! I recommend this version over '63 just because I think that although Vanessa's actress is long, it's great ----- not to mention that Jason Alexander and the rest of the cast are very impressive (except for Philips Chyna ... what they What the hell did they think when they threw it?) <br /> <br /> In total, I would say that this version is great and I would recommend everyone to see this version!
