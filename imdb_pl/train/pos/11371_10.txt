It's really an amazing movie achievement. From the very beginning I was completely connected to the (real) history when Lieutenant Viktor Burakov (Stephan Rea) is crying while carrying out autopsies on the bodies of children. This is the fascinating story of Andrei Czikatilo, wonderfully played by Jeffrey DeMunna (Green Mile). In fact, he plays it so well and so sympathetically that the viewer almost starts to pity him until we remember who he is. Psychiatrist Dr Alexandr Bukhanovsky, wonderfully played by Max Von Sydow, was completely credible in every detail, and the point he talks about paranoia in the Soviet Union is too visible in the behavior of the local Commissar of Bondarchuka, Joss Ackland. For me, however, the outstanding performance comes from Donald Sutherland, who once again proved who is a great character actor. I was almost in tears when he told Burakov how the FBI was following his work so closely. This film puts the silence of sheep in the shade, from the moody and bleak Soviet landscape to the excellent performances of all those involved. <br /> <br /> I am evaluating this film 10/10
