Wilhelm Grimm (Alexander Knox) ​​stands trial for Nazi crimes. Three witnesses testify - father Warecki (Henry Travers), brother of Wilhelm Karl (Erik Rolf) and former lover of Wilhelm Maria (Marsha Hunt) - before Wilhelm speaks in his own defense. The film ends with a summary by the court .... <br /> <br /> The film is based on three segments of retrospection, because each of the witnesses takes a stand. The story takes place mainly in a small Polish village, and the memorable scenes include the village's reaction to the death of Anna (Shirley Mills), whom Wilhelm accuses of rape; treatment of Jewish villagers preparing to be transferred to concentration camps; and a church service in which Willie Grimm (Richard Crane) condemns his Nazi upbringing while mourning his girlfriend Janina (Dorothy Morris), daughter of Marji, after she was shot in a brothel. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, Knox is contrite and very persuasive as a bitter, offended and evil man. Martha Hunt has a few strong moments and matches him with his strength, and Henry Travers is also very good in the role of a priest. This video shows an effective story that will stay with you when you're done.
