In her autobiography Laureen Bacall reveals that she told Bogie that she should not make such films like this or something like that. At that time, Douglas Sirk was called "wicked women", in fact he was restored to favors. at least in Europe, after he stopped directing. And when he filmed "written in the wind," Sirk made only three films: "impaired angels", "Time for love and time to death", his masterpiece, IMHO, and finally "imitating life" (1960). Then came the silence. Actually, the characters of Bacalla and Hudson are not interested in Sirka. They are too simple, too virtuous. Dorothy Malone - who was a kind of substitute for his former German star Zarah Leander - and her brother Robert Stack are the main interest in the story. constructed on a continuous basis, most of the film is a long retrospection. The instability of brother and sister, coming from the wealthy Texas oil owners, is brought to the fore by flashy clothes and rutilant cars that drive at the top speed on the side of the landscape. Malone's metamorphosis at the end of the film is stunning: a suit and a chignon, playing with a small dirk: he is ready to live, the rebel is tamed. Now alone because she lost Hudson (but he was not in love with her anyway). This end is somewhat reactionary, but the melodrama is reactionary par excellence, three years later, in "imitating life", Sarah-Jane (Susan Kohner) will be blamed because she does not know her place.
