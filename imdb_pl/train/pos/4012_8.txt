After some hardships, Johnny Yuma arrives at his ill uncle's ranch to take over daily operations, only to find out that the old man was murdered by his beautiful wife with a gold kicker and a malicious female brother. <br /> <br /> Good production values, pleasant performance of Damon's brand and airy action script make it a fun, if not exceptionally deep, above-average addition to the spaghetti western. <br /> <br /> Co-star Rosalba Neri is one of the hottest European grandmothers who ever love the screen. Here it is absolutely perfect as a cold user (and perpetrator) of weak men. <br /> <br /> Damon and Neri have appeared together in at least one other photo, The Devil's Wedding Night, a pretty good horror movie, which is a special interest for those who want to see what's under Rosalba's dresses.
