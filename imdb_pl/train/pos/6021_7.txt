Although it is not necessarily a so-called "classic" movie by today's standards, it's worth seeing. The main reason is that after experiencing this movie, you have the impression that you have also experienced the counter-cultural idealism of the 1960s, regardless of whether it is good or bad. <br /> <br /> It happened to me to see a movie in the English literature class at SUNY Geneseo, and although it initially seems to be just a senseless composition of icons from the 1960s, the film is far from being simply "thrown together" ". If the film remains dissatisfied and confused, the movie has fulfilled its role: it gives an empty view of the future that makes you feel insecure and angry. Perhaps it was the same feeling that the film tried to explore in his youth, which was an example. <br /> <br /> Therefore, "Zabriskie Point" can not tell a very good (or interesting) story, and at the same time its characters can be one-sided and predictable. However, this is so well conveyed by the stereotypical, rebellious desire to get out of existence that both Mark and Daria must share. Even anti-establishment students are just as inauthentic as the government against whom they rebel.
