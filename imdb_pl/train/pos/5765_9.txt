Zombie Bloodbath is a movie created by zombie fans for zombie fans with a real love for the Horror genre. As I understand from the commentary and the things I read, it arose during a massive flood in the Midwest in 1993, when half of Missouri was under water. The buildings were under water. cars and houses were under water. In one article, it was said that zombies and crew from this movie would help in hacking the river after shooting every day. The fact that this movie was made at all is a miracle. It's like a lot of zombies of every zombie movie ever made by Trom's filter. This is a party movie in which you can enjoy friends who like lots of splattered and silly characters. It's fast, energetic and really fun. <br /> <br /> A toxic leak in a nuclear power plant causes people to melt or turn into zombies. The local government covers it, breaks the factory and builds houses over it. Some land changes (?) Cause the opening of the cave to develop, and some new inhabitants find a cave and free the undead to a newly built community. From there, it just becomes crazy and bloody and funny. <br /> <br /> I have read these reviews several times. And it seems obvious to me that the same person attacked this funny little movie three times as another reviewer using fake names. They use the same words and sentences. Zombie Bloodbath is cheap. It is raw. He has some bad behavior. Like half of the movies. There is a lot of WORE there than this funny movie. If you hate this movie so much, do not buy it. There is no need for personal attacks and calling the crew or throwing a "Trailer Trash". And it is obvious that you are not from Australia or England. It's just annoying that this great service, IMDb, does not catch people who use it to destroy others. There are bad reviews and good reviews, and I do not mind. Personally, I give bad reviews and good reviews. But it is painfully obvious that some fool wants to use this forum for a personal attack on the director of this film. Court. <br /> <br /> Some of these so-called "reviewers" basically sue their "review" only to promote their own videos. This movie was called Boring - well, I love it or hate it, one thing NEVER can say about this movie is that it's boring. Moves quickly and never has a boring place. <br /> <br /> Oh, this reviewer from the Netherlands ??? Um - LIAR. You tried to publish the same review in Amazon and it was downloaded there. SAME review only said it was from Missouri. <br /> <br /> This nonsense must stop. I love it or hate it - give it a real review or do not enter anything. It is obvious that you have not seen movies. <br /> <br /> But for the recording, I have, and although this is not the best I have seen, it is far from the worst. And even the worst I would give real REVOEW and I would not attack the director personally. <br /> <br /> I hope this review will help some people see through the stupidity that happens here.
