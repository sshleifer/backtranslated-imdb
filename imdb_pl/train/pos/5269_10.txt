I love bad movies. Not only because they are often so funny as "really" good movies (like the Pirates of the Caribbean series and other Hollywood pathos), but they are often much better than these films. And that is the reason why I love the Italian rip off cinema from the 70s and 80s of the 20th century. And that's why I particularly like this movie, The Barbarians & the Company. <br /> <br /> Director Ruggero Deodato has made some really good films, such as House on the Edge of the Park, as well as his Atlantis Interceptors and Live Like a Cop. Die Like a Man are nice action movies. But this is really bad. Barbarians are such an idiotic movie. Peter and David Paul as Barbarian Brothers Kutchek and Gore are very funny because of their lack of charisma and acting skills. But if they can not act, they scream and scream whenever they do something important. In one scene, people try to hang the Barbarian Brothers and escape very extraordinarily. <br /> <br /> Bad acting, bad special effects, very stupid story, wrong direction, actually everything is bad in this film. I can not describe how much I laughed when I saw it for the first time. Barbarians and Kompania are a classic camp, which everyone should see one day. If you thought that Plan 9 From Outer Space is a fun camp, it will be a real killer.
