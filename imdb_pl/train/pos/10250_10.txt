Guinea Pig: The Devil's Experiment is undoubtedly a star at first glance, it is a harsh, realistic, frightening and disturbing look into the dark side of human nature. This movie gets to the bottom, maybe you're wondering what point it is? The idea is to please fans of extreme violence and gore. This movie has some blood, it tortures women more or less brutally. There are really only three scenes that can be considered gore. I will tell you one thing, though a guinea pig: the devil's experiment makes the hostility look like a sesame street. If you thought that Hostility is a crazy violent obstacle to torture, you will not see half of it until you see Guinea Pig: Devil's Experiment. <br /> <br /> Video rating 0-5, Gore 0 10 <br /> <br /> Guinea pig: devil experiment (Uncut) ***** (7)
