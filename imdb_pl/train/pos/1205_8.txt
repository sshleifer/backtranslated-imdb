This movie is exactly what describes its title - an attempt to get you to buy what writers have to offer. <br /> <br /> First of all, it's nice to see Toronto in 1996, which I remember with all its stupid hairstyles, sunglasses, clothes and attitude. It really has not changed; just a nice, safe, cheap, provincial little urban street, which is a great meeting place for international types of movies! It's also fun that Kenny and Spenny go to Los Angeles and find out that it's Toronto anew, only with a strange assortment of sunbathers, musicians, fortune tellers, and even more exclusive types of movies. I do not think that Pitch is a movie that you can enjoy; it is not entertainment, unless the viewer likes to enjoy trampling someone's aspirations. I take Pitch as a warning that power and money are really maintained by contractors and production houses. The would-be (and "successful") writers, musicians and actors are still ordinary transient even when they reach Great Time. <br /> <br /> So Kenny and Spenny try to sell you a warning. Buy or not, but the message still exists.
