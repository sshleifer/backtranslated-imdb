As baseball expires, this movie contradicts what I expect from a sports movie: an authentic-looking sports action, credible characters and an original storyline. While "Angels in the Outfield" fails miserably in the first category, the last two are successful. "Angels" tell the story of Roger and J.P., two Anaheim alumni in love with baseball, but they are looking for a family, with family franchise woebegone Angels, fighting to attract fans and win games. Filled with the father's promise that they will be a family only when the Angels get a pennant, Roger asks for heavenly help and receives it in the form of diamonds living in diamonds, aimed at reversing the downward spiral of the franchise. And when short-lived manager George Knox (played Danny Glover) begins to believe what Roger sees, the band suddenly hopes to change their season - and Roger and JP find something they can believe. Especially Glover gives a nice performance, and Tony Danza, playing on the pitcher, also does well, even though he has the ZERO idea of ​​how to jump out of the windup!
