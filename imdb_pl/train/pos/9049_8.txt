There is an old saying that refers to the thrilling new Joe Johnston movie, which sounds more or less like this: "A man who thinks he can and a man who thinks he can not is right." This is a very presumptuous statement regarding self-motivation and belief in the individual, which in this film is true even after the obstacles stand in the way and family problems. <br /> <br /> "October sky" is a young man who believes in Homer Hickam, growing up in a strict, traditional family in the 1950s. Homer loves a small mining town where almost every man grows into a miner. All his friends, Quentin, Roy and O'Dell, all think that their life after high school will be like everyone else. Homer does not go out of this future. <br /> <br /> One night, when everyone is staring at the sky, a Russian spacecraft called Sputnik is arriving. This is something new for Homer and he thinks it is spectacular and overwhelming. From then on, his view of life will never be the same. <br /> <br /> First of all, he tells everyone that he wants to work in the area of ​​rocket scientists in order to practice. Taken aback by what he says, his family passes this thought over their heads and continues to live as usual. However, his friends think that this idea may have some potential. After all, Quentin is very smart when it comes to this kind of thing. <br /> <br /> When four friends start to test model rockets and blow up a small fence, what seems to be a forest fire is terrified by them, they are forced to complete their progress. <br /> <br /> The performances in this movie are completely riveting from beginning to end. All actors give performances as if it were a real mumbo jumbo here. Outstanding fame: Laura Dern as Miss Riley. This can be material from the Academy Awards if the judges remember the beginning of the year in which the film will be released. <br /> <br /> Characters are also very well developed. Not only do filmmakers give a clear, apparent reason why Homer is interested in this subject, but they also explain to the audience how they are successful in rocket research. We clearly understand all the motives and beliefs of the heroes, especially the father who is bending over the eternal tradition. <br /> <br /> The movie, unfortunately, loses some of its momentum halfway because of a stupid, recycled romantic sub-story with the participation of Homer's love and how his brother stole it. This kind of phenomenon is becoming so common in high school movies that the film is not aimed at high school students. The actors stare at each other thoughtlessly, as if in a trance. I endured it without complaining about "1997 Inventing the Abbots", but I had enough of that. <br /> <br /> But this is just a small complaint. With an authentic look, cinematography worth the Oscar and movies from real life of Homer and friends at the end, who all fulfilled their dreams, especially Homer, this is the first great film of the year 1999. <br /> <br />
