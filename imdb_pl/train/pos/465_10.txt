Marlene Gorris has been named one of the best directors in the world. This sensitive, visually beautiful film is based on the history of Vladimir Nabokov and well reflects the writer's dark irony. John Turturro gives what I think is the best (usually I'm not his fan); and Emily Watson is also brilliant. Worth to see.
