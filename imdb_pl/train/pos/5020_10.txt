This is what a movie should look like, trying to capture the essence of what is very surrealistic. It has this foggy overtone that is rarely captured on film, it seems to be a sequence of dreams and really takes you into a dark, haunting memory. The children were extremely reliable and I expect that some things will come to them in the future. A very natural game for such young people, I do not know if Bill pulled them out of them or just fine but no less perfect. As far as I was concerned, Bill took on KevNJeff's comment about Mr. Paxton, who might act in that role. In my opinion, he played this role quite well. It comes from someone who said that Hamlet was good (The Ethan Hawke Version?) Wow ......... Do not listen to his comments. Great traffic, make you feel really uncomfortable, if you want? The cinematography is also above average.
