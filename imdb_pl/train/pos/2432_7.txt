I remember Casper's comics, but I do not remember any cartoons. Maybe they were not unforgettable; I do not know, but at my advanced age I look at this very early Kacper yesterday. Then I was shocked to read the comments of users here. Have people longed for the ending? <br /> <br /> I have to learn again that Casper is not like other ghosts who like to go out every night and scare c-p away from everyone. "He sees no future in it," according to the narrator here. Instead, one evening he goes out into the rural part of the city, accidentally scares some animals and can not find friends. He brings him to tears until the little fox hears, how he yells and befriends him. Two become buddies, but soon the fox escapes in search of fox hunting in progress. <br /> <br /> All other reviews mentioned what is happening, so I will also mention it. The fox is killed by hunting dogs (not shown), and Casper cries for the loss of "the only friend I've ever had." But no one mentions the happy ending of this story. "Ferdie" the fox becomes a spiritual figure, like Casper, jumps to his knees, licks his face, and the narrator comments on "lived happily ever after." Both characters look happy. <br /> <br /> What's so sad about it? It's a nice story with a nice, happy ending.
