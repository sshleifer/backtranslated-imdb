This movie is simply amazing. It was a very delicate subject, and the movie was great. This film did not cause any controversy in India (as far as I know), and his ad was also low. At first I thought this movie would be a waste of time because most of the Indian directors and producers changed the subject, even though it is very sensitive and adds a love story to the original story and spoils the whole ... most Indian viewers would agree on this subject if you remember o Ashoce, Mangal Pandey, LOC etc. <br /> <br /> There were so many films in India that would become a milestone or mega hits if part of the love story were not added unnecessarily. <br /> <br /> But its treatment is very similar to the Pinjar movie (also a must watch). <br /> <br /> If that matters, I would like to thank Anil Kapoor (producer) and Firoz Abbas Khan (director) for making such a great movie ...
