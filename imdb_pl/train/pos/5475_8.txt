Finally, the unprocessed version of the surface of "Baby Face" and from what source? Library of Congress. Restored four minutes, fragments here and there, create a much better movie. We now know that Baby Face has been wounded by her old man since she was at least fourteen years old. Another reason for her behavior and cold, calculated appearance. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck is really amazing in the role of Lily Powers (pay attention to the moniker), the part that required the right amount of sexuality covered with power, cunning and revenge, but tinged with a virgin pretext, when it is required, very difficult for presentation. Barbara Stanwyck gives the necessary nuances to show that although she sleeps on her way (literally), she still has a good heart - notice how she treats those few who were nice to her, such as Chico (great actress Theresa Harris) and an old philosopher. And although he uses his sexuality to make a mash of rich and powerful people, the same men try to use it for their carnal desires without the intention of lasting bonds until they fall in love with her. <br /> <br /> Lily Powers at the beginning does not understand that emotions are difficult to drive, it is easy to lose control. One possible result is death. Connecting a wagon to a star, obviously materialism, can lead to a goal in which nothing else exists except ephemeral and it is a cold, lonely place. <br /> <br /> You should say a word about the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche, whose will of power is emphasized in "Baby Face" by an older philosopher who befriends Lilly while he is still doing tricks for his old man. "Baby Face" was released in the same year in which Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany. Although it is highly unlikely that half-literal Hitler would understand much about Nietzsche, he considered Nietzschean to be the ninth degree and advertised him next to his other rant. "Baby Face" serves as an accusation of the popular interpretation of Nietzsche's will power, especially in the final scenes. <br /> <br /> Although "You have the sweetest little face of a child". is apropos as a theme for "Baby Face", an even more eloquent and appropriate melody is "St. Louis Blues' WC Handy, especially at a time when the camera has to depart from what would otherwise be sexual scenes. "St. Louis Blues "is also wisely used towards the end when Lily begins to see eternal values ​​beyond materialism. Chico sings a raw, malicious version of "St. Louis Blues, "when Lily, disagreeing with the lyrics, orders her to stop. <br /> <br /> The restored version of "Baby Face" makes the film more modern in its approach and attitude to sex as power than many new releases in Hollywood. At all costs, look at this jewel from the distant past and enjoy.
