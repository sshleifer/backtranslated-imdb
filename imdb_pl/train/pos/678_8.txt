The first international success of Peter Weir, THE LAST WAVE, is above all an impressive aggregate with a fascinating story based on Aboriginal myths. Richard Chamberlain gives good results as a defender whose life becomes more and more detached from reality when he delves into the murder involving Aboriginal tribal rivalries. David Gulpilil plays one of the suspects who tries to lead Chamberlin through the kingdom of "Dreamtime", an alternative reality / timeline central to Australia's native history and tribal custom. Heavy climate, deliberately ambiguous in delineation, the film builds a disturbing finale, which is somewhat weakened by weak effects, probably due to budget constraints. Nevertheless, an intriguing movie whose general impression of mystery and fear lurks just below the surface of what we perceive as "reality" will remain with you.
