Far from my second favorite Spielberg cartoon, after Animaniacs. Even if the ratings were low, so what, I still liked and liked, it was so fun and I loved the cast, wow Jess Harnell and Tress Macneille were there and they were just fantastic, the whole cast was brilliant, especially the legendary Frank Welker. <br /> <br /> I would like to see this cartoon again, it was amazing, and the jokes were brilliant. I also remember the funny moment in which scenes from the brain appeared, you heard his voice and played on the instrumental topic of PATB, it was just fantastic, I love them in these cartoons when episodes appear. I loved them
