First of all, I have never been afraid of this underestimated jewel as a child ("The Little Mermaid" on the other side ...). As my title says, it was one of my favorite childhood movies that I still love as a teenager. It is a beautiful, bittersweet film about a German shepherd named Charlie (fantastic voice of Burt Reynolds), who is killed by his boss / partner in crime (his name is ha, ha is Carface). Charlie is sent straight to the sky by default because "all dogs go to heaven because, unlike humans, dogs are good, loyal and nice by nature." Chalie is sent back to Earth because he finished his life clock, in which he gets into even more trouble with his best friend, Itchy and a small orphan, Anne-Marie. I used to watch it all the time as a child and I still sometimes watch it. Anyway, it's a beautiful bittersweet movie, as I said before, which can just leave a tear in the eye ...
