There are not many films about Lighter-Than-Air (LTA) aviation, but it's one of them and it's damn good. Just a nice movie to watch. <br /> <br /> Most of the film takes place in the navy of NAS Lakehurst (with NAS Tustin in the role). Wallace Beery plays sympathetic but Munchausen-like senior boss Ned Trumpet, a captain, whose high stories have become so common that no one really believes him. Half the fun is approaching the end of the movie, when events start to prove that most of his more bizarre stories are indeed real. <br /> <br /> During World War II, the main plot focuses on the Trumpet bachelor, encouraging the local widow only to end the father-son relationship with the crippled widow's son, Jess. He said that he would never walk without a bullet through the doctors, the Chief Trumpet pulls the strings, and the naval flight surgeon helps in restoring the boy's crippled leg. Jess joins the Navy to become an air force officer, flies back to Lakehurst and faces a completely new challenge. <br /> <br /> A very well made film, although some technical advisors and visible inability of Beery to march in a step have gone beyond some cunning dialogue with Hollywood. Otherwise, the film will get good marks for technical accuracy and cast a rare look at the Navy's LTA operations. The cash register scene, the exchange between Trumpet and the future love interest of Jess, Cathy, is an absolute bang.
