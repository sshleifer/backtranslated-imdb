This movie must be my favorite movie of all time. It should not have a story because its creators wanted people (Charlie Sheen, I think) to believe it was a real snuff movie. It was an exercise with visual effects and does not cut off when the action happens like any other movie. Nowadays, movies focus exclusively on sound effects, thanks to which images created by computers make it easier for them to deal with CGI blood. There are still filmmakers who still can not get fake blood to look real. There is no rape scene because it was not the purpose of the movie. Did you see that the hills have eyes 2? The rape scene was fun and not shocking. Although I am sure that some porn makers of GONZO tried to marry porn with horror. But because they probably shoot movies, they probably would not be able to do that. The film "Baise Moi" has a disturbing rape scene, because the actresses are actually porn stars and show everything, even though the movie is sucked. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that the film can not be done without thinking about the monetary aspect of all this, especially when it comes to assessing AO or NC-17. I'm sure Eli Roth has the ability / talent to make his movie series in the hostels much better, but he too tamed it to get a rating of R ... or at least I hope his films are useless because of these restrictions. <br /> <br /> Watch traces of death or more than crushed pumpkins if you do not want any additional recordings (scene of an accident / crime / recording). Do not forget that this movie was made in 1985. The fact that this movie can still defy the majority of nonsense that is being said today says a lot about this film. It would be like someone said 8bit Super Mario Brothers sucks because PS3 has better graphics.
