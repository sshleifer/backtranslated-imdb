I remembered that I saw this movie when I was a child in the wonderful world of Disney. This film has been in my memory for over 30 years and I was looking for it. I would have to say that of all the children's films that I saw then, this one showed more than all, and after seeing it only once, I hoped to see it again. The story and images of this film have been burnt in my memory. To this day I have never seen it that day in the '70s. In fact, I never remembered the title until I found it on the Internet before. I loved it and I want my children to see it. Does anyone know where I can find him?
