I do not know why people think it's such a bad movie. It has quite a good plot, good action, and changing Harry's location does not hurt either. Be sure to make some of it offensive and unreasonable, but this is not the only such movie. Eastwood is in good shape as Dirty Harry, and I liked Pat Hingle in this movie as a policeman from a small town. If you like DIRTY HARRY, you should see this one, much better than THE DEAD POOL. 4/5
