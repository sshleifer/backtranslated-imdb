"I moved here to escape this kind of thing!" The sheriff of a small town laments. <br /> <br /> "It happens often in Chicago?" His deputy asks. <br /> <br /> Well, no, not exactly. The conspiracy is that a group of Martians mistook the Halloween broadcast of Orson Welles' world war as a report from a real Martian invasion and concluded that they must take part in the action! Below are some misfortunes associated with random attempts by Mars to conquer the city "Big Bean, IL". They all come to the conclusion that they are children in really good clothes, except for the daughter of Sheriff and her friend, a kid in a suit with ducks. <br /> <br /> Sami Martians are comical, and you have the impression that they do not pose a threat to anyone outside of themselves quite early. It's a fun family movie.
