Before watching this movie, I read an article about Dan Jansen's Olympic and personal journey. I am always intrigued by the story of hope and overcoming life-changing events, and this was no exception. <br /> <br /> The background of characters that are delivered gives a sense of closeness to the family and how it has positively influenced the lives of others. I can not talk about the accuracy of specific details in this video, usually a creative license is organized while organizing the script. However, the spirit of Dan and his family counts. <br /> <br /> This is a valuable movie from the story that needs to be told. I felt empathy for the heroes and cheered for the end.
