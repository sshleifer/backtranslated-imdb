An excellent picture of one of the more unhealthy aspects of this era. I loved visuals - very suitable for the story associated with the graphic novel. <br /> <br /> I thought Tom Hanks was really great at it, he came across very well for someone who was hardened by his job (which he did not choose himself) but still wants to live normally for his family. He does everything in his power to see it. I do not want to spoil the story - but YOU have to see this movie if you're a person who wants more than a normal action shoot / em up / gangster. (But this is brutal.)
