I loved this movie! Chris Showerman did an amazing job! Not only is he an amazing actor, but he is wonderful with an amazing silhouette! He did a great job of supplying his lines, and he changed into George better than Fraser. A great performance for his first big roll! This movie is full of funny scenes that every child will love. My children have watched this movie many times since we bought the DVD on the day it was released. In addition to the movie additions on DVD are equally fun. Two thumbs up! I highly recommend everyone!
