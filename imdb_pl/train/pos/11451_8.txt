A highly engaging documentary about Scottish artist Andy Goldsworth, whose work consists mainly of ephemeral sculptures made of elements from nature. His work consists of rocks, leaves, grass, ice, etc. Which are blown away when the wave reaches the beach or the wind blows in the field. So most of Goldsworth's works do not really last, except for photos or videos about what they were. Now you can say that Goldsworthy's work is a reflection of mortality or words for that purpose, but is not it easier to say that what he does is just beautiful art. And at a time when the stereotype of artists says that they are mainly bitter, pretentious, often mentally unstable people living in disintegrating urban conditions, Goldsworthy seems to be against: a stable, unpretentious family person who loves nature and lives a small village in Scotland (of course I am sure that these are the same reasons why people from the world of art avoid it, who discovered that his works are fluffy or superficial).
