To Be Honost With you I think everything was so good in this movie that there should be no reason why he would not go to the movie theaters, The Deaths in the movie are amazing, fx are amazing when they're used. There are a few boring moments when the story follows a little girl, but all in all it was a very good movie, which I hope one day will get the props that it should. The first part of the movie is the reason why he came straight to the video, killing a little boy, but then the story is based on a little girl and her mother who came to visit the boy with his mum who moved to try to become a writer. The property he buys turns out to be the place where Witch Fairy lives, and anyone who lives in her home or goes to her property will be in great danger, I do not want to really give away anything if you want to see the movie, and then it is worth the rental price
