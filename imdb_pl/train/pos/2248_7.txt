Surprising rent in a local video store, I was glad that I found media satire enough to challenge Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers. And almost so disturbing. I think it was good when I watched it at the end of 2004, watching a Republican machine that does magic on most popular American television. The question "Are we really those manipulative?" Appears. <br /> <br /> It definitely distorted my view. A larger theological question - the history of Christ - was also provoked. Does an oral word and overwhelming dependence on something used as television create a messiah? Could the history of Christ be exaggerated? Could it be completely fabricated? It's something that the film puts in an extremely perceptive light.
