After watching "Guinea Pig" two questions appear (except "Am I really a psychopath to watch it?"): "Is it snuff?" The answer is no; even though it's the nearest snuff movie I've ever seen. And then: "Where the hell did they find this girl?" Because he is tortured for 45 minutes without giving any reasons (in fact there is nothing more in this movie!): Nails torn off, beaten with hands, feet, tools, infested by worms, ... and much more until the last scene (still not I'm sure how they did it). Because it belongs to the "underground Japanese scene", it is obvious that it did not get much money. What were her motivations? <br /> <br /> I saw it in Japanese without subtitles, but it's not a problem (no real dialogues, boys just offend her in a few scenes). I have not seen the whole show yet, but the first "guinea pig" is not known for being the best. I still have 8 points, because if the goal was to convince people to this snuff, the problem is quite good (ask Charlie Sheen, the actor). But I think they could go further, what they did in the next. <br /> <br /> Another movie that I hid from my parents. <br /> <br /> 8/10
