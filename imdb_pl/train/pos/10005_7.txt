Yes, this is art ... to successfully create a slow thriller. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds in nice volumes, while you will not even notice that this is happening. <br /> <br /> A great performance by Robin Williams. Sex angles in the movie may seem unnecessary and can probably affect how much you like the movie. However, the main plot is very addictive. The movie is in no hurry with you and still holds you tight enough to make you wonder. The direction is good. Using lights to achieve the desired effect of tension and surprise is good. <br /> <br /> A very nice 1-time observation, if you want to lie down and hear an exciting story!
