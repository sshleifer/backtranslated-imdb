Be careful with this. Once you get the gloves, it will change the way you look at cinema-cinema. You will miss the story of all kung fu movies now, you will want the depth of character and development, you will desire mystery and unpredictability, demand dynamic camera operation and amazing scenes. Unfortunately, you will not find all of these aspects together in a single kung fu movie EXCEPT Five DeathSome JADS! <br /> <br /> Easily the best kung-fu movie of all time, Venoms combines a rich storyline, full of twists and turns, with colorful (and developed) characters, along with some of the best pictures from the 70's. The success of someone who likes a movie depends on the viewer's ability to decipher which character is the one who specializes in the venom. One of them is Centipede, two are Snake, three are Scorpions, four are Lizards, and five are Toad. Each character has different characteristics, features, strengths and weaknesses. This is the hook we learn with the student's figure, finding out who these different men are. We are in his shoes (so to speak) and we have to choose who we trust and who not, just like him. We learn with him. <br /> <br /> Not only the plot, characters and camera are great, but it's also fun to see what in my book makes it more valuable than almost any other movie of its kind. It's worth a lot of watches to check everything that's going on. Venoms is a lesson on what a kung fu can really do ... just do not expect many other kung fu movies to meet your expectations.
