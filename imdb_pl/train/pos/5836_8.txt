Yes, as other reviewers have already said, this may not be the L & H annual, but this is not their worst job as in the 20th century Stupid ... I mean Fox. This film certainly contains all the basic ingredients that can help boys. But their serious attitude and determination make them funny. They do not play for laughter like other comedians, but they treat their work and situation quite seriously and this is the essence of their eternal humor. In this film, there are several basic problems that each of us can face today, namely work-related stress. First, the doctor would check us out, and he would rewrite the much needed rest and maybe stop by the sea. Surrealism appears in all of this. L & H always takes the most likely set of circumstances and exaggerates it, but it is never unbelievable, except maybe once in a while. It makes us laugh because we can refer to their situation which caused trouble and attempts to free ourselves. It makes Stan and Ollie multipurpose in its appeal. In this movie, all these ingredients are presented in a wonderfully ingenious and grateful way. Not so much in comparison to their earlier work, probably because it was the last film they made for Roach because he wanted to reflect "big" studios and create only functions, and he wanted to hurry up and finish his contractual obligations. BIG MISTAKE! Everyone should have stayed together and continued for maybe five years. What the world could have missed, without considering it an option. Watch, laugh and enjoy it as their last great performance.
