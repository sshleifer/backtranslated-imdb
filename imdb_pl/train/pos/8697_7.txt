They often laugh at the loud fun of sex, family and classes in Beverly Hills that laugh at the zip code, than you can see since Granny and Jed Clampett. The plot focuses on two chauffeurs who have bet on which one of them can put his employer (both single and soon lonely ladies, pretty sexy - Bisset and Woronov). If Manuel wins, his friend will pay the debt to the brutal Asian street gang - if he loses, he must play downstairs with his friend! <br /> <br /> A lot of cunning dialogue, quite sick humor etc. But many comedies are just below the surface. Bartel is remembered as a very sensual family member who ends his sexy, teenage niece on an annual "missionary trip" to Africa. <br /> <br /> Funny fun.
