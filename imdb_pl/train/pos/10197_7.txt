Well, it was a long year and I am ready to review the last movie for 2004. Panaghoy Sa Suba (Call of The River) took second place in the last Metro Manila film festival. As expected, this did not work well at the box office, because it was too artistic for ordinary moviegoers, especially since MMFF is a season in which many families go out for movies. <br /> <br /> It was quite intriguing to see a movie on the screen that was not in Filipino or English. I thought that Cesar Montano did a good job as both a star and a director. His great vision and creativity really helped this film. He was also very effective as the main star and was able to express the wide range of emotions that were required for the film. Young actress Rebecca Lusterio also did a good job. She did great job as Bikay, younger sister of Duroy. I hope that I will see it in many other film projects in the future, maybe in other genres. I think the fact that this movie was in her local dialect really helped her. <br /> <br /> Some camera shots were done very well. The scenery was breathtaking, although I feel that if less effort would look completely different. <br /> <br /> Regarding the story, I feel that the writers could delve into the lives of the smaller form of cinematography. I certainly will not be delighted with the story of this film.
