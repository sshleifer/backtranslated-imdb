I wanted to see it the longest, James Merendino is a great director. SLC Punk is one of my favorite movies, and in the first ten minutes of the movie I thought it was a great continuation, but it starts to drag. Acting and direction were great. In fact, everything in the film seemed to flow except for the script. Sometimes the only thing I paid attention to was the fact that the cast was the most beautiful woman in the world, Claire Forlani. This movie was good, but I expected more. <br /> <br /> P.S. Look for great scenes by Chi McBride and Chris McDonald.
