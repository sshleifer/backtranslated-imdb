First of all, this movie is painfully beautiful. Someone who works on 3D CG films as a lighter / composer, visions have dispelled me. Every second I was stunned by what was on the screen. When it comes to history, it's good. It will not ignite the world, but if you like your futuristic stories about Blade Runners (and who not?), You'll be fine. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I felt that the voice game is particularly bland and negatively affects the movie as a whole. I saw it in the cinema in English, but I hope that there is a floating French version somewhere. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing.
