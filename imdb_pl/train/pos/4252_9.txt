this movie will take you inside in the early minutes and keep it to the end. has a very human story and very well chosen music. The work of Moritz Bleibtreu (Giancarlo Amato) and Barnaby Metschurata (Gigi Amato) is satisfying. Recommended for people who get bored with action movies and want to see a good movie.
