I did not come close to "Still Crazy" with real expectation. Just another rock'n'roll picture, I thought ... good nostalgia for baby boomers. This movie is partly like that, but much more. Brian Gibson, director, previously ran the biography of Tina Turner, and is quite successful in his style. I suppose it's good that it was his last movie. <br /> <br /> The cast is well chosen. Bill Nighy is a perfect team leader. Actor - director Bruce Robinson appears as the guitarist of the band. He does a great job, even though he has not appeared on film since the late 70's. If you're looking for a moving and funny movie (with some great songs), you found it. <br /> <br /> 7.4 out of 10
