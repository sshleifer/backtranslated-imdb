The worst movie of all time? Wow, whoa now. You can not be serious. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's what you want from the movie. I live in Oregon, so I could enjoy beautifully filmed shots of friends, but still incredibly beautiful Smith Rocks and other areas in Central Oregon (as well as a sweet episode of our own Ken Kesey and Ken Babbs looking at Sissy's cradle at the beginning of the movie). The same were enough to encourage me to give the film a better quality than the "average" result. <br /> <br /> Or ... Maybe it's what your expectations are. After reading the AGES book of this and thinking "goodness, no one can ever make a movie out of this interesting, weird, strange book ... especially 20 years later, when customs (MORAYS - can not enter accent mark online) have changed" - I was quite pleasantly surprised when I first saw the movie when it appeared in 1994, and even more liked it today, watching it again. <br /> <br /> Sissy was superbly staffed, and I do not care what you all say, I was also pleasantly surprised by the performances of Rain Phoenix and John Hurt. I'm not a lesbian or a bi or a trance, but I've met a lot of people who are similar to the people they were supposed to portray - and these "real" people acted just like those actors did. Stilted bit, stage-ey - always a little "on". Gus Van Sant is one strange native Oregonian, but by garsh he did a good job adjusting this crazy book, IMHO.
