Esther Kahn is a young Jewess who lives in a crowded Jewish ghetto in nineteenth-century England. It is surrounded by lush, arduous, gloomy, devoid of any characteristic features, worn brick architecture, narrow pavements and streets, darkened windows and hordes of crowds in black-brown jackets. <br /> <br /> He lives in a small apartment with her large family who runs a clothes shop in the apartment. As a child, she worked, had no privacy, wore colorless clothes, shared a bed, and remained silent to avoid mocking her mother and siblings who made her laugh at them for imitating their boredom. <br /> <br /> As a young woman, her life remains the same - there is no privacy, she lives in a mental and physical state, lethargy and inertia, emanates with an empty, expressionless expression, she is dressed in ordinary, nothing stand out clothes and is constantly persecuted and dwarfed by gray, mundane, massive buildings and narrow streets, narrow corridors and narrow doors, as well as her loud mother and siblings and the prosaic, banal lifestyle of her family. <br /> <br /> Only she is a form of mental escape is Yiddish theater. Sitting on the balcony, in the first row, leaning against the railing, there is a huge space between her mind and the stage, the space that allows her to breathe, think, feel and miss her. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the freedom of thought provided by Ester to the open scene, her face and body remain shamelessly sleepy, indifferent, dispassionate. <br /> <br /> The simple and common look of Summer Phoenix genially captures the impassive behavior of Estera - Lato / Esther does not convey any desire for anything to desire or predict anything. <br /> <br /> After an extreme explosive confrontation with his mother, Esther finally decides to free herself from the grim life in which she is imprisoned. <br /> <br /> She is eventually cast in smaller parts in several stage plays and meets with Nathan Quellen, depicted by the quintessential British actor Ian Holm, who begins to teach Esther the technical skill of acting. <br /> <br /> From then on, Esther begins an exhausting double journey in which he learns how to act and how to feel. <br /> <br /> She begins to experience emotions she has never felt before and begins to gain the experience she needs to fully understand and control the technical aspects of acting. <br /> <br /> Nathan guides her through the stage through physical and emotional steps of surprise, hesitation, anger, disgust, self-loathing, etc.; then it begins to pass through these emotions in your personal life. <br /> <br /> There are three truths, says Nathan - the truth about how the character reacts, the truth about how the actor will react, and the truth that the character and the actor are not the same person. <br /> <br /> These technical steps and three truths slowly deconstruct the defense of Esther and lead her to two building experiences in the solution of the film, which mark the beginning of her freedom of thought, movement and emotions. <br /> <br /> Esther Kahn is a technically difficult film to watch due to its strange and narrow camera shots, a poor direction of the photo, which captures the realistic, colorless surroundings of the ghetto and the characteristic of Summer Phoenix and a bland and unattractive portrait that He brilliantly reflects Kahn's mental and physical attitude and lethargy and bland nature. <br /> <br /> A movie that must be seen for people who want to learn technical crafts and for people who value the minimal style of ilms and character research.
