I think the movie was pretty good, I'll add it to my "classic collection" after this time. I think I've seen other posters that reminded some of the more sophisticated people that it's still just a movie. Perhaps some of the more esoteric points are contrary to the "logic", but many religious matters accepted "in faith" do not pass the odor test. If you want to accept any faith you subscribe to, you can definitely accept the movie. Whether it's just me or someone else noticed that Aja-Yee Dagger is the same possessed knife, Lamonte Cranston had so many problems with mastery in The Shadow. Not to mention this in the trivia section for any movie here (IMDB), but I would put a dollar on a donut, it's the same prop.
