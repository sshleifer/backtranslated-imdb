"The Kennel Murder Case" starts on the run and does not end until the very end. Everyone had a reason to kill the victim and several people tried. William Powell is wonderful as Philo Vance, a gentleman detective. Mary Astor is a refreshing niece who only wants to marry her Scottish gentleman and enjoy her heritage. This movie is combined with "Nancy Drew, Reporter" on DVD, which is also fun. If you need to borrow a CD (or check it in your local library), do it. It's pure entertainment!
