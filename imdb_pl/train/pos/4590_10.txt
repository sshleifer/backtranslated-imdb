Maybe the movie itself is not one of Jackie Chan's best films, but I think everyone will agree with me that the fight in the mall was one of the best fighting scenes. There were also unforgettable acrobatics that were so impressive that they made the film a classic action. This movie has influenced many other action movies and I think that today's action film makers should learn from this film (as if they could convert this scene of pursuit, I have to deal with modern technologies could make it even better). There were also some funny scenes that made this movie enjoyable even when Jackie did not fight. Although I think that they could put more battle scenes in this movie.
