A great little thriller begins with Trevor Howard in his convertible and ends at the port of Liverpool. It's all emotions and spills, because the former spy has to resume his career, as does some serious R & R cataloging butterflies (how is the British?). <br /> <br /> Trevor Howard and Jean Simmons play from London to Newcastle-upon-Tyne to Liverpool (via Ullswater) - he was simply kicked out of MI5 or something like that, and she guessed he was running away, wrongly accused of murder. There are dingy docks, rolling hills in the Lake District, sheep, village pubs, lost coppers, waterfalls, a group of amateur bikers, chases on the roofs and lots of Chinamen (do not ask), and this is all very Hitchcocky and Hannayesque ... <br / > <br /> .. and a great example of the British Noir ...
