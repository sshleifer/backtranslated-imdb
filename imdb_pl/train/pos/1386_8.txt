Three teenage girls in an incomplete triangular relationship. The base of the triangle almost does not exist there. At the top there is Marie, a serious, short and slim tomboy with a face like Belmondo. Her best friend is the physical and psychological opposite: coquette, plump - I dare say she is fat - and wanting her first kiss with the boy, but not quite ready for her first sexual encounter. Because of her plumpness, the boys do not seem interested and hurt her. <br /> <br /> The other leg of the top is a beautiful "fille fatale" blonde vampire. She is deeply involved in the sport of swimming synchronization at a competitive level. Marie sees her during a competition at a local public pool. Marie enters the vampire's life, wanting to become a synchronized swimmer as an argument. The vampire has a reputation as a whore, fighting with every young man who circulates around her. Marie is not being withdrawn by this reputation. Highlight your reputation. <br /> <br /> The first half is configured. We see a lot of synchronous swimming when we meet three girls. Ultimately, the narrative leaves behind synchronized swimming and concentrates on the worst relations between the three. That's when unexpected things happen. <br /> <br /> This is a trademark of French films that throw viewers wisdom lumps. This one is no exception. It's about ceilings and dying. See the video to learn more. <br /> <br /> The director says that using synchronous swimming is expedient. This sport only for women is a metaphor of a girl's life: pretty and feminine on the surface, while at the same time working and competitive underneath. A series of scenes drives this point: elegant movements and smiles for the audience, legs kick awkwardly under water. The title in French is also suggestive: "prieuve", or an octopus, suggest that the individual must simultaneously juggle with many pressures.
