In the classic sense of the four humors (which are not specific to a fun or even entertaining concept), Altman's H.E.A.L.T.H. treats all the moods, actually very funny, fun ways. It is a phlegm, personified by the very slow, guarded and caring figure of Lauren Bacall, Esther Brill, whose mission in life seems to be a look that protects the secrets of her age and beauty more than her well-being. There is Choleric Dr. Gil Gainey Paul Dooley, who likes fish from the water (maybe more like a seal) flutetically around, barking and exhorting the crowds to sign under his water madness. Isabella Garnell of Glenda Jackson's Melancholy touches Shakespearean and hypocritical Hamlet - he even gives a monologue or two. And let's not forget about the bile form of Henry Gibson, Bobby Hammer ("Breast feeding a baby rules the world"). Then there are the characters of Harry Wolff and Gloria Burbank (respectively James Garner and Carol Burnett), relatively sensible characters striving to find a balance between all comrades and extreme moods, who gathered on H.E.A.L.T.H. - a type of world trade organization specializing in H.E.A.L.T.H., which is supposed to be something other than health. This is Altman in its best classic.
