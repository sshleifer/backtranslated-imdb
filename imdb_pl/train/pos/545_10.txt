Sequels hardly ever meet the original. This certainly turns out to be true in this case. However, if you're a big fan of the original, definitely give it a watch. Although there is a lack of work with the camera, Brian Krause's character is annoying, and the story is clique, it is much more fun than the first one and that's what makes me happy. <br /> <br /> Do not look how this movie expects the same performance as in the first movie. Honestly, it's a bit different. Instead of sitting in his scenarios to write in a booth, Stanley is in Hollywood and tries to direct his dream project Cabin by the Lake. This movie has a completely different atmosphere, but it's still great to see Stanley back in action. <br /> <br /> I give him 6 out of 10.
