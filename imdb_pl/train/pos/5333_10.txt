As it did not become a cult movie, I do not know. I think, unfortunately, he has not been overlooked as a truly brilliant comedy! <br /> <br /> "Runaway Car" tries to leave as a quick thriller, but considering the quality of the game (good God, it's bad), the plot, practical aspects of demonic car ownership and the evacuation stage of the child are not able to do anything but laugh. And laugh. Films are meant to entertain us, and the degree to which they do so can testify to the value of the film. This movie is the peak of entertainment, I laughed from beginning to end. At some point I caught my breath and almost choked, at some points it is really fun. When the child was removed from the roof roof in the trailer by a helicopter with a robot pilot, who managed to maintain a constant speed identical to the car and perfectly flat plane, which meant that the hook did not tear the roof of the car to pieces, I laughed hysterically. But when the child began to sway in the air, it nearly hit the bridge and almost got tangled up in a tree, tears running down my face. <br /> <br /> It also occurred to me that the black policeman was the guy who played Jesus in the movie Madonna "Like A Prayer". He seems everywhere.
