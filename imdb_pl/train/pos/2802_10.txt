As someone who has never done sports, it seems that it will be difficult for me to get into football (or, as we inexplicably call it Americans, football) - media "Bend It Like Beckham". But I have to say it was one cool movie! Anglo-Indian Jesminder Bhamra (Parminder Nagra) and her friend WASP Juliette Paxton (Keira Knightley) love to play football (yes, I will say it in English - and internationally) and I love footballer David Beckham. But the traditional parents of Sikh Jesminder do not approve (her mother offers a really exhausted description of football at the beginning of the movie). Okay, maybe it's kind of a clich√©, but you have to love this movie! And if you're like me, you go to this movie without knowing the definition of a "bend" in football ... do not worry, the movie explains it (I've never heard of David Beckham before). We all know that Keira Knightley has achieved great success: a few months after the release of "BILB" in the States, she performed in equally nice "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl."
