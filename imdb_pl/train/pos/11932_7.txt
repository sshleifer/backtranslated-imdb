I saw this movie on TV many years ago and saw this movie when I got it on tape. I thought it was quite well done. It was not the best of all movies, but it was good enough. The film has enough talent to inspire many people, especially younger children. Acting was good, and Danny Glover ran the cast. The plot was not very reliable, but the script was well written. This video may also be of interest to avid baseball fans. This does not apply directly to a sports movie. This applies directly to a nice movie that you can watch with your family and get to know the hidden messages in this video. In general, the film was good, but not great. I give this film 7/10.
