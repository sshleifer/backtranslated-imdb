I could not take my eyes off the film when it appeared on the cable. Dialogue and costumes have the quality best associated with the soft porn core. In this case, the intentional plot serves as a non-sex vehicle, but for serial thrash with nunchukami. (Perhaps also for sex, but not for Indian TV.) <br /> <br /> Without being a fan of the genre, I could not put Jeff Wincott and I had no clues to search. It was only when Brigitte Nielsen exchanged her futuristic nurse (yes, the mayor!). On the remarkable fade that we remember from Beverly Hills Cop II, I made a positive ID on it. <br /> <br /> I will not doubt this movie to admire a couture admirer from the early 90s, or a fan with Paul Verhoeven. Can we add a genre tag for "yes-bad-is-good"?
