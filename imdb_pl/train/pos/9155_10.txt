Whoever ever invented a story is one sick person. I rented him for the night party, and all six of us were terrified, because we're all in the acting class and we know several actors from the class. Besides that everyone was screaming all this bizarre night, I had terrible nightmares. I kept thinking about God, if I get up to go to the bathroom to pee, I'll be stabbed in the middle of the wiping or something. I could not even go to the bathroom because we were watching this macabre horror movie. I also thought why all the girls are topless in this movie, but we do not have any boys? You should do a horror movie in which the killer is a girl and hack an individual. I would watch it over and over again. Call it hard or soft or something so stupid. I only give this film 9 because FREAKED ME OUT FREAKS.
