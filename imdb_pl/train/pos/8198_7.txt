Dirty Harry must track down a rape victim who brings out his revenge by shooting at the goolian assailants before he kills them. Probably a more accurate punishment would be to let them live after the initial shot and let them suffer forever, just like she and her sister ... In any case ..... full of action story again in San Francisco and Santa Cruz. The main rapist played by Andy Drake is appropriately mean and gets a penalty at the end (of course!). This is not a classic movie, but better than others, except for the original Dirty Harry.
