As a child, I remember being nine or ten years old and I love this movie. It was the whole Bollywood action movie. This is, of course, the Bad Boys imitation! The entire exchange of identity, but the appearance of two other twins, throws everything out the window, and then the arrival of colorful villains who dance and sing! The action scenes in the film are not revolutionary, but still amazing. The film is really very funny and it was a great return that Amitabh Bachan needed. Govinda is a jewel as always and this is probably his best work so far, shining when the side kick delivers the best comedy scenes available in the Indian cinema. <br /> <br /> Songs ... Songs are both funny and catchy .............. proving laughter when you least expect it ... Amitabh Bachan is surprisingly very funny and make you laugh like "Bade Miah" .... his accent ... body language ..... Genialny ... <br /> <br /> "Assi chutki naab re daal" is the best song .............. Hilarious.
