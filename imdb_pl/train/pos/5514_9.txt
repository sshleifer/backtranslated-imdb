I watched part two days ago and today I saw the second part. Of course, these two parts are separated from each other, so I'm a bit shocked by everything I just saw. I felt absorbed in the knowledge of the inevitability of Che's death; it clouded the whole movie for me. I suppose it was what Soderbergh wanted, the slowly evolving inevitability of his death. Part two was so inept compared to, again unavoidable, but in Cuba it was positive, and in Bolivia was so negative. The traffic policy in Bolivia was only established, but rarely confronted with didactics. For me, the memorable scenes were at the end of the movie: a confrontation with a prison guard and a gentler conversation with a Bolivian official, where the official questioned Che about the failure of the peasants to support his revolution. I did not consider national differences as playing such a large role as in the conflict, Argentina and Bolivia. I thought that Soderbergh coped with the unavoidable supply problems in a revolutionary struggle; How do you get food without antagonizing the peasants who are not fed up. It struck me how difficult it would be to try something that Che tried. I think that's all at the right time; is there enough anger against the government to start a movement; there was no one in Bolivia. Che realized the terrible corundum of revolutionaries in his letter to Fidel, who read at the beginning of the movie: If not now, when, in 50 years. A very provocative and well-made film; make every effort to see it.
