Watching "North Cowboy" is like branie lekcji mistrzostwa w actorstwie / reżyserosci / cinematografii / montaż / writing. I was too young to watch it when it was originally released, and I saw it for the first time a few years ago, but it absolutely stood the test of time and I watched it several times. <br /> <br /> Everything in this movie is brilliant, from the thrilling performances of Voight and Hoffman (although I know this movie well, I still feel good when every time Voight flashes one of his innocently painful looks, Hoffman coughs a sickly and sinister way to make great photos and perfectly assembled dream sequences. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that many of our contemporary filmmakers are not prepared to risk creating films that are as visually and visually interesting as this one. should be required to watch at all film schools. <br /> <br /> 10/10
