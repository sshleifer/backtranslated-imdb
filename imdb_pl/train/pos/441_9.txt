This is a great film about finding happiness in everyday life. The pace, the work with the camera, the emotions, the disturbing musical note and the pure charm of this painting make it necessary to see it. Immature or emotionally stunted are not easy to appreciate. The only drawback I see in this movie is that it has not been captured in a more technical movie format. He deserved the Todda-AO, Technicolor and the most perfect sound format available (a chamber movie can be made in seventy millimeters). The wonderful effect of the Italian villas on the inhabitants would be even more juicy, and the small, charming moments would be even more beautifully seen and heard. In fact, it still requires attention as a sweet, moving little movie. I can not help watching him every time he comes on the satellite. Transformations of characters from closed, tight and distrustful are always a joy to watch and I should really recommend them more often. <br /> <br /> the casting is perfect, the mood is perfect, the action is beyond reproach. It is a middle-aged movie and the choices people make. It is deep and thoughtful, not burdening the viewer with a heavy hand. Watch him in one sitting and let it affect you. If you do not get it, maybe you did not survive enough or something else is wrong with you.
