Well, I said it all in summary, I love the movie and the cast ... I would give every actor an Oscar ... great, great movie ... I'm 25 years old and I watched him 4 times in different periods and I always think I will not cry and always I do it, about 2 or 3 times ...;) meryl s. was absolutely brilliant, i'm also irons ... just brilliant ... I would like the film to receive more prizes ... I really do not know anyone who watched it and he did not like it ... also, the glen close was fantastic. .. the story was beautiful and sad at the same time ... I loved the fact that despite everything, the clara and esteban loved each other so much and how the blanca was close to her parents ...
