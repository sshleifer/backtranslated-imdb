Incredibly intriguing and captivating, I could not turn around when I started watching. I am usually one of the harshest critics, but for me this movie was simply brilliant, strange because it may sound like I could almost feel the air and feel the texture of the places. <br /> <br /> From the cinematography, I thought there was a great use of light and texture. From the orange glow of summer light to the plastic couch - all this had a clear realism for me. <br /> <br /> From the perspective of the character, I thought of Victor Vargas as almost the glue that connects the story was quite inspired, each of the family members with a more complete background simply caused a greater intrigue of the main character himself. <br /> <br /> Besides, knowing someone like grandma and being after receiving such a situation, I can say that the situation was particularly realistic. The awkwardness, accent, cooking, and even the comments I felt were so authentic to me. <br /> <br /> I think this movie worked for me because I started watching it without any expectations and found it completely addictive and recalled the memories of teenage emotions worth watching.
