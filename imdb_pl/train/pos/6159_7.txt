This place in England in 1940. Three orphans (Carrie, Charles and Paul) are sent to live with Miss Price (Angela Lansbury). He does not want them, but he reluctantly takes them. It looks like he learns to be a witch on a college of Witchcraft correspondence course. (OK - I realize this is a family movie, but - College of Witchcraft ??? chief of Professor Browne (David Tomlinson). And she and the children travel around the bed with the help of a magic bed. <br /> <br /> After I first saw it when I was 9 and I do not remember how I loved it, I'm sure she can not stand it as an adult! History is stupid (even for fantasy), children are horrible actors and one of them (Charles) is incredibly disgusting. McDowall is third in settlement and appears only in two short scenes! There is also a trip to the island of Naboombu, which is run by animated animals.I thought it could be fun, but the animation is poor (for Disney) and has a very sharp and too long match There are some saving graces here: Lansbury and Tomlinson are simply great, the songs (while forgotten) are pleasant, the long dance sequence at Portobello Road is very colorful and full of for energy, and the Oscar-winning special effects are still impressive. But poor storyline, poor animation and unlikely children really attract. I heard that the extended version is even worse! I can only give it 7.
