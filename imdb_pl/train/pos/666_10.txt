The second episode of the first season is a charming summer tale of love, betrayal ... and murderous, escaped by a madman dressed up as the Christmas Father. <br /> <br /> A woman (Mary Ellen-Trainor) has just murdered her hubbie on Christmas Eve for her life insurance. What begins as a perfect crime begins the struggle for survival as a mad Santa's suit in a psychopath (Larry Drake, perfectly overhead) threatens her life ... as well as her precious young daughters. <br /> <br /> This episode is warmly remembered even by those who have become familiar with the program. By the way, this particular reviewer is watching what Christmas is. The most noteworthy is the escalation of uncertainty and narrative narratives, and everything by Houst is the best among Tales From The Crypt.
