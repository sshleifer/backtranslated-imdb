Easily the best low-budget horror of all time. I saw this movie for the first time at about the age of nine and I have to say that it frightened me. Now that I've grown up, I see this movie for what it really is ... a work of genius. Everyone, or at least everyone who has any taste, dreamed about seeing a snowman who kills people, even if they do not admit it. I always found something really terrifying in snowmen, so naturally, like a horror movie like me, this movie was a dream come true. Some say that this movie is stupid, or otherwise devoid of any intelligence ... is a movie about serial deadly snowman, what the hell did you expect? Anyone who has given the film a low score is, of course, too tense to sit down and laugh at silly monolayer and cheap gore. I love this film for what it is, a comedy, and until the film industry develops and does not make a serious horror about the deadly snowman (which, unfortunately, seems impossible), I will forever stop this wonderful piece of indie horror close to my heart.
