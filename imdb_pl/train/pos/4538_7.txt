I did not even want to watch this movie after reading the Maltin review and 1 1/2 stars. And so I watched him on the advice of my son and found him much better than I expected. I would give him 2 1/2 stars from a 4-star system. You need to watch the movie more than once to understand it all. If you do not know much about religion, you will miss a lot. I graduated from high school in the year in which the film was made, so maybe I will get to it better. Yes, the movie has a bit of a grudge and to some extent it's weird, but it was the '70s, so what to expect. I can see why people may not like the movie; but I can not understand people saying it's boring. The film is not boring. Either you hate him or you love him. If you find it boring, you probably do not live in the brain.
