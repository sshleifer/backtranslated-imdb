Verhoeven's film was complete and complete. It is a disgusting hook of the director and he should be ashamed. He admitted that he had read the 2 chapters of the book, got bored and decided to do everything from scratch. <br /> <br /> Heinlein would NEVER support this trash if he lived to see it. Basically, she steals the name, mocks the book's policy (which is a good part of it), and throws a little T & A, so the average idiot American movie guy is not bored. <br /> <br /> This anime is not ideal, but at least mostly accurate, the best I can.
