Fay Grim is a real example of what I call a completed logic. It contains all elements of acting, directing, story and entertainment. Everyone fits together and when they do, create a masterpiece, Fay Grim. <br /> <br /> This movie is followed by a single mother, Fay Grim, who tries to raise her son so as not to grow up to be a father who escaped from the law and is missing. Soon, the CIA contacts Fay in a desperate quest to find eight of Henry's husband's magazines. These journals were full of confessions from his long past in the CIA and his commitment to the countries and their governmental activities. Fay is sent to find these magazines in exchange for the release of her brother from prison, and is sent to chase after cats and mice all over Europe to retrieve these magazines and learn about her secret husbands that she never knew about. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey was already an actress that I liked after seeing her at The OH in Ohio and Best in Show. She brought life to these two comedic roles, but Fay Grim was a completely different role than the other two films. Posey made me believe in what was happening on the screen, I felt for her, I humbled her and wanted to know more. It grabs you when it's on the screen, and when it's off, you can not stop thinking about what's going on with it. <br /> <br /> I have not seen any of the previous works of writer / director Hal Hartley, but I believe that I will take a look at some of his earlier films if they are half as good as Fay Grim. <br /> <br /> If you decide to choose a smart movie the next time you decide to rent a movie or buy a DVD I would love to choose Fay Grim. If you have some common sense about what a movie should look like, you'll love this movie immensely.
