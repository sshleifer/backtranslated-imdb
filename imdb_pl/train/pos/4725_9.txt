Despite the lack of logic in the storyline, Kill Shot is a very nice movie. Through a moving spectacle, Kasper Van Dien magnificently presents the emotional discord between a hardworking affluent father and his erring son. Each member of the cast is supported by a solid performance, highlighted by a live act of a young man whose name I do not remember. A shockingly tragic ending can upset some of the younger viewers, but as a whole, Kill Shot really gives a lethal blow.
