Why did the show enjoy the last episode? Because of Melissa's true talent, Joan Hart and her supporters of the demonstration of this little humor, comedy, carefree humor and deep thought can actually co-exist. What I liked best was that I could go home after a hard day's work and smile ... I was inspired ... and why? It was an inspiration to watch how this magic person was so happy to help others. <br /> <br /> Sabrina was in my opinion a hero ... even though she was defenseless in a way that was not so different from ours ... completely different; she had powers at hand, wishes and commands that can be used for good or bad, which can only exist in many of our imaginations. Most of everything we see, we have, we know it ourselves, we even want it ... we can use it for good or bad, and also how we define it, we define the person we are. <br /> <br /> She traveled the world and other worlds with these fixed and unshakable ideas in mind ... to learn, live, laugh and love. She always learned how to improve her skills for the benefit of everyone around me; she made mistakes, living her life, going through different paths of growth, because she, her aunts and Salem (an underrated but imperfect hero) did well to show that even by mistake we can still be a noble, gifted. <br /> <br /> She also showed many selfless, learning and loving behaviors as she walked her way. If this is not enough for 10 stars in this war-torn world where people are so hostile towards each other, not realizing that differences are a spice of life rather than a reason to kill ... I do not know what it is . This show was certainly a journey to a better world, as well as inspiration to be better and a gift that would cause a smile on our chops ... I had heard from the doctor before that everything I mentioned above leads to a healthy "heart". ... and do we all need this? :)
