Pushing Daisies is a real breakthrough in television as a form of art. Everything seems to pay tribute to Amelie and Tim Burton, but so, in a world where fresh ideas are clearly rare, this program ensures that you do not care whether it is fresh or not. It is simply brilliant. <br /> <br /> I was charmed from the beginning, intelligent writing, background direction and dialogue make this show the most amazing masterpiece since The Shield and The Wire (okay not quite a comparison, but the beauty of Pushing Daisies lies in on the fact that there is no comparison on television). <br /> <br /> Really addictive and absolute pleasure. Perhaps like one of the Piemaker cookies that are exchanged in such a tempting way.
