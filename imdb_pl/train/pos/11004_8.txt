In the near future, an ordinary man over all suspects from the suburbs of Morgan Sullivan (Jeremy Northam) is hired by Digicorp, a large corporation that is to be assigned as a spy and steals secrets from its competitors, Sunways. During training, Morgan is brainwashed, assumes a new identity for Jacek Thursby and travels to boring lectures. In one of them comes the beautiful and mysterious Rita Foster (Lucy Liu), who advises him that nothing is as it seems. Morgan recognizes a new reality in which he does not know who to trust. <br /> <br /> The unknown "Cypher" was a big surprise for me. This film has not been released in Brazil, but the immersive and exciting story is quite complex, with many story lines, excellent script, direction and performances. In the last installment I remembered Arnold Schwarzenegger's "Total Recall". This movie certainly deserves to be seen more than once, and I really did not like the last scene when an independent spy gets rid of the disc in the sea. He knows only the director of Vicenzo Natali from the fantastic "Cube", and the second job I see is also stunning. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
