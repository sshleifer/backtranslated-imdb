I saw it on the big screen and I was locked in it. The period of younger years of Queen Victoria is a mystery and it is a perfect description of how a young girl was entrusted with one of the highest roles in the world. <br /> <br /> The screenplay is perfect, the acting is amazing, the history and attention to detail is out of this world. Emily Blunt is perfect as Victoria. Funny how her mother plays Elizabeth 1 and William IV plays Prince Albert! (Think Blackadder). <br /> <br /> This portrait of Victoria shows that she was once a rebellious young woman - I'm sure she would be at Jeremey Kyle Show if it were then: "My mother and her boyfriend are trying to steal my life." <br /> <br /> An excellent piece of much of the history of Great Britain and Commonwealth.
