The film concerns Philip (Leslie Howard), who is a serious but disabled student of medicine. He falls in love with a soulless, ravenous waitress named Mildred (Bette Davis). He leaves him, engaging with others (Alan Hale, Reginald Denny). Meanwhile, he is affair with other suitors (Kay Johnson, Frances Dee), but he returns in a destructive case. <br /> <br /> Easily the best and first of many versions of Somerset Maugham's film novels. Bette Davis as a cruel waitress Cockney winning another wonderful interpretation with a seductive and smoldering performance, absolutely mesmerizing in his description of the captivity that occurs from beginning to end. Davis raised her fame with her performance. Her role as a hard and severe dominant woman will be repeated several times in the backward directions. Leslie Howard as a fundamentally good and decent, subtly ruined student gives a perfect and melancholy performance. He was an amazing actor (Gone with the wind) in addition to the producer and writer and dead in the plane crash during World War II. Both will play again in the etrPetrified forestÂ¨ (1936). The atmosphere of the film is carefully reproduced in the RKO (Radio Picture Inc) studio is completely convincing. Rebuilt in 1946 by Edmund Goulding, with Eleanor Parker and Paul Henreidem; and in 1964 Ken Hughes with Kim Novak and Laurence Harvey. The film will appeal to lovers of classic cinema. Rating: Very good, but a bit outdated.
