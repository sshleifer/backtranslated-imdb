Picture Bride paints a realistic and moving portrait of what must have been for Japanese brought to Hawaii at the turn of the 19th and 20th century to work on the sugar cane fields. Most of them planned to return to their homeland, but few were able to do it. Equally touchingly portrayed is the fate of Japanese women, some at the age of fifteen or sixteen, who were sent as promised fianc√©s to men whom they knew only through photos, which were often out of date from 10 to 15 years, or were from some other younger man. They also worked long hours in the fields, struggling with longing for the home and maintaining their dignity. <br /> <br /> Hata's presentation of one image of courage and perseverance of a bride struggling to survive in a foreign country and a foreign society under great physical compulsion is ultimately inspiring and uplifting - a story of moral and cultural survival. In the painting "The Bride" is the grandeur and splendor of character and landscape, which captures the appealing beauty as well as the brutal rawness of colonial Hawaii. It is a film that is emotionally, intellectually and artistically satisfying.
