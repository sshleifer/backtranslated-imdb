At first it seemed like a boring comedy, like The Odd Couple, but when I got to it, it turned out to be a really funny movie. Essentially, the forgotten comedians Willy Clark (winner of the Golden Globe, Oscar nominee and BAFTA Walter Matthau) and Al Lewis (Oscar winner and nominated for the Golden Glove George Burns) were a great comedic duet and restored their hospital sketch to a television program. Willy's nephew, Ben Clark (winner of the Golden Globe Richard Benjamin), is convinced that they can meet again without any feelings for each other, how wrong he is. They can not get along all the time, they are both forgotten, especially during the conversation, but in the end they do. Starring Lee Meredith as Nurse in Sketch (Miss McIntosh), Carol DeLuise as Mrs. Doris Green, daughter of Al, Rosetta LeNoire as Odessa, nurse of Willy and Muppet of F. Murray, the Cosmic Abraham as Mechanic. I think the best line of the movie is Burns, mentioning that Matthau called him "son of a bitch." He was nominated for an Oscar for the best artistic scenario - set design and best script, script adapted on the basis of other materials, was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Screenplay, and won the Golden Globe Award for Best Film - Musical / Comedy and was nominated for Best Screenplay. Very good!
