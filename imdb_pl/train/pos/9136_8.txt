This is not a bad movie like some reviewers, and as a summary on the IMDB site of this video, let's say it is. Why? Firstly, in 1984, the filmmakers dared to confront the issue of domestic violence as one of the elements of the story - so the reviewers who complain about the story unfortunately lack one of the main points! Secondly, without the feature film of Prince's film relationship with his abusive father, the musical climax would not work as well as he did - so those reviewers who say that only music is good once again missed one of the points - specifically WHY it's so good ... because all the music in this movie has a background that makes the music more effective. Thirdly, give this movie a break! For producers and directors, for the first time it is not so bad! Amazing filmmakers have much worse films !! And finally, reviewers who say that music is "good" also did not hit the nail on the head - check the range of stylistic musical treatments, variety, musicality and stage performances of Prince - really unique, going musically, where no one else he traveled in the 1980s and with the style visible in the works of other artists (clothes and movements: which costume elements appeared first, Michael Jackson or Prince's?) See also if you can see the fingers spread before the eyes that Prince does in this film, long before "Pulp Fiction" by Quentin Tarentino). As the sum of its parts, it is not a bad movie at all.
