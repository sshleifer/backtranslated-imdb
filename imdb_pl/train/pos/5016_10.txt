This movie is one of my favorites. It is difficult to explain why. Maybe it's Corin Nemeca's innocence and his awkwardness, combined with Cheryl Pollak's boldness, but it certainly has something to do with the soundtrack. In addition, some characters have small lines or movements or moments that are fun in themselves. In the end, the story is one that always attracts my heart, and the last scene is so bittersweet. In total, I love this movie; is perfect for a sticky, sentimental night of girls.
