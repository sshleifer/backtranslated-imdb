Anna Christie (1931) <br /> <br /> By the same token, this version of Anna Christie Garbo, made a year later in German with a completely new cast, is simply subdued and sophisticated enough to work better than the English version (both there are American MGM productions). Garbo is, if something more evidential (or more beautiful as a presence on the screen) and her acting is more restrained. And it seems honestly more calm, probably for many reasons, but we can speculate that it did not make its first image anymore, so it adapted quickly. <br /> <br /> Completely one movie with the other is always different, this Anna Christie is still the same O'Neill game with too many words. His motives for a woman who wants love without losing her independence are here, but they are strangely old-fashioned. A few scenes are missing - the Coney Island section is shortened and not as good - but in general it is a direct echo of the first movie. The director, Jacques Feyder (Belgian-French), just changes what has already been done, which I think must be a frustrating experience. <br /> <br /> It's interesting to watch both movies one by one because they are locked in exactly the same way (not just sets, but the shots are the same). Occasionally there is a scene from an earlier film - understandably, part of the storm, but also a short scene in which Marie Dressler (with English language version) walks with her friend after boarding the channel, how she can be drunk. But these are just silhouettes, and when the next scene shows their faces, we see German actors taking their parts. He certainly has no intention of replacing Dressler, but for me, the German father is more credible and honest in his performance. <br /> <br /> Of course, topics - immigration, stubborn fathers, daughters going to prostitution and trouble finding real love - have strong currents then, especially in European themes (Garbo plays a Swedish young woman appropriately).
