First, I record this movie on VHS than I had to buy it on DVD, it's on my favorite movies of all time. I have read the book, but I really think that the film is much better. I loved Gwyneth Paltrow as Emma and Jeremy Northam, because Mr. Knightley was a great choice. He was brilliant! <br /> <br /> This movie is 10/10! <br /> <br />
