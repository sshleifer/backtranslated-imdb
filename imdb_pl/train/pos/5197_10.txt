This movie completely circled the original Dolemite. He had everything that made the film great ... except real actors. (Ernie Hudson could not do it alone, and you KNOW LOL) I admit I killed my first video tape from this movie and plan to buy the DVD again as soon as possible! This movie has so many catchy lines that it's pathetic! I am embarrassed when I say that I know the theme song forwards and backwards! I love Jimmy Lynch to death, and he should have won the Best Supporting Actor award in Blaxploitation, but the Oscars have never been ready! This is a random movie consisting of Crooked Cops, Breast, Chases, Bad Editing and, of course, martial arts. (Because it is the '70s and I can say that everyone knew of some martial arts). I think that this movie should be restored and shown one night amid a marathon in local theaters!
