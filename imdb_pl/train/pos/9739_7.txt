I had a good time watching this movie, mainly thanks to Simon Pegg, who quickly became a solid cash draw for comedy movies. <br /> <br /> He is employed from the dead end in London. Jeff Bridges, as a writer, for one of his celebrities. <br /> <br /> After paying the premiums, he goes to senior celebrity hackers ("seventh room"), to which he goes alone or less known. The story is very funny, and Gillian Anderson plays an impressive supporting role as an aggressive advertising agent. <br /> <br /> On the way to success he finds the true meaning of love, etc. <br /> <br /> Apart from the story, the movie was very funny, mainly thanks to Simon Pegg, Jeff Bridges and Gillian Anderson. Kirsten Dunst was as good as love. The rest of the supporting cast did a good job. <br /> <br /> It was a good comedy and it's worth checking out in cinemas.
