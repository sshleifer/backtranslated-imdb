This is a great Canadian comedy series. The film tells how the stars Jean Paul Tremblay- (Julian) and the main writer of the series and his friends Rickie and Bubbles play what is a real satirical look at parks of trailers and residents of these kitsch hoods. In the video, you'll find out why Rickie and Julian are starting to do more advanced expeditions into the world of crime. WHY and the reasons for everything would be a spoiler, so I will not give the real reasons for their more brilliant escapades. Their friend and often partner (Bubbles) is a great character. The whole performance is brilliant and will not affect the way you see sit-com. It is a comedy with a capital letter C and a genius satire in the showrooms of trailers and small time swindlers with small ideas on time, but with great dreams. If you ever have the opportunity to watch - buy - steal this program. You'll be glad you did it. And my American friends --- It'll break you down too. 10 out of 9. Ingenious. TV how television should be.
