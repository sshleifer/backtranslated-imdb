This has grown up on me. I love R.D music. Burman and despite the more complex elements of this story, many things have been moved to me because I was constantly watching the movie. The plot line of brother and sister is powerful, I thought; there are also more likely compulsory things, such as bar fights, strange detective stories etc. that simply distract. (Although this is not strange from a certain point of view.) Also, the English translation is definitely by someone who was a bit tense for it, and just as strange that I'm grateful that he did it. <br /> <br /> Like many Bollywood movies I've seen, this one is melodramatic and similar to an opera, in particular a song sung by a small boy first, to cheer up his battered and unhappy sister, and then the same song sung 12 about a year later, a man who traveled to Kathmandu, wanting to reconnect with this girl, grew up and worried (she was told that her brother and mother were dead), anesthetizing her pain with drugs. <br /> <br /> The great thing about this movie from 1971 is that it's about the hippie movement that brought hordes of seekers to India, from an Indian point of view who sees them as people whose spiritual hunger has caused their own shortage societies, but nevertheless in India, living only for the pleasure of the moment. The hippie singing and dancing scenes are really wonderful and accurate in their sound (I am old enough to remember) and I am pretty sure that the mass of young white children broken down into zones are real hippie accessories, as I remember hearing about children from the caravan in the East, who do this kind of work in Bollywood. <br /> <br /> (It's not about the actual Hare Krishna movement, although the hippies of the movie are singing the song of Krishna / Rama, like a group of real Indian devotees, unrelated to hippies, in the initial scene of the movie.) <br /> <br / > ~ Virginia
