If you're a fan of the big cast of Altman, as evidenced by movies like M.A.H., Nashville, Gosford Park, and less-watched movies such as A Wedding, no doubt HealtH is enjoying you. Focusing on the Health Convention, in which two women run to the President, HealtH includes many of Altman's regulars from the 1970s, such as Paul Dooley (who helped write the movie), Carol Burnett and Henry Gibson, as well as the leading Altman stars, such as Lauren Bacall, James Garner and Glenda Jackson. Like many Altman movies, there are many themes in this movie, but it's not as overwhelming as movies like Nashville or A Wedding, but it's more central, perhaps like M.A.S.H. or Gosford Park. The whole is an obvious satire about the Health movement, filled with exaggerated, bizarre, contradictory figures, with hospitable stars such as Dick Cavett, providing a flashy commentary on the whole matter. Emphasizing the entire electoral process is Altman's pessimism about politics and public appeal, but the most interesting in this film is the pure fun that most people seem to have. That would be one of Altman's last films like this one for a moment!
