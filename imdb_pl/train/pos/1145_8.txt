This is a romantic comedy with an emphasis on comedy for a change. As usual lovers - Sally Field, the queen of the soap opera almost on the hill, Celeste Talbert; and Kevin Kline as a marginalist and marginally talented actor, Jeffrey Anderson - they work in crucifixion, seemingly unaware that they are madly in love, etc. Having a little to Margo Channing Bette Davis in All About Eve (1950) and the whole in accordance with the tradition of the slapstick theater, Sally Field goes up in the direction of merriment when she breaks the path to love and happiness with her. Kevin Kline, one of the most underrated leaders of recent years, is also very good and he wins very much because he is handsome, sensitive, selfish and pleasant at the same time. <br /> <br /> Center of adventures around Celeste's fear of losing the audience when she got in her forties, and reaching the crisis point with the arrival of her niece, the aspiring actress Cori Craven (Elisabeth Shue), who turns out NOT to be her niece, with the following plot complications. Cori manages to get a small role in the telenovela as a homeless deaf before discovering her true relationship with Celeste (and also Jeffrey Anderson) - but never mind. <br /> <br /> Robert Downey Jr. is a romantic counterpoint or lead foil. (director of the soap opera, David Barnes) and Cathy Moriarty (Montana and Nurse Nan). David Barnes is so hot to her, but he only cares about one thing: getting rid of Celeste so that she can shine more clearly on the set. For this purpose, he forces Barnes to do various things to destroy Celeste's career, but by accident and / or perverse logic all his attempts are not in vain, to the delight of the viewer. <br /> <br /> Whoopie Goldberg is played by Rose Schwartz, the lead writer of the series and alter-ego of Celeste and the confidant, while Carrie Fisher has a modest role as the producer of the hard-as-nails series. <br /> <br /> I thought it was more fun than just another parody of the world of the soap opera I saw (Young Doctors in Love 1982, who spoke on TV General Hospital and was pretty good). Soapdish is more fun with his humorous screenplay and lots of laughter-loud one-liners and great performances by Field, Kline and Downy, Jr. But see this for Sally Field, who is outstanding.
