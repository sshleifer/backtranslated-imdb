This vast drama has everything: top-class acting, amazing photography, good history. Often it is compared to "Braveheart" because both films take place in historic Scotland. Although I love Braveheart, I think it's better from two movies. Jessica Lange gave an amazing performance (she should be nominated for an Oscar). Liam Neeson is fantastic in the title role. Tim Roth plays one of the most evil, wicked characters in film history (he was nominated for an Oscar). John Hurt is excellent as Lord Montrose, another disliking character. I am always amazed by the amazing range of characters that John Hurt can play. It's the story of a money dispute between Rob Roy and his clan and Lord Montrose. Rob Roy is a self-proclaimed man who will not solve problems with Montrose if he violates his sense of honor. Montrose, who inherited his title, has no sense of honor. And this is basically the story; the honor of an ordinary man and the corruption of gentry. This movie is very funny, it should appeal to everyone. It has an affair, action, beautiful landscapes and has an exciting storyline. One of my favorite movies.
