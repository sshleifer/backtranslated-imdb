In 1987, Hong Kong gave the world such films as "Meetings of the ghostly kind" Sammo Hung Chow Yun Fat in the iconic "A Better Tomorrow" by John Woo, "Zu Warriors" and the classic "Mr Vampire". Jackie Chan has enjoyed international success on video, but thanks to "A Chinese Ghost Story" HK has for many years his first real crossover hit in the West. <br /> <br /> Western filmmakers have never seen anything like it. It was a film that used various components that the HK cinema has been using for years (flying swordsman, wildly choreographic martial arts and supernatural) and mixed them, creating a film that was unique in appearance, feel and performance. Forget about the poor and unnecessary sequels that have appeared, this is the original and the best. <br /> <br /> Director Siu-Tung Ching (still known as Action Choreographer in such films as Woo's A Better Tomorrow 2 / The Killer), under the watchful eye of the legendary producer Tsui Harka, created a masterpiece of Fantasy / Horror cinema. such a qualified crew available (no less than 6 martial arts coordinators), the chances that the movie will be something wonderful would be unthinkable. <br /> <br /> The installation by the incredibly prolific David Wu (who wrote / directed "The Bride With White Hair 2 "and edited such classic titles as" A Better Tomorrow 1/2/3 "," Hardboiled "and the cult hit" The Club ") is simply a genius creation: the creation of perfectly directed sword fights, climbing the trees, makes them one of the best HK cinemas ever created, fast moving, bizarre, but never confusing, they are even the top of their art today. <br /> <br /> The crew of operators made miracles. It is a film in which every shot is a professionally made image. Where wonderful blue stained night sequences wrapped in everlasting fog are a breathtaking platform to develop our history. It is a film in which everything is used to weave the beauty of a dream. Even the silk robes and dresses worn by Hsiao Tsing become living parts of the film, both in romantic sequences and battle scenes in which silk flows constantly. Even the simple scene in which Hsiao Tsing changes his clothes turns into something of a fluttering beauty, because each skill in the set combines, creating the most memorable scene from such a simple act. The sets are also amazing, giving the forests a different world sense, and the temple and the harshness of the burned, filled with flag wasteland of hell for an amazing finale. The Zhongwen Xi production project deserves the highest praise. <br /> <br /> Another important factor in the success of films is the music of Romeo Diaz and James Wong. The films in Hong Kong gave us fantastic music and songs that added so much to the success of the sequence, but the "A Chinese Ghost Story" music is simply indispensable. From the beginning of the song, music becomes as important as characters. <br /> <br /> The score is a great combination of modern and traditional instruments. Percussion, bells and guitars are great for action sequences, but in slower, painfully romantic pieces, they recover. Here; flutes, strings and feminine choral effects probably form the best pieces of music heard in the HK movie. Add to this a female vocal, a stunningly beautiful song that plays over the creation of love Tsau-shen and Hsiao Tsing (nothing is ever seen, but the effect is wonderful, it's a love affair with innocent film affair) and you have a great example of the power of film music you can have. <br /> <br /> And of course we have talent for acting. Leslie Cheung ("A Better Tomorrow 1 & 2" and a very popular singer) is outstanding as an innocent tax collector. His work in (fortunately, gentle) comic sequences is never at the highest level, and his scenes with Joey Wang are played with the right amount of passion and innocence. <br /> <br /> Joey Wang (who would later be largely degraded to support roles in films such as the classic "God of the Gamblers" Chow Yun Fat / Andy Lau never looked more radiant than in this case. She is the epitome of ethereal beauty. the portrait of tragic Hsiao Tsing is stunning, she shows the sadness of her characters because of what she has become and what she has to do, but also gives off subtle eroticism in scenes where she urges men to their gruesome deaths. Veteran Wu Ma ("Mr. Vampire" "Fencer") is great fun as smart, brave but always in a bad mood, Jen, tread on a thin line between eccentric and annoying, with practiced ease. And what could easily be a figure that could harm the film is really funny and unforgettable. <br /> <br /> But what about monsters and beasts ?, I hear crying. They include quite primitive, but funny stop-stop / animat romatic zombies that inhabit the temple (which results in a great running gag with constantly thwarted attempts to bite fun unsuspecting Tsau-shen), to a fairly tacky but surprisingly effective Black Lord. Includes an arsenal of fierce flying heads and excellent wire work. Most of them have never been crowned to this day. <br /> <br /> But the most prominent effect and creation is the deadly language of the spirit of the tree. This is the first time we've seen this thing with the "Evil Dead" style shooting through the camera, because it causes the victims' throats to fall to deliver a deadly French kiss that turns victims into zombies. But later it is shown in all its crazy glory. It can grow so large and long that it shoots through the forest after the victim, breaks the trees, wraps around buildings and scrolls, is slimy around people before picking them up and throwing them on the tree trunks !! It may even break to reveal a mouth full of fangs! This is a scandalous idea, which, given the deeply romantic main theme, should not work. But it has, thanks to a fantastic and unforgettable effect. <br /> <br /> So this is all a classic example of making movies in Hong Kong. The real effort of the band that gave us a really groundbreaking movie. It is a movie full of wit, inventiveness, action, monsters, martial arts, ghosts, fantastic ideas, lush visuals, beautiful music and the most important for its lasting charm, one of the most moving romances in cinemas.
