(No spoilers, only details of the plot) I do not understand such hatred for this episode. Want to watch the bad episode of Smallville? Watch Subterranean - now there is a sack of shit. Tom Welling gives a good performance (I do not say that too often), and Michael Rosenbaum is great, but most of the time. The alternative universe scenario seems incredibly realistic. The Martian Manhunter who previously appeared in "Static" returns and tells Clark that the doctor, who is the head of the mad hospital in which they are being held, is actually a phantom from the phantom zone and if Clark wants to return the universe, he must kill him. Overall a great episode with a good game and decent pace.
