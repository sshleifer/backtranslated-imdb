This is one of the unusual cases in which both the film and the novel on which it is based are great. Maybe because Gorris "takes Nabokov's initial ideas and gives them a different interpretation. The final consequence is the point of view on Luzhina who honored him more than Nabokov. <br /> <br /> The only thing in the movie I do not like is the influence of Valentinov on Luzhina's destiny. I can not imagine that Nabokov would create a person like Valentinov and give him so much influence over the arguments of the novel.
