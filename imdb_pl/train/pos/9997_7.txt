Life Stinks (1991) was a step towards the other production of Mel Brooks. He plays the role of a rich man who runs a mad bet with his "friends". Brooks says he can live like a homeless man for a month. His shocked and amused friends accept this unusual bet. During the "stay" in Bowery he meets a group of strange homeless people, one of them grabs his fantasy (Lesley-Ann Warren). They establish friendship when he teaches him many tricks that she learned while living on the street. Can Mr. Brooks survive alone, without the luxuries of being rich? Will this unconventional bet win? Who are his real friends? Find out when you watch LIFE STINKS to find out! <br /> <br /> This film has been treated unfairly. Sure, this is not a classic like his earlier films, but it's still nice. I liked the way Mel Brooks paid homage to Charles Chaplin in this movie. If you've watched Chaplin's silent movies, you'll also get humor. <br /> <br /> Recommended for Mel Brooks fans.
