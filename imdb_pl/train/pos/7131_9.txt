This TV movie is genius. This is probably the best and favorite role of BAFTA winner John Thaw (Kavanagh Q.C. and Inspector Morse). The widowed man Tom Oakley (Thaw) has been living in the village for some time alone, because his wife and son have died, and now he has been landed with the evacuated Villaim Beech (Nick Robinson). When he meets this child, he begins to develop friendship. Until Willaim's mother (Annabelle Apsion) wants to get him back. After Tom worries that William will not contact him, he goes to London to find him. Finally, Willaim gets his home with a loving family (or dad). The set during World War II is a great movie. He was nominated for the BAFTA Lew Grade Award and won the National Television Award for Most Popular Drama. John Thaw was number 3 in the 50 biggest TV stars. Very good!
