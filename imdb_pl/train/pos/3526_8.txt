Phantom Lady (1944) dir: Robert Siodmak <br /> <br /> Production: Universal Pictures <br /> <br /> Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis), after a nasty fight and parting with his wife, looks drowning his sorrow in local watering place. There, he spies on a woman in a similar emotional state and, looking for company, asks her for a show at the club to free their minds from problems. That's right, but only if they keep their names for themselves. Indeed, when Scott returns home, he finds the police there, waiting for the interrogation. His wife was murdered. Where were you at eight in the evening, asks Inspector Burgess (Thomas Gomez)? But Scott has an alibi, right? Only he does not know the woman's name. And the bartender remembers Scott, but not women. The taxi driver is not either. Neither drummer (Elisha Cook Jr.) in the club. Even the dancer in the club, which Scott apparently caught looking at the woman (they both had the same hat), would not admit that someone was with him. Something is happening, but whatever it is, Scott is helpless to defend himself at trial and is condemned to death for the murder of his wife (on the most delicate "evidence" in Hollywood court history). This was his loyal secretary of "Kansas" (Ella Raines), who later joined a sympathetic inspector, Burgess, to find out who the real killer of losing Scott. <br /> <br /> The phantom Lady is built on topics that repeat, almost compulsively, in Woolrich's work. For example, a schizophrenic antagonist also occurs in Black Angel and The Leopard Man. In addition, there is a character who becomes mentally disturbed by death or a spouse, as in Rendezvous in Black and The Bride Wore Black. It can leave the viewer feeling like he was treading on well-worn ground. But in the right hands, feverish threads, pathetic dialogue, narrative inconsistencies - everything is meaningless. Fortunately, the Phantom Lady was led by sound hands. <br /> <br /> This is Siodmak's first noir. He will continue to stand out as one of, if not, outstanding practitioners of the style (The Killers, Criss Cross). Here he is inadvertently connected to the operator Woody Bredell (they will be reunited at Christmas and The Killers). There are wonderful stories in the camera. In one shot, the character's mind deteriorates as he sits in front of a 3-way mirror, suggesting a lot of personality. The same hero who is an artist has a self-portrait of Van Gogh with a bandaged ear hanging on the wall in his apartment. But what Siodmak and Bredell really do in Phantom Lady is practically creating the look of a noir. Released very early in 1944, everything is here; wet sidewalk, bags of atmosphere and fear, sharp contrasting black and white, wild expressionist versions of reality (when Kansas visits Scott in prison), unruly light sheaves etc. It's a great view of this. /> <br /> Franchot Tone aside, cast, as well as the subject matter and relative inexperience of the director (and presumably the budget) suggest the ambitions of the film "B". I thought Tone was a small hamma. Alan Curtis (High Sierra) does not have much to say and in some scenes is quite weak. Ella Raines is mainly good (and quite beautiful). Her "sex scene" with Elisha Cook Jr. it's so delirious that you have to believe it. Another distinctive scene is that Kansas follows the bartender to interview him. It boils down to the scene of the pursuit, when he mercilessly takes him out onto the street, stopping at the subway station. Some really good tension. <br /> <br /> *** from 4
