I swear when I saw this movie for the first time, I cried my eyes! STAR IS A BORN movie that lets you know how love really is despite the obstacles on the face of John Norman (Kris Kristofferson) and Esther (Streisand). You also experience what it is like to lose such love at the end of the movie. Streisand and Kristofferson have such great chemistry, and the music is fantastic! When Streisand sings With one look at you / Watch now carefully, it's just pure magic! This movie has made the Evergreen song one of my favorites, and Queen Bee is such a fun song. I also love the fashion of the '70s (with the exception of Afro Streisand.) It is also beautiful.). And Star is Born is my favorite film number one. This movie is a pleasure to watch and is a breakthrough at the end.
