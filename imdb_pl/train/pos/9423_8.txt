I can not say whether the British comedies after World War II produced at Ealing Studios are acquired or not, but I am totally addicted, and the Man in a white suit is one of the best. There is no need to enter into the well-known thread of the threat posed by both the textile industry and textile compounds by the indestructible, dirt-resistant fiber. Suffice it to say that the slings and shots experienced by the na√Øve idealist Sidney Stratton in pursuit of his polymer vision cause comedy pleasure. Many famous faces from the world of British actors - nervous Cecil Parker, bizarre cunning Michael Gough and ruthlessly ruthless Ernest Thesinger - made great performances. Guinness - as always and forever - is wonderful, and Joan Greenwood is as good as Daphne (just as he says "dad", he makes the whole movie worth seeing). !!!! "
