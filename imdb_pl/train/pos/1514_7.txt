This extremely effective piece of British horror, containing several stars of All Hammer, revolves around the house and the fate of its previous tenants, whose stories are told by a detective from a shipyard in Scotland in search of a missing actor. <br /> <br /> History number one, probably the least impressive of the four, relates to the writer and his wife who have just moved home and plan to stay for a short time so that he could write one of his horror novels. He creates a demented character named Dominic, who is a very scary looking strangler, and soon turns out to be crazy when he begins to see this horrible looking man everywhere he goes. After his wife convinces him to seek psychiatric help, a sub-story is introduced which, to be honest, really does not work for me. I will not spoil this. <br /> <br /> The next story (the best in my opinion) plays great Peter Cushing as Philip Grayson, a man who moved into the house to retire and soon makes his way to a nearby wax museum (which deals with macabres), where he is very surprised to find a wax figure that looks exactly like a woman from his past. Shortly thereafter, an old friend (who also has a story with this woman) is in a city of business and falls into it to see him. The two men are waiting for a naughty awakening, because they soon discover that this woman is more than just an eye. <br /> <br /> The story of three stars one of my favorites ... Christopher Lee, who plays John Reid. After moving home with Jane's peculiar daughter, the nanny he employs becomes extremely suspicious about the way Reid suppresses her daughter. Well, to find out ... if she knew what Lee did, she would surely understand. <br /> <br /> The last story is a rather light tale of vampires in which there are John Pertwee and Ingrid Pitt. After buying a mantle from a mysterious merchant, actor Paul Henderson discovers that he turns into a creature portrayed several times in his career. <br /> <br /> In general, the pace and direction were very good, as it was the most spectacle. Here and there were nice gothic accents and an effective result complementing the atmosphere. This is a guardian and is highly recommended.
