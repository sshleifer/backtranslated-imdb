If the first film by Jean Renoir "Whirlpool of Fate" for the first time takes us into the world of villages, rivers, the life of the peasantry, which will continue, it seems that his second film mostly deals with the rich and privileged, the upper classes and those who try rise up. Put the characters from the first two films and feel the advantages of his great "Grand Illusion" and "Rules of the Game". It is beautifully filmed, with a restless camera, taking full advantage of the amazingly large apartments and backstage areas that dominate the interior of the film, and acting, although often interrupted, also offers great moments, especially from Muffat Werner Krauss. But gorgeous and sensual Mrs. Hessling, who at first glance seems to be able to give Louise Brooks an escape for her money in a vampire, she never goes beyond one note, a selfish portrait of a harlot. Perhaps this is partly a problem with the script, which seems to mainly use high points and outraged emotions; without reading the novel, I am not sure if the election was well done or not. <br /> <br /> However, the differences between Nana's suitors are well-matched, and I especially liked the relationship between Muffat and Jean Angelo Vandeuvres - a tragic understanding that each of them seems to have about their ultimate destiny and compassion for each other, especially in the scene at the bottom of the huge stairs, where Vandeuvres warns Muffat, and we wonder if violence will break out - this and other praise of the ridiculousness of idle wealth help give the film the depth it has. <br /> <br /> Far from his greatest achievement, and probably only a shy "Whirlpool of Fate" for me, it is still worth seeing for Renoir fans or interested in silent cinema.
