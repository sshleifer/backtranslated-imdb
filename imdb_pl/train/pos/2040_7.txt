CREEP is a simple, serious real-time horror that does not want anything more than to show that the mutant will attack on the empty subway platform for 85 minutes. And that's what he does. Nothing more nothing less. Director Christopher Smith draws the drama as far as possible, introducing a series of characters who would actually have a reason to be in the subway after closing. He also deliberately leaves the title Creep, deliberately unclear (it is said about illegal experiments in the underground of the 1960s) and a bit of a mystery. Unfortunately, it is undermined at the end, refraining from the twisting ending, in which there would be more genetic defects (they are also suggested). Yes, you heard me well - I wanted to finish the clich√©! Frank (RUN LOLA RUN) Potente is good because the terrorized woman leads and the rest of the cast is ok.
