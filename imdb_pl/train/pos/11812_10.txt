This movie is the best movie to watch with a view to comics. Sets, costumes and color are so vivid that they resemble a comic book. This is a movie that I think about when talking about Mobs, suits, hats and attitudes. <br /> <br /> Hoffman gives a comic relief when Mumbles and you can not help but feel compassion when Madonna tries and fails to win Tracy. This movie contains all the classic clich√©s of mobs - burying people in concrete, blowing up cars, tying a good guy and trying to blow up his girlfriend's house. <br /> <br /> This film is a classic in any meaning of the word, even the angels from the camera shout the comic. It's great to be able to get back to the older movie and see that someone knew how the comic should be done in the movie after seeing such bugs as Spawn and Hulk. <br /> <br /> YOU MUST SEE THIS FILM !!!!
