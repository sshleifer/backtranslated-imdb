This movie has several things. This is a story of "feeling good". The characters and actors are friendly, realistic and look great. The most important thing I think is that Dennis Quaid knows how to grab and throw baseball. Robert Redford looked good both throwing and swaying the whip in "The Natural", like Kevin Costner in "For Love of the Game" and "Bull Durham". In "Major League", Tom Berenger and Charlie Sheen looked as if they knew what they were doing, but many others did not, and this picture was pure and silly - and not too funny. <br /> <br /> So many earlier baseball movies, even where stories might be interesting, presented such a lack of baseball's ability on the part of the leaders, were absurd in this respect: in "The Stratton Story" and "Strategic Air Command" "Jimmy Stewart looked just as credible as a professional baseball player, like your overweight, not an athletic senior uncle in a softball game during the family reunion Other stars of high masculinity and physical condition (eg Gary Cooper as Lou Gehrig; Robald Reagan as Grover Cleveland Alexander; and Dan Dailey as Dizzy Dean) also showed some degree of baseball skill in the late rounds while "picking" the game on a Sunday picnic (even if it was coed, and even if the uncle was involved in it). <br /> <br /> Scenes from the school team Quaida, who he trained, those in which he takes part in a rehearsal with Devil Rays, and those in which he played in two smaller leagues and in the American League, all true. Participants are credible and capable. In addition, he is an engaging actor who always provides talented and appropriate characteristics (except, to some extent, some of his "best" scenes and his forced accent in the performance of Jerry Lee Lewis). But he's definitely in the pinch, and this movie is "9", as good or better as any other genre, except "The Natural."
