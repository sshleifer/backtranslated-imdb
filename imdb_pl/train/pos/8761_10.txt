I love Claire Danes, and Kate Beckinsale looks incredibly immature in her role. The film is defective only because it seems that both defendants seem to be in a monastery, working like monks on the grass and under the strict discipline of almost martial arts. Acting and filmography and the amazing colors of what is supposed to be Thailand are eye-catching, but Claire Daines steals the whole film and unexpectedly is deep in learning a hard life lesson to the very end of incredible unselfishness unprecedented and completely unexpected in the real world. The disadvantages are negligible and I recommend a movie that seems sad forever in rare television programs. For example, I want a movie for my collection - a collection of only '10' films. Take care, you will be very moved.
