Letters aimlessly go to another world located in the back rooms of the post office. Here, Alice manages to find a job in the hope of finding a missing father. He discovers the tormented soul of his boss, Frank. A quiet little Australian flick who came and went to the cinema. Now you can find him in the deep, dark corner of the video shop, dimmed by fifty copies of this terrifying movie, GODZILLA. It is a pity, because it turned out to be a satisfying film telling a bold story with strong, simple images and effective performances of two leaders. The film manages that another dead letter to Garry Marshall's office DEAR GOD (1996 - USA) has failed and is close to glamor, not to Kevin Costner, but to POSTMAN Heianj (1995 - China).
