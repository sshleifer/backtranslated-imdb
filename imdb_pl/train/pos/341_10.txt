I really enjoyed this thriller! I wanted to see it again when it's over. The cast was great, the story was full of tension and fun, and it was just a nice movie overall! I would rate it as one of the best thrillers I've ever seen! The girls in him were also really cute, especially Denise Richards. She was very ornery throughout the movie and gave her character a bit of OOMPH!
