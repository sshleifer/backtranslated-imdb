The Gang of Roses. "Every rose has its spines." <br /> <br /> A mixture of old western and hip hop, perfectly combined. Dress styles, scenery and plot are adapted to what the director wanted. <br /> <br /> Plot - they rob twenty-seven banks in five years and then disappeared without a trace. Now the small western town is under siege and one of the first victims is Rachel's sister. Rose Gang is ready to go. And this time it's a personal matter. <br /> <br /> Rachel (Michael Calhoun), Chastity (Lil 'Kim), Maria (Lisaraye), Zang Li (Marie Matiko) and Kim (Stacey Dash), five gunslingers who parted after five years of riding together . When Rachel's sister is killed, she ends up gathering her friends again and riding along the vengeance route. <br /> <br /> A good, dirty version of the western. (If you've seen Bad Girls, well, it's a bit better in terms of female characters). <br /> <br /> I gave him 10/10, because the characters, story and scenery did it for me.
