It reminded me of the Spinal Tap at a more serious level. This is the story of a band that organizes a concert tour, but there is no harmony between them. I was impressed with Bill Nighy's performance as Ray. You felt sorry for him, but he had some fear in him. It's a great movie to watch if you've ever seen your favorite band wasted, old and pathetic.
