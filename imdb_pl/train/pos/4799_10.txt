Perhaps more than many movies, this one is not for everyone. For some people the idea of ​​slowing down, reflecting and allowing it to happen at their own time is a good description of their personal hell. For others, this approach speaks to some deep part of their knowledge that exists to some part with which they miss contact. <br /> <br /> I suppose it is a function of where I am in my life today, but I am counting in the camp of this last group. I found that the meditative tempo of this film is almost hypnotic, gently leading me to the almost mythological land. This is actually a journey history, a rich representation of the distance many of us have to travel if we are to circle at the end of our days. <br /> <br /> Much has been written about the performance of Alvin by Mr. Farnsworth Prosto, though I am not sure if there are words that would express the perfect balance of the dazed sadness and wise innocence that he conjured for us. Knowing now that he had actually come to terms with his own mortality while sitting in this tractor seat, I wish I had the opportunity to spend time with him before he left. I hope that he had a small flash of satisfaction and truth that he brought to so many people, not only for "acting", but for sharing absolute humanity with such brutal honesty. <br /> <br /> Given the realities of economics, I'm not sure that full recognition was given to Mr. Lynch for the courage he showed, allowing history to develop so slowly. Regardless of the film production, I nevertheless understand that there are few areas of modern life in which the expression "time is money" is so thoroughly descriptive. Immerse yourself in our hearts is not an adventure that can be rushed, and in his favor Mr. Lynch seems to understand that he did not just tell history - he invited his viewers to spend some time with their mortality. There is no simple task. <br /> <br /> If you want to experience the power of a movie to show you a valuable part of yourself, you can do something worse than spend a few hours with The Straight Story. And then give yourself some time for the next, just listening to his echo in the small hours of the night.
