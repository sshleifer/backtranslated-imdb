Initially I bought this DVD, because the cover was SRK and Aishwarya Rai and I thought: hey! another film from Aishu and Shah Rukh, I did not know much that Aishwarya will only appear in the issue in the last quarter of the movie in the song he shares with SRK and help introduce his character, who is in the film for about 15 minutes. Shakti is a film about love and endurance of the mother. It is a film about changes, ignorance, maturing, entering knowledge and embracing the harsh realities of life. The item number in which SRK and Aishu appear has nothing to do with the film. In fact, it is a sequence of dreams that occurs when a drunken SRK character is knocked unconscious by alcohol. He dreams that Aishwarya Rai is the sexy street girl who one day appears in his favorite meeting place, wearing a scantily dressed and seductive body. The title of the song is "Ishq Kamina" (loosely translated as "Love is a bitch!") And it's just hot smoking! Do not miss it.
