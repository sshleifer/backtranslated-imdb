Cary Grant, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Victor McLaglen are three soldiers in nineteenth-century India, who with the help of a boy from the water (Sam Jaffe) get rid of the murderous worship of thugs. Chemistry between actors makes it one of the most entertaining movies of all time. Sam Jaffe is unique as an outcast who is badly treated by everyone and still wants to be accepted as a soldier in the company. Loosely based on the poem by Rudyard Kipling. Everyone who likes this type of film has to see.
