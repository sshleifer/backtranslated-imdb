"Yokai Daisenso" is Takashi Miike's children's movie, but as you might expect, it's probably too dark and frightening for the younger ones. However, older children can eat well, that is, if you play English in dubbing. <br /> <br /> The story is about a boy who moved with his mother to the country to live with his grandfather after divorce. During the village festival the boy is chosen as the "rider of Kirin", a great honor, but with this honor is of course a great danger and adventure. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, bad deeds are at hand as a woman in a white mini skirt, go-go shoes and hive hairstyle, join forces with evil Yokai to oppose people and reject objects. And this evil manifested itself as a flying city in the form of a monster that is heading to the very city of Wrath, Tokyo. One rather funny scene has two neglected monsters watching over the city ... says one: "Oh, it's just Gamera." <br /> <br /> A young boyfriend befriended the Yokai, which are monsters, mostly gentle, that have been isolated from people, and all Yokai teams in Japan are fighting evil together. <br /> <br /> In many respects, Miike and the crew made Yokai movies from the late 60s and early 70s and transformed them into a modern adventure film for (older) children who also combines strange mechanical monsters that have made them I thought about Transformers. The look and style of the film is great, the effects are fun, and some of the humor will flow right over the heads of children, but nevertheless, the elders can enjoy it. When it comes to adults, there is not much to please, if you're a fan of Japanese monster movies, you'll like it. <br /> <br /> Cool and fun stuff, sometimes dark but maybe it's just Miike ... and what a crazy ride. 8 out of 10.
