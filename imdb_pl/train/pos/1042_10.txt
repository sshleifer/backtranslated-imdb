An American woman, her European husband and children return to her mother's home in the movie Watch on the Rhine, based on the play Lillian Hellman from 1943, with Paul Lukas (who I think he repeats his stage role here), Bette Davis , Lucile Watson, George Coulouris, Geraldine Fitzgerald and Donald Woods. An anti-fascist, underground worker, many times wounded and sought by the Nazis, Kurt Muller (Lukas) needs a long vacation in the estate of his rich mother-in-law. But he learns that there really is no escape, because one of the guests of the house (Coulouris) is suspicious of his true identity and more than willing to sell him. <br /> <br /> This film is full of great performances, written very much to show the liberal point of view of Lillian Hellman. It was certainly a powerful propaganda vehicle when it was released, because the evil of war and what happened to people in other countries reached safe American homes. The great controversy in today's film is that Paul Lukas won the Oscar for Humphrey Bogart in "Casablanca." Humphrey Bogart was a great presence on screen and a fantastic Rick, but Lukas is transcendent like Kurt. The monologue, which is about the need to kill, is a jerk to mention only one scene. <br /> <br /> Although it is not something that is thought about the film Bette Davis, it gives here a masterful performance as Loyal and loving wife Kurta, Sara. Her acting heart strokes and love scenes between Kurt and Sarah are beautiful and delicate. <br /> <br /> The last half hour of the movie had tears in the sincerity of emotion. Lillian Hellman is not a cup of tea, but unlike "The Little Foxes", she wrote some really nice, great characters and a wonderful story given by Warner Brothers. Highly recommended.
