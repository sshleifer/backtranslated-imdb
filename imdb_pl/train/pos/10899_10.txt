During this movie I laughed so much that my face ached. Ben Affleck was hilarious and reminded me of a nice boyfriend Jacek Black in this role. Gandolfini gives his typical performance. The whole cast is fun, the story is pretty good and the comic moments are amazing. I went to this film without expecting too much, maybe that's why I was so surprised that I left this movie completely satisfied and exhausted in terms of sex. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes comedy, can identify with loneliness during the holidays and / or put up with relatives. The best part of this movie (and so for me) were the subtle elements of humor that completely scared me away and made me laugh long after the rest of the audience stopped. Namely, the scene with the Christmas tree lighting. Go see him and laugh good!
