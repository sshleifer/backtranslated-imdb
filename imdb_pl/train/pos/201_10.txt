The marvelous and underestimated Marion Davies shows her things in this late (1928) quiet comedy, which also shows the wonderful William Haines. Davies plays a hick from Georgia who smashes Hollywood with the help of Haines. They appear in cheap comedies until Marion is "discovered" and becomes a great dramatic star. A great lampoon about Hollywood and its grudges. Davies and Haines are a great band (it's a pity they never created talkie) and guest shots by artists such as Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, John Gilbert, Elinor Glynn and Marion Davies (you must see this is a hoot. for any serious movie lover or for anyone who is interested in the still nasty Marion Davies!
