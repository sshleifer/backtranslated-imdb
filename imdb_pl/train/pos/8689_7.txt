An excellent cast for a few people drama. Simon is dead, but he somehow resurrects from the outside. What he saw there is displayed in the form of empty spaces arranged for the wonderful result of the German avant-garde composer Werner Henze. Simon is haunted by his death, comforted by the support of the death men he saw on the other side. His girlfriend tries to revive him, but no, he decides to follow him after his death. Very touchy and moving, deeply psychological, but a bit slow and even boring.
