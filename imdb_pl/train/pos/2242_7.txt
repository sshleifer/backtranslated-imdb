It is partly due to the need to include a conventional love story in the story so that the film will be more accessible to the audience of the 1950s. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the wicked funny characteristics of high-ranking bureaucrats running the Ministry of Foreign Affairs --- The British are pilloried in a way that only the British can brag. But then the film loses its way in the conventional Farce story. Terry-Thomas watched as always, but the great talent in the cast (Peter Sellers, et al) is largely wasted. <br /> <br /> A thrilling but not great movie.
