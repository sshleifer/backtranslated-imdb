I was able to watch this film in its entirety and I was deeply moved by it. I was not sure if it was really a comedy or drama - it contained elements of both. Mary Tyler Moore and Valerie Harper looked great - our image of 60-year-old women has definitely changed since Aunt Bee's time! They are lively, beautiful, sexy! The only disadvantage of this movie was that there was no mention of other characters in the "MTM" or "Rhoda" programs from the 70s. I would think that since it was founded in New York (where "Rhoda" was set up), at least some mention of her sister Brenda or Julie Kavner will appear, assuming, of course, that she is still in Big Apple. <br /> <br /> I hope that ABC will make a series of it and bring back all the old casts of these concerts. By the way, what was wrong with the CBS doing this meeting, or a possible series? Was not this the network that displayed "MTM" and "Rhoda"?
