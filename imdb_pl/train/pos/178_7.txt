The "protocol" is a hit-and-miss picture with Goldie Hawn as a champagne waitress who rescues the Arab visitor's life one night before the attack. The woman immediately becomes a celebrity and gets a new job for the US government. Will the corridors of power in the capital of our country always be the same? Hawn is perfect as usual, although "Protocol" is not as much fun as her best movie "Private Benjamin". But it's still a good movie, and I was laughing a lot. <br /> <br /> *** (out of four)
