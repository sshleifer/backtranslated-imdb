I saw the film for the first time in the 1980s as a small boy. My dad recorded it from the TV. I had to watch over 20 times before a relatively recent release on DVD. <br /> <br /> Of course I bought and watched the DVD and I was surprised how much the dialogue changed. In the first version, which I still have on VHS, the mood of the film, thanks to the dialogue, was in fact very dark. However, the new version, with the participation of Van Der Beek and others, is more comic. <br /> <br /> In other words, it's like watching the original Akira's American release with this dub, before watching the remastered version with a literal Japanese translation. <br /> <br /> I'm not complaining in any way, the story and the quality of the animation are not reduced, but it raises the question whether Miyazaki intended a lighter or darker narration and a motif in his film ...
