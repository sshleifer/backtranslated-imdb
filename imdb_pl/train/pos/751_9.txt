This is one of the best films of Jodie Foster, which is largely ignored because of the public's misconception that it is a teen movie. She has great performances, especially the fight scene between Jodie and her mother, played by convincing Sally Kellerman. The three girls playing Jodie's friends are a bit amateur, but I think it's worth seeing them.
