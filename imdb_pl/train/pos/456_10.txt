It is a beautiful film restoring the spirit. From the use of a real villa that inspired Elizabeth Arngrim to write a novel in the 1920s to an inspired casting, every choice was completely right! The quiet joy of this film does not disappear after repeated reviews. Josie Lawrence, Miranda Richardson, Polly Walker and Joan Plowright seem to be born to play these roles! I would love to see Enchanted April released on DVD in a widescreen format.
