This is your standard music comedy from the 1930s, with a big plus that includes some well-known actors from the 30s in small funny scenes. <br /> <br /> There is not much history, and basically the film is everything about your play and the general atmosphere of "no worries" with the typical Hal Roach comedy. It looks like it's a Cinderella story, but I certainly have not thought about it this way while watching a movie. The story becomes very confusing in the story, which contains many different characters, as well as many small episodic appearances, when the main characters hit Hollywood studios. <br /> <br /> Of course, the main attraction of the film is Laurel & Hardy appear and show some of their procedures. It's like watching a movie and getting Laurel & Hardy for free. Also, Laurel and Hardy regular Walter Long appears in the routine, and James Finlayson (this time without mustache) as the director of the short film. <br /> <br /> It is true that all scenes and threads distract the main plot line and character, but in this case it is not a problem, because it is much more fun and interesting to watch than the main plot line and tile typical main character. <br /> <br /> The movie is certainly no worse than any of the other genre films from the same period, although the rating here would suggest otherwise. <br /> <br /> 7/10
