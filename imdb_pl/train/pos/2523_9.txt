When I first heard about Moon Child, I thought it was a joke. After a few months, I thought it was real. A few reviews that I read that were NOT made by squeaking fangirls was not very promising. <br /> <br /> When I was given the opportunity to see it, I was fully prepared for moans, curvature and other needs to close my eyes to avoid being stupid. <br /> <br /> I was more than a little surprised and in a good way. <br /> <br /> Yes, Moon Child has his moments of cheese, camp and general stupidity - I think it can not be avoided when it concerns Gackt Camui, a man unknown to healthy senses - but all in all it was quite pleasant. <br /> <br /> No, this is not the work of a genius movie, but it is very, very cordial, funny, with funny choreography, moving result and fun cast. I do not know much about Japanese cinema, so I can not really judge acting, but given the fact that the cast spoke a language or an extreme dialect for them at one time or another and that few of them have almost no acting experience, I was impressed . <br /> <br /> If you can enjoy a good action movie, good drama, good comedy, see this movie. At least rent because it comes to Region 1. <br /> <br /> By the way, in this movie there are no homosexual / homoerotic content. I did not even see too many overtones. Do not let people who read too much fall into disrepair.
