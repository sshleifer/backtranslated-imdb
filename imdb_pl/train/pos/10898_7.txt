This movie is not as bad as I heard. It was pleasant, fun and I love the fact that it revolves around the holiday season. He's totally in the mood for Christmas shopping and listening to Christmas music. When this movie comes out on DVD, it will take the place of Christmas Vacation in my collection. It will be a movie that will be watched every year after Thanksgiving, to ensure my mood for the best time of year. I heard that Ben's character was a bit crazy, but I think it just adds to the movie and why it's so serious all the time. Take this for what it is, a Christmas comedy with a love accent. I liked. No, it's not Titanic and it does not make your heart beat, but it will make you laugh. So laugh and have fun :)
