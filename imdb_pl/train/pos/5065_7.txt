All in all a good movie and a better fact that if the film was not realized, the story could be hidden from the masses. Brosnan does a good job as a native American with a hidden past, and the photography is stunning. For some it may be too capricious, for others it is boring - for me it is a gentle, well-told story and ideal for watching a family. Now, this is not something that has not happened much lately.
