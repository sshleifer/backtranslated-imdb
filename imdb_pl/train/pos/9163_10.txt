When my school-aged daughter was in kindergarten, this miniseria appeared on A & E every day from 8am to 9am. My neighbor and I have a pact that we will not miss a minute of Jane Eyre, and our children are late in kindergarten every morning throughout the week. A good choice. <br /> <br /> I forgot how much I loved this movie until I recently released my old copy of VHS. Timothy Dalton is very handsome, but still perfect as Rochester. The dark, rocky face, imperious attitude softened by humor and tenderness were directly from the pages of the book. Although Dalton eats some scenery, I could not sit in the adaptation with wimpy William Hurt or grumpy Ciaran Hinds. The magic is that women love Dalton and become entangled in romance. <br /> <br /> I would like to know what happened to Zelah Clarke. She is dead as Jane, quiet, official, talking volumes with just a look. The flash in her eyes gives viewers the power and thrilling nature that helped Jane survive the ill-treatment she experienced in her youth. The criticism of her performance as "wooden" is wrong. A servant in a proper English household would only behave like that, but he speaks with passion when he is moved by emotions. Unlike many others, Janes from the screens seems simple enough to be Jane, but pretty enough to let the audience draw her to her. this intact. Dalton and Clarke catch Jane and Rochester playing with a distinct and quiet intensity. Although Jane looks as simple and sweet as vanilla cream, she does not want to be intimidated by the dark, penetrating Rochester. Both wires are beautiful. <br /> <br /> This is the most perfect adaptation of the best romantic novel in history.
