As a fan of looking at the phenomenon of school shootings, this film has taken an interesting and different approach to this idea. Presented as a series of video recordings made by two restless men (I can not refer to people who kill as boys or teenagers), months of preparations leading to day zero (code name on the day when they will attack) the film tries to present the situation from the opposite end gun. It seems that they are going to present the pain they suffer, but it focuses on literal preparation. The problem is that it does not provide much emotion. The only point where emotions became overwhelming was the ending, as expected. But up to this point, it is never clear why they are planning. We were told the obligatory story that they were ridiculed, but the film also seems to contradict it. Without ruining the movie, it's easy to say that it was a great rehearsal and it was equally intentional, but because of the careless making of movies. All directing is amateurish to develop the concept of home video, but history and continuity are weak. It seems that the film wants the audience to make a lot of decisions, but also does not provide information about this event. The ending is violent and does not have the impression that it ends with everything the film started.
