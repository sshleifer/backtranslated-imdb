Huge fun for both adults and children, this film works on many levels: everything is from car crashes and cakes in the face to very good (but subtle) jokes for adults. <br /> <br /> Glenn Close is in her extremely bad as Cruella ("call me Ella") De Ville. <br /> <br /> After three years in the Behavior Modification Department, Dr. Pavlov is cured of thirst for fur? even the puppy skin she wanted so much. He even has all the fur in the dungeons of the unusual castle that he lives in. <br /> <br /> But it would not be a "Dalmatian" movie without deception and Cruella's machinations and you know something about it that will change her behavior. And now I need one extra puppy (hence 102 Dalmatians) to end this wicked plan this time. <br /> <br /> Ioan Gruffudd is immediately attractive as the main character of the film, which runs a dog shelter "Second Chance". Although he was in the "Titanic" and last year's television version (as Pip) "Great expectations", I did not recognize him; Well, he was the "Fifth Lowe officer" in the "Titanic" and I did not see "Great Expectations", so I'm not really surprised. <br /> <br /> Gerard Depardieu makes a wonderful turn as a pawn of a furrier Cruella. He is proud and poses in the most bizarre and outrageous fur clothes you've ever seen? and he does it well. His tribute to "Wicked Witch of the West" is funny. <br /> <br /> Tim McInnerny is a great, not too bad supporter of Cruella? he was also "Alonzo", "Crusel coder" in "101 Dalmatians" and you can also recognize him from all "Black Adders" Brit-Coms. He plays his typical, inept, good-natured, slightly depressed character to get a great effect. <br /> <br /> Oscars for costumes are generally awarded for all costumes in the film. This is unfortunate because the clothes worn by Glenn Close are amazing? it is incredibly detailed (pay attention to her handcuffs when she is released from the Behavior Modification Clinic) and deserves such a superior character. Her clothes deserve at least an Oscar nomination. <br /> <br /> Animation has a special place in my heart? but comparing this movie to the original animated film is like comparing apples to orangutans: it can not be done. Suffice to say that "102 Dalmatians" is even better than the film version of "101 Dalmatians", which appeared in 1996. Here is a lot to like: from sight, dialogues and costumes to casting - it's a good movie for the whole family.
