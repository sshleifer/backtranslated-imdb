Okay, to tell the truth, I saw the announcement of this movie and thought about what the producers think? Hutton, Jolie and DUCHOVNY? How could the monotonous actor compete with Jolie's natural power on the screen? But unexpectedly both had chemistry that showed intensive care without a kiss. Even David's mood matched Jolie's spark and fire. As for Hutton, he played psycho very well, contrasting with the calm delivery of David's life-threatening situation. Overall, I was impressed by the writing and development of the character. I gave him 8 stars.
