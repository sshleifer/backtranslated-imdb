This movie tells about this naughty guy who decides to become a spy for a great high tech company named Digicorp. This skinny guy, Morgan (Jeremy Northam) is dissatisfied with his pathetic suburban life and demanding wife, so he decides to become a spy. It has to go on conventions with other high tech companies and learn about all company plans. Instead, Morgan is convinced that he is attracted by a beautiful woman (played by Lucy Liu) and almost two of the two companies that force him to become a double agent. How will Morgan get out of this? Can he trust the beautiful but mysterious Rita Foster (played by Lucy Liu)? And more importantly, can Morgan survive? Wow! What a cool movie! I was completely caught after 15 minutes of watching this movie. He is very uncertain and you can feel the fear and confusion of Morgan, who does everything to stay alive. The scene in which they put this awful device on Morgan's head to brainwash him is terribly frightening and frightening. Morgan is slowly undergoing a personality transformation that is not so obvious until you think about it after the movie ends. From a naughty guy with bad hair and glasses, he turns into a man actively fighting for his life. <br /> <br /> Finishing, wow, the ending is amazing! Twist is so much fun! It made me gasp and cheered like crazy! Good performances from around the world, especially Jeremy Natham, Lucy Liu and Nigel Bennett. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie!
