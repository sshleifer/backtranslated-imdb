In a word ... amazing. <br /> <br /> At first I did not want to watch Pinjar, because I thought it would be another movie lamenting the partition and show prejudices against India and Pakistan. I was so wrong. Pinjar is a poignant, emotional and intelligent movie with no visible flaws. I was persecuted by this after watching. It was in my mind for so long; topics, pain, loss, emotions - everything was so real. <br /> <br /> This is really a masterpiece that you can rarely see in Bollywood. He has no prejudices or prejudices and gave human history. Here, no country is depicted as good or bad. There are bad Indians, bad Pakistani and good Indians and Pakistanis. The photos are excellent, and the music is melodious, meaningful (thanks to Gulzar sahib) and haunted. Everything in the film was amazing ... and acting was breathtaking. Everyone was perfectly staffed. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in watching an intellectual and really great movie ... look no further. This movie gives it all. I recommend with all my heart. AMAZING can not describe how perfect it is.
