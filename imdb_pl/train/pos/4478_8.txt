In general, it is a charming, light, romantic, musical comedy. I suppose you can do a little thing to make the movie long. But I'm not sure what you would cut out. A song that Kelly and Sinatra do? No. A great dance that Kelly does? No. The time needed to develop the plot and develop the relationship between characters? No (this seems to be a frequent complaint many times that newer films do not develop characters). <br /> <br /> Some say that Iturbi did not bring much to the film, but it gives us the chance to see and hear the great talent from the 40's. What if he was not an actor? It was an important part of the movie because the main plot was to get Grayson interviewed. <br /> <br /> Originally Katherine Grayson wanted to become the star of the opera. Louis B. Mayer took her to the MGM for a screen test that included aria. During the interrogation in the film is a shot of MGM brass, nodding and smiling. You can only imagine that it was like that when she made a real screen test years ago. <br /> <br /> This movie is so full of life that it is difficult to hit all the major events. Great use of color and lighting throughout the movie. You can see why Frank Sinatra became the star he did. A nice turning point in the film is the way in which Sinatra (a woman even then) played a role in wanting to simply find a date during the holiday. After watching this movie you will feel good. 7/10
