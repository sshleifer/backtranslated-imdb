I saw it as many times as I could before leaving the stage. A great and fun movie with my favorite stars. It is a pity that I can not find it! I would certainly buy it if I could. Please, somebody bring it back. Fred MacMurray was perfect as a patriot during World War II, and his leading ladies, Joan Leslie, and especially June Haver, were beautiful and charming. It was a musical, but also romantic, funny and clever. It was my favorite movie from June Haver, though I always liked it. Her dazzling smile lit up the screen, and her beauty and talent were the trump of any film. Supporters lend loans to their individual roles. A well-balanced and light film; it is a pity that we did not have more such things!
