Halloween is the story of a boy who was misunderstood as a child. He removes his problems with his older sister, whom he murders at the beginning of the film. This is just the beginning of things from Michael Myers. <br /> <br /> Donald Pleasance is a doctor who has been studying Myers for years. He knows that something in him is different, something mysteriously evil. This evil will not be stopped and you can not stop it. <br /> <br /> After escaping from the institution, Myers hunts a younger sister. If he kills her, he can end up with the troubles of this incomprehensible boy. But he seems to have problems finishing his sister because other people are disturbing. He manages to eliminate them, still looking for the one girl he needs. <br /> <br /> There were many horror movies in which teenagers were murdered by a masked or macabre killer. But he started everything. If you think about it, most of the horrors we all remember are those in which Freddy Kruger or Jason chase around naked girls. Well, if it were not Halloween, these characters would not haunt our dreams when we were children. <br /> <br /> The director of Halloween, John Carpenter, many of the 1950s horrors and combined everything he knew, into one movie that scared many people in the late 70's. These films strengthened him as a director to watch, and he began his career with Jamie Lee Curtis, who plays a girl persecuted by a masked killer. <br /> <br /> This movie may seem trivial today, but then there was not much. It was copied and torn out, but Halloween will always remain the quintessence of a teenage horror movie. It still gives you chills, listening to Carpenter's exciting music, while we see another victim pursued by this dark Michael Myers.
