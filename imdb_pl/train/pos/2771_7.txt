David and Bathsheba is a sumptuous Hollywood biblical picture produced by 20th Century Fox by Darryl F. Zanucka directed by Henry King with Gregory Peck {King David}, Susan Hayward (Bathsheba), Raymond Massey (Nathan), Kieron Moore (Uriah)) and Jayne Meadows (Michal). <br /> <br /> The film is based on the second Old Testament book of Samuel in the Holy Bible. He follows King David who, as a child, killed a giant Goliath, and now we find him in adulthood as the second king of Israel. Hard and sure of the king, David has matters of heart that cause great problems. After he spies Bathsheba taking a shower, this is the beginning of a journey involving adultery and betrayal; a journey that will end with the appeal of God's judgment. <br /> <br /> Usually for the genre, David and Batszeba are big, great production. From the perfect set design to the positively beautiful Technicolor photograph {Leon Shamroy}, it has enough quality to guarantee that it sits next to each other best, as the genre has to offer in terms of production value. Unusually, although the film is calm and based on 99% of its value, it is driven only by dialogue. This is not for action fans, or anyone who needs some swash to go with the buckle. This is a very humanistic picture, in reality it does not allow us to fight around a bush burning here, it is a biblical love story speckled with the sins of the heart. But this is not a bad thing, because it's bad, we think it's very well-behaved (Peck has a stoic but helpless thing that's going really well, and Hayward pushes her to the maximum) and it's a great story to get to know the skill often forgotten Henry King. And although some dialogues are scandalous, the character's flow is never interrupted, as Oscar nominee Phillip Dunne (The Ghost and Mrs. Muir) attracts attention all the time. <br /> <br /> Sometimes a forgotten picture in terms of biblical genres / Swords & Sandals (most likely because it is a talkative piece that has a heart as the main selling point), but it's really worth the time for anyone he is interested in the most sumptuous genres. 7/10
