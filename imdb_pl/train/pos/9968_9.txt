My mother took me to watch this movie as a child and I miss seeing it every year because I'm doing all the other favorite Christmas presents. I remember most stupid Devil and Nicholas looking through his telescope. I waited and looked at the T.V. every year after that to see when it will be shown. Usually, I would play on a Saturday afternoon. I found only a film in English that took something special from the movie and I wanted to find a copy in Spanish. I keep this movie dear to my heart and I have never suffered from nightmares, as other people may suggest. Yes, this is a different movie about Santa Claus and that's what makes him unique and special. I can not wait to get a copy of this movie and watch it with my children, because I explain to them my favorite parts and memories !!
