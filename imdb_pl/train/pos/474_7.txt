Without reading Nabokov and not knowing anything about chess, I could watch "The Defense of Luzhina" as a movie. <br /> <br /> It works very well as one of my favorite genres of "sports romances." Chess comes to life as a tough competition much more than in the saying "Bobby Fischer's search", showing how hard mental work can be, requiring thought, preparation, endurance and planning. I especially liked the special effects on the chessboard, because alternative games are expected. <br /> <br /> Through the feminist director Maureen Gorris (from "Antonia"), Emily Watson, with her blue eyes, gradually strengthens herself thanks to her transformative relationship with the rather unanimous, intense chess genius of John Turturro. <br /> <br /> Settings in Italy and Hungary are beautiful. <br /> <br /> (originally written on 5/27/2001)
