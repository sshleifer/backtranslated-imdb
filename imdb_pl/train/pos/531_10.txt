This movie has the most beautiful opening sequence ever made. I saw this movie for the first time a week ago, because I see it openly every day and every time I feel so excited, how I felt for the first time, when I heard David Niven say immortal words from the pilgrimage of Sir Walter Raleigh. <br /> <br /> Give me my shell of silence, My rod of faith walk, My skin of joy, immortal diet, My bottle of salvation, My grace of glory, true hope; And that's why I will take my pilgrimage (??) <br /> <br /> Do you know why it would be a truism to say that the life of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressuburger is perfectly justified, that they created such a wonderful opening? Because they had already been accepted into Paradise Poets long before they made the film. <br /> <br /> I imagine that they both face a trial in Doomsday and talk nonchalantly to an annoyed God: I am asking for forgiveness. Do you want to know what we did during our lifetime? Well, you'll see: We wrote the director and produced: I know where I'm going, Colonel Blimp, Red Shoes ?? Do you think that's enough for Sir? It is quite obvious that these two wonderful artists have already fulfilled their obligations to God, Nature Muza, or whatever you can call when they made the "Matter of Life and Death." The fact that other people's lives would be justified on account of their actions can not be obvious to everyone, although I feel that my life would matter if I had never done anything else to see the movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, old people will be tempted to say: they no longer make films like this one. They will be partly wrong; in the past, they did not make such films. <br /> <br /> I have already quoted Keats, but I will repeat his words: the thing of beauty is a joy forever.
