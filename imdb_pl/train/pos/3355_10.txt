May 1938. Hitler in Italy. Preparations for the historical appointment with Mussolini. Emotions, tensions and forms of self-affirmation. an empty city, a housewife and a journalist. Meeting of two different worlds. A shelter for a mother with a sad life. A short fill for the classic victim. A tale of loneliness and silence. About the form of the nooks and crannies of life as a form of struggle. Wonderful figure - book received in the spring of the afternoon. This film is an unusual poem for art describing the shades of common loneliness. Pleading for an ineffable relationship with reality. And with your inner world. Il Duce's cinematography, Gabriel's awkwardness, patience and frailty, director's art giving a sense of grace to the two great actors makes this film sublime, a foretaste of subtle delicacy, a wonderful film about hypocrisy and an arbitrary verdict about the essence of life and the repulsion of any tyranny. Loren and Mastroianni are masters of great intelligent acting. A bright masterpiece.
