I grew up watching this series. I was about seven / eight years old when it was. I still remember the first episode, which was called "The New House". It scared me! I can almost hear the statue, laughing madly. And finally, oh my God! The hoorora spirit appears in a child's room: Yikes! It was a classic TV set and it was one of a kind. I found a DVD collection for sale on the internet: 2 actually. My question to all readers: Has anyone bought this set? This bootleg. Both sellers claim that they have a very good copy. I have a scanty and bad DVD with the episode "The New House" and a few other episodes, which are a bit better, but if anyone knows if they are much brighter, it would be worth buying and sharing with my children. A wonderful series, wise, terrifying and courageously supernatural. Thank you in advance for any supporter who has any doubts - I would like to discuss it. Chris Walker
