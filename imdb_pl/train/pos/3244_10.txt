I could not agree with the comments of Nomad 7 and I A HVR. The perfect, relaxed Sunday movie. Humor is subtle (the exact opposite of "slapstick", as one wrong commenter pointed out). <br /> <br /> But what always surprises me is how often I want to come back to this movie over and over again. Originally, I copied this video to VHS about 12 years ago, when it premiered on one of these Pay Cable weekends (maybe HBO?). I've never heard of it before. I do not know why it was not sold so well. ?? When DVDs were released en masse, it was one of the first films I replaced. A great combination of cast and writing. Plus, a drop of wild nature in Montana is also okay (beautiful). <br /> <br /> Probably not a type of comedy for everyone, but what is it? If things like Adam Sandler are in your avenue, it probably will not be your cup of tea. This movie requires your full attention. Humor is mainly in the dialog. <br /> <br /> I believe that my next visit will probably be about my twelfth. But I still know that when it comes to scenes like this, in which the hoods of police cars are beginning to dissolve, I will lose it (the face of Ed O'Neill is FREE!). Recommended 110%.
