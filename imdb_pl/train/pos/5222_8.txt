After Chicago, I began to lose my respect for Richard Gere, and then along with The Flock. So far, there is a nice smile and a few facial gestures can help you, but he proved to me that he finally got his craft and could work with the best of them. Clare Danes was also great as his "apprentice / deputy". Some suggest that there was too much unnecessary violence, but I do not see it that way. Nothing I saw did not diminish the power of this film. I was really shocked that I had not heard about his release in theaters and instead came across him in Blockbuster. A truly unique movie with the right combination of action, tension, emotions and social awareness. As good as seventeen? Perhaps. And you'll see that Gere works better than anyone who ever got out of Pitt.
