This is the perfect Sammo Hung movie. Actually, this is a great piece of action cinema in Hong Kong. The story tells about the pedicab drivers in Macao looking for love and mixed up with furious pimp. The performances are excellent and the characters are nice and well-defined. The story is addictive and contains enough affairs, dramas, comedies and suspensions to observe between fight scenes. Sammo Hung proves here that he is probably the best choreographer of the fight in the industry. The action is simply amazing, especially. fight with Lau Kar Leung and the finale. Billy Chow and Sammo Hung are amazing. You must see for each action fan.
