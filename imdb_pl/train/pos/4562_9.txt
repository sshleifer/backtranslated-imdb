Yesterday I saw this movie on DVD and I was stunned. The undamaged operation of DDL only broke my mind and I was surprised by the entire cast and its great performance. The whole character was so authentic to me that I really took DDL for Christy Burns and Brenda Fricker for his mother. Go and see it! You will cry, but you will experience a wonderful catharsis! In addition, it teaches you one important lesson: It's all. You can be a cripple in the poor suburbs of Dublin, but when you're stubborn enough, you will not have any problems. If you can only operate with your left foot, you are still good enough to become a painter or writer. The worst thing you can do when you are mentally retarded is self-pity. You will not get anywhere, and the only person who pities over you will be alone.
