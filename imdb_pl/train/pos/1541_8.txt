I just watched this movie today at the Seattle International Film Festival and we loved it. <br /> <br /> Great writing and direction, excellent and reliable interaction between the cast and great comic time. <br /> br /> This film deals with topics of universal character and separation. As a result, I see the European, Asian and American audiences in all points of similarity between this film and their own lives. <br /> <br /> If all this was not enough, it has the potential to be the best underground movie of the year ... someone distributes it in the US, please! <br /> <br /> Finally: thank you Maria Flom! It's a really great movie.
