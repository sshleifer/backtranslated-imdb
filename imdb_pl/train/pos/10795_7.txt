Ooverall, the movie was pretty good, a good action plot with lots of explosions and battle scenes, but Chuck Norris did almost nothing, except to disarm the bomb and launch a few characters. The film was very similar to the events of September 11, when a terrorist resembling bin laden sent a video to the president (Urich) and threatened to detonate him. Judson Mills had some great roles in action, eliminating Rashid's relationship and various kicking roles but missing Chuck Norris. Judson took over most of the action, leaving Joshua (chuck) with Que on his computer. But in general, he was realistic and he did not lack action, but he only did part of Mr. Norris. I gave the movie 7/10.
