I followed the trip two years ago on the Internet - now I saw the movie !! What a ride! And what a journey to finally get to know Darius Weems! Such a brave, wise, funny and talented ghost! And what a crew! To listen to how Darius laughs at the water in Panama, to see his fear of too close contacts with alligators in Louisiana, surprise in his eyes when he rode a hot air balloon, excite the rafting by some rapids put on a wasabi spoon, and the phone rings to home and as always - the boys will be boys. This film has to be watched by everyone - both young and old. Darius and his mother are models of strength and courage. Crew members are testaments to the heart of the young generation. They got a new wheelchair for Darius; documented accessibility problems; they took Darius on the journey of his life; and touched many, many lives. Raising DMD awareness and encouraging research funding, this film will help achieve the ultimate goal of Darius Goes West - a cure for DMD.
