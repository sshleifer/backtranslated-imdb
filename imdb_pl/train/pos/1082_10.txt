Mr. Blandings is building his dream home can be the best film of Frank Capry / Preston Sturges, which no man has ever done! If you like Bringing Up Baby, The Philadelpia Story, The Thin Man, I was a male fianc√©e war or this is a wonderful life - movies made with wit, taste and from time to time tongue breathed on the cheek, check it out. Life after World War II is simply and idyllicly presented. <br /> <br /> Grant is the absolute summit of its form, playing a city mouse, venturing into the life of a country heir. Loy is adorable like his wife before NOW. The cast of supporting characters is comparable to "You Can not Take It With You" and contains the early work of the future Tarzan Lex Barker. Artistic management and assembly are well above par. <br /> <br /> The movie never bends over the low rent, spontaneous slapstick of the later adaptation of The Money Pit.
