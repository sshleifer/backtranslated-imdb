Because it was only a toddler, when this program was originally aired, I just recently picked up a DVD set and I would like to make more episodes. This series was the 90 poplular version of the X series "X Files" from the 70s, but with a slightly more comedic / light approach. But do not get me wrong, some of these episodes are full of horror topics, many of them have some very gray threads (of course left to the imagination - it was TV from the early 70s). Some of the threads are a bit stupid as well as acting, but it's a charm and a train for this series. Regardless of whether you like crime dramas, comedies, or sci-fi / horror movies, this series brought it all together. Each episode was about 50 minutes (about 1 hour with ads), and these 50 minutes are fast, and I want more. A great classic show that is underestimated in my book!
