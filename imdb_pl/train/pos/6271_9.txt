I liked the movie. It was pretty cool. It has everything: cars, shooting with pistols, a fight, and even a symbolic girl. It does not stand out in any of these things, except for cars. A little shooting, some fighting, a little smooching around and LOT car, with a great chase at the end. The jump, you can say, is impractical, but according to our good friends, here at IMDB it's possible, so the movie is not as bad as people paint it. It has a certain quality and I liked to watch it. In fact, I loved the movie. And I did not have to turn the brain off to watch it. I did not always think, "Is it possible?" Or such a tramp. 9 out of 10.
