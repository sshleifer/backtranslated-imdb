Of course, the average fan of Sci-Fi Battle Star Gallactica will hate it. It makes me happy. I do not like those cheesy science-fiction programs, especially Gallactica with the stars of battle, and that's why I like this program. <br /> <br /> The creators of the series got a lot of heat for doing this (unconventional sci-fi way) and it was worth it. I read in the Wiki that they want to please everyone, including women, not just sci-fi nerds. <br /> <br /> This is probably the most promising program since Lost. It has the most interesting, smartest and deepest scenario at any given time and is truly unique. <br /> <br /> What I like the most about this series is that it plays like a great Anime! From young teenagers running around guns to shooting, to an extremely well balanced and complex scenario, the robot reminds me of something that came from Japan, except a bit better (most Anime is too confusing).
