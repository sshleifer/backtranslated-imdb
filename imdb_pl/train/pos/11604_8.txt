In the seemingly endless quest to find well-made, well-preserved horror movies, you can not find one that is even close to the mark. Needless to say, I was very pleasantly surprised when I came across the "Burned at the Stake" in the American cable network while browsing the channels. The assumption is quite simple. In 1692, young Ann Putnam (Swift) is the loudest witness against the alleged witches, eliminating groundless accusations against anyone who earns her dissatisfaction. It is manipulated by Reverend Parris (Peters), who also acts as a court guide in spells and Satanism. Things get complicated when Ann starts accusing members of the Goode spell family. Salem (around 1980), Loreen Graham (also played by Swift) begins to have extraordinary visions shortly before the Salem Witch Museum visit. A strange man in the costume of the seventeenth century tries to catch her there and the building. She continues to follow her, while strange phenomena are beginning to engage her more and more. Soon, it turns out that the spirit of Ann Putnam possesses her. Unfortunately, the further description becomes rather involved and will give too much. Although the film is not action-oriented and probably will not interest many viewers, the performances are good, and the 17th-century dialogue used in many flashbacks of the film sounds very convincing. Production values ​​are constant, with the possible exception of some special effects. By the way, the technical advisor of the film was Laurie Cabot, the official Salem Witch. This will be appreciated by viewers who appreciate a well-made, moody but understated horror movie. The writer / director, Bert I. Gordon, has a long career in making horror and science fiction films.
