Okay, I saw this movie as a child and I really loved him. My parents never bought me a movie, but I think I will go and buy it now. I am a sucker of animated films from before 2000. In any case, for a real review. <br /> <br /> WHAT I LOVED: There was a real portrait of heaven and hell, one of the few I saw in animated films. Character development existed! It's easy to classify characters in this movie (eg: Charlie is a selfish mutt, Itchy is cynical, but he thinks that Charlie, Carface is of course an unyielding villain, etc.). I also loved the song of King Gator. I've always loved loud, annoying, extravagant guys. This song could have been accidental, but it was fun. Finally, the detail of the animation was beautiful. You could say Charlie was gruff and the backgrounds were beautiful. <br/> <br /> WHAT HAVE NOT BEEN: A proper portrait of the sky: the way Charlie reacted to it, "no surprises", he actually did seem very boring. He refused space in Heaven and you MUST finally return to it. I remember some lines of some songs, such as "... you can not keep a good dog", "... let's always create music" and "... hello, you're dead", but I can not remember most of them. Honestly, the songs were not so catchy. Whippet Angel: It's annoying and this NECK! Augh! <br /> <br /> WHAT PARENTS CAN NOT LIKE: A few very frightening (depending on the viewer) images of Hell are shown during the movie. Carface is quite dangerous. Beer is also implied, but it is not DUBBED beer. Gambling is a key element of the film. A good guy dies. <br /> <br /> GENERALLY: I love this movie, even if it's sometimes forgotten. Frightening animations for children are always my favorites. It was created at a time when producers and writers were not afraid to give children a little fear from time to time. Currently, he would probably be rated PG. Children under 8 (or easily disturbed children) should not watch it. I also give 9/10. :) <br /> <br /> Happy Viewing!
