When I rented this movie to watch it, I knew it would not be a movie with a mind. Instead, I thought about it as a disbelief of reality in which someone would be seriously beaten. And you know what it worked. Kurt Russel did what I thought was a remarkable role in showing the emotionless soldier he was. I recommend this movie if you're with boys and want to watch a good action movie.
