It was modesty that we did not know! It has been mentioned and summarized in a comic for syndicates selling newspapers! Lee and Janet Batchler were real fans of Modesty Blaise, who received The Dream Job - they will tell a story about Modesty, which fans have never seen before. In their audio commentary, they admitted that they had made changes in their origins so that history would run better. The "purists" should also note that we really do not know if everything that Miklos said was true, because it "stretched on time." I did not rent or borrow a DVD, as other reviewers did, I bought it! And I do not want a refund! I watched it three times and I did not sleep through it! Great dialogs and well-drawn characters I cared about (even the evil guy Miklos), just like in novels and comics! I am also looking forward to the next film Modesty (and Willie), especially if this "prequel" is a sign of what is to come!
