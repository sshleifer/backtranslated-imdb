I read one comment that called the film "garbage" and "waste of time <br /> <br />". I think that this person has tightened his political imperfections too much. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I have just rented a new DVD Criterion, both yellow and blue. <br /> <br /> These films - though they are not great - have at least become the historical interest of the so-called "radical student of the political and social movement" of the late 1960's. <br /> <br /> I have not seen a photo or their reputation, <br /> <br /> I was expecting a real porn (there is none). br /> <br /> nudity (including still verboten frontalna mężczyzna nagość (automatic <br /> <br /> NC-17 - Orwellian-X) in the US But I did not expect films <br /> <br /> democratic socialist message. <br /> <br /> Although it has a tendency to simplify, I thought that from time to time well <br /> <br /> points to it. I'm laughing out loud <br /> <br /> and the director's comment clearly showed that there is a lot of parody in the film. <br /> <br />. Especially the porn scene of sex, <br /> <br />. The first scene is very realistic. The main pair is <br /> <br /> clumsy, inept, funny and endearing in her first copulation scene. <br /> <br /> The second - which caused the most complaints - faked <br /> <br /> kunnilingus and fellatio. koniec gniewnej walki, <br /> <br /> wiarygodny. <br /> <br /> The accessories contain an instructive introduction to the film, <br /> <br /> an interview with the original American distributor and his attorney, <br /> <br /> fragments of trial testimonies in the US and the "diary" commentary <br /> <br /> by the director in some scenes. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that "blue noses" could not be carried away and led to <br /> <br /> the key "prudent interest without social value" <br /> <br /> that, fortunately, he still stands. <br /> <br /> Those who are interested in historical freaks will find it as a necessity <br /> <br /> see.
