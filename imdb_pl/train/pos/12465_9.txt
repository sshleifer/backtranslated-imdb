I definitely recommend reading the book before watching the movie. This book won the National Book Council Award in 1978 and is very captivating reading (no pun intended). It is not too difficult to read for those who do not read often, so do not be afraid! The book seems to reflect the passion of relationships more than a movie, and the movie will make more sense after reading the book. Growing up in Melbourne, I could really refer to this book and the movie. Not many Australian writers appeared in the 1970s, so there are very few documented ways of life for women in an urban city in Australia in this era or class. It's a valuable piece of Melbourne's history. It is a pity that it is documented as a kind of porn movie from the 80's. This is far from what the other reviewer mentioned, do not read the DVD jacket, it does not show what the film is about at all. Those who rent a movie based on this description will be disappointed. Remember that this movie was made in 1982, so do not expect Hollywood to cover dramatization these days. That's what I like. It's great to see Noni Hazlehurst in this role, she's just fantastic like Nora and it's great to watch him play, because if you're close to my age, you'll remember her best for traveling to Playschool and Better Homes and Gardens. Who knew that she hid this talent? This movie will give you a completely new impression about it. A classic Australian story!
