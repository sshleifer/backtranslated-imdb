I was a young film student in 1979, when the Soviet Union of Filmmakers came to Sofia in Bulgaria and premiered "Siberiade" Konczalowski; Tarkosvky's "Stalker" and Danelia's "Marathon's Autumn". I was stunned by the cosmopolitan dimension of the art form. Then and only then I saw "Siberiade" 4 and a half hour of epic and I was speechless. Better than Bertolucci's 1900. Definitely! <br /> <br /> I hope that Andron will somehow get negative and will make the "restored version of the director be full" sometime! Of course, on DVD! I fought fiercely in defense of this cinema against the majority of my colleagues who identified the Soviet film with bad taste! Time is on my side.
