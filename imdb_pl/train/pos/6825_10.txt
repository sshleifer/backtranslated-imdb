I was absolutely delighted with the opening of the evening of John Cassavetes. This is his first movie I've seen, which seems to be on a larger scale, so it seems to be more mainstream, but still does not feel as if he has grounded more than in his previous films. Maybe it makes it so intense. There is also something undoubtedly purging in watching this movie. <br /> <br /> It's about what Cassavetes actually did the basic part of his career, the ideal he has expressed behind the camera throughout the director's career and is here in front of him. The protagonist Rowlands, a middle-aged stage actress Myrtle Gordon, can not force herself to play her part in the upcoming production, as she wrote, so she does not give in to impulse after the impulse, which causes chaos on stage until she finds the right one. It is a boldly abstract assumption. <br /> <br /> It is a film that does not evade the innate control that goes through emotional cleansing. No one understands why Myrtle does a lot of things that he does, and is perceived and even presented as something destructive, but that may be the best thing for her. It can be cleansing, not a breakdown. Withdrawal, cocoon, rebellion, all this leads to a meltdown. Cassavetes gives her character a brutally real accent, which is so early that he passionately claims he has nothing to do with his character, but he is in a calm but emotionally corroding fear that the opposite is true. <br /> <br /> The final scene, the climactic performance that Myrtle shares with the painfully separated character who plays with her, is one of the most interesting, funny, difficult, informative and pleasant moments I have ever seen in a movie.
