Pierce Brosnan drinks his last Martini and returns, in a scandalous self-parody, as an aging, disgusting killer, Julian Noble, who is particularly fond of teenage girls, bullfights and sticky clothes. While working in Mexico City, he meets Danny (Greg Kinnear), an entrepreneur from the suburbs of Denver with a simple face who stays in the city to spend his time at the hotel bar. Despite their completely different personalities and primitive and insensitive remarks, Julian becomes friends. <br /> <br /> To a large extent thanks to the performances of Pierce Brosnan and Greg Kinnear, director Richard Shepard revealed that he did not write a movie with Pierce Brosnnna in mind, but without him I can not imagine it. He proves that he has a real talent for comedy and can be more than just James Bond or cold war spies. The scene in which they both meet in a shiny hotel bar (stunning sets and beautifully photographed) is really a daring piece of acting skills. The scene lasts almost fifteen minutes and although it has probably been carefully written, the two actors are improvising to a large extent, but they are successful! It's almost like a new standard for screen operation. Think of Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel in the improvisation of MEAN STEETS and add one of the most subtle foundations of many genre stereotypes and typing actors (in particular James Bond Brosnan). . <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the story weakens after some time. After an hour, the film lacked steam. Nevertheless, and I can not define it exactly, I liked it very much. It's just very fresh and original, with the ingenious use of kits and lighting, and a few tips for Seijun Suzuki and Jean-Pierre Melville. Other characters do not have much to do, but this movie offers something new, in this respect it almost effortlessly combines all conventional genres into a pretty funny parody. Very funny. <br /> <br /> Obscura camera --- 7/10
