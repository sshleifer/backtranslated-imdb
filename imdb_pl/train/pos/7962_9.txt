Very few so-called "alterations" can be as good as the originals. This crosses this border in the colors of the flying. Only a remake, I do not think so! I saw it theatrically at the age of nine and I was absolutely delighted with the film. <br /> <br /> The film certainly invites you to compare it with its counterpart from 1963. An earlier film is also a nice and entertaining movie, but it seems to be more a document of nature than a movie. This update is more epic and cinematic. Nevertheless, I totally recommend both films. <br /> <br /> This film is certainly a must for an animal lover. We have a wise old Golden Retriever, Shadow; sharp, sarcastic cat of the Himalayas, Sassy; and a young, fun-loving American Bulldog, Chance. The animals are perfectly spoken by Don Ameche, Sally Field and Michael J. Fox respectively. <br /> <br /> There is virtually no offensive in the film. There is some scatological humor, but nothing extreme. No hard violence, except for a few taut scenes involving a tumbling waterfall, a furious porcupine and a dark shaft. <br /> <br /> Funny, frightening, moving, and above all real, it surprised me that the film did not win any awards, not one. Nevertheless, I must say that it is just as good as some of the Best Films nominees of today.
