Diane and I saw this wonderful movie in Fremantle today and we both agreed that pastiche films are head and shoulders above the rest. I say this because we were enchanted by the short, five to ten minute fragments that composed the film and the fact that this film had a theme around which each song was composed and of course the theme was love in its many forms. > <br /> Apparently the movie took place in various Parisian arrondissements, giving each segment a special taste. Having traveled a few times in Paris, I was not competent enough to easily recognize the location, but I am sure that Europeans, especially the French, can easily recognize the location of the city. In any case, the viewer is immediately drawn into each story because of their production perfection, so these city locations are consequently becoming. <br /> <br /> The movie moves quickly and the viewer is absorbed in one scenario while the new one is on the screen. The stories themselves are not graphic like Hollywood nonsense, they are subtle, thought-provoking and gentle, like in most cases of life without media, which bury so much beauty of life under the nearest dung heap, only to sell and sell. sell ... <br /> <br /> Go with someone you care about and let this magical little movie bathe in the spa, and when you leave, you'll guess that you'll feel refreshed.
