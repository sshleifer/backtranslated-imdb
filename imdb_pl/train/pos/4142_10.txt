FATTY DRIVES THE BUS is simply the funniest, most original and engaging work I've ever had the pleasure to see. <br /> <br /> this film is by no means compliant with Hollywood standards, and even with the standard movie comedy with a cup with Terry "hulk" hogan, when it comes to working with the camera, editing, acting, budget or anything else. <br /> <br /> what this movie has is a very original and enjoyable story and it is of course made by people who like to create it, and the enthusiasm of the entire cast and crew really breaks all of its budget and running downs. <br /> <br /> this movie proves that I do not need a huge budget or decent actors to make a great movie, all you need is original ideas and a passion for what you do. <br /> <br /> simply the best movie ever. I do not care how you get it, rent it, order it, steal it, download it, you'll just see the movie. <br /> <br /> Now I hope they will make a DVD version.
