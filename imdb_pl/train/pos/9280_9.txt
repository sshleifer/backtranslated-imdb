In Iran, women's sports events are officially banned. In June 2005, the national football team of Iran has an important match against Bahrain at the Azadi stadium in order to qualify for the World Cup. A group of Iranian girls and football lovers dresses like boys and tries unsuccessfully to enter the arrested stadium. <br /> <br /> Football (and Flamengo team), beach and movies are my greatest passions; that's why I loved this little gem about a group of girls and their passion for football. Director Jafar Panahi of "The White Balloon", "The Mirror" and "The Circle" made the film the day Iran defeated Bahrain and qualified for the World Cup in Germany. The dramatic and fun adventure of these Iranian girls is one of the most stunning films I have ever seen. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
