I watched the movie at the same time, which is really late at night. Usually, if the film does not interest me, I start to fall asleep and have to attack the fridge so that I do not fall asleep. <br /> <br /> At first I thought that was what I had to do, because the stimulation of this movie began slowly, with the fact that his shots lasted for a long time. But after some time, I'm getting more and more involved in this movie because more information about the main character is revealed in the story's story. At the end, you feel that you know his whole life. The film kept my interest so much that I did not even know that the sun was supposed to be created. <br /> <br /> Not much of Lynch's bizarre style, but he's pretty bizarre to make the movie fun.
