Red Rock West (1993) <br /> <br /> Nicolas Cage is entangled in a deadly crime, not knowing it at the beginning, and dominos lead to more and more danger, adventure and unhappy accidents in the wild abandoned American West of the 90s . Red Rock West is often brutal, and sometimes funny, and Cage pulls out a mixture with ordinary sardonic wit and caution. <br /> <br /> Is the plot upstairs? Yes. Is Dennis Hopper perfect as a crazy, almost lovable killer? Yes. Does Cage have a chance? Well, you have to watch and see. I never give up and surprise me the first time I saw it. During the second yesterday's viewing, I was surprised at how well it lasted, how well it was constructed and how gruesome and funny it was at the same time. <br /> <br /> Director Ron Dahl (who also helped write) is more well-known for his television work, but with Rounders and this movie he shows a clever hand with sensational stories. By the way, thanks to his humor and caricatures. The bar is dingy, doubtful clays. And do not miss the really inspired Dwight Yoakam episode as a truck driver.
