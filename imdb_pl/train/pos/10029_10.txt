Why are people whoring about this movie, not about horrible movies like the Godfather. Titanic is the largest film of the 21st century. Thanks to great acting, directing, effects, music and everything in general. This film is always cast by everyone, because one day someone said they do not like it, so most of the world decided to agree. There is nothing wrong with this film. All I can say is that this film is not only the Oscar-winning award of all time, the most money ever issued, and unfortunately one of the most underrated films I've ever seen. Besides, it is really the best movie of all time. The only films that are similar to all Star Wars and Lord of the Rings trilogy or anything else by Hitchcock or Spielberg or Tim Burton. These are all good movies and directors, but none of them matches James Cameron's Masterpiece TITANIC.
