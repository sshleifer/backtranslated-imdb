I saw this movie for the first time in 1980 in the place of the film. After many subsequent reviews (and purchase of video) I still laugh out loud. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's a relic of another era - a home-made comedy set in affluent middle America - but well done well made. But it is also a document of his age - a feast of post-war optimism, baby boom and nascent consumer age. This film is not a "guilty" pleasure. <br /> <br /> Three wonderful sophisticated actresses - the handsome Melvyn Douglas; stunned Cary Grant; determined by Myrna Loy - the team of the characters is complementary and unforgettable. <br /> <br /> My favorite scenes - "It means we have to explode" and "Miss Stellwaggen" and "This little piggy". <br /> I love it.
