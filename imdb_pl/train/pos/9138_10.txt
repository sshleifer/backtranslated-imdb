I am the owner of this movie and have watched it several times over the years since its release. Prince does not stun us with his phenomenal style of play or whatever, he is a musician and I feel that this is what he showed here, he is simply the best to tell this story through influence. Most of this movie is simple and teenage, but it's the fault of directors / writers, but it's a great movie with even better music. Purple Rain's principles and beliefs are quite strong and if more films were based on the basics, we were taught how young children would have a better environment, seeing that art reflects a life that reflects art.
