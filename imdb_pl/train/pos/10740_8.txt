Made by the French brothers Jules and Giddeon Naudet and narrated by Robert De Niro and Firefighter James Hanlon, this is a fascinating and moving story about how the best New York shines on the darkest day. I saw it for the first time when I was a young, naive 12-year-old, and in this age he still touched me. Knowing how serious he was on September 11, 2001, it expanded the whole effect of September 11th. We learned who the heroes were, how everyday life was created and how they put their lives on the line in a situation where most people would simply run away and save themselves. These brave people put their lives on the line, and watching them increases my admiration for them. See if you can, it's the best documentary I've ever seen.
