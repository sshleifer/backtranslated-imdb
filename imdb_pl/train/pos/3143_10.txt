If any program from the last ten years deserves 10, this rare gem. It allows us to escape back to times when things were simpler and more pleasant. A performance filled with heart and laughter makes you laugh for three decades of difference. The furniture was ugly, clothes colored, and even medicines were bearable. The hair was feathered, the music was accompanied by roller skates, and according to Merle Haggard, "the pond was bad." Take a trip to the best of times in American history. Fall in love with characters and feel the good essence of a small town where people were nicer to each other. This classic is just like "Full House" on TV. Do not miss this and always remember to "shake your thing!"
