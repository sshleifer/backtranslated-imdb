40-YEAR-OLD WIRGIN (2005) **** Steve Carell, Catherine Keener, Paul Rudd, Romany Malco, Seth Rogen, Elizabeth Banks, Leslie Mann, Jane Lynch, Gerry Bednob, Shelley Malil, Kat Dennings. Hysterically entertaining high-concept comedy about the title Andy Stitzer (splendidly played by the age-old second banana Carell in a truly amazingly comical breakthrough spectacle certainly a stratosphere on the A list), a technical department in an electronics store in Southern California who is told about his mysterious identity by the trio of well-to-do, but completely unaware, female associates (Rudd, Malco and Rogen, each one a little more fun than the next) determined to let their friend be overthrown regardless of the cost. Below is an unlikely, but very affectionate romance with a lively mother (wonderful Keener, who has a lot of fun here), which leads to the addition of more fuel for fires in the Andes. Surprisingly spiritual and obscenely pathetic romantic comedy; the most fun of "There Something About Mary" with the keen perceptive scenario of director Judd Apatow and Carell, which includes astounding sequences, including the stunningly accurate joke of David Caruso, homophobic insults, sending "dates with palooses" and demystifying the war of sexes with brazen calm. A real winner and an instant classic; the funniest movie of the year.
