I've always wondered what happened to the magical feeling that old Slovenian films were carrying ... Well, with time I wondered if this feeling was just longing. Or maybe this "feeling" decided to pack the bags and say "goodbye" somewhere in the middle of our film story, and then it never came back? Did he do it? Because he came back for the first time for me when I saw "Ekspres, Ekspres". And it was just old. <br /> <br /> There are three features of this film that makes it a bit unique and as enjoyable as watching - the smooth flow of history, the warmth of colors and, what I appreciate the most - the lack of excessive use of verbal communication (something , what many other (not only) Slovenian screenwriters should at least consider). There is no point in using words when you can understand well (yes or better) by other means. Just look at Bakovica and Cerara. <br /> <br /> So, in so many words, I would recommend to you all Express, Express, as a necessary movie after Slovenia, regardless of what you've heard about Slovenian movies (if you've ever heard anything, I mean ...) . <br /> <br /> Oh, and this scene in which Bakovic dances to Vivaldi's music ... Feast. <br /> <br /> Treat yourself. Watch it.
