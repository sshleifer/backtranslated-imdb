Perhaps the funniest movie "behind the scenes in Hollywood," especially for short comedy factories like Keystone. <br /> <br /> Marion Davies should receive a medal for courage for taking part in a role in which he badly works in front of the camera is part of the role. Plenty of scenes for movie lovers.
