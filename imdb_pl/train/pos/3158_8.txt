There are too many new styles of the show, but the one that works best is the old fashioned way with the audience and the internal set. This show of the '70s is a great example. When the show appeared on the air, no one heard about Kurtwoodie Smith and Debra Jo Rupp, much less adolescents played great Topher Grace and Ashton Kushton (both leave this year's program to pursue other interests). around because the series started about his character, Eric and his close circle of friends. Ashton is John Travolta of our time. Remember when John was in love with Dana Hyland with Eight Is Enough, think about Ashton with Demi Moore. The cast of the actors has never been known to us, which is a good thing because a celebrity cast member can spoil it. I miss Mo Gaffney who played Don Joanne's girlfriend. I miss Lisa Robin Kelly as the original Laurie, the deputy could not match her, and I'm sorry for that. I liked to fill Tommy Chong as a wasted, but beloved figure of father Steven Hyde. I loved watching Tanya Roberts except Charlie's Angels. I loved Brooke Shields playing Jackie's mother. Before going on Broadway, she really showed her acting talent. This show was a joy of many surprises. I hope that this concert will last longer, even if 2 of its members are gone, but I hope they will not stay too long. I would like the creator of the show, Bonnie and Terry Turner, who also created my other favorite program, Third Rock from The Sun, to be more successful on Fox than on NBC, who sabotaged their performance. The turners are not mannequins and I hope that in the future they will create more such concerts.
