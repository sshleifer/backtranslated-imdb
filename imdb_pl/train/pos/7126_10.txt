This film resonated with me on two levels. As a child, I was evacuated from London and seated on reluctant hosts in a village village. While I avoided the bombardment and had experiences that gave precious memories (for example, listening to a nightingale singing one dark night for the first time) and enjoying life I could never have had in London, I missed my family and worried about them. Tom is an old man whose wife and child have died and live alone in a small village. As an old man who is now without a wife whose children are married and live far away in another province, I am sometimes lonely again. The boy's mother is a religious fanatic with very strange ideas for raising a child. Because a deep feeling has grown between old Tom Oakley and this young boy, Tom looks for him and ultimately saves him from very strange and dangerous circumstances. At the end of the story there is a great tension, because due to a bureaucratic decision, it seems that the child will lose someone who developed a love relationship with him.
