Sophmoric this movie is. But it's fun how to get out. Shows the "mentality of the boys' locker room" played by the "other side". It's good to see such tides and how stupid they are. But that's probably not the news for most women, because (just ask), "they've heard them all before." <br /> <br /> Watch them with a small group or mixed party and 97.3% of the room will laugh straight for 2 hours. And the remaining 2.7% ... can you really like them?
