After the first look, I believe that this story is at least less annoying than other Cannon movie stories. After many others I think that he is one of the best. Some songs are very bad, especially the love song, but two things stand out, which makes the film, even the song, worthwhile. One of them is the direction of art. Like other Tales from the film about Cannon, it is a beautifully decorated piece from the era; every piece of material and jewel (both of which have the main parts in the story of this film) look fresh and modern, and contrast with the usual clothes of peasants. Even during a love song, I think I'm studying a princess dress and hair, wonderfully done. Another thing is the comical time. Many films are cheap, but the vanity of the emperor (and his mockery of himself), the suspect guardian, the guard who pursued Nicholas and the stupid prince, were quite funny and seemed ridiculous quite deliberately. And the sequence during the song Weave-O makes up for songs that were not so good.
