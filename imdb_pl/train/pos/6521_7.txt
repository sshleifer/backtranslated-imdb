Taken in the context of the time in which it came into being, I consider this film to be valuable. Although the details can be "dramatized", the overall story was a pretty foundation. Besides, I found actors I knew and which were real pleasure. Who would imagine Ben Cartwright as a wicked cad? I leave the rest of the star to you. As for the secondary casting, this movie (as you would expect from a movie from the late 1930s) has many nice character actors, but top kudos "for Andrew Jackson's right hand, Peavey. The perfect touch of comedy. Well filmed, with beautiful ships and competent actors, I recommend it to anyone who wants a bit of a camp, or an eye on a piece from a double period, set at the dawn of America, and made in a period of great names and top-class actors were a real pleasure .
