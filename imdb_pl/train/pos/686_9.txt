Ghost Story (TV movie - 1972) was a pilot of the NBC series. The film was well written and well played, and I thought that when the 1972-73 television season began, if the show is half as good as the movie, NBC has a winner. (I would like this video to be available on video !!) The series was a huge disappointment - even with William Castle as a performer. manufacturer. However, if you have the chance to see the original Ghost Story TV movie, check it out. You will not be dissapointed.
