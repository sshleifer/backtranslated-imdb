I just finished watching this movie in the GCSE class. it was exciting and was a great insight into what actually happened to Steve Biko in the days of apartheid law. If anyone can say that this movie was the most boring or boring 2 and a half hours of my life, I do not know, because it drew me from beginning to end. it was great, as Denzel Washington presented him and showed him how he fights the law of apartheid and has equal rights for black people. In one part, Steve Biko tells the police officer that we are just as weak and human as it is to show them that he and all other Black people in southern Africa are not different from whites. Donald Woods inspired me because he did not believe in apartheid for what he believed in. He and Steve Biko created a very strong friendship that shook southern Africa and woke up the world. I really enjoyed this movie and I definitely recommend it to people. it helped me see that racism is not right and that everyone is equal, their fate should not be determined by the color of someone's skin. n
