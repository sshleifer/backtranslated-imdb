I only saw this movie once when I was 10 years old. I remembered it all these years because I could not sleep for a week or more after seeing. It just pissed me off. I was on vacation with my aunts in Ft. Worth, Texas and I will never forget it. Now, 48 years later, my daughter is trying to get a copy of this to see her as an adult. In order to find out what kind of film it was, I needed a lot of research, but I always remembered that Barbara Stanwyck was in it and finally managed to get a name and reviews. I really liked it, but it frightened me! Jaqui
