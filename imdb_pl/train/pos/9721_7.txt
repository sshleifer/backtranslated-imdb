How to lose friends and alienate people is a decent comedy with a bit of a romantic approach. <br /> <br /> It's actually the story of Sidney Young (Simon Pegg), who breaks into the journalistic and writing business, which is interpreted in a fun way. Simon Pegg looked good, a bit worse than usual. The film is not funny or entertaining all the time, or something, but it has its moments, and these moments are really fun. <br /> <br /> I recommend this game and it's worth watching an American cream comedy for all people who just want to sit back, relax and enjoy the movie. If you intend to watch this video with a critical approach, you should pass, unless you want to be disappointed and start destroying it.
