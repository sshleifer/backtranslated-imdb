Before Nicholas Cage was a big action star, he was a great actor. This less-known film is the place where Cage presents one of his best performances. "Red Rock West" was a low-budget, almost unknown movie, but it's one of my favorite movies of all time. I discovered that going along the video store corridor, I wanted to see how Cage and Hopper (who is also great in the movie) appear together. Go for this and I'm sure you will not be disappointed.
