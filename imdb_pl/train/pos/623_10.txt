There are not many movies that would make me feel that Star Dust did everything throughout the movie. Like a magical fairy tale like "Princess Bride", Stardust is by far the most wonderful fantasy show in the 2000s and 90s. Exciting, fun and equipped with great images, as well as unforgettable characters, especially Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert DeNiro, I challenge everyone to watch this movie without smiling. From the first ten minutes of the film, you know exactly how it will end, but it is a journey, not a goal, that delights the viewer from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> Ten stars, not decimal less.
