Each of the major studios recorded jazz singles-reelers in the 1930s and 1940s (with Universal taking over the lead). While most of them looked as cheap on the screen as they did, Warner Bros. (which he suddenly stopped doing in 1946). He often distinguished himself by unusual camera angles, mirrors and optical effects, thanks to some creative directors such as Jean Negulesco. Actually, the best of this genre should come from this studio. <br /> <br /> What distinguishes "Jammin 'The Blues" from the rest of the package is that it looks more like an avant-garde experiment than a Hollywood musical. Filmed in July 1944, he transforms an ordinary jam session into "trippy", sneaking away from dreams from the war, highlighted by the melody of "On The Sunny Side Of The Street." Gjon Mili and cinematographer Robert Burkes (later working with Hitchcock) had great artistic freedom, perhaps because Lester Young was not Glenn Miller, and the studio did not care how he and his colleagues were presented. The optical printer is well used, and many images of the same artist appear simultaneously. (Norman McLaren really did this process two decades later in "Pas De Deux", while Linwood Dunn's band achieved different effects in Citizen Kane). Strong emphasis on silhouettes and lit cigarette smoke was also ahead of time; in some respects it was preceded by psychedelic sixties, but with a distinctive noir style from the 1940s.
