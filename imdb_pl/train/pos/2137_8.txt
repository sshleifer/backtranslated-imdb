This is much more than a charming story of a middle-aged man discovering the pleasure of ballroom dancing (although that's the way it is). It is a story about one person learning to love life again, pushing through all the pressures of work and money to rediscover joy. The bonus in this film is a fascinating insight into the slowly changing attitude of modern Japan to everything from ballroom dancing to physical contact. There are scenes that will make you laugh loudly ... a few where you'll want to get up and tango ... and many more where you'll just feel good. a great introduction to modern Japanese film production for those who may have the impression that all Japanese films are "heavy" and inaccessible. <br /> <br />
