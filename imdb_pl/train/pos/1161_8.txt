It was a very low budget (some scenes look as if they were recorded using a home video recorder). However, it has a good plot line and is easy to follow. Eight years after shooting a sexual assailant, Amanda's father is released from the psychiatric ward with the help of his doctor, with whom he secretly has an affair. The doctor rents her home and buys a car. But in the first 20 minutes of the movie Amanda kills him and buries him in his yard. Then she sees that her neighbor, Richard, is staring at him and does not stop until he's gone. He behaves innocently, but after the second neighbor Buzz learns that Amanda killed the doctor and tried to kill Laurie, Richards' wife (this is after Amanda and he take him in the hot tub). Then he stops acting so innocently and kills Buzz and then tries to kill Richard, whom he apparently loves and cares for. And you'll have to rent a movie to find out if Amanda dies or not. Generally a good movie, it reminds me of my life very much, that you know everything that falls on your neighbor and do not stop anything until you disconnect it.
