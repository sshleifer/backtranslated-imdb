An excellent movie about two cops loving the same woman. One of the policemen (Périer) killed her, but all the evidence seems to burden the other (Montand). Unlucky Montand does not know who his second lover could kill her, and Périer does not know that Montand was having an affair with a girl. Montand must ruthlessly find a killer ... and what a great ending! Highly recommended.
