A brilliant movie, another best movie for The Drunken Master (Jackie Chan). I recently bought it in the original VHS and have not seen this movie for 15 years, but still as good as it was then. Acting was terrible, and dubbing was even worse, but these features make this movie (and many other old-fashioned Chinese kung fu movies) great. Choreography is amazing and the plot is simple. I've never seen the 36th shaolin rooms, but I know it's the same movie, but Gordon liu plays San Te, but San Te in Thr Return to 36th Chamber is played by a different character. It has many comic and brilliant kung fu values.
