I just finished watching this movie, which really upset me. I was also twice in South Africa, more or less at the time when this movie is set. <br /> <br /> It is certainly difficult, and the initial scenes tend to "set the stage". Slow but steady growth of the pace almost does not allow for a break, and certainly there are few light moments. <br /> <br /> He will never be able to see Nigel Hawthorne again. He found himself in a very twisted unit, and every time he appeared, I did not like him more. <br /> <br /> I totally agree with Steve-thomp's articulated and thoughtful comments.
