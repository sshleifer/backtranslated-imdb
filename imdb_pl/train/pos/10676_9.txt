This movie was shot at Gerard Gardens in Liverpool and was the UK's response to movies like "Blackboard Jungle." The film works quite well in time, and all moral stories are still valid (or even more recent). In the film, you can see some great performances by British actors such as David McCallum, Stanley Baker, Peter Cushing and Anne Heywood. Baker plays a Liverpool cop assigned to juvenile liaison duties, assuming that if you catch children at an early age, they will be responsible adults. <br /> <br /> Significant episodes in the film include Freddie Starr (Fred Fowell) and Melvyn Hayes (Gloria). Tsai Chin and Michael Chow play brother and sister (they are a real brother and sister) who have been caught in a network of arsonists. Tsai Chin still works and you can see him in Nicole Kidman's latest film, The Interpretor. <br /> <br /> Violent Playground contains siege of weapons at school, so it is unlikely that it will appear on TV after similar events in Scotland / Russia. <br /> <br /> I lived in Gerard Gardens, where the movie was filmed (although it was not born then), and I have fond memories of the area. I recently completed a documentary about Gerard Gardens, which contains fragments of "Violent Playground" and a small British film "Coast to Coast", in which Lenny Henry and Pete Postlewaite play. The tenement houses were demolished in 1987, and the films somehow support the memory. <br /> <br /> There were a few complaints from the residents when the film was released, because the film showed this area in a bad light. Time has helped heal these wounds. <br /> <br /> A little jewel of the movie, I recommend that you discover it
