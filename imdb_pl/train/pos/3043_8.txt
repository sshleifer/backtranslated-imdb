This video will tell you why Amitabh Bacchan is a one-person industry. This film will also tell you why Indian viewers are smart buyers. <br /> <br /> Amitabh was at the peak of his domination in Bollywood, when his one-time godfather Prakash Mehra decided to re-use his picture. Prakash has the habit of selecting topics and building stories from them, adding liberal doses of Bollywood sensibilities and stereotypes. Zanzeer saw the creation of Angry Young Man. Lawaris was to be a bastard, and Namak Halal was about the loyalty of the master-servant. <br /> <br /> But the topic was limited to moving the script to three hours of song, dance and drama. The film consists of a caricature of Haryanavi, who goes to Bombay and becomes the hero of regulation. Amitabha's vocal skills and diction have made the film earn a lot of money thanks to the priceless Haryanvi accent. For me, this is only the biggest success in the film. The rest is a typical Bollywood scenario. <br /> <br /> Amitabh must have had typical comedy scenes in each of his films. Thanks to Manmohan Desai. This movie had a good dose. A hat at the party, a monologue on Vijay Merchant's and Vijay Hazare's reflections, a mosquito challenge in the conference room and an ordinary drunkard scene that has already become the standard Amitabh dish. <br /> <br /> Shashi Kapoor added An additional advantage of the film is its moody, picky character (remember that Ranjeet asked "Shaaadaaaap" after the incident with a poisoned cake). His most important role was that Amitabh was his loyal servant. But Prakash Mehra knew the Indian mind ... and so Shashi had to continue his act with the rest of the movie. One character could have been more developed to make a serious movie. But this is a caper, remember? that's how people came and saw Amitabh wearing a new hat and coming home happy. The end is always predictable, and good guys, and those bad go to prison, the eternal motive of loyalty is once again underlined and everything ends well. <br /> <br /> So, does it make this movie almost classic? Amitabh Bacchan as Haryanvi. Prakash Mehra created one more icon on behalf of the story. Chuck the story, characters and storyline. My ratings apply only to Amitabh.
