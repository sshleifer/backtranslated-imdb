Bonanza had a great cast of great actors. Lorne Greene, Pernell Whitaker, Michael Landon, Dan Blocker, and even Guy Williams (as a cousin who was brought on several episodes in 1964 to replace Adam when he left the series). The cast had chemistry and it seemed that they really liked each other. This made many of their weakest stories work much better than they should. It also made many of their best stories in the great Western drama. <br /> <br /> Like every program that has made over thirty episodes of each season, there will be some weak ones. However, most of the time each episode had an interesting story, some conflict and resolution that usually did not contain violence. While Bonanza was western, the shooting was never the main attraction. While I am a fan of The Rifleman and Wanted: Dead Or Alive; these shows usually ended in shooting. The shootings were based on the fact that many Westerners resolved any conflict, and Bonanza tried very hard to seek peaceful solutions and harmony instead of killing. <br /> <br /> In the early years of Bonanza there are some interesting episodes that contain a lot of shootings. These episodes contrast with the rest of the series, but they are quite good in themselves. In 1964, when Pernell Whitaker wanted to leave the exhibition, Guy Williams was introduced to replace him. Williams played the role of a long-lost cousin. Unfortunately, Whitaker decided to stay for another year, and thus Williams was discharged from the series when he moved out to marry Adam's old girlfriend. If Williams stayed for the duration of Bonanza, you can only wonder how much better the series would be in the years after 1965, when Pernell Whitaker left the series. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, when Pernell Whitaker left the series, stories focused more on comedies and national hijinkach. Whitaker often played heavy in many episodes, and his absence left a void in the cast. Little Joe always wanted to play a nice kid, and Hoss always wanted to play an old good boy with a golden heart. Ever since Ben was a good and wise patriarch of the family, he did not leave too much room for any shooting. <br /> <br /> At one point they hired a hand named Candy (David Canary), who became their fourth cast member, but Candy was never described in any shooting, and he was nothing more than an older version of Little Joe . For a year or two, they also had Ben in the role of another lost cousin (Jamie, played by Mitch Vogel), who was a teenager who usually had trouble with somebody. <br /> <br /> Apparently adding a teenager, the studio wanted to attract younger viewers. It also gave writers a chance to write episodes about the problems of teenagers, alcohol, crime, etc. These kinds of teaching episodes were popular in the 1960s as a response of the establishment's media to the counter-cultural movement. Dragnet was probably the most popular source of law and order on television, although Hawaii 5-0, The F.B.I. and many other programs have tried to jump into fashion by making TV shows with irresponsible teenagers that caused pranks, chaos and crime. <br /> <br /> Adding a teenager to the cast gave Cartwrights a better chance to show their problems, but these episodes are very imaginary and generally not very good. After the death of Dan Blocker, the series lasted for about a year before it was canceled. The last season was pretty bad because it contained little Joe tracking his wife's killers, and most episodes were a bit depressing because Little Joe usually drank or otherwise remembered how much he loved his wife and how unjust it was that she was killed. <br /> <br /> I do not think I've ever seen the last episode of the show and I'm wondering if they've ever officially wrapped it in some way. Only Ben (Lorne Greene) lived in Ponderos last year, because Adam moved away (and never returned as a guest), and Hoss died, and Little Joe left his wife (in the series) was killed by tramps. <br /> <br /> In general, the era of 1959-1965 is the best in this series. After Adam's departure, he slowly diminished. Most of the shows before 1970 are also quite good. In 1970, the series tried to be fashionable and up-to-date, and lost much of its western taste. The addition of Candy and a teenage child also weakened the overall quality of the series, and Hoss's death (Dan Blocker) was the last nail. Bonanza is probably the best ever produced series of westerns, and of the 465 episodes that have been produced, at least one hundred of them are excellent western dramas! It's a pretty good record. Even the worst Bonanza is better than many other TV programs.
