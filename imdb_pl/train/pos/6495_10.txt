10 out of 10, this brilliant, super documentary is a must, with movie clips from the war that people have not seen for years, until it was shown in 1974. The movie clips from this war document do not miss anything, some of the clips left me motionless. The whole series has more than 20 episodes, and Sir Lawrence Olivier is a narrator and tells the amazing story of the war. It is simply probably the best war document, and now over 25 years is still able to pack amazing power. You have to watch it at some point, even if it's a few episodes, even if you're still amazed at the impact that this document means for those who were there, suffered and died in the name of WAR, in WORLD WAR.
