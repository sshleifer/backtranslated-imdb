When I saw this animation for the first time (I was 15) I was really impressed! It has a completely different style compared to Japanese animation and I like it a bit. The whole impression of the film is more sinister and dark ... The colors are not so ... colorful. The characters do not talk much, there are no long and boring conversations about this and those (as in Ghost in the Shell). With his dark images, views of strange beasts and a sense of magic, he looks like this ancient Scandinavian tale full of violent and frightening creators, enchanted forests and deep caves inhabited by dragons, trolls, orcs ... and one mysterious hero who will stop evil ... .
