I highly recommend this movie. Set in the future Bladerunner-esquire in Paris in 2054, it is in many ways the classic scenario of the movie noir: a lady in danger, a sister trying to find her honest cop fighting everyone. Fortunately, it avoids stereotypes and combines quite a good story with interesting, innovative visualizations. The film can remind you of the appearance of Sin City, but it has a sharper, more graphic look that really appealed to me. Each cage, each sequence seems to have been able to be pulled out of the desk by qualified graphic designers. When it comes to history and works of art, you can find sticks dating back to the forties (or even earlier with the classic views of the Eiffel Tower and the Sacre Couer) and films such as Casablanca, as well as looking towards the grim future in which our destiny is governed by corporations. Make an excuse to see this movie.
