The Grand Canyon falls into a very rare category: it is a very clever movie, with very clever dialogues and food to think everywhere from beginning to end. I have the impression that he never reached the well-deserved ranking (and he will never be), because of his simplicity. This kind of fast traffic requires sensitive observers. It is a pity that IMDb has me write ten lines, because in this case it is not necessary. In any case, to fulfill this request, I will tell you that the weak point of the movie, if any of them is in the game: not that it is bad, but it could be done much better. The exception was Kevin Kline, who was perfect. Go ahead and watch it.
