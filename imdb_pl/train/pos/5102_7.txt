do not worry about the soundtrack that is currently being played. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, Debra Winger is always interesting, and although it was an earlier role for her, she is quite good as Cissy, the girl from the wrong side of the song, lived in the trailer with Bud, (Travolta), just for to be replaced for a time by rival Madolyn Smith as a rival. <br /> <br /> I agree with an earlier Scott Glenn review, which is used only for the plot, thrown into the mix to create tension; history is predictable and invented. <br /> <br /> Moreover, although I am from the East, many of us did NOT like "Saturday Night Fever", while she had her moments, constant stereotypes are beyond criticism this point. <br /> <br /> Worth to see for Debra Winger; she's still so nice and she never had that Hollywood personality that we're giving too many actresses today. 7/10
