<br /> <br /> Have you ever felt like you were being watched, watching someone move? Remember, before you decide to break the law, the FBI will always be there. At least that's how it feels after watching the thrilling but somewhat gentle crime drama "FBI History." He follows the organization's roots from a small office to one of the most modern facilities in the world (in 1959), telling the story through the eyes of one of its agents, Chip Hardesty (James Stewart). <br /> <br /> Chip has been with the FBI since the first day and is happy to do his job above all else in the world, even sporadically his family. The FBI story follows his life, depicting what he does as an agent, and how being one affects his personal life. The film makes a spectacular task showing in which cases the FBI handles and how they deal with them. The audience can see the riots of the Chip stop Ku Klux Klan, hide to solve the Indian scandal of murder / property, lead fugitives to detention, save hostages and help fight during World War II. He even helped bring the communist spies to justice. <br /> <br /> Stewart, in a somewhat complicated way, is stellar (as always) as a slightly neurotic agent who loves his work maybe a little too much. One of the best parts of this movie is that we can see the inner life of the Chip family and his work. We are witnessing how he suffers through the death of his best friend and then his son. We also see that his wife miscarried and his marriage was rocky. Almost all of his personal problems are caused by love for his work. Vera Miles gives unprecedented performance, but it is very convincing. She was never a great actress, but there was always something very attractive and attractive in her. Maybe it's just me? Unfortunately, none of the other performances is worth mentioning, but the story that attracted attention managed to attract me a lot. <br /> <br /> Photos of this movie were impressive, especially scenes in the jungle of South America. All colors had an texture that really created the atmosphere of the film. Perhaps the biggest part of this movie was the fantastic direction of Mervyn Leroy. Each scene was so fluid that they just gathered to tell a genius story. It's full of imaginative camera shots, some with a very keen sense of Hitchcock. <br /> <br /> In all, the history of the FBI is a spectacular but overlooked movie. Within two and a half hours some viewers may be intimidated, but if you have a chance, I recommend jumping into it. I liked the spectacular performance of Jimmy Stewart and the captivating story.
