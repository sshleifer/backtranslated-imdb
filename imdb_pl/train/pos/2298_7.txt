I love occult horror, and the great British Hammer Studios, which released one of their biggest films from "The Devil Rides Out" (1968), turned out to be more than capable horror in this field. This occult tenth episode of Hammer's "Hammer House of Horror" (1980), "Guardian of the Abyss", is indeed a frightening entry into the series. Director Don Sharp, who previously enriched Hammer's work for "The Kiss of the Vampire" (1963) and "Rasputin: The Mad Monk" (1966), and also directed two films "Fu Mach" with Christopher Lee, is undoubtedly one of the better known names among HHH directors, and he also provides here. Antiquarian Michael (Ray Lonnen) stumbles over a mysterious old glass. Wandering glass seems to be the object of lust for devotion worshiping the devil who wants to use it for his satanic rites. When he hides a beautiful young girl named Allison (Rosalyn Landor), who is to be sacrificed by worship, Michael gets into deeper trouble with worship and their sinister leader (John Carson) ... Although this is not one of my absolute favorite episodes of "Hammer House of Horror "(the best of them is the brilliant seventh episode of" The Silent Scream "), is very frightening and moody. The plot has several interesting twists and it remains full of tension and amazing throughout the film. Ray Lonnen is a good leader, young Rosalyin Landor is convincing as an innocent beauty, and John Carson is really terrifying as a leader of Satanists. In conclusion, "Guardian of the Abyss" is another interesting and terrifying story of HHH, and my colleagues from Hammer should not miss this.
