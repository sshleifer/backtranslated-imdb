_Les Acteurs_ is the absurd story of Jean-Pierre Marielle desperately waiting for a cup of hot water, a story of a plot against actors, stories of aging actors whose career is slowly less active than before, but a stunning tribute to French actors and their cinema. <br /> <br /> Supported by a solid reflection on cinema and acting (the fourth wall, hidden cameras, play or not play), the story of this film, in which most of them Famous actors play their own role (not mixing with life in front of the camera - the film is not a voyeur) is quite vague and follows the actors in a series of episodes that make the movie quite funny. When Andr√© Dussolier leaves the movie and leaves Josiane Balasko to play her role (great actress, she is hilariously serious, especially when as a Dussolier bitch about herself), when the actors run to each other on the street, asking for autographs, like fights and gossip they happen, we recognize pastiche of other scenes in which everyone (or others) played. <br /> <br /> Actually, for anyone who does not know the actors (most of them are at least 50 years old) or do not know French cinema, this movie has less interest because most of the references will be skipped, but it will still be a good song reflection on aging, acting, public life ...
