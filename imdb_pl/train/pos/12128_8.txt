I just saw "Of Human Bondage" for the first time a few days ago and WOW! What a mysterious and almost terrifying movie. I loved how the music was following the pace of every step of Philip's feet. It gave me chills for some reason ... <br /> <br /> One of the biggest aspects of this movie is that you'll see Bette Davis get in front of your eyes. She's great, not necessarily because it's her best job, but because she was so unusual to be as nasty, rough and unshakeable as an actress in 1934 ... Bette was a risk taker, always wanting to be different, right? when she began to realize that she could be as ugly and bold as she wanted, and people would love her for it. If you're a real lover of the movie, it's amazing to see ... <br /> <br /> She just had a way to deliver a line that was part of it, and the movie belongs to it. Like "Mass of music and fire. It's me ... old kazoo and a few fires "or" But you are Blanche, you are in this chair! "Or" WITH ALL MY HEART, I STILL LOVE A MAN THAT I KILLED !! "... These are some of her films, but you have my drift. She was so brave, sassy and exotic, looking at these beautiful big eyes. After seeing this, I can not believe it was done twice ... <br /> <br /> Leslie Howard was wonderful ... so calm and persistent, in need of love. I thought he was charming and could not understand how everyone was falling for him, but then everyone was ... except Mildred. He did a great job ... <br /> <br /> The only thing I did not like was something to do with writing in early movies. They will make the character so hated that it is almost unbelievable that someone will fall into it at all. The shows were great, but in real life, Philip would never be interested in Mildred. It's just a simple truth ... See!
