A recent review of THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT has encouraged me to see many classic MGM musicals from the forties and fifties. ANCHORS AWEIGH is definitely a smaller movie than ON THE TOWN. Songs are not as good as chemistry between characters. But the film is beautifully intertwined with classic favorites, such as Tchaikovsky. And the scene in the Hollywood Bowl, with Sinatra and Kelly emerging from the forest above her, and then running down the stairs, while dozens of pianists play the piano, is the best scene in the movie, even if in which dances Kelly with Jerry Mouse they are more familiar. Classical music enthusiasts will undoubtedly determine the music played by pianists. Sinatra then sings "I Fall in Love Too Easily" before going to the epiphany about who he loves. The color is beautiful, Hollywood looks nice with mountains and air free of pollution (can you imagine Hollywood in the 1920s, let alone the mid-1940s?!), And piano music is absolutely great. MGM certainly had the talent to create such lyrical moments.
