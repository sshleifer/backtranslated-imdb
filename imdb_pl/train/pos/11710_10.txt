Long before Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins shook the world of the Christian subculture (and made millions in the process) with books by LEFT BEHIND, MARK IV Pictures, the Christian film distribution company of Billy Graham's evangelistic association, it gave us a masterpiece . What I like the most about this genre is the extraordinary attention to detail, sitting in the living room. Instead of leading us to dramatic scenes of oppression after elation, we sit in the living room, hearing about it in the news, because the filmmakers can not afford it. The premi√®re of the film is embedded in pre-magmatic, pre-enforcing eschatalogue, believing that Christ comes once to secretly capture the real church, and then returns at the end of seven years of hell on earth. What once frightened me in the gymnasium now makes me laugh. Patty's intriguing adventures and her journey through the entire period of trouble (and two of the three continuations of the film) tell her an extraordinary story of unbelief and ultimately condemnation. I hate to admit it, but I still like to watch it. He even has the SAME EXACT result from Monty Python and the Holy Grail. I think I am the only person in history who made this observation.
