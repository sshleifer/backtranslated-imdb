Good performance. <br /> <br /> The basic assumption is that humanity is at a crossroads. There are a number of moral dilemmas we are struggling with. Humanity has made many technological breakthroughs, but is humanity mature enough to cope with new toys? There is moral decadence in the virtual world. There are religious fanatics who are willing to kill to get attention. I predict (based on the BSG background) that there will be a problem with Cylon and slavery. Besides, there are all other problems that we humans carry on ourselves. <br /> <br /> This program is not BSG - at least not as far as humanity escapes the absolute problem that was ultimately their own. Also, there are not many special shoot-em-up or space effects - at least not in the first few episodes I have seen so far. <br /> <br /> What he has are very good stories, characters and themes. He also has good performances by actors. They can make culture that is similar to modern society, but at the same time alien, be completely reliable. Like BSG, this series is about humanity - our strengths, weaknesses, potentials and disadvantages. It may seem strange that human society in a different world has neckties, antique cars and chicken. But these things are really more than just creating a half-familiar background. Anyone who gets stuck on these details really does not make sense. Regardless of whether you are from a mafia culture or a prosperous and advanced culture, people and human nature are not so different 150,000 years ago in a technologically advanced past than what we see today in the world. I wonder if the writers are trying to tell us something.
