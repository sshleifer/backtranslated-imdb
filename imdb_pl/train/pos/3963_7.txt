The history of the FBI, told from Agent Stewart's point of view by retrospection, intertwines with his personal life story. Stewart and Miles (as his wife) are pretty good, just like Hamilton as a serious agent. The problem is that the episodic character of the story makes it difficult to get involved. It's like watching bits and pieces from a dozen different films when we see a glimpse of someone who throws gangsters. Some episodes are too long, some are too short, and some just look out of place (Stewart's daughter's school routine). In general, it takes too long. Nevertheless, it is worth looking at its attractive production values.
