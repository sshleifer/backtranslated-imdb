Carla works for a developer, where she stands out by being unattractive, unappreciated and desperate. She is also deaf. <br /> <br /> Her boss offers employment to someone to ease her heavy workload, so she takes the opportunity to secure a male company. Help comes in the form of Paul, a tattooed fresh hooligan from prison and a clearly unadapted routine of an office environment. <br /> <br /> Between them develops a hidden sexual tension, and Carla is determined to keep him in spite of his unwillingness to accept a working week. When Carla is eliminated from a valid contract negotiated by a slimy colleague, he uses Paul's crime, forcing him to steal the contract. A colleague quickly realizes that he is behind theft, but when he meets her, Paul's usefulness for hitting people in the face is also useful - but this crime has its price. <br /> <br /> Paul is "passing" by some mafia friends as a reminder of unpaid debt. He formulates a plan that uses Carla's unique lip reading ability to wrest a gang of violent bank robbers. Now it was Carli's turn to enter the terrifying new world. <br /> <br /> The fourth film by director Jacques Audiard, "READ MY LIPS", begins with a captivating romantic drama between two marginalized losers only to change the course of the half-sharp thriller, in which their symbiotic shortcomings change them in winners. The leads are excellent; easily convincing us that this strange couple can really connect. The first meeting between Carla and Pawe≈Ç is a pleasant farce in which he tries to circumvent his surly restraint and manners of the prisoner, only to discover that he was until recently a prisoner. Emmanuelle Devos, who plays Carla, has an almost exclusive ability to go from witness to magnificent and back in the frame. Vincent Cassel plays Paul as a dog with a horn that really seems to be at home when he gets beaten or made up of a rip-off that can kill him. <br /> <br /> Like many French movies, "READ MY USTA" At the beginning it seems that it is not about anything special until you scratch the surface and you will not know that it's probably about everything. The only note regarding the boom is the sub-entry concerning the missing wife of the parole officer Paula; a device that seems to have been invented just to direct the main plot of the story into a neat little dead end. <br /> <br /> It was the French "New Wave" from the 1960s that introduced the concept of "genre" for making movies and I always thought that every medium was somewhat at risk when you had to use a label system to help it define; so it's always a pleasure to discover a movie that seems to go beyond the genre, and even better, oppose it.
