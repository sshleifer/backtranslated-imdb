When Harry Callahan stood up for years, the inevitable "chip-boy on the shoulder" must finally enter the game. Callahan, sometimes fragile and out of place, his behavior was still unwavering. Fortunately, this movie took some time to develop a different kind of story that could rediscover Dirty Harry and the whole genre. Although the movie did not meet their expectations, it was still a great addition to the series, even if it was a bit out of place during the stupid fashion trends and New Wave music.
