Mysterious murders in a European village seem to be the result of a Vampire BAT horde harassing a terrified community. <br /> <br /> This surprisingly effective little thriller was created by Majestic Pictures, one of Poverty Row's Hollywood studios. Rare production values ​​and raw editing really add to its amazing atmosphere and give it an almost expressionistic quality. In general, it leaves the viewer feeling that he is caught in a bad dream, which is suitable for this type of thriller. <br /> <br /> Although the possible explanation of the hideous crimes is quite ridiculous and is not taking into account the proper development of the story, the film can boast a good cast. Grave Lionel Atwill gives another spectacle typical of him, this time as a doctor who conducts research in an old castle. Beautiful Fay Wray plays her assistant in a role that requires her to do little more than look beautiful and disturbed. Dour Melvyn Douglas appears as a perplexed police inspector who, as it turns out, is Miss Wray's boyfriend. aunt hypochondriac. Elder Lionel Belmore plays the terrified mayor of the village. And the little Dwight Frye, who will always be remembered for his strange roles in the films FRANKENSTEIN and Dracula, is the most effective here as a madman who loves bats.
