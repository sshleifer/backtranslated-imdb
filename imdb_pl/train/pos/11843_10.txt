Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron is a great movie. Mixing different types of animation is unique, the story is amazing and the music is great. <br /> <br /> The drawn animation is a unique feature of many animations. The way they expressed characters, especially horses, thanks to their animation is particularly spectacular. While the way horses communicate through body language is easy to understand, many small children and people who have not studied horses may not understand. Without words, I imagine that expressing them with functions would have to be difficult. For this reason, I understand the "eyebrow" added to horses (while real horses do not have these thick lines). One of the few things I noticed about horse habits that may have been strangely depicted is that the Spirit is leading a flock of mothers. In the herds of wild horses, the stallion usually chases young stallions. <br /> <br /> Also, although some people may think that presenting white officers as "bad guys" are stereotypes, think about all the films in which Indians were portrayed as such. Sometimes then; they treated the mustangs very badly. For example, in real history, the Appaloosa race was almost completely destroyed by army officers. Imagine what would happen to one of the best-loved equestrian breeds if the native Americans did not save them. <br /> <br /> I think it's amazing how realism was not taken away by horses talking to each other. The feelings of the Spirit were expressed by a little narration, but mainly by music (by Bryan Adams). Songs express history well, and Hans Zimmer and Bryan Adams did a great job of telling a story using melodies and lyrics. <br /> <br /> The emotions I got while watching the movie, whether for the first time or for the twentieth time (yes, I watched it so much), you would not believe it. Some scenes are breathtaking, while others seem to force tears in your eyes. The opening sequence, showing the homeland of the Spirit, immediately introduces you into a spectacular action. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why some people are so hateful about this great movie. Overall, I rate it as 10/10 - you have to watch.
