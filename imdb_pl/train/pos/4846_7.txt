It's a classic British comedy thriller I've always wanted to check, but no chance has appeared yet. It is based on the popular stage play, which was already shot many times (especially in 1931. By the same director, but unfortunately this version did not survive in its entirety!); for the review the remake of the plot was updated to the then military situation. <br /> <br /> In any case, I was mainly familiar with early British comedians thanks to Will Hay movies: considering that this movie contains a similar thread of legendary hauntings, smuggling and hostile agents, it is very similar to that (it was written by regular Hay crew from Marriott Edgar, Val Guest and JOC Orton); the element of itinerant travelers was an equally tried and true formula. This time, the star is Arthur Askey (incited by Richard Murdoch) - I have not seen any of my films before - who is such an unlikely hero as Hay himself and whose personality turns out to be just as potentially annoying ... but he warms up quickly for him, and Askey he certainly invented many witty lines and funny pieces of business to justify the fact that the main character of the play (and the movie version from 1931) was divided into two parts, with Murdoch acting as a simple star partner. <br /> <br /> A remote single setting (film events largely take place during one stormy night) provides a great atmosphere; the last half hour - with the sudden appearance of a mysterious pair (Raymond Huntley and Linden Travers) and ultimately the arrival of the titular vehicle itself - is particularly handy and well served. From the rest of the casting list it is also worth mentioning Kathleen Harrison as a stereotypical frightened young lady, with the parrot as her constant companion, who is influenced by all emotions to take her first drink.
