The Torrent movie was the first and the last for Greta Garbo. It was her first American movie at MGM, the only studio in the USA where she had ever worked. It was also the last time someone else was exposed above her credit, that is her main character, Ricardo Cortez. <br /> <br /> Torrent is based on the work of the popular Spanish writer Vicente Blasco Ibaneza Entre Naranjos. It concerns a pair of unmatched lovers, Garbo and Cortez, who can not meet, mainly due to the machinations of Cortez's mother, Marta Mattox. <br /> <br /> Mattox is a wicked woman who has some ideas about who should marry her son. Remember that it is Spain, and such arranged marriages were still quite appropriate. Mattox means Gertrude Olmstead as a daughter-in-law, he is a descendant of Mack Swain, a man rich in pig farming. Swain provides a few moments of comic relief with his caring concern for piglets before they grow into the big old hogs to be cut. <br /> <br /> Blasco Ibanez had his earlier novels, The Four Horseman Of The Apocalypse and Blood, which was previously filmed with Rudolph Valentino. It would be interesting if Valentino did it with Garbo, but he could do it outside of the movie. In any case, one of Valentino Ricardo Cortez's followers fills the male lead. <br /> <br /> One of the reasons why Valentino may not want this movie is because the main character is Garbo, in contrast to the two previously mentioned works. When it gets dirty by Cortez, who does what Mattox and her "adviser" will say, banker Tully Marshall, leaves Spain and travels to France, where he becomes a big opera star. And it leads a quite scandalous life there. <br /> <br /> When he returns to Spain and tries to revive things, Mattox is even more outraged. He means a political career for his son. Cortez now works for the Spanish parliament, which is quite oddly called Cortes. <br /> <br /> The title refers to the flood and breaking of the dam causing all kinds of havoc in the countryside. Cortez actually fights Torrent in a rowing boat, trying to save Garbo from danger. When they meet, they have a brutally honest discussion, brutality from Garbo. <br /> <br /> Special effects here, primitive, though now they seem to be unusual for their time. They look very similar to the shots used in The Rains Came of 20th Century Fox, which was released in 1939 and won the Oscar for special effects. Unfortunately for Torrent it came out a year before the Oscar debut. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to give you any endings, so you'll have to see the movie to find out if Cortez and Garbo meet at the end. Garbo rightly won enthusiastic reviews for her performance and in an era when exaggerated gestures were the norm in a quiet screen, she was extremely subtle in her role. So she was the rest of her career, she had an unusual face for close-up. <br /> <br /> Although Greta Garbo would do a much better job than Torrent, this movie is still a good debut for her American big screen and it works very well for today's audience.
