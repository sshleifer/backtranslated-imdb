THE DEVIL'S PLAYTHING is my second attempt to produce Joseph Sarno - and although I say that it is much more enjoyable than the painfully boring and non-erotic Swedish WILDCATS, it is still a bit slow and unspecified for my taste. <br /> <br /> This one focuses on a group of vampire girls who live in a castle who want to resurrect their previously murdered 'leader'. To do this, girls must dance naked and kiss, sing strange things - and of course, drink some blood. When the doctor and her brother's car break down and they must stay in the castle for accommodation - they provide the perfect blood bank for horny vampires ... but they may not be as helpless as they seem ... <br /> <br /> THE DEVIL'S PLAYTHING is a pretty good example of extravagance from the early 1970s. A lot of nudity - including a few full rights, a little dingy - including incest and of course lesbians ... but these scenes are still quite tame according to today's standards. Some very hot women in this would benefit from more pronounced sex, but I think you can not have it all. He would also use heavier violence / gore, because it's a vampire movie, but I think the goal of THE DEVIL TO PLAY was to show the skin, not the blood. Still a bit slow - and the acting is mostly completely wooden - but this can be expected from something from this period and this budget. It is worth looking at the use of fans - others may think that it is a bit too boring for their taste. 7/10
