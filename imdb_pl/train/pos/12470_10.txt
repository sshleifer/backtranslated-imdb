I just saw this movie on TV ... <br /> <br /> I lost my father when I was young and this movie definitely touched me ... <br /> <br /> I feel lost little girl Desi felt ... < br /> <br /> feeling that I want to see my father again ... <br /> <br /> wanting to talk to him ... <br /> <br /> or at least I got a chance to say goodbye ... <br / > <br /> and I am so touched by a letter that has been written to her. <br /> <br /> saying that her father read her letter and sent him back to someone to answer her and buy her a present, because there is no store in heaven ... <br /> <br /> it just lets me feel that miracles exist ...
