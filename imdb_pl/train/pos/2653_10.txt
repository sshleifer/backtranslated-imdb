Kubrick once again proved his splendor, now in a horror movie based on Stephen King's book in the same way. Jack Torrance is a man in his forties, married, with one child, with a history of trouble and alcoholism. Overlook in Colorado suspends service during the winter because of extreme weather, and the person who deals with facilities during these five months has a well-paid job; and Torrance, who wanted to become a writer, considered it perfect. But the manager advised Torrance about loneliness in this winter-potentially dangerous place, and told him that a caretaker had gone mad and murdered his family in the past. Even before they got there, his son Danny, who has an imaginary friend who lights him in the future (shining), knew that this place is not good and he does not want to go. When they installed themselves in the hotel, everything started well, but within a month Jack began to behave strangely, irritated and depressed. At this point, we know something will happen, but I do not know when or how. Terrible things happen, for example, the appearance of two twin girls talking to Danny and someone who attacked him violently. They are not alone in this place. Later, Jack began to see other people and immediately felt good with them as if they were his family; among them, the famous psychotic caretaker, Delbert Grady. Grady tells Torrance that he must kill his family because they are "intruders" in the hotel. Following this order, Jack went to his destination and many of the most terrible things I have ever seen happened here. The ending is spectacular, and the viewers will be interested and shocked until the last moment.
