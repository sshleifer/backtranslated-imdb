I have read most of the comments for this video. I've seen this film (and a whole series of prophecies) many times with family members of all ages, we all enjoyed it and just meditated on what we already knew from reading and studying the Bible about the wonder and end times. Nobody was scared or traumatized, as I read on some posts. The film is based on biblical facts. I have seen many films from the times of the end of "Tribulation", "Armageddon" and so on, and this is one of the best in presenting biblical truths. Maybe there are not many great special effects like today's movies, but I believe that this is a good observation tool. This video and its series of prophecies can be seen for free on this higher site and evaluated by yourself. Blessings for everyone.
