in 60 seconds it is a very good comedy film, which earned over 100 million dollars, but has been criticized by most critics. Personally, I thought it was a great movie. The story was credible and is probably the best cast for this type of film, including the winners of the 3rd academy Nicolas Cage, Robert Duvall and the very hot Jolie Anjolina. besides the lame coup d'Ã©tat it is the perfect combination of action and drama comedies. my result is **** (with ****)
