Wow, I loved this movie. Perhaps he has failed to get the funds and advertising that get the latest Hollywood hits, but they pack up twice as much as the emotional blow. The story revolves around this one family from Utah and it is a connection between people in the family that provide the film with its impact. The main host (Giovanni Ribisi) plays his role very well, and at no time lets you believe that he keeps all his feelings. However, it was his brother (Elias Koteas) who stole this program from me. When they were together in the stages, they limited their lines, giving fantastic performances. Great cast, great movie.
