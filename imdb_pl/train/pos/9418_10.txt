For years I have had this film on tape and started watching it this morning (waiting for the laundry - how ironic!) Mainly because I wanted to hear the title music of Benjamin Frankel again. It ended up being around the first half hour, enchanted by how wonderfully I was in the direction, writing and performances. The film resembles the figure of the British hero of the 1950s: Cecil Parker, Michael Gough, Miles Malleson, Duncan Lamont, and especially Ernest Thesiger, a great old giant textile factories. Not to mention Alec Guinness and Joan Greenwood, not about characters as such, but cute, charismatic heroes. It's science fiction in its purest form and droll comedy. A classic classic and I hope that nobody will ever try to convert it!
