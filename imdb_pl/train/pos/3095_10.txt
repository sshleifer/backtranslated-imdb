So what is the reason? Is there any vendetta against this AMAZING program or someone involved in it? Why would the best performance I've seen for years been canceled? I'm addicted. I saw this concert at random last fall and I immediately loved it and watched it every week. Then he left, and I tried it, but it was not broadcast. I forgot about it for a moment until I found episodes on the ABC website. Now I want MORE. I agree with everyone else - with the rest of the trash on television today it was refreshing to see something as well rounded and developed as this. I watch Boston Legal for my eccentric, comedic patch, and House for my intellectual-mysterious repair. My wife loves Gray's Anatomy for "realism" and I love / hate this show, but for me it can not be further. ROAD for a lot of drama. Everything that can go wrong, does. But once, there is a drama that REALLY is true. Real people, real problems. Sure, there are some extremes, like a former gangster who was good, a girl escaping mafia, etc. But these people (especially in New York) are really there and I refer to each of them. It seems to me that I do not have enough. I just hope that ABC will pull their heads out of bean-sized butt and continue this show. Get respect for the drama QUALITY. This can be one of the best concerts of all time. If anyone will allow it.
