Tintin was one of my favorite characters as a child. I have always borrowed books from the school library. My favorite was "The Red Sea Sharks" - so much action and humor. <br /> <br /> This document was a brilliant exposition of Herge's history and its development by Tintin. The personal experience of the filmmaker during the interview with Herge and the story of his relationship with the artist, who was an inspiration for the character of Khan, was very moving. <br /> <br /> A great documentary about a very talented and beloved artist. A great example of someone who has become known around the world and brought joy to millions of children (and young people) around the world.
