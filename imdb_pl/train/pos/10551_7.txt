Sitting, writing? Nothing is the latest "what if?" Fest offered by Vincenzio Natali, with David Hewlitt and Andrew Miller as two losers. One has problems with relationships, he was expelled from work (because of problems in the relationship), and the police have to catch him (because of his work and problems with relationships). The second guy is an agoraphobia who refuses to leave the house, he is met by a nuisance guide who calls his mother to claim she was molested when she does not buy cookies from him. Oh, yes, the police are also after him, after the scout's mother will call them to arrest him. <br /> <br /> Man, what a day. <br /> <br /> And what if you liquidate it all? This is the whole premise "Nothing". Two fools realize, cops, scout, cars, lawn, road, everything? to disappear. There is only a white space! It's an interesting concept that I thought. I also looked at it at the time, 30 minutes passed in the movie, and I had another hour in the film. Could two actors make this work fun for us for 60 minutes? Although the actors are trying, 60 minutes is a long time, and the place of this movie is clearly dead air. But the two actors who are friends all their lives and the director have such a huge repertoire with them that it was great to watch the dialogue and improve both. There are many supernatural elements, but it's rather their reaction to those elements that ultimately make this film worth seeing.
