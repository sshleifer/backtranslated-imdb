This film concerns one of the most terrifying geriatric diseases among modern elderly people. As a person who has faced many families who are facing the potential of Alzheimer's disease or are at the stage of forming, I would suggest that every health care provider recommend this film to any family that has to deal with the trauma of this disease. The film is intended primarily to talk to the patient's family and reaches the very heart of the fight. Casting is excellent, and the dramatic portrait is outstanding thanks to the very impressive plot line.
