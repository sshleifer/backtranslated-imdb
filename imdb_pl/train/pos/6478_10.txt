Despite stories from the British perspective, this is the best WW II document ever made. Presented in digestible (as digestible as the war may be) episodes, like the grave of Laurence Olivier, he connects masses of eyewitnesses who were forced to experience the events of this horrible time. Eagerly awaiting the release of the DVD in the US, Europeans have the opportunity to release it on DVD this year.
