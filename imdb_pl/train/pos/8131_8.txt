<br /> <br /> If you like rap or hip-hop, watch this movie, although it's funny if you do not get references, as a simple comedy. <br /> <br /> I have not seen much of these very interesting CB4s, but what I saw did not have the heart that this little buzzer had. <br /> <br /> I have not heard from the people involved, which is a surprise. The movie is very similar to Spinal Tap, which is nothing bad, and I think a lot of this dialogue, while priceless in Tap is more fun here, probably because I'm more in rap than in rock days, so my own judgment is doing the cloud of this point. <br /> <br /> Rapid songs are fun as hell, and it's basically the reference point for most of the movie, not all of them are on the face, which means physical comedy and one-liners take precedence over starts. <br /> <br /> Great fun, one to watch twice, if there ever was a movie.
