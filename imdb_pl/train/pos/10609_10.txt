I saw this movie last night on the cable and it is extraordinary. What I like the most is that it is understated and low, but from the bottom of my heart. Henry Thomas (he played a child in E.T.) is masterfully unarticulated (he should be a man of a few words). David Straithern is a wonderful crazy villain. And a miracle (considering that we are talking about a Hollywood product here), the child plays the role of the main character, but it does not work or has lines, but it is simply IS (and it is luminous in it). Interestingly, Thomas's mysterious relationship with E.T. was the core of the movie; while his bond the child serves as the core of the "Good Child". <br /> <br /> Then there is music - oh, what music !! Gillian Welch's songs are great, and the entire score is great mountain country music. <br /> <br /> This movie is wonderfully atmospheric. I recommend it very much.
