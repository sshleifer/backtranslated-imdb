YOU MUST SEE! I saw WHIPPED at a press show and it was fun. We speak without interruption. It makes SOMETHING ABOUT MARIA a meandering drama. Amanda Peet shouts about the quality of the star thanks to her winning combination of beauty, mind and serious acting abilities. Peter Cohen, the director, made the most modern film that shows the raw interior of the male ego in the urban world of dating. Despite all the comedy, Whipped is successful thanks to his intelligence. Which is rare for the first director, especially in the romantic comedy. He is a great talent. Judah Domke, Brian Van Holt, Jonathan Abrahams and Zorie Barber complete the cast with depth and very strong performances, just like the typical men would be. You must see how these boys go to work and get caught in the Peeta network. Check the trailer on whipped.com, it's worth downloading 3 minutes.
