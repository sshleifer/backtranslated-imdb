I saw this movie a few months ago on the cable and it was fantastic. William H Macy is one of my favorite actors, and his performance was simply amazing. It makes you look after your character, even if it's clearly doing badly, and Neve Campbell gives you a performance that is undoubtedly the best performance I've seen this year. She is fantastic as a wild young woman who is smart beyond her years. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland is just terrifying, like Macy's father, and John Ritter is okay when he shrinks in the middle of everything that's happening. <br /> <br /> I would like it to be in the theater because I feel it is a movie that should be watched by a wider audience. It is a pity, because it is much better that most of the new films now come to the theater. <br /> <br />
