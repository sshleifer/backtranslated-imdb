This is a fantasy children's film based on the Boggy Creek legend, although I do not know why they called it Return to Boggy Creek, as if it were a sequel. Dawn Wells appears as a mother of three children who get lost in the bogs around Boggy Creek with two other men, and the monster comes to their aid. Yes, it is very stupid, and the story is banal, but this kind of film is perfect for a group of 8-12 years, which was the goal. This is a harmless rate for children with G grade, or at least you do not have to worry about leaving your children alone while watching. Strictly for a set of 8-12 years, older children will be bored and think it is poor.
