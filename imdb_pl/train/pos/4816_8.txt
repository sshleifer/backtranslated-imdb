I liked the movie very much. Certainly, it will leave the audience wanting to learn more, and there really is much more historically to discover! <br /> <br /> Has the production team fall into the temptation of excessive drama, especially in the case of shooting? There are a lot of interesting, accurate materials on the site? The contribution of Prince Albert to Britain and the monarchy guarantees the film on its own, but it was admitted that it was apparently not part of the intention here. <br /> <br /> Costumes and sets are especially good, but am I alone in thinking that this production (which, judging by the length of the titles at the end, certainly was not too cheap), wanted to be bad for the label expert the British court outside of Princess York? ie. Did Princess Victoria really stuff the whole truffle / rissole (?) to her mouth, talking with the prime minister in the company of His Majesty with full lips? <br /> <br /> "I have never felt so sympathetic for Victoriain in this film, or rather in her shoes. However, he loved the cast of directors, whose actions were convincing, so did the script really let us get to know them well? I have always felt completely disconnected, uninformed beyond the observer, much more than in the case of "Mrs. Brown," or even "queen." However, to be honest, I still could not take my eyes off the screen, except that some of the more avant-garde techniques of the camera that occasionally distracted.
