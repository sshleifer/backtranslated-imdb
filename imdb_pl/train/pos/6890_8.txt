This was one of the most important events of the second season of the ST: TNG, before they "grew up" or grew up in the third season and later. It was not only a show for upart-ups such as Bill Campbell and Teri Hatcher, but it was also a continuation of the search for Data for its "humanity", this time through the concept of comedy. Still one of my favorite episodes. <br /> <br /> By the way, I'm still disappointed that there is no recognition for an actress whose character Okon was to have a tryst (after Teri Hatcher) before he is brutally interrupted by Lt Worf. I remember watching this episode "for the first time" in my friends' comic shop that day and we all thought she would be the perfect Jean Gray / Marvel Girl. <br /> <br /> It would be nice to know who this pretty lady is ...
