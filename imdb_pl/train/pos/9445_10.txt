This is without a doubt one of the best movies I've ever seen. I saw for the first time that I was about 9 or 10 years old. I started looking for a rape scene. And when I saw it, I was really shocked thinking, "What is this sick movie?" Today I saw it from the very beginning and I really understood how the movie really is. It's exciting, frightening, shocking and disturbing. But the best thing about it is the ending, in which the audience shows that this experience haunts the characters for the rest of their lives. They will torture their conscience and they will worry about the rest of their lives for the bodies found in this river. And there is nothing they can do about it, it's something they have to live with. This ending is one of the most unfortunate endings in film history and very clever, brilliant and terrifying. <br /> <br /> And acting is also great, especially Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds. Great acting in this movie. In all, John Boorman created one of the best films in film history based on the novel by Dick Chaney. Must see for all movie lovers
