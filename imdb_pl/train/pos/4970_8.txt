Some critics have found this film gloomy, but for me it was good enough humor and optimism to overcome this impression. For example, the quiet positive and stoical character of her daughter is still the center of the film, often opposing the unfortunate aspects of the scenery and story. <br /> <br /> The movie is full of original ideas and characters, and the final result is not predictable: I felt it could go in any direction. <br /> <br /> By the way, many reviews I have read mention the effective use of black and white, but the printout that I saw shown on the SBS TV network here in Australia was in full color. <br /> <br />
