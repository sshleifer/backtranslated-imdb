Robert Taylor and Stewart Granger change the roles of nasty guests in "All brothers were brave". Taylor seems a bit uncomfortable in his role as a bad guy, but Granger plays his part perfectly. However, the true heroes of this story are the bison and the northwest. The film is perfectly made, with the atmosphere of great times. The direction is tight and although the film is not a playful entertainment, my way of thinking is a big movie, unjustly ignored by experts.
