The melodrama typical of this period (mid-1950s) and adequate food have become blurred. Rock Hudson, a hulk in which everyone always falls in love, plays his usual stereotypical role, but while in Giant, made in the same year, when his material and collaborators (Taylor and Dean) were above average, in this film is simply not good enough to raise the caliber beyond the nonsense story of how difficult it is to be rich and happy. Self-destructive brother and sister (Robert Stack, passing through a film in a drunken stupor, and Dorothy Malone, playing vampire poor, a small rich girl completely over the top) ends in losers, and Hudson gets Bacall - who is rather wooden in the part that does not have enough character or joke to take it. To paraphrase Oscar Wilde, a good end happily and a bad end unfortunately, this is the meaning of fiction. However, I wanted to read that the film is based on a true story that confirms the story. Like other films from this period, homosexuality is hidden in heterosexual terms. Maybe the movie could be rewritten: Stack's character will call more real if he hides homosexual feelings for Mitch, getting married. Todd Haynes's Far From Heaven has significantly improved in All That Heaven Allows, also directed by Sirk. Perhaps Haynes can remake Written on the Wind and give us a really memorable movie.
