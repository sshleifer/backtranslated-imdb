Okay - I'll confess. It's a movie that made me love what Michael Keaton could do. He's making a beautiful parody of someone who's parody James Cagney, with the grace to save. <br /> <br /> Supporting staff are reliable employees who will do a good job in the 80's comedy. The false gangster film from the 1930s and 1940s constantly breaks through with an extremely original material. (Well, yes - some of them have been copied since then - but when this movie was shot, it was original, and most of it was not copied elsewhere.) See how Joe Piscopo warns people not to do it, with one from the big slogans of forgery. See how Roman Moronie does things with English profanities that will make your grammar teacher laugh. Watch amazing gags, such as the owner of the pet store Johnny Kelly, using a gun with the price on your puppies and vacuuming kittens. Watch the largest educational film "Warning of sex". Watch the most amazing church performance in Latin, while a guy who never attended classes assembles a Thompson machine gun from the part. Watch lines that you will use in casual conversation for the next decade. See how Maureen Stapleton makes the perfect antithesis of a diligent mother, with the surprise that you will never see the upcoming. <br /> <br /> If you see a gag that does not hit your funny bone, be patient - another will come in 30 seconds or less, and the chances are, you have to stop until you finish rolling on the floor a few times. Duckies and Bunnies? They too. Watch out for subtle things - some visual gags can go unnoticed by the first few impressions. <br /> <br /> There are a few minor flaws - but it's probably the best of fakes. Some are coming, but none are so good.
