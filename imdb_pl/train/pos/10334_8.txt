I have never watched this movie until recently in TCM and we found this story about Poland and a small town that had to suffer from the Nazi occupation of local cities, like many other European cities, for example: Norway. The First World War came to an end, and the people in the city were still suffering from the missing soldiers and wounded, which the war always creates. Alexander Knox (Wilhelm Gimm) "Gorky Park" returns from the war with a lost leg and was a former teacher in the city. He was brought up in German and was not very happy with the Polish nation, and they did not accept him either. As Hitler's party grew stronger Wilhelm Grimm wanted to be a Nazi to return and punish this small Polish city for their treatment of him, which was really in his mind. Marsha Hunt (Marja Pacierkowski), "Chloe's Prayer", played an extraordinary role as a woman who lost her husband and was romantically associated with Whilhelm Gimm. There are many flashbacks and some very real truths about how the Nazis destroyed families and their whole lives. Wagons with cattle are shown in this picture with the Jewish people heading for the Nazi gas chambers. If you have not seen this movie and you like this topic, please take some time; this movie is very down-to-earth for a 1944 movie and a story that you will not forget too soon.
