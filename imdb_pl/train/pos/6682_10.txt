I saw it in cinemas and absolutely loved it. Geoffery Rush gave me the best performance as a super-dark character I've seen since Gene Hackman as Lex Luther. Kel Mitchel and Paul Rubens were a maid in heaven. This film also introduced me to William H. Macy, who is now one of my favorite actors. Hank was great as Blue Raja and I especially liked that the character was not really British. Scene with him and telling mum that he is a superhero, almost brought tears to my eyes. I loved the fact that The Bowler was talking to the ball. Some of the funniest things were about the fierce anger of Stiller and his hero, and the fact that his threats and one-shots were mumbling and never made sense. I could barely refrain from applauding when he said "fraculater, Freinken-puss," he said. But one of the things I liked best was Captain Amazing dying in the movie. I highly recommend this film for every occasion and give it my own, personal thumbs.
