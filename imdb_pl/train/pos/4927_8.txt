Only comment on the accents in New Orleans ... <br /> <br /> An earlier reviewer noted: "This movie could have been filmed in New York or another big northern city because it presents characters who speak more like" broklynese "than maybe the southern accent you can hear in this part of the country." A similar commentary also appeared in the English reviewer. <br /> <br /> Many people in New Orleans actually sound "broklynese". I never found out why. (This is mentioned in John Kennedy Toole's "Confederation of Duncesses".) I always appreciate the movies in New Orleans that contain this detail, just like this one. Too often, this is just a Hollywood version of the standard southern accent.
