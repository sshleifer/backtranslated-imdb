A movie from which I expected very little, and only watched how to pass a quiet hour - but what time it turned out. Roll is a great, if not too serious, little story "country-boy-lost-in-the-big-city-make-good", it's fun, characters are endearing and the pace is fine. br /> <br /> Toby Malone is the real star of the movie with his charming portrait of Matt, said a country boy and a local Australian football hero who comes to the big city to try one of the big teams. He is superbly supported by John Batchelor as Tina's local gangster. Watch out for these two. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it.
