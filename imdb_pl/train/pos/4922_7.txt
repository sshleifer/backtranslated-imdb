I wonder what the audience thought that day when he first looked at Walter Jack Palance (Blackie). Certainly looks like no other at the time, this skull-like face, flattened nose and elongated body - even now remains a disturbing presence. And what could be more appropriate than his emerging from these dumpy slums in New Orleans that seem to fester like a plague that Blackie loses in the city. I'm sorry I did not have more scenes. <br /> <br /> The film itself is very skilfully assembled? black morgue humor, interaction with Widmark-Douglas, uninteresting places, battles among civil servants - all of them woven into an extremely realistic thriller with a threat in contrast to other times. Even the home scenes of Widmark, which put a woman (Bel Geddes) on the tent, are not too burdensome. Director Kazan certainly shows his skills in creating a studio product (Fox), no matter how he felt about the commercial aspect. <br /> <br /> Widmark is doing a solid job as a public health official. But my money is in one and only Zero Mostel. Was there ever a more hardcore performer who would be able to whine louder or push more than a large-sized guy (eg The Enforcer, 1950). This scene with Mostel, where Palance argues with the cunning wife of Mostel (Liswood), is a jewel of crazy submission when Mostel tries to calm everyone down like a madman. It is a pity that he has lost so many years on the black list. (I wonder if this is what Kazan called him.) <br /> <br /> But not only professionals add color. Locals add both character and authenticity, especially two Asian guys with whom policemen talked. This whole scene has improvised air, as if Kazan recognized their potential and shaped a cool little scene on the spot. Also, this colorful rental hall with all deck-chairs is pure inspiration. And what about those flea cafes that lead me to the nearest Denny's. <br /> <br /> In any case, the film is still a well-exposed, thrilling thriller with apocalyptic air, which strangely predicts many of today's mega-hits.
