I remember seeing this movie as a child in 1977 or 1978. HBO would show it late at night, when they were one and only movie channel. In those days it was UNRATED and it was the only movie of its kind ever seen in pay TV ... especially then. I would like to see him now as an adult, in which I would be more inclined to understand the topic for adults. It was probably the closest thing I've ever seen in porn at 7 or 8 years old. Fortunately, on the weekends I had silly babysitters and partying parents. Most of my memories of this movie were completely chaotic sexual behavior of these two guys. Breaking into homes to smell underwear, feeding a foreign man's milk on a public bus and adultery in a taxi at the request of one of the women are just a few of those crazy escapades. A very racial movie in the early 70's. Until I checked IMDb, I had no idea that this movie has such consequences. Most of the people I'm talking to have never heard of it.
