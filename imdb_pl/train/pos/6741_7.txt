The title sequence shows the credits written on the rain-soaked pavement when people trod on it; the music is provided by someone whistling "Street Scene" by Alfred Newman. Then we meet Det. Sgt. Mark Dixon (Dana Andrews), who always wanted to be something that his old man was not: a guy on the right side of the law. But he is quite malicious for a good guy. After a few complaints about his rough people, his boss, insp. Nicholas Foley (Robert F. Simon) humiliates him. Foley tells him he's a good man, but he has to straighten his head and be more like Det. Lieutenant Thomas (Karl Malden), who just got promotion. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Tommy Scalise (Gary Merrill, in an incredibly slimy performance) has an illegal dice game and wants to make a sucker from rich Ted Morrison (Harry Von Zell) whom Ken Paine (Craig Stevens) brought along with beautiful wife Morgan (Gene Tierney). She discovers too late that her husband uses her as bait, and Paine hits her when she refuses to play. Knightly Morrison intervenes, but Paine knocks him off balance. It seems the worst, but later it turns out that the guy is dead; and Paine looks guilty. <br /> <br /> But that will not be Paine's story. Soon, Dixon fell in love with Morgan, but not before losing his temper and committing a terrible act that he was trying to hide. Morgan's father, a taxi driver (Tom Tully), can guess. Dixon must try to blame Scalise. <br /> <br /> Otto Preminger directs the script attributed to Ben Hecht and three others from William L. Stuart's novel Night Cry. It's a solid movie noir with excellent performances and all the shadowy photography and dark morality we expect from this genre. He holds up to a brightly lit end that looks like something the studio has done to calm down censors. Of course, the classic noir directed by Preminger with Andrews and Tierney is "Laura". You'll like it, but you can not miss it.
