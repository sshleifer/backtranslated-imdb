An absolute masterpiece of the film! Goodnight Mr.Tom has quickly become one of my favorite movies of all time. Nobody should miss this movie, it's just too good! Mr.Tom perfectly introduces John Thaw as a stern old man who becomes a gentle figure of his father when William Beech (Nick Robinson) is sent to him for evacuation, almost like a "city mouse and a country mouse". A really painful movie. The director knew exactly how to turn a book into a movie, and he did it extremely well. The film was so perfectly filmed that the emotions of the characters and what was happening made the audience feel a lot of emotions, from love to fear, and these emotions could turn into sixpence. This film, set during the turmoil during the Second World War, also shows the difference between cities and rural areas, they are almost like different countries. Absolutely need to see, those who do not miss a really amazing and brilliant movie.
