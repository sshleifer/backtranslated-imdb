Why would you watch it? Certainly there are no reasons why you should not see it! Wonderfully and funly directed by Albert and David Maysles, Gray Gardens was originally meant to be a film about East Hampton gentrification, but it turned out that it would be interesting to develop a study on the eccentric life of these two Edith Bouvier Beales, aunt and cousin of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. Their life was certainly fun (Edith spent most of the day in bed opera singing, Edie doing pirouettes and majorettes dancing with many cats, one called Ted Z. Kennedy). The film is interesting because it is both amusing and sad - Edith died shortly after the film's premiere (February 1977) At the age of 82, after experiencing the fame she received after Edie (she danced and sang in the nightclub Edie Beale Jr. born in 1925 and still lives in Miami Beach. This film is both captivating and enchanting.
