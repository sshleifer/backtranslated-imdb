Yes, I did it when I was sitting on my face, remembering that I felt almost guilty when I watched him a few weeks ago, while my wife decided to watch something so insignificant (in comparison) as "Dearest mom". <br /> <br /> How to explain the attractiveness of "Batman and Robin" - I mean only those who really counted, Adam West and Burt Ward. It was a terrible performance, with terrible conspiracies and horrible acting - and oh yeah, it was terribly fun! The same applies to the film "reunion" and "flashback". Adam and Burt are invited to the auction, on which the old Batmobile will be sold for charity. But it is stolen, and our buddies (like themselves) jump into the form of their old heroes (if not their costumes) and go to find out what happened. Along the way, they mention the series and see how it all happened in flashbacks, with Jack Brewer and Jason Marsden playing young Adam and Burt from the TV series. It really was quite interesting to look at the old series behind the scenes, and Adam and Burt just returned perfectly to the character (even though they were not really in character - well, you would have to see it to see what it means.) It was great to see Julie Newmar and Franek Gorshina. <br /> <br /> If you're not a fan of the old series, you hate it - If you - God forbid - you thought that Michael Keaton and George Clooney accepted the "Batman", you hate it even more. But if you grew up with Adam and Burt and you still want to admit that you've never missed the episode - well, this one is for you. <br /> <br /> Yes, that's right - 9/10
