This movie scared me! I must admit that I spent most of the film watching with my fingers, but what I saw was really terrifying. I shouted loudly two or three times during the show. <br /> <br /> My favorite movie aspect was sound and photography. The sound was especially great and the surroundings were really scary beautiful. I read somewhere that it was some weird band of husband and wife who did it. For some reason, it makes it even stranger to me. <br /> <br /> If you like jumping and shaking of scary movies, this one is for you! Very tight and great movie for rent with a group of friends who love to watch movies curled up on the sofa screaming like little girls!
