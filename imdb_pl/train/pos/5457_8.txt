This movie is one of the riskier black and white movies from that period in the early 1930s, before the Hoyts Code was introduced. This is the story of a young beautiful woman moving to New York and heading to the top of the business, using her body as a tool to get there. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck plays young and beautiful Lily Powers who really does his job well. Lily moves to New York and goes on a business trip, sleeping with all the men. Stanwyck has an outstanding role of being a strong woman who uses men as one-off occasions, almost no emotions to them when playing in them like pawns. Lily Powers is a woman who has no mind just power and money. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie is a bit different than other movies I've seen, because there's almost no music in the background heard. I believe that it's only because people first got to know the live sound and dialogue between people in the film. Several times the music is heard at the beginning, because we show how it goes up the chain. Filming and various scenes were fantastic! The director of this film did all the right angles and all the right tricks, making this movie full of realism. <br /> <br /> This movie was a good movie in its entirety. The end of this movie was not as good as it should be, but it did not ruin it completely. Baby Face had its slow movements throughout the movie and perhaps a few predictable parts, such as who to sleep with. But it is a nice movie that you can watch more than once and suggest to some people and friends.
