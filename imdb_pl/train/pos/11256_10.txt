Without a doubt, the best of John Le Carre's novel, splendidly transformed into a classic movie. Performances by Peter Egan (Magnus Pym, The Perfect Spy), Rudiger Weigang (Axel, real name Alexander Hampel, controller Magnus "Czech Intelligence), Ray McAnally (father consul Magnus) and Alan Howard (Jack Brotherhood, mentor Magnus, believer and British controller ), along with the rest of the characters, are so perfect and natural, the person responsible for throwing them should receive the prize. Even small parts, such as Major Membury, are performed perfectly. He talks a lot about the strength of the performances and the strength of the characters in the novel, that despite the duplicity of Magnus, you can not help feeling closer to Magnus and Axel than Jack the Brotherhood and the slimy Grant Lederer of American intelligence. I have read the book at least a dozen or so times and have watched the movie almost as many times and I'm still hypnotized by both. If I had one book to do on a desert island, A Perfect Spy would be a choice above all others.
