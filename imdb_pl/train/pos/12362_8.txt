I will quickly deal with the film's affairs here: it was a very addictive tale of destructive traits absorbing passions; a young Italian woman who can not emotionally connect with her imprisoned political-radical fianc√© (partly due to her apolitical attitude and free approach to life) finds comfort and passion in a new young lover with whom she has a clearly sexual relationship. Fears, rage, tenderness and passions that swirl in the atmosphere of the story equalize emotionless silence that seems to consume two things. It gives the film a disturbing mood that permeates all political conflicts that otherwise lose on the viewer (unless you have a deep knowledge of Italian politics in the 80's). The film was fascinating for me ... what ruined it was the unpaid oral sex scene that the actress performs on the male role ... it is not simulated and leaves little imagination. There are also other sex scenes in the film that I think are necessary because they outline the madness and loneliness in which the heroes live. But the oral sex scene, I think, turns attention to real history. Up to this point, it flowed smoothly, and when the infamous sex scene (which caused many floods in those days) appeared, it was like hitting a roadblock. It's shocking and unnecessary, and I'm in a camp that thinks the film would not be hurt if the scene was removed from it. And the unfortunate fact is that this particular scene may discourage people from watching this intriguing movie, which in my opinion is worth seeing, because so much is happening under the surface, emotions and further turmoil. <br /> <br /> In general: A great movie hampered by a very unnecessary sex scene.
