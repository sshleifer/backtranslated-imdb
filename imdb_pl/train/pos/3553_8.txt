Guys and dolls is a movie that itches for a remake. It was built forty-eight years ago. His two main stars are either dead or 409 pounds. Although a remake with big stars would be a box office success, he would not be able to capture the magic that came in this version. Its unlimited energy can not be recovered, nor the pure joy that can be obtained by watching something like this: a huge, panoramic, large entertainment movie. <br /> <br /> Marlon Brando (who recently reached 409 pounds, the last time I heard) Sky Masterson, one of the biggest players in New York. Frank Sinatra is Nathan Detroit, who plays how often-how-you-can-find-it-for-it-crap, is known throughout the city. However, when one place he left, he charges $ 1,000, Detroit quickly needs money. He places $ 1000 on Masterson that the next day he can not take missionary Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons) to Havana. <br /> <br /> Guys and dolls are basically nothing more than tasteless kinds of singing and dancing, which usually like here, add to the fun. It's obvious how it was on Broadway: there were not many sets, and the scenes were long. If I had to complain about one thing, how uneven the songs were. Sometimes there were two songs on the stage; another time thirty minutes have passed. Guys and dolls are never boring, they just have a great time. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10 <br /> <br /> Not rated.
