I was surprised how the movie can be both tacky and perfect at the same time. Frisbee's flying saucer was unintelligible, especially when landing, but the effects Krell attacked were amazing for a movie that was made over half a century ago! Living in the Middle East, I saw how the shades of Islam are blurred when JJ Adams suggested that Alta should dress more modestly, and as an engineer he was amazed by the imagination used for "futuristic" gadgets and gadgets invented by the support department. All in all, a funny hour and a half, the first time I saw Walter Pidgeon and the chance to see Leslie Neilsen as a "young" man
