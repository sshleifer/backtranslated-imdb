The most satisfying part of "Dan in Real Life" is that the relationships between Dan (Steve Carell) and Marie (Juliette Binoche) make sense and are beautifully realistic. The cast of Oscar winner Juliette Binoche, as Dan's interest was love, was a great decision; she is exceptionally talented, intelligent, naturally attractive and, thank God, she has aged well for this role! If this movie was made with Jessica Alba or Scarlett Johansson, it would be a disaster. <br /> <br /> Another great aspect of "Dan in Real Life" is that it is the perfect adult film for those who are interested in mature comedy, which overlooks the three pillars of the "frat pack" formula: stupid chicks, chauvinistic guys and bad jokes. "Dan in Real Life" is witty and has fun, intelligent laughter. While other comedies contain or are almost entirely based on jokes that shock the public to laughter, the jokes from "Dan in Real Life" are more natural and clever, and require audience thinking. /> My only problem with "Dan in Real Life" is that the rebellious middle daughter is played too outrageously by actress Brittany Robertson. It is hard to say whether it was a personal choice on her part or the director's choice. Anyway, its character is unrealistic and annoying. But this is only a small flaw of the film and does not take away the whole story. <br /> <br /> In total, "Dan in Real Life" is a great movie, a fantastic escape from the excess of offensive and foolish comedies. The quality of writing, direction, acting and (especially) cinematography is excellent. It's just a beautiful, light comedy.
