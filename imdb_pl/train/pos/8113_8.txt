This sci-fi masterpiece has too many flaws after the editors murdered it after its opening in 1936. Visually, this is wonderful, but the script allows too many intellectual speeches about war and progress. It's very banal when the actors are I gave up to recite many thoughtful messages all the time. Raymond Massey and Cedric Hardwicke, both wonderful actors, have gone away like a few fanatics. Ralph Richardson is very good as "The Boss", a megalomaniac chief. The predictions about World War II were very strange, considering that the world was on the verge of the most devastating conflict in human history at the time. I am glad that the war did not come out like in the movie. There are several visually stunning assembly sequences that combine jumps of time between different episodes of the movie. Although it's not as fun as I expected, this movie is in your mind long after you saw it.
