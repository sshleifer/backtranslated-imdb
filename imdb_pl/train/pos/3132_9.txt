I watched the last night with low expectations. The reasons are that I usually do not like movies "made for television" and I rarely like "planted" films. But the Los Angeles Times critic seemed to like it, so I gave him a chance. I'm glad I did it. It was pretty good. Adam West and Burt Ward connect with each other. But in a sense, they acted as their "Batman and Robin". They were in the camp and did not treat themselves or the film too seriously. The film begins with the search for the "George Barris" Batmobile, which someone stole before being sold to the orphan's house. They are looking for a car, but they also mention the series they have made together. This is talked about in retrospection. It was well done. The actors they got for the younger Burt Ward and Adam West were dead. And when it comes to the TV movie, he came to the heart of their real behavior on screen and beyond. I give this one 9/10, I liked it so much.
