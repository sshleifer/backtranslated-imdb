There are not many stories about overcoming opportunities, as in the case of Christy Brown. Born of cerebral palsy in Dublin in the 1930s, his parents thought his disability was both psychological and physical. Although eventually diagnosed, Brown, in a family of a lower working class with almost 20 children, had to push himself to be appreciated by the family. Thanks to the use of his only fully functional limb, left leg, he learned to write and paint, he developed both skills expertly. <br /> <br /> But what makes the film version of Brown's autobiography "My Left Foot" is such a great story is her humbleness. Both director and writer Jim Sheridan and star Daniel Day-Lewis managed to tell this story in a way that does not scream about attention and resort to melodrama. Tricky struggles and scenes of frustration, as well as glorious moments of victory are easy traps of such a wonderful story, but "My left foot" remains true and inspired. <br /> <br /> Day-Lewis is the easiest to attraction. Playing someone with such serious physical impairments must be a demanding task. Day-Lewis not only gives us a complete picture of Christa, but also manages to chronicle the growth, improvement and inner change of characters at various stages of his life. He played at Christy at the age of 17, when he had limited language skills and was emotionally unstable, just as intellectually learned Christy, who tries to cope with why he can not find non-Platonic love. This last theme is the strongest in the movie and it would be nice if Sheridan and co-founder Shane Connaughton really developed it. Regardless, Day-Lewis makes us understand and sympathize with all these elements, giving a performance that is so credible that you often do not have time to think "wow, he is such a great actor". These are the most praiseworthy performances. <br /> <br /> Equally important, but thanks to more subtle means is Sheridan's work on the film. This story is about everyday life and struggles. Although Christy has such a unique set of circumstances that make his life difficult, his struggles do not differ from ours, and Sheridan completely understands this concept. Christy is struggling with love, parents' attention, issues of self-worth and ability. His struggles are more physically manifested (literally and figuratively) than ours. <br /> <br /> Sheridan gives us moments that reflect the spirit of a large Brown family and a special place in her Christy. Drama develops naturally when tensions are highest and humor comes in a similar way. A dinner scene when Christy learns that his doctor / teacher - the woman he loves - marries his brother Peter, who is the best example of the Day-Lewis and Sheridan movie. It's so well built by Sheridan that it comes out when we're ready, and Day-Lewis takes us out of it with its amazing work. <br /> <br /> The second strong element of the film is Brenda Fricker as a lady. Brown. I did not know that she won the Oscar, but in her performances there was something like Christy's loving and wise mother who was screaming at the Oscar. Her love for Christa and the constant struggle for him seem so convincing and cordial, and she earns a lot of sympathy considering her situation. <br /> <br /> The emotional blow of the film, taking into account the story, is surprisingly minimal. Perhaps it was part of the sacrifice of trying to create a film that is organically human. These two things should be reconcilable, but I imagine that the challenge is to tell a story that is real and that provides enough dramatic moments to experience our emotions on the roller coaster. The choice to downplay the latter was definitely wiser for "My Left Foot". Brown's circumstances speak for themselves - you do not have to squeeze them to get a greater dramatic impact. <br /> <br /> ~ Steven C <br /> <br /> Visit my website moviemusereviews.com for more information
