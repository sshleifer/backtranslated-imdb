My Tutor Friend is a well-written comedy movie that has something like My Sassy Girl ... there is no scenes with kiss / sex. Hollywood should learn more about Korean productions. Sex is not always required in a good romantic movie. <br /> <br /> The movie has a light tone with occasional cartoon CG scenes blended into the movie. I like the part where Ji-Hoon almost kissed Su-Wan. The funniest moment is that Ji-Hoon hit Su-Wan's first love because he threw Su-Wan on another girl and would soon be a father. How he became a father was revealed in the next scene, which brings a smile to the audience. <br /> <br /> Mao points: 8/10
