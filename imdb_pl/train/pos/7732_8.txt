The performances in this movie were fantastic. The dialogue was great. Jason Patric played a fantastic performance as "Kid" Collins in this great adaptation of Jim Thompson's novel. Much better than "The Grifters", which was a good movie, this film remained true to the roots of fiction / film noir, from which this story comes. I recommend this movie to all fans of the noir movie.
