Together with my girlfriend, Annette, we watched it together and we'll both comment. <br /> <br /> We both really enjoyed watching it, although it took a bit of freedom in Dicken's work. Many of Dicken's works are a bit dark and gloomy (including Oliver Twist), but this movie has changed it all. It was fun, colorful (both visually and musically), and the characters were more carefree. <br /> <br /> TRAVIS: I do not usually care about music and dance music, but the melodies in this production were catchy and vivid, and the choreography was amazing. <br /> <br /> ANNETTE: That really says a lot from Travis. I can not stress enough how good dance numbers really were. You could say, for example, that these boys really worked hard to bring the procedures to perfection. <br /> <br /> TRAVIS: The three actors really stood out for IMO; Nancy (Shani W.), Bill Sykes (Oliver Reed) and Artful Dodger (Jack Wild). Man, Oliver Reed can really do a good villain. This one scene in which you see his eyes through the post-slot, gave me shivers down ... AMAZING. And this kid Jack Wild was a great clever dodger. And Nancy was fantastic (man, I felt bad when she was killed). She can also sing! Recognition for the casting department for their election. I hated kid Oliver Twist. He was too stingy and skinny for my taste. (I still regretted that Bill Sikes would not throw him in the mud during the chase scene.) And they should not sing him. <br /> <br /> ANNETTE: Acting was really great. In addition to the three stars that Travis mentioned, I felt that Ron Moody (Fagin) did an amazing job. He was so funny and at the same time also slightly sinister. Supporting actors were also great. Harry Secombe did very well with the role of Mr. Bumble. And he has a wonderful voice of singing. I saw Mr. Secombe perform in another film called "Davy", where he played an opera singer with nice results. Talented Harry Secombe should be in a much larger number of films. <br /> <br /> TRAVIS: As I mentioned earlier, the story is not quite consistent with the book, but IMO was more solid. This movie was also not boring, as some musicals seem to be. And continuity kept you moving along with the characters. The songs did not diminish the story or make you sleep too long. <br /> <br /> ANNETTE: Every musical movie that Travis watches completely must be a rare find. And this is indeed a rare find. It is a very easy to watch production that moves the viewer smoothly and pleasantly to the end. On the day when all the films seem to be effects connected to pretty faces, it was a refreshing interlude. <br /> <br /> Our total score for this was 8.5 out of 10. (In this case, we will occupy 9th). <br /> <br /> TRAVIS: I rated this as 7 mainly because the kid of Oliver Twist (Mark L.) irritated me and his songs were tortures for my too sensitive ears. Otherwise it was a great movie. <br /> <br /> ANNETTE: My rating is 10. Movies are not much better. And you can say that everyone involved in this production really worked hard to make it a ... masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this ... even if you do not like musicals normally. It's really a rare feast.
