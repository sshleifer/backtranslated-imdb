Steven Spielberg (24 years old) has already directed two great episodes of the 1971 series "Psychiatrist" starring Roy Thinnes. One of the episodes concerned a 12-year-old boy with emotional problems and the other with a lively young man (Clu Gulager in the best performance) who dies of cancer. Both episodes were stunning, visually dissimilar to anything else on TV, as well as emotionally complex and adult. The creators of "The Psychiatrist" were Richard Levinson and William Link, who created "Columbo" and also produced their first season. <br /> <br /> Peter Falk insisted on the first place of experienced television directors in the first season of "Columbo", like Bernard Kowalski and Jack Smight. But Falk agreed with Spielberg after seeing part of Clu Gulagher's "Psychiatry" episode. <br /> <br /> Spielberg says on DVD "Duel" that he loved Steven Bochco's "Murder by the Book" (based on Levinson / Link history) and tried to make the production look like a million dollars, even if he had a lot less money to work. <br /> <br /> This episode of "Columbo" is far more stylish visually and makes better use of the soundtrack and background music than almost any other episode of "Columbo", although the series has always used the best directors. Spielberg manages to stop Big Falk and Cassidy from being too difficult, but both actors are still having fun. Spielberg also receives great supporting work from Martin Milner, Rosemary Forsyth and Barbara Colby. All performances have freshness and vitality about them. The only episode of "Columbo", which was close to completion, was the episode "By Dawn's Early Light" with Patrick McGoohan (directed by Harvey Hart). <br /> <br /> I think two episodes of "The Psychiatrist" and this episode "Columbo" suggest that Spielberg has not developed as technically as the director. He was wonderful from the very beginning. In "fight!" A DVD commentary on an episodic guest from 1962, in which Albert Salmi performed, Robert Altman says that the episode was almost as good as ever as a director. Maybe the same applies to Spielberg.
