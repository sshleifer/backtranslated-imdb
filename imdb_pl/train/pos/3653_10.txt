Why is a good actress like Elizabeth Berkley playing in this popular movie ??? !!! The cast gives good results (Elizabeth Berkley as a Barbie girl, Ele Keats as a girl without a mother and Justin Whalin, a guy eternally weakened by his troubles), but the direction is extremely boring, and the story is NOT so interesting and original. I can not believe that such a movie was produced on the big screen! Julie Corman (producer): are you CRAZY ??? !!!
