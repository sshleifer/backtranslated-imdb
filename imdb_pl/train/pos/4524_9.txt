This is a very rare example of a film about transvestism (heterosexual). The film treats the subject of taboos, so that even the general public, who does not know transvestism at all, will strongly sympathize with his main character. Adrian Pasdar is very credible as Gerald / Geraldine and will not forget about this brilliant acting. Directed by Christopher Mitter is very sensitive, treating such a difficult problem perfectly, packed into a good story. It is not a big movie, nor an "artistic" movie, but a small, beautiful movie!
