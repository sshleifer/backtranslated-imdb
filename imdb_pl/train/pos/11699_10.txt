I've seen this movie a dozen times and it's amazing. But the only thing was that at the beginning there was too much talking about who was leaving. I think it would be interesting to do a remake of this. But on the official website they said they would not be remaking because many people were saved while browsing. What happened to Patty Dunning now? She is a good actress. She made several other films in the '70s and' 80s, but since then we have not heard about her. I know for sure about Thom Rachford, who plays Jerry, works for Accounting at RD Films. But in general, I have to say that the series itself is like an old school on the left.
