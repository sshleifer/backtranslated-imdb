I am a huge fan of Simon Pegg and so far I have watched many of his films and none of them stopped making me laugh. Or how to lose friends and alienate people. <br /> <br /> This film is basically about a good man who annoys people. However, he has an inborn set of ethical principles that prevent him from doing things that would make him famous. But in the end, it ends them, the culture of life. <br /> <br /> The movie is well-toned with humor, romance, good acting and a little dance on your knees. This is one of those movies where you can be happy when it ends.
