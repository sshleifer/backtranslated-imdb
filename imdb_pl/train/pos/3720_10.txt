Joel schumacher He made a piece of choice when he decided on this cast and this scenario. The story is well written and well laid out, and this completely new cast of 10 or 12 main characters was absolutely brilliant. There seemed to be 6 "leads" and about half a dozen supports, and it's definitely the best thing in the movie, fresh faces of tomorrow. It's been a long time since Hollywood has touched on controversial Vietnam war films that say something for "history to be told" (as schumacher said) and Tigerland in a handful of the best war movies. However, it can not be called a war film because it seemed to be based more on the human spirit of Bozz and others. I think anyone who just wants to see a good movie without all the special effects, but just a good, rough drama, should see Tigerland, of course Shumachers Best works in the last 8 years.
