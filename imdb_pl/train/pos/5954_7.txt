I can feel a mix of confusion and a varied degree of personal taste in the reactions to this film. Yes, there are vampire stereotypes. Yes, there are scientific stereotypes here. Even stereotypes of martial arts. Everything is good and good, and certainly not everything. However, I sense that one key point regarding this film has been overlooked ... the cultural significance of its location. The film takes place in Pensacola, Florida and does not try to avoid it. It is a bold move in today's film world and a rare treat for indy film fans. And indeed, it may not be the last. Pensacola is known throughout the world as a navy city, a city of aviation, a city of timber, and sometimes even as a home for political controversy. It is rarely seen as a developing film city. But now everything is changing. There are more film companies. And more native pensacolians discover the power of cinema for themselves. This film is part of the growing trend of feature films based on Pensacola, and more are on the way. Pensacola makes a big noise in the global film community, and the world is paying more attention to it. Watch and listen, the world. Pensacolians are coming. Like a virus.
