I have to say that from the very beginning when I was watching a movie from Stargate, I was not shocked or anything but an average science fiction movie with a lot of potential, although the movie was not as great as other science fiction movies, such as Star Wars or aliens who, if you're a science fiction fanatic, admit that one of these two titles is amazing, even though I'm not a fan like some people, do not remember one line from one of these movies, I'm not a big fan of wearing shirts with star wars, in fact, if you saw me, I would look like an average person to you, which is somewhat detached from the subject, well, my point is you do not have to be a hardcore sci-fi fan to like this amazing series, which unfortunately ended after 10 amazing seasons without decreasing its quality, because it was approaching the end in 2006. <br /> <br /> Although I did not like the movie, I was very happy for the first season in 1997 and I will tell you that the special effects were just one of the effects of the incorrect things about the series, the chemistry between the characters just smashed me, they were so good, if not better than most of today's sci fi programs. I must admit that I would never go to Sci Fi, if it were not for the stargate, and my dad, who actually put me in sci fi when I was 6, and I'm glad he did it, other times I would not like to see the wonderful programs such as SG1, which in my opinion set the standards for almost all series of films and films, in principle if the new series is better or not as good as SG1, it is not worth watching. basically it's the best sci fi program so far, and if you do not see it, you have no idea what's missing!
