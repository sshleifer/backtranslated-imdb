When Gundam0079 became a movie trilogy, with which most of us are familiar, many of them were pure action and nothing else. This OVA is a bit opposite. Although there are only half a dozen episodes, it is not filled with action but emotional things. I think that the two main sequences of actions are enough to please me. After watching so many TV series, movies and OVA, I was completely ready for a movie with civil esquire. This movie did a great job. What distinguishes this film shows that both sides of the war have good and bad people. This made the Zeons seem more human than the original films on which they are portrayed as the second rise of the evil Nazis. Most people who do not like the anime I was forced to watch this movie (lol) liked. I recommend it to many people only for anti-war history. If you're a fan of Gundam and have not seen it, you should not read it; you should already watch it.
