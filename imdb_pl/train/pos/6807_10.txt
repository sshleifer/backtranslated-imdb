I have copies of both of these classic films, in which Robert Blake is a powerful, great actor in which most of Blake's 1967 film is more screened, standing by the window in prison, telling about his childhood where he was born, since he did not kill the Clutter family show a lot in the classics of what really happened, does not tell us which of them really killed, but it really catches the eye if you watch a cold-blood movie from 1996.
