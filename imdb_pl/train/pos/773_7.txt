I was expecting something else: more passion, drama ... Again another failed attempt at originality. I am sorry to say that the film falls into the old stereotypes of "cheesiness". 15-year-old teenagers can appreciate it. not very convincing and common lines, devoid of wit. Nevertheless, the soundtrack was good and well adapted. I can not say that this movie is a total flop because people are watching it, but it did not meet the expectations of the public and sunk in mediocrity. In conclusion, the production keeps you in front of the TV for almost an hour and a half, which is something you can feel. So, I think it's worth seeing if you're not nervous
