It's an excellent movie. The cast is a great mix of characters, and the story is decent. The film tells about a well-made doctor who steals bodies of dead brides and takes them home. When the bodies are in his home, he removes things (I hate to use such a general term, but I forgot what it meant) and puts them in a wife's place to preserve his youth. Then reporter Patricia Hunter investigates the situation and begins to find an answer to the question why the brides die. He travels to the doctors' home and interesting things begin. Definitely watch this old man, but if you can, that's good.
