Is it a good idea to use live animals to display department store windows? <br /> <br /> No, and here's why .... <br /> <br /> In "Hare Conditioned" the sale, which is Bugs Help in the promotion is over, and the store manager (Nelson) moves him to new department: taxidermy. Naturally, Bugs and fun are starting. <br /> <br /> using almost every department in the store (children's clothing, sports, shoes, costumes, women's shirts - do not ask). at every step, even referring to the manager as "The Great GilderSNEEZE". Even when trapped in the elevator, Bugs does the best. <br /> <br /> As usual, Jones is at the top of his picture game, as is Blanc (as Bugs, Natch) and Nelson (manager - who sounds like Gildersleeves as the basis of the radio - go and ask your grandparents). <br /> <br /> And wise advice: when confronted with a woman who looks fuzzy wants to try on bathroom slippers, always check her ears. <br /> <br /> Ten stars for "Hare Nutrition", the best argument for animal labor law.
