First of all, I liked this movie. Everyone did it well. <br /> <br /> However, I do not understand the comments I hear from people about the unexpected ending. I did not know anything about this film, except for a few "I see" recommendations, but I knew where the plot was under ten minutes. (I will not mention what touched me, not to spoil a good movie for others.) Still, although it seemed obvious, I was still watching. It was nice to see how everything takes place, filling out the details and motivations of characters in later scenes. <br /> <br /> I do not hate it when I guess the ending at the beginning of the movie. I hate it only when the road to resolution is lined with boring scenery. <br /> <br /> Persona character Will Smith is simply nice, even when playing such a restless character. He is energetic and credible in everything I've seen, how he does it. Seven pounds is another great performance. <br /> <br /> Rosario Dawson is a solid performer, presenting a bizarre, rather optimistic form despite a deadly heart condition. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and with Rosario, if you do not find her wonderful, you should think about replacing your eyes. <br /> <br /> It was nice to see Woody Harrelson back on the screen. I have not seen him lately, but it can be me. Woody did not have a lot of time on the screen, but he sold his merry, playing piano, blind figure for everything that was worth it. Perfectly. <br /> <br /> A brief study of the box jellyfish tells me that her venom is cardiotoxic, neurotoxic and dermatonecrotic. I think that this makes it a dubious choice for both pets and story. <br /> <br /> In general, I have to recommend this film not for the story, but for very good performances and for the fact that it has a tendency to evoke tragic emotions that we usually try to avoid.
