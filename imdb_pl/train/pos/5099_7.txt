The only reason I came across this movie was because it is on LITTLE MISS MARKER DVD and I recommend watching it, although you will not like the well-known movie. <br /> <br /> We have Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard as a cheater and his companion. The film begins quite brightly, but it becomes more dramatic when Coop plans to use his daughter to extort a lot of money from his brother-in-law, but after meeting the girl and seeing the discipline with which he will be subject to his brother -in-law decides to keep her. However, he has trouble staying on the straight and narrow path, so the drama is developing. <br /> <br /> Cooper and Lombard are good, and Shirley still manages to steal the scenes in which he is. There is not much music in it, and Shirley has only one song. However, it is fun and worth seeing along with LITTLE MISS MARKER.
