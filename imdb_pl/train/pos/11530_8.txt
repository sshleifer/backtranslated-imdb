A group of friends decide to go into the desert - and discover that they are persecuted and murdered by a mysterious killer in a black pick-up. "Mirage" is of course inspired by Spielberg's "Duel" and "The Hills Have Eyes" Still this torn yarn offers a lot of nasty violence and gore. The most important event of the film is a sequence involving a man who has an arm and leg tied to him around a tree, and then has dismembered limbs when the chain is pulled by a truck. there is also some uncertainty and exciting sequences of stems and cuts. Acting is pretty bad, and the script is quite weak, but the film is fast and shocking. BGSteers, who play the villain, is quite dangerous. desert places provide a bit of atmosphere, and the blood is quite strong. In general, if you like low-budget horror movies, give this look 8 by 10.
