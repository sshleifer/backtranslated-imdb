MAIN SPOILERS !! THIS IS FOR PEOPLE WHO VIEWED THE FILM !! <br /> <br /> Commentators raised the main topic of "honor" in the film and too many comparisons to "Braveheart". I will pay attention to a few things about this movie, for which I have not seen other comments: <br /> <br /> This film has a different approach to abortion. The first character who will become pregnant is a bad girl (Roth), and when she suggests coldly abortion, she says it's too late. The shame of her situation ("I have a bastard bastard") leads her to commit suicide on a much later stage. The second figure who became pregnant is Mary, Rob's wife, after the rape of the hero Roth (and at least one sex scene with her husband, Rob). At the end of the movie, when Rob leaves for the final confrontation with Roth, Mary asks what she should do with a pregnancy of dubious origin, with a tone suggestive of abortion. Rob responds with a noble tone: "It's not the child's fault," and then states what he thinks it should be the name of a girl or boy. I believe that this "pro-life" attitude of the hero is very non-Hollywood. Rob goes from the darkness of the house to the bright surroundings outside to make this comment - not a random symbolism. <br /> <br /> Another related topic is the character of Roth, a bastard, someone who apparently does not know who his father was and he has some nice words for his mother, although she carries her picture in a case that is hung around her neck. Is it a coincidence that Roth (deprived of family stability) is the walking definition of a psychopath while Rob is a strong figure of a husband / father and of course a hero. In the final sword fight between Rob and the villain (Roth), the first crosses the latter deep on the chest - the left side of the chest, above the heart. His employer and pseudo-father (character of John Hurt) holds the image of a mother in his hand and looks at him before he pulls him from the dead Roth's neck. <br /> <br /> Also interesting was the direction of the rape scene, which was not quite graphic, but it was not out of camera and suggested. I was surprised that in a sense this is a real presentation, and Mary convincingly shows the characteristics of someone who is undergoing a severe trial and later post-traumatic stress (as we call it now). My point is that rape was neither sensational nor simply suggested, which I think is an interesting middle way to Hollywood. <br /> <br /> In the final battle scene, I need to improve the earlier commentator: Roth's weapon has chosen a rapier (or maybe a short sword), a weapon Rob and Claymore chose. Somebody really did their homework on this stage. Roth would have an advantage in this situation, but of course Claymore is clearly Scottish. What's even more striking to me (as a swordsman and someone who has read a bit about this) is that this last sword fight is one of the most convincing movies in history: the actors seem to try to kill each other - not the usual blade cut the enemy we see in most of the film battles (including the fight to open the film). Even more faithful to history, Roth is seen several times using rapier as a pushing weapon, which is intentional from the point of view of the project! (Rapiers were framed, but most of all a pushing weapon with edges mainly used to steer the opponent's push.) Rob uses Claymore in wide cuts as he is going to design. The fight falls as I should - Roth wins successfully. Although Rob wins this day grabbing Roth's gun (more symbolism) and hitting him with a dead, powerful cut. <br /> <br /> People, it is RARE to see this level of historical accuracy in the fight against movie swords. br /> <br /> I will also notice that for whatever reason I remember the year 1995 (year of publication) clearly as a time of distrust of the US government. Hollywood was tuned to it, releasing both "Rob Roy" and "Braveheart", and I think that anti-government inclinations are the reason why both films are so compared. <br /> <br /> I think the other perspective that this movie gives is refreshing for avid movie fans, tired of the same old, not so hidden Hollywood news.
