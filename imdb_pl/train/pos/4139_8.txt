I really wonder how this concert plays in Britain and all over Europe. THIS IS A BECAUSE OF BEING American (especially white Americans). This can be a big reason why some venom and vitriol are expressed here. I love this show, but with some reservations and I think that Spoiler Spoiler did it in a simple way: <br /> <br /> Crash and burn everything at the end of the second season. Julie slammed the door, hoping to revive the show, unless her character landed on a haystack in the middle of some farm. Who knows? It was a funny, bawdy and barbarous show.
