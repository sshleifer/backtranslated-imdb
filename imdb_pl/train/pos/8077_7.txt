A film created for the contemporary public. The masses can see what they want to see. Action, comedy, drama and of course sensual scenes. This is not a movie that could be comfortably watched by the whole family. This is not for children's eyes. I had to quickly rewind many scenes. <br /> <br /> If it's just the entertainment you're looking for, this movie has it all. The songs are catchy. Sumptuous production, I have to add. <br /> <br /> However, the message of the film is not universal. He emphasizes the idea of ​​karma. This means that if you do well, you'll be fine. And if you do evil, you will receive evil. The fruit of good works is good, while the fruit of evil is bad. <br /> <br /> In real life this is not always the case. We know that most people do not have justice in this world. Although it is true that some bad people meet with a bad target, many escape. And then there are many people who are doing well and yet they face a sad end. <br /> <br /> If you do not care about the news, and all you want is to escape from reality, this movie is fine.
