I loved this movie. Without being a fan of Ed Wood Jr., I prefer to appreciate his "boundless enthusiasm" and admit his shortcomings. His films are fun, but his personal story is full of pain. I was hoping and delighted with the statement that this film would be about understanding his turbulent life rather than simply throwing it away with posthumous praise. From the beginning to the end, the film changes from a documentary into mythology, leaving the cast and viewer unexpectedly connected with each other and Ed Wood Jr. <br /> <br /> We get people who knew Ed Wood the best way to talk about him from all perspectives, positive and negative, and show us his character just like Ed. We get an insight into Ed's personal and professional life: from his affairs, his drinking, his sexuality, friends, enemies and even the creation of films. <br /> <br /> The film itself is shot in a low-budget fashion that seems to be made out of respect for Ed, as if using the techniques of most cinema-released 1996 films would be disrespectful (something like wearing a nicer suit than the President ). The production designer uses a sense of humor and a lot of insight, matching each cast member to his background. <br /> <br /> Fans will be excited to hear personal testimony about Ed Wood's controversy, and new players will be amazed that this man was real. The DVD is full of impossible to find gems ("Crossroads of Lorado" and photo gallery), but the real treasure of this movie is the surprisingly addictive and connected story. <br /> <br /> Ed Wood had the habit of defining people through their relationship with him (for better or worse), to the extent that one woman would go down in history as "Pool Owner", once allowing him and his friends to be baptized in her pool. This ability to define a person's legacy is common, because the most amazing effect of the film is not only to convey a well-understood idea for a man who was Ed Wood Jr., but also to present the overall picture of the community he created. Somehow, having no more interviews with one cast member on the screen, the combination that Ed Wood created among the various people in his life becomes clear and the viewer remains with a great sense of commitment. <br /> <br /> Even the title indicates the genre of B-list horror, but at the end we see that it is even kindness. What begins as unrelated stories of random people ends with the conclusion that the entire cast will be permanently woven into an unpredictably coherent fabric whose history will lead to a haunting unity with Wood's legend. <br /> <br /> A contradiction lives in many respects, Ed Wood Jr. it could not be condensed to one point of view. This joint effort is the closest thing we can get to know it. Being a compilation of topics, it is also full of respect, provocative, thoughtful, addictive, funny, sad, kind and fulfilling.
