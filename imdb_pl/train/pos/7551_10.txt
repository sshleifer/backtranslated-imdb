The best animated film ever made. This film explores not only the huge world of modern animation with absolutely amazing effects, but also the branches of the human mind, soul and philosophy. The story depicts a family of cats, where a younger brother dies in a big sister, sees it and saves her body, but when he wakes up, he is left without a soul. So two siblings cats set off on a journey to find him. I have taken this journey to many things. World history, the Bible, the cycle of life and every time I watch it, I discover more and more hidden topics and metaphors. If you are not in this physiological aspect, you will still adore it. The animation is great and the creative scenes will be attached to the screen. For example, freezing the ocean in time, god eating soup on the ground, a strange and somewhat SNM telling about Jasiek and Ma≈Çgosia. In summary, Cat Soup is an absolute feast for everyone. <br /> <br /> PS - Not for children, including unjustified violence.
