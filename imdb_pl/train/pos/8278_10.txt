If you want Scream or something like a big horror studio we're forced to, do not worry. This well-written movie helped me think about everything that he had to say. The importance of the myth in our lives that makes sense, how children interpret the world (and violence in it), our plundering of the environment and ignoring its history and legends .. all here, but not flat on the surface. You can technically call it a "movie of monsters", even if Wendigo does not take the physical form to the end, and then it depends on you and your beliefs about what happens to the legendary spirit / beast. Some standard elements of the thriller for those who are only looking for the basics, and the movie never gets boring, but in reality the less you see, the better. Fessenden successfully continues the tradition of George Romero to use this genre as a parable and as a discussion forum, while keeping us secret.
