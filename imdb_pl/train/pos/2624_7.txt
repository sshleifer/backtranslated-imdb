In this video, we have a great opportunity to see what happened to Timon and Pumba in the film when they are not shown - which is very much! This film even goes before Simba and (probably) just after the birth of Kiara. <br /> <br /> Completely consistent with the first movie "Lion King 1/2 (or Lion King 3 in other places)" is a fun, funny, exciting and surprising movie (or sequel, if you want to name it). A package of surprises and merry is waiting for you! <br /> <br /> While Timon and Pumbaa are watching a movie at the cinema (using a remote control), Timon and Pumbaa have an argument about which point "The Lion King" will start to observe, because Timon wants to go to the part when he and Pumbaa they come and Pumba wants to get back to the beginning. They have a very honest compromise watching a movie from their own story, and that's what's waiting ... It starts with Timon's first home ... <br /> <br /> For everyone with a good sense of humor who liked the first films in almost all ages, enjoy "Lion King 1/2"! :-)
