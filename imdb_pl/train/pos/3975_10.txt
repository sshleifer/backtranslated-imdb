If you survived the 1960s, this movie can sometimes be painful, and sometimes quite joyful. It's all there, but a small print in the tabloids for culture that were important at the time. These are the roots of the social revolution that is still taking place: "do not talk too early, that the circle is still spinning, because times are changing." While the film focuses on the revolutionary nature of LSD and its dissemination at that time, it has only played a huge hand in the evolution of intelligence, affecting engineers, scientists and helping in the hyper-development of computer-related activities. Regards, the filmmakers from the one who was there - you have captured this era better than before.
