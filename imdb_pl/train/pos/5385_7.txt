I never watched the "Next Action Hero" program, and to read other comments here, I did not know that this movie is a "prize" from this competition. I was just flipping through the canals and came across this, and saw that I was watching, boldly, until the end. <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot was made (The Most Dangerous Game etc.), But I was hoping and almost got the "gotcha" - how the hero had to finally defeat the hunter. I think that high-tech was exaggerated (GPS) and gave me cold sweats from Night Rider, but still it was not too exaggerated. <br /> <br /> The basic problem I had with this movie was the degree of Suspension of Disbelief, which was required from the viewer. Do we really think that someone flying a helicopter could lobby with countless grenades igniting on a public bridge, and NO COPSY do not appear to investigate? Can a limousine make countless donuts at the intersection in Las Vegas and COPS does not appear? Pleeease. Too much of this type of thing - it's nice to watch, but keep it at least credible, thank you very much. <br /> <br /> The final solution was good, but the ending was disappointing, after the aftertaste of the bad episode of Star Trek. At least now, I understand why acting was so tacky - with the exception of Zane, who does not get as much work as he deserves from IMHO - they were the reality show winners. <br /> <br /> Release me.
