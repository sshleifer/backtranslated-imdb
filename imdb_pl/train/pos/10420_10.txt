Grand Caruso presents the unique talents of Mario Lanza. He shows great acting ability and is in top form as a lyrical singer, in combination with Dorothy Kirsten, the soprano Metropolitan Opera. Indeed, I dare say that he performs a few songs better than Caruso (check out A'Vuchella from Tosti and La Danza from Rossini). MGM's art and music departments have also done a good job. This film could be perfect, if not the uncomfortable presence of Ann Blyth; we see that she is trying her best, dressed in the style of the fifties in the scene just before 1920 - unforgivable. Lanza deserved a better lady, and Blyth should stick to less demanding productions. Also note that Ms. Kirsten sings most of the opera duels of the movie with Lanza, giving the mistaken belief that Caruso had a sort of permanent leading soprano.
