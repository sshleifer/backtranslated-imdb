Todd Rohal is a crazy genius. "Knuckleface Jones", his third, most fully realized, short film has an unusual sense of humor and leaves a few scratching heads. What's going on in the movie, and he almost certainly would not agree with me, is how an ordinary Joe finds the confidence to go through life with a bit of inspiration. Or not. You must convince yourself. There is a short round interruption on the festival circuit, so keep your eyes wide open and catch them if you can - you'll be glad you did. That's funny. Check out Todd's other short films appearing here and there from time to time: "Single Spaced" and "Slug 660".
