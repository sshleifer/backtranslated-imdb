I see many people on this site who want AG to appear on DVD. I bought it on DVD. (With Borders, no less!) Although it's great to have this great performance in a boxed DVD, I'm nervous about the fact that they have added very little in the form of "extra" (director Shaun Cassidy's commentary on the Pilot Episode) and episodes are shown in this the same order in which they were released on television. Missing episodes that have never been shown before launching on the Sci Fi channel are included in the boxset, but are included on the last DVD. If you buy a DVD set, get the actual order in which you want to be watched and you will be happier. (You will have to replace the DVDs in the player to see them in order, but you'll be glad you did it.) <br /> <br /> S
