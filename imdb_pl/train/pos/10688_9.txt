I really did not know what to expect when I watched the film, in addition to the somewhat surreal, basic story that a lonely man is ordering a Russian bride over the Internet. This and that was Nicole Kidman. I really liked this movie and came out thinking "wow". <br /> <br /> Refreshingly to the ground, the movie moves nicely, with a few surprises on each corner. The relationship in the film is trustworthy, and Nicole and Chaplin work together beautifully. Humor is subtle, with some great scenes similar to "Office" in the bank, and the thriller element adds tensions without being Hollywood. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is about real people in an extraordinary situation. Less is about heroism, and more about delicate relationships. British film at its best ... <br /> <br /> (9/10)
