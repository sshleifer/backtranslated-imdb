It all starts with a series of thefts of seemingly unrelated objects in the student hostel on Hickory Road in London. Out of concern for her sister, who is a housewife, Miss Lemon asks Hercule Poirot to look into the matter. That's right, but soon the rate increases when a murdered girl is found, who admits that she is responsible for most (not all) thefts. <br /> <br /> "Hickory Dickory Dock" is a solid exercise of the brain, not being as complicated mentally as "One, two, fasten my shoes." Murders, theft and smuggling of diamonds are crimes, and the last change, which unites everything together, only reveals itself in the last two minutes! The heroes are interesting, especially the psychology student Colin McNabb and the mysterious American girl Sally Finch, Inspector Japp has her funny moments (perhaps the closest series has gone to "toilet humor"), and Miss Lemon becomes a more integral part of the story than usual.
