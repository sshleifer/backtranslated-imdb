2 WORDS: Academy Award. Nuff said. This movie had everything in it. A comedy to make me laugh, Drama, to cry and one of the biggest dance scenes to compete with Breakin 2: Electric Boogaloo. Acting was the pinnacle of every independent film. Jeremy Earl has been in great shape for a long time seen since his visit to the Joan Cusack Show. His lines were made with dynamic precision and a lively joke last seen in the very young Jimmy Walker. I thought I saw another appearance of young Denzel Washington, when the line "My bus !! It's ... Gone. "It was the real turning point of the movie. My grandma loved it so much that I bought her a DVD and instructed her friends. It will bring tears to your eyes and warmth to your heart when you see white Tony Donato and African American Nathan Davis. Through thick (kept at the point knife) and thin (Nathan gives Tony tips on women) appeared a new dynamic duo that conquers Hollywood.
