"The Luzhin Defense" is a good movie with great central performances, but too many novels and its creativity is not enough. For most of the movie, we felt that the characters simply helped push the narrative. Marlene Gorris might have investigated Luzhin's psyche instead of presenting him as a tortured innocent victim torn by the cruel motives of others. <br /> <br /> Adaptation of literature to the screen is undoubtedly a difficult task, especially a novel written at the beginning of the 20th century. This film does not penetrate deeply enough into the relationship between Luzhin and Natalia. Natalia's slit with her mother rather meets her mother's bizarre opposition than the dramatic flash point in the film. I felt that I had lived through Luzhina's torment and finally the tragic end, not giving me the pleasure of having an extraordinary and complex personality. However, it was a moving and enjoyable movie, but certainly not great.
