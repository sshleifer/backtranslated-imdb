I just watched the movie and fell in love with it. Everyone will find something for themselves and is especially free for everyone when it comes to romance between Lachlan and Lil. When they are on the beach, I almost cried ... there is an unspoken awareness that time is the most precious commodity and is most visible when they are together. This idea was taken from several points of view, from marriage to siblings, to finding love in the least conventional places. The film almost makes you miss this kind of desperation when you know that tomorrow may well be your last. Crowe was especially great in the role of Lachlan. I always had a weakness for the accent, but I almost melted with his presentation of his character. The way the film was made is also beautiful, with music, open fields and great acting. All this together is a great movie that touches all human emotions.
