this movie was one of the best Disney movies I've ever seen. great for the whole family. Ideas can be a bit far-fetched, but it's a good comedy, and acting is great. I love a little boy, j.p. and some of the Adrien Brody Academy Award winner could have been very short but very memorable. highly recommended.
