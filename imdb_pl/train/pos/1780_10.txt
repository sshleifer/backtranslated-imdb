My mother and I were on our way home from a trip to the northeast (mainly Massachusetts) when we decided to take a small detour to the Boston film festival. Now I do not know much about the film, so I thought it could be a little bit educational. The first movie we saw was this movie, THE ROMEO DIVISION. Now I do not know about you, but I thought it was great! I am from Texas and where I come from, we do not see too many films, so it was a nice surprise. My mother insisted that it was too violent, but she said I do not know much about what he says, but it was a great picture. I was shocked by the combat sequences that were great. Besides, I'm a big fan when good guys win, so I was excited when Mr. Romeo killed all the bad guys. It was a real glow. I'm not sure when it will be released on video, but if you have a chance, you should check it out. I think you will be pleasantly surprised. However, the word wise is rather violent and many words, so you may not want your children to look. It's more for adults.
