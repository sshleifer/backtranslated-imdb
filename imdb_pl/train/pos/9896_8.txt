For several months I wanted to see this move. I was really surprised how good it was. <br /> <br /> The action takes place around a group of teenagers from high school who intimidate a boy named Marta. They keep harassing him until one of them makes a terrible mistake that leaves Marty awfully burnt. <br /> <br /> A few years later, a group of reckless teenagers are invited back to their own high school, which is now abandoned at the party. Nevertheless, none of the reckless teenagers organized this event. <br /> <br /> Later in the film, teenagers start to die in the most macabre way. I can certainly tell you that they are also damned. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie you will learn that it was a dream and nothing happened. But Marty is in the hospital with severe burns. Although the murders did not take place, burns and pranks apparently happened. <br /> <br /> Acting is horrible, but that's good. <br /> <br /> I love this story. I really sympathize with Marta. It's like Tamara (2005). The persecutors finally get what happens to them, and you feel satisfied that the victim gets their sweet revenge. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend anyone who approaches this, if you are looking for cutting 80s. /> <br /> I give this film 8 stars out of 10. Good cheesy slasher!
