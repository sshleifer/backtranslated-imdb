Sitting on the porch of a Burbank home, Ted Mapes told me that he and Reed Hadley wore exactly the same size in every garment except the hat. <br /> <br /> Ted, one of the biggest stuntmen, said that every time Zorro put on a mask, he was the one who was on the screen. <br /> <br /> It was a bit of an exaggeration: there were times when Zorro was of course Reed Hadley, but in acrobatics we can be pleased that he was Ted at work. <br /> <br /> And what tricks! "Zorro's Fighting Legion" is, as you can see here, one of the largest series. It is exciting and generally very well made. <br /> <br /> Reed Hadley was a great actor and, as someone else commented, he made a very good fop. <br /> <br /> But, admittedly, this action makes this movie so great. <br /> <br /> And what else can we expect, with the direction of this great band, Witney and the Englishman, with great music from incredibly prolific William Lawa (the list here says he was unchallenged, but it's not true, these others the composers listed here were actually unmentioned, and I do not know if they wrote any music - it sounds like Lava), and with the meanness of, among others, the great Charles King and dozens of songs? <br /> <br /> Also noteworthy is the villain played by Tarzan's radio, Jim Pierce, who was the son-in-law of Edgar Rice Burroughs. (I insist you read his mini-bio.) There's one chapter that depresses everything, but hell, it's only a few minutes (maybe 20) and when you get through it, well, you come back to excitement. <br /> <br /> Turner Classic Movies deserves a big THANK YOU for presenting this amazing series and we should ask TCM for more. <br /> <br /> And we should thank all those involved that we will see it as a chapter or series game, not as a re-cutting function.
