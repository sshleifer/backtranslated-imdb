The film has a great story written in the genre. It contains all the usual ingredients of Columbo; The way in which Lieutenant Columbo approaches and relates to his suspect, the way in which the mystery has been solved for him, the dog Columbo, plays the cat and mouse, which is great in this and, fortunately, a good soothing humor, mainly involving characters Columbo. This is all written despite the fact that there is not even a truly original concept. Hunting Columbo on the writer of detective / murder novels has been done more than once in the film Columbo. <br /> <br /> It is also an extremely well-directed movie by James Frawley, who after that he directed five more Columbo films in the '70s and' 80s. He provided the film with style and really great and unforgettable sequences. <br /> <br /> This is one of the slower moving Columbo movies, even though it does not have a long working time. This style and approach does not always work well with Columbo, but this is what's happening in this movie, which may not be possible with movie performances. <br /> <br /> Most of the films Columbo also played a large celebrity or star from the beginning of filming as a killer movie. The film features an unknown 81-year-old Ruth Gordon. In her career, she has not played in many films, but is still well known to some, mainly for her role in "Rosemary's Baby", which also won her Oscar. It had a realistic and somewhat unusual style of play that some people may not like. In her career, she won four more Oscar nominations in her career, before winning the "Rosemary's Baby" in 1969. He also has great interactions with Peter Falk in his sequences. <br /> <br /> The film also stars still young GD Spradlin. I am talking young, because I know him only from his latest productions from his career, even though he was 57 years old during this Columbo production. He still lives, but since 1999 he left the game. <br /> <br /> Even better than usual Columbo movie. <br /> <br /> 8/10
