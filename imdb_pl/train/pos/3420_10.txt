This film is an obligatory movie for everyone. Congress should see this truthful document from the soldier's point of view, just like everyone in America. The previous reviewer completely ignored this point - it is about revealing the truth about teaching our soldiers to kill people who are NOT terrorists, but who simply live in our "hostile" territory and what soldiers do. We must support our troops IMMEDIATELY by bringing them home, before another person is killed or wounded. It also shows that the government does not help veterans who have suffered mental trauma, with post-traumatic or physical stress disorder with lost limbs. Julie A. Roberts, Streamwood, IL
