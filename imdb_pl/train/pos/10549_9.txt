I just saw it at the Toronto Film Festival and I hope it will be released on a large scale because I want to see it again! It's a movie based on characters, and Andrew and David have more than a task. Any discussion of the plot may be considered spoilers, so let me just say that the story is clever, the acting is great and the effects are amazing. Well filmed and well-walking. One of the best films I have seen for centuries, and very refreshing films that were still refreshing during this time <br /> <br />. The audience laughed all the time. See if you can. (I particularly liked the "Candy bar! Candy bar!" Scene)
