Dick Tracy is one of my favorite movies. I must admit to those who have not seen it. You will really like it or you really hate it. It was a year after Batman's success. So everyone's expectations were so high that many were disappointed just because the plot is so simple. But it's based on a comic book ... what did you expect? Creative, this movie is amazing! Scenes, makeup, music, costumes and impressive acting make this movie fantastic. The film has bloodless violence and no evil language - it is a rarity today. Direction, production and stars of Warren Beatty as an ace warrior who will face the evil Big Boy Caprice Al Pacino and his bandit crowd. Madonna steals the show as seductive Breathless Mahoney. She's one of the best characters Madonna ever played. He has the best liners I've ever heard! Madonna fans would be delighted! One of the coolest things in the movie is that they used only seven colors to make it look like a comic. This film is really a work of art, which is unfortunately overlooked by the public. In conclusion, this movie shows the child in each of us. It's a movie that will make you smile at the end.
