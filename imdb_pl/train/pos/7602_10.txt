The first season was amazing, the whole idea of ​​adapting to the island, while the secrets were examined (and seen) was phenomenal; full of tension, lots of cliffs and an amazing plot. I mean, I love the whole idea to see how they get used to the island. And then first I saw the smoke monster in the first episode really caught my attention. From that time I was addicted. The second season was on par with the first season, only a little better. I loved the idea of ​​manhole and DHARMA initiative. The entire story and sequences of season 2 were mysterious, frightening and exciting. I loved all the tension around the island, but DHARMA's story really made Season 2 amazing. <br /> <br /> Season 3 was not as good as 1 and 2 ... but still great. I loved watching the stories of others, seeing their camp and watching more secrets. ("Tricia Tanak Is Dead" is one of my favorite episodes). This season, although not so good, was still breathtaking and was fun, but above all exciting! Now the fourth season. I was hoping for this season and the first few episodes in which we are good, but then it REALLY began to be boring and monotonous. I mean, I REALLY despise new "lifeguards" like Miles and Daniel. The story got old after the first few episodes ... and MOST OF ALL .... Season 4 was deprived of something that made LOST a perfect series: Mystery, tension, comedy mixed up (Charlie disappeared) and general emotions. Besides, some of my favorite characters have gone.
