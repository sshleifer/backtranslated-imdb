Another entry in the "holiday horror" category that fills the shelves of the local video store. Spoiler * "a nerdy teenager who has been harmed avenges on" cool "children who hurt him" of course he will be known to everyone who has seen him before. And those who have seen it before will probably be watching it again; those who expect Ingmar Bergman, and then indignant at wasting time, should simply omit it. Marilyn Manson on the soundtrack and David Boreanaz, Denise Richards and Katherine Heigl as eye candy - go with the flow and enjoy it. Oh, and I loved the terrible mask.
