Plato's run is a fun movie with Gary Busey.it is quite an unknown movie, so I saw him on the trunk of the car. I thought it looked funny. I was right. Gary Busey plays Platoon smith, a tough mercenary who has been framed in the attempt of the powerful ruler of the Cuban crime now in the run, Plato must survive long enough to prove his innocence with his friends Steve Bauer (scarface) and action star Jeff Speaksman ( expert). what I liked about Plato's run is the way the movie never gets boring, the story could have been done before, but it was still good that acting was fun to watch, and the action was pretty cool, and especially the culmination of Gary Busey makes that the good hero is ironic because he normally plays the wrong guy, and Steve Bauer is good because Plato's midfielder, even Jeff Speaksman, makes a good performance and can not even play well to finish the Plato race, it's a nice effort from the movies image and I give it 7 out of 10
