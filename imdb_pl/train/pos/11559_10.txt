The Odd Couple is a comic gem. One of the funniest scripts ever written about celluloid - exceeded only by Strangelove, Spinal Tap and Lebowski! Lemmon and Matthau are the best friends: obsessive compulsive Felix and the scruffy, irresponsible Oscar. Oscar's wife has already left him because it is impossible to live because of an irresponsible attitude. Felix's wife leaves him at the beginning of the film and, after the interrupted suicide attempt, introduces himself to the poker with his friend Oscar. That's when the fun begins. <br /> <br /> The whole script is brilliant and filled with brilliant lines. You probably already know the "F.U." joke, but it still works great thanks to the comical sense of Matthau. <br /> <br /> My favorite moments are the moment when Lemmon tries to clear the bay in the diner, and when the Pigeon sisters are charmed by a very kind Matthau and Lemmon is completely out of his element. This requires repeated reviews!
