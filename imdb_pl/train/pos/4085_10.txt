If you were born at the time the movie was finished and you had a liberal / open-minded household that I had, I'm sure that at the beginning of the 80's you would first get to know parents watching dirty movies or extremely dirty movies. You know, not a 100% pornographic, but rather an alchemical mix of real drama and pornography, or that you would sneak into their collection and put in a plastic rectangle such a film in a large typographic machine called VHS. You had to be very quiet, and the ninja like it, but still have a small heart failure when you heard huge pop sounds, pressing the buttons reminiscent of the tablet for fear of being discovered. Whatever the case, these movies were sent deep into your mind, waiting and waiting for a re-connection with such visual "art". Needless to say, this movie fits the mentioned description to "T". Many people will comment on the extreme sexual nature of the film, but perhaps due to desensitization I am more concerned about the subtleties. Did the creator speak to us at the deeper levels of human corporeality and what could be considered a real abomination, interracial relations, masturbation in bed, peeping, or it could be a desperation for social status to the point of murder, pedophilia / homosexuality, or suppressed sexual the nature of social elite women in the eighteenth-century France? Who can say, but despite Mr. Borowcyzk's liking for a live, raw sexuality that is "the norm" for his works, I would say that indeed this film tells the viewer at a deeper level about the bestial carnality. Once I've found out, the story has become a lot more interesting than dizziness and that's why it's worth checking.
