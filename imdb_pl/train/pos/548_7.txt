This movie was just as good as some other Westerns by Anthony Mann and James Stewart, such as Winchester '73 and The Naked Spur, and much better than Thunder Bay and Bend Of The River. This film begins like a western mill, but it becomes more and more complex. It starts with the arrival of Jimmy Stewart and Walter Brennan to Seattle, and Stewart was accused of murder. He was declared innocent, but cattle were stolen by a corrupt judge. Stewart then agrees to lead something, but I forget what it is, but Stewart only cares about getting her cattle back. When the film goes together, Stewart cares only for himself, like his character in Naked Spur. In the middle of the road it gets much better after arriving in Alaska. This is one of Stewart's better westerns.
