World Dragon Hunters is a world with the challenge of 3D gravity. Asteroids, fragments of buildings and strange flat plants float in the atmosphere, while you can not see the ground in the direction of most characters anywhere. It is a world reminiscent of a never-ending story when Nothing came to devour the world. <br /> <br /> Pretty funny, villain is also a World Gobber here. This time it is a huge skeleton dragon with fiery eyes. The heroes are a great but taciturn warrior, an annoying and greedy helper who manages the entrepreneurial side of the duo and a strange useless animal. The most talkative little girl in the world will join them, which to my disappointment has not died a terrible pain and hopefully an early death. <br /> <br /> Animation is great. Voices and sounds are at the highest level. It is a pity that history is as simple as one can imagine. They want to stop the World Gobbler, they reach it almost immediately, defeat him. End. No real character development or twists. Even those I would not expect after a movie with such a story. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: this is a nice thing to watch, children would probably like it, but that's all. No depth of this world (pun intended).
