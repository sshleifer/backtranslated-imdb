As part of our late 50s vocabulary, we knew Ponderosa, Little Joe, Hoss, Ben Cartwright, etc. in this great show "Bonanza." <br /> <br /> It was Saturday evening and everyone was glued to the TV. It was a real show showing family values. There may have been a weekly crisis, but it was a strong family atmosphere that attracted everyone. <br/> <br /> Lorne Greene dominated as a patriarch of the family. His words were wisdom. We have often wondered that Ben Cartwright, a widower, must have been the best husband for this poor wife of his deceased. He brought up wonderful sons. <br /> <br /> Of course, everyone was wondering why Pernell Roberts left the show. The show was a gold mine and Roberts gave a lot of money when he left. His career never began because he was bound as Cartwright's son. He should have tried to come back to the series. He must have lost his bonanza by throwing himself.
