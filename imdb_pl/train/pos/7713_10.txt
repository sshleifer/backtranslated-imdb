Today sci-fi thrillers are more similar to Rambo in space with monstrous special effects (often absurd, like the sounds of an explosion in the vacuum of the cosmos). Though accustomed to today's standards, the "Forbidden Planet" special effects have been quite striking in their times. Even today, they are still credible. However, the best part of the movie can be the reason why radio thrillers still have an appeal. Much of what was happening was left to the audience's imagination. (What did Krell's creatures look like?) Because most of the story was never revealed or revealed in the end, the tension and tension continued throughout the movie. The ending was also very provocative and satisfying. In my opinion, this is still one of the best (if not the best) science fiction movies ever made.
