Personally, I was interested in this film. When I was 17 and just finished high school, I got a job at 20th Century Fox as a member of Laborers and Hod Carriers Union. At the end of the first day (sweeping the aircraft carrier deck) I was told to bring a suitcase the next morning with enough clothes, etc. For one or two weeks. When I arrived the next morning, the bus was waiting and about 20 of us managed to head south towards San Diego. Soon there we stopped at a military base called Camp Callan or Camp Hahn. After we were let down, we headed north a few miles to Camp Pendleton, a large naval base. There, on the beach, we started to build a base that was supposed to be the Japanese island of the Pacific. It took us about a week or ten days to complete the installation, including a water tank, trenches for weapons, trenches with sandbags and living quarters. All this took place at very high wages, sometimes "golden time", which was a triple our regular hourly rate. Our food was also the first rate = ribs at lunch, etc. - which was amazing because it was during the war and it was very difficult to get good meat at home. <br /> <br /> When the work was finished, I waited impatiently for a movie that was about to be released about eight or ten months later. Then I waited impatiently for two hours of film before my work finally appeared on the screen. Then, no more than three or four minutes (maybe fewer) of the film's heroes dived bombing the base and blowing it into small pieces. A bit disappointing, but still fun. <br /> <br /> Despite the disappointment, I liked the movie and have not seen it since. I learned later that this film was guaranteed by the government, and Fox was paid on a plus cost basis, which may be the reason for our extravagant pay and lifestyle. Bob Weverka
