This frightening little film, although not a horror in the traditional sense, provides goods. It seems that the vampire is loose in a small German city, draining the victims of their blood. Police inspector Karl Brettschneider, Melvyn Douglas in one of his early roles, is skeptical, believing that a mad killer, not a vampire, is an amok. The only person who believes in him is Ruth Bertin (Faye Wray), the girl inspector and laboratory assistant Dr. Otto von Niemann (Lionel Atwill), who apparently is an outstanding scientist goes hand in hand with the theory of vampires. Residents of the city suspect the freak of Herman Gleib, playing with his usual folly Dwight Frye, who seems to have a good time with his role. The film contains a lot of humor, which helps to alleviate the intensity of all murders. One of the fun things is Gussie Schnappmann (Maude Eburne), Aunt Ruth Bertin, thinking that Herman did not turn into a bat, but a dog. Maude Eburne and Dwight Frye form a good comedy band. <br /> <br /> This budget budget contains elements from the "Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" with Dr. Niemann, using the power of suggestion, that the somnambulist would execute his orders from "Frankenstein" by using human blood to help create life in the laboratory, and " Dracula "from murders are considered by all except the inspector and his girlfriend for the work of the bloodsucker. These elements are well mixed up by director Frank R. Strayer with a small comedy thrown in for good. The mixture works. The restored version, which I watched, used dyeing to increase the ghostly atmosphere. So try to see this version if possible.
