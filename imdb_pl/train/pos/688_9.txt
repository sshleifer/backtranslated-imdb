I had the pleasure of watching this film at the Rhode Island International Film Festival and I was impressed. Tess Nanavati is undoubtedly a great screenwriter and I would love to see more of her films. If she could do what she did with the budget of the movie, I care very much about what she can do with the big picture. Recognition for the cast for their great performances (this little girl was gold) and for everyone who composed the music. Perverted "Row Your Boat" blew me up. Very creative movie all around .... I hope to see it on video or DVD, because I will buy it in a moment. If you have a chance, you should definitely see this movie.
