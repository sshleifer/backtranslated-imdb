John Waters has given us a really nice movie. Certainly, it was not without the shocking moments of Waters-esque, but it is more subdued than its older items, such as "Pink Flamingoes". "Pecker" returns to the early stage of mainstream John, because it reminds the viewer the same kind of humor that was visible in "Polyester". Overall, a really funny comedy with some great moments!
