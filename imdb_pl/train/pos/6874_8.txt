A series of vignettes, most of them impersonate television in the '70s, but also with several copies in government and corporate America. One of the longest segments, "The Dealers", is not too funny for me and I do not know what a parody is. Some of them, however, are completely separated. I especially like the segment of cooking shows. Most of the bad words that I know are used in the movie, and if you are opposed to full nudity on the front, stay away.
