This movie is so good! Despite Carmen Electra, it must be one of the better movies I've seen in a while. Jamie Kennedy is simply amazing, and Loren Dean plays a crazy broken movie star. The plot is also great. This is all very real, which is terrifying. He says it's a drama here, but it's one of the funniest dramas I've ever seen. Go check it out.
