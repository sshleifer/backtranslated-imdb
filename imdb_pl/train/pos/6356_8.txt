I thought Christmas at Grinch Stole is a pretty good movie. It was not terrible, nor was it great, but watching was pleasant. I felt like Jim Carrey was a little nervous. a person with special education, when everything he needed was bad and cunning, but nevertheless proved somewhat delayed. I thought the scenery, when it was not in Grinch's cave, was beautiful, and there were a few parts where I laughed, but most of the time I thought it was just annoying. This movie could have been "SO" much better if it changed Grinch's personality, and included a few more laughter scenes, because most of the humor was not fun. Anyway, I liked How The Grinch Stole Christmas, but it's nothing exciting.
