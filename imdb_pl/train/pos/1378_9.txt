I saw this little Belgian gem two days after watching American Teen. Do not be wrong, growing up is a roller coaster, be it American or European. "Naissance des Pieuvres" (or as it is called in USA "Water Lillies") is a story about a young 15-year-old girl (played by Pauline Acquart, who sometimes resembles a young Scarlett Johansson) behaves cool, withdrawn girl who wants to be in the school swimming team to be close to another attractive girl (Adele Haenel). It is more than obvious that Marie is more than interested in Floriane. Between all this is quite chubby, unattractive friend Anne, Anne, who just wants to have a boy like any other girl her age. Along the way, we show an ordinary set of entertainment for teenagers (broken hearts, raising shops, using alcohol and / or drugs, casual sex, etc.). It's a quiet, small movie that takes time to go to your system (fans of Michael Bay, notice: the pace is here s-l-o-in, so avoid), but if you do not have a problem with it, Water Lillies is a wizard. No rating here, but hard "R", because of language, nudity, and adult situations.
