It is difficult to put a finger on it. Basically, I suppose it's a comedy about a lazy wealthy drunk who falls in love with a (relatively) poor girl he wants to marry, risking his family's renunciation. <br /> <br /> Has fun moments, romantic moments and moving moments. Dudley Moore is funny and somehow makes his egocentric character captivating, Liza Minelli is a convincing foil because of his pugnacious opposition that attracts, but John Gielgud steals the show as the wonderfully sarcastic butler Arthur. <br /> <br /> It is trivial but great fun with an unforgettable soundtrack and lasted almost 3 months in our local fleet.
