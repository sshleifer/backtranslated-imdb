I can be one of the few who really stick to this movie. I also saw this movie when it appeared, and I agree with the last post that Up The Acedemy has overtaken its time. Humor in the film itself is a pure MAD magazine. I do not understand why MAD stands behind this function. It was also one of the few films from the early 80's, in which the killer accompanied the soundtrack with punk and new wave bands, which then appeared in L.A. I am the owner of the soundtrack and I play it constantly to this day. What can I say? There are definitely the worst movies there. I do not think Porky is as much fun as Up The Academy, there are some really good laughs in the movie, and the jokes are based on stereotypes or on how to put together. Hey, nobody said it would be the Maltese Falcon.
