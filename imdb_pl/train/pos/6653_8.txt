Putting aside all political views, "Gandhi, my father" Feroz Khan and Anil Kapoor is a good film that cleverly investigates the lost side of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi's family and the struggle of his eldest son Harilal Gandhi with society, his father bigger than life, and most importantly demons in his head. One presents analogies to Gandhi, the father of the nation and the struggle that every son can have with father. <br /> <br /> Acting is good. Shefali Shetty, Darshan Zariwala and Akshaye Khanna - strictly in this order - add color and pathos to this thrilling heart of the Harilalu story, which cries to be hugged only once, and also escapes with the weakest touch of the finger. <br /> <br /> Feroza Khan's direction and production canvas are rich and attractive, but the scenario could have been more tense. I saw this play a few years ago on a pirate video type DVD (I think it was Mahatama vs. Gandhi) and it was certainly more thrilling. Although the background of the film and the moments of the father-son and mother-son are simply a great feast. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been great. It borders on this. The potential is so huge that it can only be a difference between the history of father and son or Gandhi, and even both. somewhere, the story is lost and when you expect an absolute personalization of emotions, nothing comes to you. <br /> <br /> Compares decently with other Gandhi. This is certainly not a review film, like Gandhi Kingsley, or abstract, like Hey Ram Kamal Hassan. The film almost manages to find its base; However, it remains to wonder "what if ..." 7.5 / 10
