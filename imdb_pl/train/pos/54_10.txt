Home Room deals with shooting in a Columbine-style high school, but instead of wondering about the event itself, the film presents the consequences and events that met the survivors, their trauma, guilt and denial. <br /> <br /> * Spoilers * The shooting itself is treated as a settled conclusion, without recording action other than the reaction of an almost teenage SWAT commando after shooting a high school killer. The film has three heroes; a detective investigating a crime that was not guilty and two teenagers who survived the incident, played by very young Erika Christensen and Busy Philipps. <br /> <br /> Two girls have nothing to do with each other, apart from that, photos and drama are created. <br /> <br /> Erika Christensen, although only 24 were so close that film viewers quite well know her solid and reliable style of play. Busy Philipps, three years older than Christensen and completely unknown to me, blew me up because of her overwhelming dramatic strength and presence on the screen. This girl was this part. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie and connects to you, focusing on the delicate but growing relationship between two traumatic girls. Gus van Sant's Elephant (2003), though good, seems almost superficial and miserable compared to the Home Room when it comes to dramatic talent and acting. What I see in this film has very little time on screen and exposure - much more loss for an equally traumatized America. <br /> <br /> Ten out of ten
