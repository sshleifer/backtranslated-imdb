This may be the second best PPV WWE of the year after Wrestlemania, it was a good surprise! John Cena had an excellent match in which he annoyed Chris Jericho. Jeff Hardy maintained his IC title in a short careless match against Willam Regal. Bubba and Spike Dudley have won quite a brutal match at the Benoit and Guerrero tables. Jamie Noble had a really good match with Kidman who was surprising to me. Booker T defeated The Big Show in a non-dq match, at one point Booker T gave the Big Show scissors and sent it straight across the table. In the stupid WWE decision, Christian and Lance Storm, jealous anti-American defeats Hogan and Edge with the help of the Test and Jericho. RVD and Brock had a match on the night that was full of great seats, and the RVD had to retain the title by DQ, so I was happy to keep the title. Triple H also signed a contract with Eric Bischoff and Raw, which means little to nothing. In the main event, Rock became the first seven-time WWE World Champion to defeat Kurt Angle and Undertaker in a three-time match. Overall, this is probably the second best PPE of WWE in 2002! 7/10
