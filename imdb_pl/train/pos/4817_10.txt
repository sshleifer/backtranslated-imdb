The Young Victoria is a beautiful film and introduced Queen Victoria in a different light than what everyone thinks about her. The films wash away the impression of "I'm not amused" by Queen Victoria and she shows that she was a happy young woman. <br /> <br /> When I love history, especially Victorian, you can imagine my reaction when I saw this movie for the first time, I was so excited and I counted down the days until I went to the movie theaters. I was a little afraid that it would not be historically accurate, but it was and I loved it. I discovered new facts about Queen Victoria that I did not know before and I was very interested in it. <br /> <br /> Queen Victoria in many lights was one of our greatest monarchs, and this film paints her picture of the real personality and her life. She was so ill-treated by her mother adviser, Sir John Conroy, because he wanted Britain to regency. This is what inspired Victoria to be the fantastic queen she was! The romance between her and Albert was so deep that Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend were very good! The Young Victoria is a love story, but at the same time a great look at most of British history ... I LOVE IT !!!!!!!!! 10/10 ... no doubt!
