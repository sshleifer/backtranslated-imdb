In this film you would think that this movie is only for children. Well, it is mainly directed at them, but it is also rounded enough, and jokes are also indicated to adult viewers. This time the gang Muppet is trying to get on Broadway, with serious difficulties that prevent him from producing, which leads to parting. But Kermit will not stop, and his determination makes matters go on until he comes to an agreement, he is hit by a car and sent to amnesia! <br /> <br /> This is sending, in part, these old stars from the 1940s with musicals as the theme of the musical, but here there are plenty of ordinariness and wonderful moments of hysterically entertaining moments (boomerang Lou Zealand; Gonzo stunt show , whispering campaign, many others), but also with a big heart. The creators of Muppet are not shocked by the conventions, on the contrary, they are so overwhelming that it is almost refreshing to see such a story "let us show ourselves", in which thick and thinking characters will fulfill their dreams. <br /> <br /> Although it is not as original as in the Muppet movie, it has many catchy and unforgettable songs, great locations all over Manhattan, and even interspecific intonations (and marriages)! The cameo is Liza Minneli ("frog?"), Elliot Gould (as a policeman), Brooke Shields (rat proposal), Edward I. Koch, Gregory Hines and Joan Rivers. So prepare yourself for singing or just have lots of laughs and romantic (so romantic) times with one of the best Muppet movies.
