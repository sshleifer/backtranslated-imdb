This film never got the attention it deserved, although it is one of the band's best actresses and one of the most realistic stories I've seen on screen. Clearly filmed on a small budget in real V.A. The hospital, the center of the story is Joel, played very well by Eric Stoltz. Joel was paralyzed in a motorcycle accident and goes to a hospital with other men who are injured by the spine. Joel is in love with Anna, his married lover, played by Helen Hunt, who shows the early signs of his later Oscar-winning work. <br /> <br /> Although the relationship of Joel-Anna is the primary goal, there are many other well-developed characters in the ward. Wesley Snipes does a huge job as a bad Raymond. Even more impressive is William Forsythe as a bitter and racist Bloss. I think the two best Forsythe scenes are when he becomes frustrated and angry with square dancers, and later when he feels empathy for a young Korean who was shot in a liquor store. My favorite scene with Snipe is the round table discussion about sexual trauma options. <br /> <br /> Chemistry between Stoltz and Hunt is very strong and they have two very intimate but not free sex scenes. Orgasm in the ward is sexy and funny. There is another memorable scene in which Joel and Bloss and a Korean boy take a specially equipped van to the strip bar. This is a real comedy of mistakes when they make their weak attempts to make the van see "naked ladies". <br /> <br /> The story is even more touching because the director, Neal Jimenez, is paralyzed in real life. It's basically his story. This film is real, not shiny or flashy. The amount of talent in a film with such a small budget is incredible. I recommend this movie to everyone I see because it is one of those movies that improves the look even more. It is a pity that such a wonderful work is overlooked, but through the video it can attract the attention it deserves so richly.
