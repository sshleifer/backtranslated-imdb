Wow! I loved this movie and the LOVE of Judy Marte !! This girl is not only a great pretty face, she is fun and really very talented !! She made me laugh many times, being very naturally rough with Victor, who beat her desperately! We will see her very often in the years to come ... and probably also from director Peter Sollett and co-star Victor Rasuk! long time! Very refreshing! It's true, nice, fun, well done, that's all: a good story, good actors, a good movie direction! <br /> <br /> If you like simple, slow pace, real life, city movies like Jersey Girl by Kevin Smith, you'll love Victor Vargas! This is better!
