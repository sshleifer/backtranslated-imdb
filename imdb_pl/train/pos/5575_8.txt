I did not expect too much after that, but I must admit that during this movie I laughed a few times on the ground. If you do not feel offended in the first ten minutes, it may be a movie for you. Similarly, if you are the type who would enjoy watching Amanda Peet shuffle for an hour and a half. This is certainly not a momentous work of comedy, but considering the low-budget, preposterous genesis, it is masterful. To align the game field for comparison, imagine that all studio videos with a budget cut by 100 or more and see what you get! Recognition for Peter Cohen and his network for having seen it. I am waiting impatiently for his next effort.
