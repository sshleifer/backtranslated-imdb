It's easy to make really general comments about such a movie. The fact that this is one of the few remaining Japanese films from that era, makes people say that "he started Japanese cinema" and was "unlike anything the West ever created." These recent comments are particularly false, because Kinugasa himself admitted to breaking the "Caligari" many times. But the style was to be imitated and does not deprive him of the significance of this film. We have here experimental themes and compositions built on already established visual styles, opening the door to a truly brilliant stratification of narrative and reality. For this purpose, a madhouse is an ideal place, and the authors knew about it. This is a breakthrough movie and every effort should be made to trace it. <br /> <br /> 5 out of 5 - Necessary
