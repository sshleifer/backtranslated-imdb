I did not expect much and to be honest I did not like this movie for the first time, but I watched it again and realized it was fun. Sure, it's a movie with one joke, but it's a funny gag. <br /> <br /> Someone wrote that it can be better written and can be. I think that this movie had the potential to become my best cousin Vinny. But with the host of a horror instead of a lawyer. Unfortunately, this is a missed opportunity. A little more writing can be a classic. Children are not fully used, there is no reason for them to complain to Elvira. Apart from obvious reasons. It would be great to see how their relationship blossoms. I know it's a comedy, but there are small differences that separate good films from genius. <br /> <br /> Elvira is always fun and addictive. Not to mention courtship. Every time you smile, you'll be too. It's hard to knock on a movie when the main character is so charming. And it really is her charm, do not let her look like a fool, thinking she's in a tart. She is. But she is pretty. The man you let look after your children. I would not let her cook for them, though ... <br /> <br /> I recommend that you do it. <br /> <br /> Just do not expect too much. <br /> <br /> She is more than a great set of boobs. She is also an amazing pair of legs.
