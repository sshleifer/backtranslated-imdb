One of the best Amitabh comeback movies I liked. This was the phase when Govinda was strong with Dhawan. The songs were amazing and completely, as we call it, type "masti". An eternally green artist with multidimensional Anupam Kher. The plot has a lot of funny twists, which is known for the potboilers of David Dhawan. Thanks to the appearance of "Nene" Dixit on time by Madhuri, it was a total riot at the end. It was great to see that Amit appears with such strength and humor after long exile. Although some may consider this a typical Bollywood Masala movie, I watched it every day. It gives you an easy 8 out of 10 just for being pure Bollywood.
