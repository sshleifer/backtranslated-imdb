This is the most handsome film. The color photography is beautiful because it shows the pomp of the Metropolitan Opera House in a bright color. Other scenes in different residences, etc. They're just as great. When it comes to music, what else can be said except that Lisa's voice was at the top when he sang so many famous and beloved arias of the world. Great Dorothy Kirsten is also a joy because her soprano voice is combined with the sound of Liza in stunning harmony. Of course, Hollywood has adopted the usual freedoms in the life story of Caruso. There is not much in the story that relates to real events. For example, the facts about his death are completely fabricated and have nothing to do with the truth. There are some very good websites that tell the true story of Caruso and contain some of his photos. These websites can be found using any good search engine. There are also several books on his life history. But the fictional plot has nothing to do with this beautiful movie. The voices of Lanza, Kirsten and members of the choir are real stars of this film. Enjoy it, I know it.
