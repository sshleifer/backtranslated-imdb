Vincent Cassel plays the role of Paul, who is assigned to work in the office, where he meets Carla, a secretary who is quite deaf when he has his hearing aids in a very deaf person? when not (plays Emmanuelle Devos). Together, they help each other grow as people. <br /> <br /> Particularly interesting in this movie was the complexity of the character? it does not match the obvious stereotypes. Paul seems to be anxious in an office environment, or is it simply not cut down to work? This belief is dispelled when he gets a job at the bar and shines. <br /> <br /> The film has some kind of amorphousness which I think is refreshing and showed how easy it is to act punishably, even if we think it is harmless or justified. <br /> <br /> Finally, it is a movie full of wonderful moments, both moving and full of humor. One of them is when Carla takes care of the child and tries to comfort the screaming child. Is he still hugging him? but he takes out hearing aids for his own convenience.
