Shirley MacLaine in a different, tailor-made role. As a lonely aunt in a Chicago working district in 1962, Veteran actress receives another exercise as a courageous woman who will not allow any opponent to overcome her spirit of success. Children, an earlier boy and girl, are attracted by their fiery aunt Zoe, although many magic tricks and practical jokes have learned from her, and used with all the bad chances eventually led them to exclusion from school. br /> The conspiracy is cleverly hidden in the Cuban missile crisis, with all social implications. Men building a shelter, people watching news programs on what seemed to be the only television set, in the restaurant, and a general mist of anxiety and fear in the air. When a "harmless" miracle is torn out of proportion, the climatic conclusion makes the viewer feel good. Yes, Virginia, the sun will come tomorrow! It is of course a production with a small budget, but it is still a sweet, small movie, filled with the magic from which the Sunday Matinees were made. With a few selected "oldies" thrown into the effective soundtrack, the whole family will certainly be happy about it. ****
