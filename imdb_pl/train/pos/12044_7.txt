A young lawyer sent to a remote area to complete the property of a recently deceased client. When he arrives, it turns out that he is less than welcome by local villagers and that his dead client was not liked. To speed up, she decides to move out of the local inn and live in her home, a house that is usually foggy and only approaches a causeway that is blocked by the sea most of the day. When she sees there visions of a woman in black, whether she is real or imagined, she is also subjected to the bleeding cries of the woamn and the child who apparently drowns in the swamps, these events are reflected on him and soon becomes quite terrified. Atmospheric TV adaptation of the famous art of Susan Hill, which releases the third part of her characters, before she moved to the terrifying village house, her poor color contrast immediately captures the television roots, it should be black and white, but still, as a ghost story, she had several disturbing moments, but while waiting so long to see it, I must say that unfortunately I was a little disappointed.
