I am one of Jehovah's Witnesses and I also work in a medical facility for acute care. Over the years, I've seen people dying from hemolytic reactions to blood transfusions, attending numerous conferences on blood-borne pathogens and seeing several patients who are seriously affected by transfusion-induced pathogens. I have also heard that several Jehovah's Witnesses have been informed that they will die if they refuse blood, and after 26 years in the field I have never seen it happen, leaving the question: "is it really not wise to refuse blood transfusions or be a great benefit to the community? fight in this matter? "The problem of Jehovah's Witnesses is moral. "You must abstain from blood" is not ambiguous. Thank you for this video and permission for comments on this topic.
