I can not believe that we no longer have this program from the 70's. I have all 8 seasons from this 70's show !! I love it !! I lie in bed every night and watch a few episodes before I go to bed. At the end of a long, tiring day, it's nice to jump back and laugh before you go to sleep. I was so sad that they took the air show ... at least we still have replays !! I hope and pray that they will come back with at least a meeting ... How can Donna finish her studies and we will see her and Eric, we will marry !!!! Would not it be amazing !!! It would be even better if they continued it for several years !!
