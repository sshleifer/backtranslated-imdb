I must say it's one of the best animated films I've ever seen. I liked it for the first time, but I really appreciate it during the second watch, just a few weeks ago. I can see why the sequel is doing a great deal at the box office. Apparently, many people liked this movie. <br /> <br /> A great palette of colors (man, it looks good) and a lot of good adult (but pure) humor make it a great winner. The opening of the 3-4-minute scene with "Scat" is excellent, as are the subsequent cutscenes with it. "Sid" laziness (John Leguizano's voice), however, provides the main humor in the film. He usually has something funny to say in this movie. <br /> <br /> Ray Romano is the voice of a mammoth, a great character of the movie, literally, while Denis Leary is a cruel evil man sabertooth tygrys <br /> <br /> It's not just humor and nice colors, but pretty, a sentimental story about how a small child softens a few hard figures. It does not interrupt many songs: only one short and nothing insulting, linguistically wise. <br /> <br /> If more animated films were so good, I would have more.
