In the hands of smaller actors than Claudette Colbert and Robert Ryan, this movie could become stupid and banal. But with these two experienced thespian at the head, I found "Silent Fury" to be the most exciting and pleasant little secret. When their wedding is interrupted by a stranger who claims that Colbert is already married and that he was the best man at this wedding, one can sense that there is some conspiracy against her at work. As Colbert, Ryan and her lawyer decided to bring down the claims of strangers for an earlier marriage, they meet with each subsequent evidence that seems to confirm the claim that she is indeed a wife. Although it is not difficult to understand who the main "baddie" is, there is still a lot of fun because the intensity and tempo of the story increases. To sum up, a good, solid mysterious film with great performances by two leading actors and a great cast, in which Paul Kelly is often underestimated.
