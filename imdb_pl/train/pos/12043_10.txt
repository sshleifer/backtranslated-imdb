... On the stage, on TV or in the book "Woman in Black" is a unique story about ghosts. Other reviewers have already said almost everything that can be said about this film, but I thought I would add my belated, minor review. The film created especially for television has a deliberately slow first act that tells the story of the main character Arthur, who talks about his activity as a lawyer in London in the 1920s. I can understand why this may not please all the palates. Nevertheless, for me, I love this British style of story, similar to the adaptation of the BBC "Ghost Story for Christmas" by the great work of M.R. James. In the second act, a ghost story begins, when Arthur is sent to the provinces by his boss to sort out the matters of the deceased client. The third act is constantly based on the conclusions about tingling of the spine ... As a Londoner I saw the game. I am the owner of a book, a DVD-R disc and I have a full audiobook on my iPod. For me, "The Women in Black" on every medium is a story about ghosts with a few equals. It's about time we got a legal DVD version for region 2.
