This film, which begins with an interesting opening of two hot blondes who get into a car without a driver, has a rather bizarre personality. The cast of seven people (although one girl does not revive around the body, which is unfortunate, because the number of deaths is so small) is super hot, because our story focuses on teenagers playing in the desert (strange but effective choice of settings), chased by a terrifying man in black gloves and jeans who rides a black truck. It precedes many previous vehicle-inspired slashers ("The Trip", "Joy Ride", "Jeepers Creepers"), in which the murderer's vehicle itself becomes a bad antagonist. The killer itself is quite frightening and we find consolation in the extremely nice character in Jennifer McAllister (look at the interesting symbolic contrast of the evil killer on all blacks, while our benevolent heroine cultivates all white outfit, as skimpy and dingy as it can be). Director Bill Crain really does great things with his camera, some cool tricks on the screen, and the cast tries their best. Enough gore in low numbers to please fans, and enough T & A from a few girls to please T & A fans. In general, this film is very underestimated and widely sought after in the world of Slasher films, because it turned out that it is rarely found on video. Highly recommended.
