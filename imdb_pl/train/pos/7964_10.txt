It surprises me how much I love this movie, even though I do not like dogs. Fox, Field and Ameche do a great job with Chance, Sassy and Shadow, and the acting of the animals themselves is simply amazing. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie 72 times (I know it sounds scary, but it's true!), and every time scenes that get me are over. I highly recommend people of all ages, especially animal lovers. This is really my favorite movie!
