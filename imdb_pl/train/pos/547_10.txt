I do not know if I'm just weird, but I really enjoyed the movie. <br /> <br /> Return to Cabin by the Lake is of course a continuation of one of my favorite films, Cabin by the Lake. In fact, I think that I liked the movie even more than the first one. I also thought the cast in this movie was great, Judd Nelson is always the best! I also liked the whole story. I liked the fact that this second movie focused on making Stanley's scenario "Cabin by the Lake" - it was not a totally unnecessary movie Stanley grabbing other girls and sinking them. - If you're looking for some deep meaning, this movie is probably not for you. However, if you're looking for a cool way to spend two hours, look at it. I probably killed at least ten hours watching this movie. :)
