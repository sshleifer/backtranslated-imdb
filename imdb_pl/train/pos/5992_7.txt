I admit that I had no idea what to expect before I see this stylized piece. It could have been a cure for a zombie virus or a common cold for everything I knew. It started with great visual effects, small fragments that caught your attention and made your imagination go crazy. Continuing, I quickly learned what is happening in my voice. A nice little story about the neo noir that I felt was not a band of a few minutes of my time. Small tips given to the audience through visualizations at the beginning give them a sense of accomplishment when they combine the story. With a nice touch at the end it is a nice package in general. The score, although not bad, gave the film an almost cinematic character. It just was a bit outdated, not adding anything to further develop the story. Some performances were too dramatic, but they perfectly matched the whole. I'm leaving very happy about it. I got a lot of information in a short time, but thanks to the great editing and reading I did not feel hurried or pushed. Good job!
