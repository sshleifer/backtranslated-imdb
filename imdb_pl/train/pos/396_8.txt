Legend of Zu <br /> <br /> I remember the original Zu Warriors by Tsui Harka 18 years earlier. During one Christmas, on a rare week, when Channel 4 in the UK showed a week of films in Hong Kong, Zu Warriors was so captivating for the very young viewer and his brother and so memorable that it was engraved in the memory of an adult now sprog ... <br /> <br /> Actually, I think that the original Zu Warriors is one of the earliest films that I saw as a child, from which I can clearly recall the plot and action scenes. And memories of seeing Yuen Biao, Sammo Hung and others in their classic prime. <br /> <br /> So when I saw the remake of Zu Warriors, there was a feeling of anxiety. Could it break the dreamy memories of childhood from the original, or will it follow the path of other alterations and die a death more frightening than the angry and their broken necks that you will find in these kung fu movies? <br /> <br /> Well, the answer is: I can not say. But that's because it is not really a remake. Stories (and styles) are almost completely different. <br /> <br /> Legend Zu tells the story of King Sky, a lone warrior whose master, Dawn, declares his love for him, but her life is taken from her by a monster called Insomnia. Two hundred years later, Insomnia returns, Dawn is reincarnated as Enigma, and Insomnia returned to destroy Zu. Meanwhile, white eyebrows and red try, with the help of King Sky, to stop insomnia. <br /> <br /> The plot is not full of twists, but it contained enough details to interest me. But I see this movie as the one who either loves or hates. The film is about special effects, mostly involving several computer-generated environments, such as The Storm Riders and A Man Called Hero. But unlike the other two films, this movie did not overdo the graphics and the whole was tasteful. Nothing is in a hurry - unlike Hero. The backgrounds were complementary to the game and did not overwhelm the scenes. <br /> <br /> The story also includes a lot of characters, and the interpenetration of many people makes the film intriguing. Probably it was at the border of "too many chefs", but in general each character had its share in this story. But some roles seem to be "extended scenes" in my opinion, and somehow I leave some doubts about the necessity of this. <br /> <br /> Ekin Cheng and Louis Koo play a very important role in the film, but I could not say that this movie showed their best performances. It seems that Cecilia Cheung at least grew up in her acting, but she is still quite strict. Kelly Lin was a new revelation for me. Despite the very short role, I apologize and admit to the polling! <br /> <br /> Generally, I have to say that I liked this movie as much as I liked the "original". Given that both films were produced by the legendary Tsui Harka, both films are part of a chronicle showing how the creation of films in Hong Kong changed over the two decades. One of the advantages is that you can not compare both films at all, just like apples are apples, and pears are pears. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, both films are very pleasant in their own good. And I return to my memories, watching the original again. <br /> <br /> Two to watch, but not to compare.
