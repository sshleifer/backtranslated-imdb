I really think this movie is great, personally. But in every movie there is a downer. Now some of you may not have seen "Raise Your Voice" by Hilary Duff, but if you think about it, these two programs are very similar, if you know what I mean. In "Brave New Girl" Holly wants to get to Haverty Conservatory so much. In "Raise Your Voice", Terri wants to go to the conservatory in L.A. (I do not remember the name of the orangery). They are both in the music field and they both have to sing at the end of the semester. It's really funny how these two films are similar to each other. Personally, I like "Brave New Girl" better than "Raise Your Voice".
