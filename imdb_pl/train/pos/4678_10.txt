I decided to watch this movie in Tribeca based on Judd Hirsch and Scott Cohen and considered him one of the best films at the festival. Both leading actors present a well-rounded sensibility that seems to suit the characters on a personal level. The director did a great job of restoring characters and history to life with skills that are usually not seen in the first production. <br /> <br /> An interesting aspect of this film is love for woodwork and New York (Brooklyn in particular). The film revolves around the family furniture industry and weaves delicate photos of both carpentry and ordinary life in Brooklyn. again kudos for the director on this great selection. <br /> <br /> It is a jewel and I heartily recommend it (I'm sure it will hit the screen).
