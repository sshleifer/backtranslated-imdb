Psychotic transsexual Bobbi murders a patient (Angie Dickinson) of a prominent doctor (Michael Caine) and then races in an expensive prostitute (Nancy Allen) who spotted Bobbi in the elevator. Liz (Allen) is suspected of a crime and works with the son of a patient (Keith Gordon) to catch the killer. <br /> <br /> It can be summed up in a few words: it is very sexy (Dickinson and Allen looks great), it is very bloody - with a kind of gore usually reserved for movies splashing out, and the boy is well made. The screenplay of the script writer and director De Palma is fine, but it really is useful for the film abilities of a man. It is very successful at the internal level and I actually engage / interest in these characters. I see standard De Palma tributes to Hitchcock - at least from one of the Master's photos. <br /> <br /> And most importantly, he has a professional and reliable cast. <br /> <br /> This was the third film De Palmy with ex-wife Nancy Allen (after "Carrie" and "Home Movies".) By the way, the dancer who became actress Rachel Ticotin was one of the production assistants. There are some curiosities for you. <br /> <br /> I would not think that the thriller can be classic and bloody at the same time, but this photo distracts it. <br /> <br /> One of the best things is the typically striking music of Pino Donaggio. <br /> <br /> 8/10
