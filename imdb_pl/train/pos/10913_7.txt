William Powell is a doctor dealing with murder and ex-wife in "Ex-Mrs. Bradford ", starring Jean Arthur, Eric Blore and James Gleason. It looks like Powell had chemistry with almost every woman he was connected to. Although he and Myrna Loy were the perfect screen pair, the actor did several other "Thin Man" movies, one of Ginger Rogers and the one with Arthur, both with very good results. <br /> <br /> Somehow I will never get bored seeing Powell as a witty, professional professional, and "Mrs. Bradford" is no exception. The former Mrs. B has Mr. B with the call for maintenance, and then returns to help him solve the puzzle into which she drew him. And not the first time she did it! It looks like the film Bradford was before the film, or that it was to be the first in a series of films - Mr. B complains that his mysterious writer is constantly bringing him to the affairs. This time, the jockey riding on your favorite horse in the runway mysteriously falls off the horse and dies just before the finish line. <br /> <br /> The solution is a bit quirky, but not on the subject. It's about the teasing of a couple and the interference of a former lady. B. Jean Arthur is quite effective in his role and very funny. However, with an actress who comes out like a mischief like Arthur, humor seems more intentional than bold. I suspect that the writer meant something else - let's say the crazy side of Carole Lombard. When Arthur hears that the police have arrived, he says: "Ah, it's probably my alimony. I waited for the police to take my hand, "it is rather a Powell rib than a serious statement. It still works well and shows how a good actress can do something of her own. <br /> <br /> It's definitely worth watching as William Powell and Jean Arthur have always been.
