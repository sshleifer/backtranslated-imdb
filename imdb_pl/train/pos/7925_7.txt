A silly movie is really, very funny. Yes, it has its dead moments, it can be a bit too obvious, it drops a bit in the second half, and history is an incoherent mess, but it laughs loudly funny. And it's worth seeing only Ed McMahon as the right kook. This movie is in the same class as Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, another incredibly funny, underestimated movie.
