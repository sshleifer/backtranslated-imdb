Let's go to the pursuit: if you are a baby boomer, you have inevitably spent some time thinking about the fact that in 1976 McCartney wanted to enter the life of the hermit city of John and spend the day with him. You certainly also wondered how things went. I heard exactly the same reports that the author of the film heard from the perspective of John and Paul, and I admit that I reconstructed this encounter in a similar way as the film does. But none of my imaginations could buy tears in my eyes, just like doing amazing work and acting. I found this to be extremely realistic, perfectly reliable and 100% free of saccharin. Can anyone explain why I did not hear about this masterpiece before it was shown by the CBC last night? I mean, he's three years old, for God's sake! And yes, if you're a Beatles fan, that's what you have to see! Even subtle paraphrasing of the Beatles' melody in the background is even inspired.
