I expected: rather a poor, stereotypical representation of a crazy athlete and equally poor stereotypical image of a gal who likes him, but he suffers, being the second banana because of his overly zealous support for his favorite sports team. <br /> <br /> What I have: a story of an equal hand in which both a guy and a girl admit - to themselves and each other - that each of them has a passion in their lives, but everyone can forgive others to save the love they share. <br /> <br /> Sounds good, but with constant humor and great performances, this story works! Barrymore is a classic Barrymore: it's the perfect combination of sweet, strong and charming. We expect this from her and she gave birth. <br /> <br /> But Fallon is a nice surprise in this movie. He brings to the role the perfect mix of sports nut in combination with recognition for normal things in life, such as taking care of children and his girlfriend. Fallon delivers his lines with subtle perfection. He can be caring ("You just ran through the field for me!") And at the same time blindly blinded with your love for Red Sox ("How did the grass feel? Spongy?") At the same time. Fallon's portrait "made" the film. Let's hope that this film is the beginning of a better film career for Fallon, something more than the exaggerated humor typical of SNL alumas (eg Will Ferrell). <br /> <br /> In short, a film that could have fallen victim to stereotypical male and female characters that have risen above this limitation and provided carefree, humorous lines, most often provided with Fallon's brilliant subtlety. <br /> <br /> Hey, I saw it with my wife a baseball fan - and she loved him the way I did. This is neither "Guy Flick" nor "Chick Flick". It's a great movie with a laugh. Go see him!
