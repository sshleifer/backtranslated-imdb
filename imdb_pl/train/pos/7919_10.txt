"Full Moon High" is undoubtedly a joke, depicting a teenager from the 1950s of Tony Walker (Adam Arkin) accompanying his father (Ed McMahon) during a trip to Romania. Indeed, Tony is bitten and grows fur and fangs when the moon is full. A particularly interesting aspect of this movie is that it can not grow old as long as it has a werewolf curse and that it must fulfill its destiny - even if it takes twenty years. <br /> <br /> But otherwise, the movie is just fun when it moves. Ed McMahon's character is an excessively patriotic right-wing yahoo (he thinks everyone should listen to Joe McCarthy), Kenneth Mars's head coach / director is a tense dweeb, and then there's more. One of the most opening cast members is Demond Wilson - best remembered as Lamont in "Sanford and Son" - as the bus driver who has a big surprise. But perhaps the funniest scene is the change of presidents; then the gag with Gerald Ford really summed him up! In any case, it is a real feast. Considering that Alan Arkin - who plays a mental psychiatrist - just won the Oscar on Sunday evening and thanked the sons, I wonder if he remembers that he performed with two of them in this film (except Adam, his son Anthony also a small role ). Pretty funny. Elizabeth Hartman performed in the main roles. <br /> <br /> PS: director Larry Cohen is probably best known for the movie "It's Alive."
