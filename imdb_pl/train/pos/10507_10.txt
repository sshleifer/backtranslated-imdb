This game is amazing. You really should get it if you do not have it. Although it is already ancient, it was amazing when it came out. I believe that this game will always be classic. Super Mario World is just as good. When I was young, my friend and I sat and played the game for hours, trying to beat it, which we finally did. It's not as advanced as Super Mario Galaxy, but if you're a Mario fan, it's necessary. It's great fun and a challenge. Everything you could want from a fantasy game, with the exception of good graphics (well, it came out in 1996). Nintendo is the best!
