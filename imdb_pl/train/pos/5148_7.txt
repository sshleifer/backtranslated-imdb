I do not know what it is with these movies. But movies about history or religion are always criticized by their accuracy. Of course, it is not 100% accurate. At present, it is difficult to create 100% accurate movies when even "experts" do not agree with each other. That is why I prefer to judge a film according to what I am trying to say, than to take account of all inaccuracies. <br /> <br /> So I start by saying that I liked this mini series. But I agree with the criticism that his childhood years have passed too soon. The show should be a three-part story, his childhood was the first part. But if they did not have more money to make more stories, would I criticize me? way of the book. Especially the second part, which is only the sum of events that happened. I would rather Hitler be more human (more scenes in which he doubts, etc.). Noah Taylor did more in the movie "Max," which seems better to me. Still, I'm glad that it was done and owned on DVD. To better remember what happened and see how Carlyle gives it everything. 7.5 / 10
