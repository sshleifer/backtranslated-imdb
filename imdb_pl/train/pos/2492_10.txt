it's one of the funniest shows I've ever seen. watching is really refreshing and I've been at the seams many times. I think that there is also a factor of social awareness in it, which makes it quite interesting. if it were white girls, would they react the same? maybe yes maybe no? the characters do not know the limits (check my lyrics) and do not exclude anyone from their twisted sense of fun! There are so many funny sketches. my favorite is Bob the Builder. it's so stupid, it's genius. if you like sprained black comedy, this is for you. if you like keeping up, it's probably not 3 non blonde's is another comic British comedy BBC shown on TV! It's such a funny program, and the characters freed from unsuspecting audience laugh at loud laughter! It would be impossible to keep a simple face watching the crazy characters and reactions of the public! This series is easily added to great comedies!
