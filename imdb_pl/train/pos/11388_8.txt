If I remember, Ira Gershwin, the songwriter and brother of George, proposed Gershwin's catalog for this film, which was recorded by the producers. In many ways it was a typical musical from the 1950s by Freed Unit in MGM and directed by Vincente Minelli with a great help from Gene Kelly. <br /> <br /> Gershwins were of course one of the largest all Broadway music bands, but in my opinion George was one of the greatest American composers, period !!! Gene Kelly was of course one of the two greatest male dancers in the film musical (one guessing the other?) And I can not imagine his casting ever questionable. But I think the rest of the cast needs some explanation: Oscar Levant was a famous character in his time and, as a true friend of George Gershwin, he had to be in this movie. He was a talented pianist, and even a moderately talented composer, as well as a well-known neurotic and hypochondriac. Here, as always, he plays alone. <br /> <br /> Leslie Caron was unknown at that time and was from the French "gamin". A talented dancer, she has never been a real beauty. George Guétary, who plays the role of Maurice Chavalier, oops, I mean Henri Baurel, he was a Greek, not a Frenchman, but he is certainly more than OK as a French boulevard, even if he is too young for this part. <br /> <br /> Gene's Hoofer voice is useful here, but Guétary has much better vocal equipment. Although Gene was better planted somewhere else, of course in "Singin 'in the Rain", where his character is much more calculating, even here he shows that sometimes it is a kind of heel (he was, not for nothing, planted as the original heel Joey in Pal Joey, a musical on Broadway.) I was not so enchanted with his scene "I Got Rhythm" with children who do not seem as spontaneous as it was in my opinion. <br /> <br /> also recognized that the character of Nina Foch Milo is rather annoying. <br /> <br /> But the most important point of the film is of course the long ballet at the end of the movie based on the title music with sets and costumes in the style of the magnificent French Impressionist painters. <br /> <br /> It was difficult for me to believe Gene and Oscar as fighting artists, and I do not think the music numbers are as well set up as they could be, but in general, Gershwin's music is very well supported in this film. <br /> <br /> The DVD is well done with clear graphics (when they are suppos ed to be) and the mono sound is good but fine.
