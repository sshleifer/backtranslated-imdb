Tressy's vocal performance was Outstanding !! Tressa played the role of the singer, while Richard was in the club. When she first came out on stage and started riffing and hitting her things, it shook my soul. Her voice is platinum. He must make a CD. He has more fans and then he realizes. I loved her performance interrupting the show in five heartbeats, which she also played with Leon when she was younger. How a little girl can have a voice so big. It is really amazing. Good voice Good Good Good Good voice voice voice perfect voice fantastic voice, shaken back, cry tearing, uplifting, go back in the days. Tressa, if you read this approval, take my advice and start recording a CD. If not only because of love for singing, but for fans. I believe that you can really do it. Look at those other single studio singers, lol.
