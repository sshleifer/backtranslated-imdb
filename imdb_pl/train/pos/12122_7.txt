The film can be great. I just saw it last night, but I can not express an honest opinion because I first read the book. The book is much better than the movie in which I was disappointed with the movie. If you plan to watch "Of Human Bondage", do not read the book beforehand. On the other hand, the book is so good and contains much more than the romance Phillip has with Mildred, you can still enjoy it after watching the movie. I do not say this lightly. On average, I read a book every 4 days and read various authors such as Danielle Steel, Ovid, Faulkner, Plato and Shakespeare. "Of Human Bondage" receives my vote as one of the ten best novels ever written.
