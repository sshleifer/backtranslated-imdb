This particular episode of Smallville is probably the best episode in the air since re-meeting. This is for many reasons. For example, it restores the series to some of its roots. He welcomes Lionel from his allegedly long absence, with the Luthorcorp office at Metropolis. This room has not been in smallville for a long time, and seeing it again evokes many memories of the Smallville past. Not to mention, Lionels' conversations with Lex are always admirable. <br /> <br /> Another pleasant return, as we guess, is Bart Allen (aka Impulse), AC (aka Aquaman) and Victor Stone (aka Cyborg). Steven Deknight not only combines old justice leaders, but combines them with the Smallville formula in such a unique way that it seems to be a full-length film. <br /> <br /> From there you will get a basic story, Green Arrow creates a league, tries to blow up 33.1, Bart gets caught, Clark rescues him, and the institution goes to the kingdom. Everything is good and graceful, with a good mix of stealth, action, pace and tension. Oh, and Cyborg has some cool new improvements to the characters from the league of justice :). <br /> <br /> Music is probably what makes this episode work so well. If you remember correctly, the first episode of Steven Deknight was directed by Agless from season 4. It was an average episode, but something was out of place. maybe it was music, acting or the fact that in the end "we did not find you, you found us", as if people lost their faith in the formula. But luckily Steve Deknight bought back this episode of Justice. <br /> <br /> I had a few quivvles about Justice, which meant that it did not fit all 10. First of all, too tacky out of the Justice League with an explosion of the Ridge object. I mean, it would be a lot nicer to say that Green Arrow and Cyborg took off on Oliver's bike (remember this in the episode with the arrow). Clark and Impulse should of course run away, and the aquaman should sail a different path. But it was so incredibly tacky that it broke away from 2 points from the whole 10. <br /> <br /> Second, another bad moment, not as bad as the first one, but when Green Arrow says "let's save the world". It made me ashamed. In total, judging from actor performances, music, direction and production values, professionals outweigh the disadvantages, and this is still one of the best episodes in the history of smallville, and maybe the second best episode in season 6. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 ...
