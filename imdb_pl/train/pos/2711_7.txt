When I think "Women in prison," I often think of poor Italian / Spanish directors, such as Jess Franco and Bruno Mattei; and although these films are often very dingy, they are also very similar and when you see them; you might as well see them all. I must admit that these types of films are generally not my favorites; but in reality the idea of ​​women behind the bars was very well implemented several times outside of Italy and Spain; and Roger Corman New World Pictures is responsible for some of the best of them. Caged Heat is the directorial debut of Oscar-winning director Jonathan Demme and it's a great movie with lots of entertainment! Naturally, the film focuses on the story of a girl who was caught committing a crime and sent to a women's prison where she is introduced to many brutal prisoners. This prison is governed by Superintendent McQueen in a wheelchair; and she is offended at the fun imposed by the girls; leading them to plot the escape. <br /> <br /> This movie is a lot lighter on a sleigh than usual in women in a prison movie; but it's more than compensated for by some great action and dialogue scenes, and that's what makes Caged Heat entertainment. It must be said that the plot is not particularly original or ambitious and basically has a structure similar to many other women in the prison films that appeared before her; but this is not such a big problem. The film never gets boring and is full of amazing scenes; including an attempt to escape while working in the field and a bank robbery. The film is accompanied by a direction from a man who will direct the masterpiece "Silence of the sheep" and a great cast with many awards; including the best of all the legendary Barbara Steele in the role of the chief captain of the prison. In general, Caged Heat may not leave much to the viewer at the end; but it is a great entertainment movie with a grindhouse and anyone who likes this movie will surely want to follow it.
