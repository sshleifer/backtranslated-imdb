Ettore Scola is one of the most important Italian directors. Together with my parents, we watched C'eravamo tanto amati together on a summer night: we liked it, but we did not like it because we loved "special day". I believe that Ettore Scola is quite underestimated: we often forget about him, maybe because his recent films have disappointed. And so last night, my mother and I sat on the couch to enjoy this masterpiece. Writing, directing, photos, scores and scenography were sober and accurate, but I liked chemistry between Loren and Mastroiannia the most. Both are great actors and play the main roles of Antonietta and Gabriele. Antonietta is a housewife: he has a wife with a fanatical fascist, he has six children, but her husband wants to have another child to receive an award for big families. Gabriele is just anti-fascist. They spend a special day together, a special day in 1938, when Hitler arrived in Rome, visiting Mussolini. I do not want to ruin the plot anymore: look for this movie!
