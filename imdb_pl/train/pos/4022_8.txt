Another detailed work on this topic by Dr. Dwivedi takes us back to the previously divided Panjaba. Dr Dwivedi chose a difficult topic for his film debut. He worked on all the meticulous details to revive the story. The treatment for the object is very delicate. <br /> <br /> Even if we were not in this region, sets and costumes look really. Unlike most movies created on a partition, this one does not focus on the bloody details of violence to attract the audience, but on its consequences. The heroes come alive. Priyanshu Chatterjee gave impressive performance. Manoj Bajpai made sure that his heart would show the difficult situation of a man guilty. The rest of the cast also did a good job.
