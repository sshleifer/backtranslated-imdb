I last saw this movie. Two hours later, my head still ached with laughter. The plot was terrible, the jokes were very bad, but I did not count on it: <br /> <br /> 1. 2 scenes before and after the film, in which Pat and Jay posed (which caused more than enough laughter) <br /> <br /> 2. Kicking through the windshield that has cut the villain. <br /> <br /> This movie is about 20 times better than the Rush Hour series, and my copy brought even a discourse telling you if you did not like the movie, send the certificate to HBO. While I was thinking about it, the date you had to send was January 1991 (which also caused crazy things).
