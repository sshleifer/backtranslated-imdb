In times of a great studio system, the worst decisions were made. Good old American James Stewart appearing as Hungarian in The Shop Around the Corner. If I had cast this movie, part of Kralik would be perfect for Charles Boyer. His accent mixed with other European accents would be nothing. Stewart had the same problem in the Deathstorm with Margaret Sullavan. <br /> <br /> Margaret Sullavan was his most frequent leading lady on the screen, he made four films with her. But if only this one does not die. Sullavan and her husband Leland Heyward knew Stewart at a time when he was a difficult player in New York. In fact, Sullavan's husband was then a good friend of Stewart Henry Fonda. <br /> <br /> I think that only Clark Gable was able to be an American in the cast of non-Americans in Mutiny on the Bounty. Stewart in the "Mortal Storm" was German, but all other players were also Americans, so nothing stood out. <br /> <br /> But if you can accept Stewart, you'll see a great movie by Ernest Lubitsch. The plot is quite simple, a man and a woman working in a department store in Budapest do not get along personally. But it seems that they are in correspondence with anonymous devotees who turn out to be themselves. Also, the employer Frank Morgan suspects Stewart of wrongly kanewling with his wife. <br /> <br /> Although the lead is fine and Frank Morgan is away from his usual stunned self, the two best players are Felix Bressart and Joseph Schildkraut. Bressart has my favorite moments in the movie when she starts after Morgan starts asking people for feedback. It's very modest. <br /> <br /> And Joseph Schildkraut, who is always good, is just great as an offensive little worm that constantly kisses Frank Morgan. You really hate such people, I've known too many people like Schildkraut in real life who are in office politics 24 hours a day. Sad that it pays a lot of time.
