I read a little about Che before watching this movie and you want to know something, he was a real hero for people, because he just wanted to see equality for everyone and hated what oppressive forces do to their people just like all other Latin Americans! Now I do not know about others, but for me he did the right thing, wanting socialism, so that everyone would have to pay a fair share. However, the powerful elite apparently did not intend to do so. So instead of understanding what Che Guevera wants, they were forced to kill him in an attempt to quell the revolution. It did not work because there were too many of his other followers who were just picking up where he stopped them. A good example of this was Castro's continuing leadership in Cuba. As far as I'm concerned, as Che said just before he died: "If you kill me, that's good. But you only kill a man, you will NEVER kill a thing! "I could not say it better alone. <br /> <br /> But ... EVERYWHERE ... that's why I give this movie 7 out of 10.
