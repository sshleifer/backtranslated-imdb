Unusual and rather funny sleepy in relation to two very different brothers, who are not only so-called "fire starters" (think about snoring Stephen King about the book of the same name), but also forever argue with each other about women is quite nasty the habit of being a piroman! Good special effects (especially at the end), bizarre performances of a quite talented trio of actors and topped off with a really interesting and weirdly appropriate soundtrack make "Wilder Napalm" a unique feast for the film that you can watch ... if you find it is it! Personally, I was lucky that I managed to get him out of the two-dollar container in my local video rental company (so to speak). (*** outside *****)
