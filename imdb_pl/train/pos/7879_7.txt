As with most Eleanor Powell movies, this one takes place on the thinnest motifs. For some reason - oh, it's been explained! - she was chosen to transport the magnetic mine to Cuba. Good guys and bad guys compete for the mine, and who is the one who is wrong. But, as always, Powell's dance is great and worth the admission price. And in this Lahr plays his cowardly lion, recalling the warm memories of this Technicolor movie from 1939. An additional benefit is listening to young Frank, with this wonderful voice and thin sensitivity, which he abandoned for his wise personality. In addition, the great drummer, Buddy Rich, has a great time to show his virtuosity. Pay special attention to his unique duet with trumpeter Dorsey and Ziggy Elman. I say "special" maybe in ignorance, but I do not know any other sequence of drums / trumpets, like the one on the film or on the discs. This movie is funny. Even the stupid Skelton figure is relatively restrained. Powell again shows that she is the best film dancer in history.
