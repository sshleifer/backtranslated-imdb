I gave this film a 7. He was better than Thirdspace, but not as good as "In the Beginning" when it comes to B5 movies. I really think that the TV series did a much better job thanks to special effects and character portraits. Let's hope that the producers and cast will get another series of "Crusade" to B5 standards.
