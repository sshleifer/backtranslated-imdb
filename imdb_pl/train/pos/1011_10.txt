I love Jacek's jokes, such as "Frazes is ..." or "Over the best banal guy, black, fat skin, a bit scary ...". He is just funny! Daniel starts catching him up! It's good that Jack is not in the band anymore (in a sense), otherwise it would be sarcastic mania !!!! I love all the threads (season 8, a bit less, I have to admit), the characters are great, the actors are great, I start to raise my face (and not only) from Jack, Daniel and Teal'c ... It's all theoretically possible and exciting .. oops! I go one more time !!! I'm sorry, but I'm also starting to improve Carter's features, and that's what drives my parents NUTZ !!!!!!! Well, to sum up, I think it's good for the next three seasons, especially if they're still staging episodes with all the humor, drama, action and so on !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !
