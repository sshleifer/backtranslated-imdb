Are you a giraffe? ... ask John to Nadia, and she, sure she will answer well, replies: yes. In this way communication begins between a man and a woman who do not know each other, and at the same time questions and doubts in "Birthday". A movie that I have heard many times, but I dare not see ... I will write it for two hours. <br /> <br /> "Birthday Girl" is a passionate movie that makes me out of the question at the same time Nicole Kidman is one of the best actresses (except that she is pretty and intelligent) that I have ever seen. "Birthday Girl" is a story of a lonely and routine man who is looking for a wife on the Internet. The woman he found is from Russia. She seems to be this delicate woman, normal, no more. One day her cousin and his friend suddenly come to her birthday. Man begins to discover certain things. From then on, he will not be a lonely and routine man who has always been. <br /> <br /> Many of us will think that this movie is an ordinary movie with a used plot. Many of us think that action and emotions are certain and will not say. But "Birthday Girl" is quite the opposite. This film is full of good surprises, good performances and an ingenious plot that I have never seen and imagined. This romantic thriller with some funny accent is a perfect natural movie with many suggestions for this kind of movie. "Birthday Girl" has some beauty and primitiveness in her scenes, but at the same time it is a moving nature and makes it so deep. <br /> <br /> "Birthday Girl" is sometimes sad, sometimes funny, sometimes brutal, but at the end is completely satisfactory. And I'm not sorry to say it's a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> * I apologize for mistakes ... well, if they exist.
