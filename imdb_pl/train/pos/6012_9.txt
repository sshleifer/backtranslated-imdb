Antonioni was looking for another fashion masterpiece, this time on the other side of the Atlantic than "Blow up". However, it was not a success with critics and youth, like the first one. Why? Maybe it was because it was a European view of America filled with clich√©s that did not work then and did not get old well. (Initially, revolutionary students are embarrassing.) <br /> <br /> Perhaps when it was released, large hit movies and those designed specifically for the youth market seemed outdated. Had it been released a year earlier, perhaps the hippopotamuses in the deserts would seem fresh ... This is a very interesting movie, very beautifully filmed with some brilliant and Antonian scenes between how to create love in the desert, the immobility of a desert residence and explosive ending ... To lead two amateurs did not help. They were beautiful but inexperienced. Mark Freshette is slightly better than Daria Halprin. It would be better with the right actors! Maybe Michelle Phillips or young Jessica Lange ... This window is actually quite funny and moving, although you would not know how the lines are delivered ... <br /> <br /> A very interesting document in the late sixties is definitely worth it look at photography and soundtrack ....
