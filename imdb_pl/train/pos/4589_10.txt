Well, I would consider Police Story to be one of Jackie Chan's best films. The plot, fight scenes and stunt work are excellent. In this movie, Jackie himself acted as a policeman named Chan Ka Kui (Kevin Chan in some versions), who successfully arrested a criminal. After freeing your crime for lack of evidence, he framed Khan for killing a policeman. For this reason, he was wanted by the police. Later, Salina (Brigitte Lin), who was the secretary of the Lord of the Crime, went to the shopping center and began stealing evidence of the Lord's crime from his computer and getting ready to hand it over to Chan. The murderer knew, however, that Salina had downloaded his aggravating data and hired his supporters to catch her. Later Chan appeared on the stages and began to fight with all the supporters, defeating them one by one. In the last scene, you've seen Chan hit your crime. Finally, it's the best action and comedy movie. Everyone should watch it. Highly recommended.
