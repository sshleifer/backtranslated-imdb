I do not know why some guys from the USA, Georgia and even Bulgaria have the courage to express feelings about something they do not understand at all. For those who have not watched this movie - watch it. Do not expect too much or do not arrange the frames just because it is Kosturica. Watch the movie without prejudice, try to understand all the humor - the people of Serbia have NOT married, while Bil Clinton bombs their villages, Gypsies in all the Balkans ALWAYS try to kidnap you in any way, LOVE is always unexpected, clean and colorful, and the Balkans are extremely creative. For those who say it is a bad movie, I only see that American sh * t (like Meet Dave, Get Smart, etc.) are much worse than the pure, honest Balkan humorous love movie, like "Promise me." The comment should be useful, and in second place should represent the personal view of the writer. I think the film is great and people watch how they must respect the director and the story. It's simple but true. He is brutal but gentle and makes you laugh from the dead.
