The movie looked like a transition to the Immoral Study. Probably I was never too much connected with the artist's burning need to immortalize the men's acts, and thus all the confusion around "Now who drew this penis?" Sounded a bit free. Dialogues in this film are quite horrible, although visually this movie has its moments. I almost dig it out when Tassi came up with a painting of a mental image, but then the movie returned to the penises. I highly recommend those who have not seen for a long time.
