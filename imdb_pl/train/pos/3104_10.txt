This movie was perfect. I did not expect that it would meet all expectations, but it did. Like all Bourne movies, the action is fast, realistic and intense. If you liked the other two films in the trilogy, you'll love this one too. The plot is simple and there are no unrealistic twists. OK, the figure of Julia Stiles appearing in an Italian safe house was quite strenuous, especially after what happened in Supremacy, but it makes sense that he is the only character in "Treadstone" that Bourne knows he does not want him to be dead and he can trust and the only person who will lead him in the right direction. The action is driven by characters and their reactions to what is happening around them. What I've always loved about Bourne's films is the fact that Bourne can kick butt, but when it's suited to people as good as him, fighting is a struggle and he takes a lot of damage. They never treat the audience like idiots. <br /> <br /> All the actors were solid in their performances. I believe Damon could play Bourne in a dream and get the perfect support from Joan Allen, who will revive his role with Supremacy, David Strathairn and Scott Glenn. I recommend this film and the trilogy. I miss Franka Potente, though.
