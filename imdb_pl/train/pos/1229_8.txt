I waited centuries before I saw it, because all the reviews I read about it were horrible! I rented it, expecting the worst, and although it is not the best Sandler film, it's worse! Sandler often talks with the camera, and the film is not taken seriously, but it's all part of the fun! A great way to waste your afternoon or maybe once you will laugh! A good movie, worth renting!
