... but I liked the program anyway. I read some of the comments that previous reviewers had to say about this concert, and I have difficulty completely invalidating all criticisms in my head (except one: that the program was out of date, but not stale). Many things that people are struggling with about this program are money: pretentious; forced; overwrought; desperate to pay attention; smug; annoying omnipresent narrative. But you know what? I really liked it. It was different, it was original, really, really THREE; and it rewarded all the minuses. The performance was clear, verbal, fast, witty, interesting, funny at sight ... you know, it was only once a week, I could take it once a week and I can not wait for it. I'm mourning his departure. But nobody will bring it back to life.
