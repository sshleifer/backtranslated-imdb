It's quite a strange movie. It appears as a film exploiting violence and unrealistic situations, but it is extraordinary because it is constructed around rural characters fighting against each other, in contrast to the invasive 'others'. <br /> <br /> The film is an excessive stereotype of veterans in Vietnam, in a long line of films that depicted veterans of this war as dangerous psycopaths. Kris Kristofferson's last poem reads: "I have not lost a war yet," because he faces death after he has committed a long murder and destruction, including the city police chief and his brother's girlfriend on a particularly chilling scene. However, Kristofferson is a good enough actor and charismatic enough to carry this villain with a surprising depth. Vincent is undoubtedly a golden boy, but with sufficient intensity arranged above his pure goodness. The film resembles the story of Winchester 73, in which Jimmy Stewart tries to tolerate a criminal brother until he is forced to act against him. <br /> <br /> The movie has a b-movie action, although the presence of Kristofferson, Vincent, the wonderful Victoria Principal and Bernadette Peters give her class A composition. <br /> <br /> I give her 7 for that since I have long lost myself in the American psychology of introspection in Vietnam / before Reagan, paranoia and the confusion and film industry who were eager to address such topics at the time. <br /> <br /> Seen on THIS channel, a great network that plays many old movies from the 70s and 90s, regardless of political bending.
