Red Eye is not a kind of movie that Palme D'or will win, but Wes Craven has never been such a director, and his branding is a good indicator of what a filmmaker can expect. > <br /> The fact that the Red Eye is a tight, low demand package after 94 minutes is part of its charm and a sign of Craven's craft in the production of light but generally pleasant cash register tickets. In fact, it is an ideal type of movie that can be shown as live entertainment, attracting attention without exposing the viewer to intellectual or emotional challenges. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a bad feeling on the story, the unclear motive of terrorist motivations and supporting characters, and the main section contains a television film. There are, however, some elements of Hitchcock's suspense and the echoes of Schumacher's telephone box, which is ultimately more sophisticated (and pretentious) on the same principle of broadcasting an emotional crisis, suppressed publicly. <br /> <br /> In the case of a film that focuses mainly on two people seated in airline seats, lives or dies on characters and scenarios. The icy but eloquent ingenious Lisa Jackson Rippner and Rachel MacAdams are the main reasons why the film is lifted. Not only does it make dialogue with zinging, but it also gives the dimension of "Adam's rib" a struggle of "male logic" with a female "sensitivity". <br /> <br /> In the last part of the movie, Craven gives himself a bit of Scream style as a man-chases-girl-with-knife. The most surprising revelation is how Brian Cox looks after the treatment of "Just for Men", his ubiquitous performance in films as different as Super Troopers, The Ring and thus makes him a Seksegenarian version of Jude Law. <br /> <br /> Fun on short distances.
