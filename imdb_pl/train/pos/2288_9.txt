It is rare for a literary work to be properly translated into a screen that I could rate the film higher than it deserves, but not much. As a longtime student of Vonnegut's works, I do not hesitate to recommend the film to my readers, at least to those who love him. The casting is inspired: Nolte is underestimated in triumph, stunned by defeat, decisive in the assessment. Sheryl Lee is juicy all the time, but her handling of the treacherous Resi and her tragic crescendo almost makes you forget her beauty. Alan Arkin provides a completely nice but also treacherous Soviet spy. <br /> <br /> Do not feel that you have to read Mother Night to appreciate the movie; however, if you have not read the Mother Night, you will probably want to watch the movie after. <br /> <br /> Note the changes from color to black and white and back, and do not miss the final Campbell loop symbol. See also, at the end of the film, an episode of Kurt Vonnegut. <br /> <br /> Bing Crosby's "White Christmas" will never sound the same (I write in the middle of December, when the song starts to play on the radio) and it drives me crazy.
