I just saw "Behind Bedroom Doors" and it was the first softcore with a solid story that I had seen for some time. <br /> <br /> We start with two neighboring couples - Vivian and James Fenway (Julia Kruis and Eric Carrington), and Lillian and Gabe Harris (Nicole Sheridan and Chris Gustafson). Vivian seems to be a housewife, James is a lawyer working for the district attorney, Lillian works in the real estate market, and Gabe is a successful plastic surgeon. Do you have all this? Let's go to this now. <br /> <br /> Enter Abby, beautifully played by the pornstar Chelsea Blue. He rents a house across the street from Fenways and lives alone. At the beginning of the movie James looks out the window and sees Abby engaged in the fun with his girlfriend, Gigi (played by the prolific pornography of Monique Alexander) and secretly begins to wonder what it would be like to be with her. The next day, Abby meets all four of them and seems to be a nice woman who simply lives an alternative lifestyle. Surrenders to Vivian, who seems surprised and says to her: "Oh ... no ... not this way." Everything seems fine ... until the plan is launched <br /> <br /> First, Abby appears in Gabe's office, naked, asking Gabe if she should get a boob job. Here we get a quote from the movie: <br /> <br /> "Tell me about Gabe." "What do you want to know?" "Is Gabe happily married?" "I'm married." "There are problems ... let me guess. Your wife stays at home and does everything you ask for. But she is a good girl. " "Yes." "She is not a bad girl?" "No." "Is the door locked?" <br /> <br /> You know what will happen next ... Abby does it with Gabe, just in the exam room. Then he puts out a small show in the window for James, who comes and does not waste time sex with her. James does not know that the piano bear with the flashing red eye is really a camera that records all the festivities (and that's obvious). Abby is having sex with Gabe again, and this time Gigi joins him to make him tripartite. Now that Abby has something on both men, he asks for $ 100,000 each to buy her silence. Not only could she ruin James's escape into the office, but she could destroy Gabe's practice. <br /> <br /> While Gabe and James are grappling with guilt, Abby finds the time to seduce Lillian - who "experimented" with women in college. It was a long time ago, but you would not know that seeing her in action with Abby - she looked like an old professional. <br /> <br /> While Gigi agrees with the plan, she seems to be jealous of all the sex her girl has. "It's just an interest," says Abby. Confessions and apologies will surely appear, as will some surprising information about Abba's true identity - it seems to do the same for different men in many different places. Gabe and James use this information to fight Abby blackmail. <br /> <br /> Now when it comes to sex. The sexual scenes were pretty good, and given that all the women featured in this movie besides Julia Kruis have a long porn background, I would not expect anything less. Four scenes by Nicole Sheridan were the best in the film, and the three-way scene was approaching the other. Monique Alexander was naked only once, but she was relatively small. Julia Kruis was the main character and naked so many times. I suppose because she was surrounded by experienced professionals, she did not have to have so many sex scenes. <br /> <br /> At the end of "Behind Bedroom Doors" she had a great storyline that improved the overall rating of the film. I consider it remarkable. <br /> <br /> Women: A- (Nicole Sheridan was good in this movie - better than her later offers in the comedies of Fred Olen Ray.) At least maybe a little drama. "Chelsea Blue was a thief's scene - she was not as bad as an antagonist I would give her everything, Julia Kruis was her usual person, but I would like Monique Alexander to have more time in this movie. <br /> <br /> Sex: B (Solid, very solid sex scenes. Performances by Nicole Sheridan Chelsea Blue also looked good in her scenes. Two girls-girlfriend victims were not hot, but they warmed up on the screen.) <br /> <br /> Story: B + (I liked the dialogue and the main story. Chelsea Blue was good for the genre and I was impressed by Nicole Sheridan's turn in the drama.) <br /> <br /> Overall: B (It was a nice softcore.) I'm glad I could watch this movie because I was pleasantly surprised. Blue ever ch to do more, would be welcomed to me. This is also true of Nicole Sheridan - although he's probably doing better with comedy. I do not mind hardcore girls who can make softcore films.)
