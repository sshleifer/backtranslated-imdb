Well, first of all I would like to explain that Kaakha Kaakha is part of the Tamil prayer and roughly translated means "to protect". Khakhee refers to the color of the police uniform (which is Khakhi!). <br /> <br /> Also the Tamil film industry is rather full of purely commercial ventures, any Rajnikanth or Vijay film would become a testament to this statement. <br /> <br /> Now Kaakha Kaakha is a PERFECT movie with a great soundtrack. Certainly very stunning in the final scene, I especially love the ending (which is certainly unexpected!). Gore is sometimes too much, but it's definitely a great movie!
