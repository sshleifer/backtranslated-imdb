Sopranos are distinguished by their tightness, dynamic exploration of American life and how American experience is shaped and defined by money. By setting history in an underground world, David Chase eliminates all barriers to grunting, low above the ground, and directly means the deconstruction of the postmodern era. <br /> <br /> Each character represents the aspect of American industry. Tony Soprano is an example of a beleaguered, stiff man, torn between his family duty and the need to maintain his "interest" on an equal level. The convergence of these two things is a necessity that keeps history moving. The heroes of Christopher, Pauli and Bobby reflect the loyal - but selfish, subordinates present in every enterprise they trust by necessity rather than by merit. With Ralph's character, Joe Pantoliano, essays are a brilliant interpretation of a charismatic psychopath, a wacky businessman who thrives with violence is tragically overwhelmed by his overwhelming earning power. And Dominic Chianese is the ultimate symbol of an obsolete old guard that maintains power through established relationships and the need for up-and-downers to reject the guilt. he deserved his place as the best television drama. <br /> <br /> PS A good addition to the Chase series would be The Shield, another violent drama that makes the ugliest of the characters interesting.
