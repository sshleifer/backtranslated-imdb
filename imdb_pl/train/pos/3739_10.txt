I really like this movie. Bozz is an amazingly cool, uninviting soldier who does not want to go to war. His character is similar to Yossarian in Catch-22, the classic novel by Joseph Heller about people and war. This film, however, is not embedded in the war zone, but in the pre-war preparatory training. This wonderful film tells of the disgusting realization that the Vietnam War was a mistake, and those men who were associated with the victim for the defeat. much real love and compassion for his soldier, as well as contempt and disrespect for the establishment who tried to kill him. Bozz is completely cool and irreverent, he tests and improves his military superiors, gaining a goat at every opportunity. He is a figure of Jesus Christ with a psychological degree, "saving" his soldiers and showing those who are in real need, leaving the army of this man. <br /> <br /> Acting and action are sharp and credible as a "Sleeper", Tigerland passes with Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket as one of the three best films in Vietnam, in my opinion. <br /> <br /> FIVE STARS, the best choice.
