I think I read it somewhere: Joe Johnston (the director of the film, and one of the guys who started Industrial Light and Magic to work on the first Star Wars film) and one of its producers or something that got their hands to get the title "Rocket Boys" (I think) was missing something. <br /> <br /> One day they got agonized by a program on a PC that creates words from other words (eg you type a word or a series of words and it mixes letters and creates different words) I think the technical term is "anagram" <br /> <br /> In any case, they wrote "Rocket Boys" and for sure, what he returns is "October Sky". They were at least shocked. The title summarized everything in the film because the film revolves around Sputnik. Initially, Homer Jr did not like the idea, but warmed up to him after the "film novel in the soft cover" appeared and took off.
