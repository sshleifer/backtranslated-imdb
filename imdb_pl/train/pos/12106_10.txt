"Danza Macabra" / "Castle of Blood" Antonio Margheriti is an amazing, atmospheric chiller, which is successful on all fronts. It looks absolutely beautiful in black and white and has a wonderfully terrifying gothic atmosphere. Alan Foster is an English journalist who interviews American horror writer Edgar Allan, Poe Poe, telling Foster that he can not spend Poe's Thomas Blackwood one night in an abandoned residence. By accepting the bet, Foster is locked in the residence and the horror begins! Atmosphere and terror frightens me. The sequence of the crypt is really amazing, and the tension is almost unbearable. Barbara Steele looks amazingly beautiful as the evil spectacle of Elisabeth Blackwood. "Castle of Blood" is one of the best Italian horror movies in the early 1960s. A masterpiece!
