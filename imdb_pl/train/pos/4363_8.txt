It's a bit disturbing to have a character Gig Young in the movie ... played by Gig Young. But this movie is a place where Gig got his name, and a good career after playing small parties under a different name. <br /> <br /> I'm going to go against most of the other comments and say that I really liked this movie, mainly because of the live performance of Barbara Stanwyck as Fiona. She was funny, angry, vulnerable, caring and feisty as the oldest of three daughters whose mother died on Lusitania and whose father was later killed during Woar War I. <br /> <br /> As a "man" home, Fiona for many years she is steadfast so as not to satisfy her father's will, which would enable Donald Trump, Charles Barclay, to get a family home. But Fiona has a secret why he hates Barclay so much. Geraldine Fitzgerald is a middle, flirtatious sister who is the wife of an Englishman, but she wants her youngest sister's boyfriend (Gig Young). <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Stanwyck, do not miss it.
