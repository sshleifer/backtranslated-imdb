Although I was born in the year in which this movie appeared and never heard of it until my junior high school (1996), when I saw it, I became completely absorbed in laughter, crying and feeling with the characters because my friends and I were them. <br /> <br /> Their hair, clothes and speech were out of date, but the emotions and desperation of every situation were so familiar! I remember thinking how real it is and how much I would like them to continue to make such films. <br /> <br /> In fact, I saw this movie the night after I was in a crazy party (not as much as the one in Jay's house), which was broken by what we considered as losers who stayed off the beaten track our crowd. World class BS'er and "responsible" type of mother figure, which I immediately identified with Jeanie (I was also the one with the car), although I had some uncertainty about Madge, who also floated there. My best friend was Deidre, and her good friend from childhood was our Annie. <br /> <br /> Watching the scene when Jeanie is at school or where she breaks up with her boyfriend, and then tells Madge how much she loved him as conversations and situations that I personally had. <br /> <br /> Now, at the age of 27, I saw the movie again and felt a surge of emotions because it was like watching my own piece of youth (though none of my friends died). I think it must be seen for all girls aged 13 and older.
