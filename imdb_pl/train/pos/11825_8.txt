Do not look too much for the plot here ... just sit with popcorn and enjoy it. The gallery of stars appears as classic black characters in this live comedy with amazing make-up and scenography, not to mention the performances of Beatty, Madonna and Pacino. Great fun for children and adults. <br /> <br /> *** with ****
