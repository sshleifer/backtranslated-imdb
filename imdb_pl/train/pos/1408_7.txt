It seems that the Pentagon scientific team has perfected a serum that causes invisibility, but when the main trumpeter tries to convince himself, he can not reverse the process. Frustrated and drunk with power, he becomes psychotic in the classic tradition of HG Wells. <br /> <br /> This is a joyfully horrible story of the Invisible Man, delivered with the delight of the always tasteful Verhoeven and Bacon as a brilliant loonytoon-maniac. As with many of Verhoeven's works, he has an incredible, unrestrained sense of adventure from the Boy's-Own comic book (secret underground laboratory in which scientists work, is simply wonderful) in combination with the most frightening and depraved images (women in underwear are groping And attacked by an invisible devil, animals beaten to death, literally gallons of blood and wholesale slaughter in the last two reels). While history does not produce any new twists in the old idea, CG's special effects by Scott E. Anderson are extremely brilliant because we see veins and arteries, cardiovascular systems, muscles, tissues, bones and the body that literally appear out of nowhere. In particular, the sequence in which the band imports the gorilla from an invisible state, and the scene in which Bacon melts Devane in the pool, takes the breath away detail and the artistic invention of effects. The film also has a great soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith and a classic horror film by Jost Vacano. The young cast is overshadowed by the technical background of the film, but both Shue and Dickens are impressive from their depth. It's a great, funny movie.
