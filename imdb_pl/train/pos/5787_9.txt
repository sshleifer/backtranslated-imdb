Many are dated in this episode (like most episodes of Twilight Zone), such as the incredibly sexist military uniform. Some things are as unbelievable as the easy availability of clean water. Consider this year and time, however, and you will quickly understand why this episode is as unique as watching it. He has a nice sense of hope, something missing in many Twilight Zones, as well as an interesting female figure (although he rarely speaks), something else rare in the Twilight Zone. "Two" is a great example of how the Twilight Zone, in just over 20 minutes, could pack more emotion and drama than most two-hour movies. And it's great to see two people who have become American icons so early in their career.
