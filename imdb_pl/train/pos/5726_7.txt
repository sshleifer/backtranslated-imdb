"The Grudge" is a remake of his own series of popular Japanese horror films Shimizu. Shimizu knows he can not do anything new, so he does what any intelligent person would do: he forgets logic and concentrates on giving the viewers a pleasant ride. He uses widely known stereotypes related to ghost stories, but Shimizu plays with these elements in the imagination. Nonlinear narrative is not a simple trick, but an interesting way to present sequences from different perspectives. At the end, I can only say that if the only purpose of the horror is to scare the audience (just as the comedy is to make people laugh), this movie has been successful. I watched him in the theater with the audience and it was great to see spectators go crazy about it. Probably not playing so well in your living room.
