"Ruby in Paradise" is a beautiful story about a young age, Ruby Lee Gissing, who escapes from the stifling roots to become himself. Although the title character is played ingeniously by the wonderful Ashley Judd - probably in her first role in the movie, though she can be proud - the emphasis is not on becoming "someone" but the la Madonna (be it mother of Jesus) or gloomy, hungry singer) . <br /> <br /> Instead, he focuses on following instincts and is a bit introspective towards them to grow into the perfect adult himself. NOTE: This is not an action movie !!! She uses narration from time to time (by Mrs. Judd) while writing in her diary - and oh, I see that I just lost the male half of readers. But be patient with this beautiful film in which we learn that happiness can be found in - oh, I do not know, carrying water and hacking wood. <br /> <br /> Actor / director / screenwriter Todd Field, who played Nick Nightingale in the movie "Eyes Wide Shut," matching with the noble interests of Ruby Lee, who helps her cure her relationship with youth. <br /> <br /> But even his character is not the answer to Ruby Lee: There is no outer hero on her. The ultimate message is that we are responsible for ourselves. Screenwriter and director Victor Nunez, who also wrote / directed Ulee's Gold, did an amazing job showing a young woman who grew up in the face of the eternal challenges of good v. Evil along the way. <br /> <br /> Supporting cast is also a star, and the music used, especially cuts by Chanteuse Sam Phillips (whom I hear is the wife of T. Bone Burnett), is right - especially "Trying to keep the Earth. "Now that I hear the first few chords of this song, tears come to my eyes, Pavlovian and uninvited - I'm not sure if this is music or an indelible connection to the quiet, charming message of the subjectification of the film. <br /> <br /> This movie is highly recommended for every young person trying to find their way. It's a must see for every woman of all ages! The downside: It is NOT on DVD, except for Spanish. (We learned, however, that it is legal to make one copy of the VHS version, which can easily be found on the Internet. My beloved husband found someone with a copy of VHS and got a copy of a DVD for me.) Although this treasure movie sometimes appears on the air? on the indie channel, usually ?? you can not count on it when it may be most needed as a tonic to relieve the pressure of the world. So buy a copy for yourself. <br /> <br /> This movie should have a serious re-release, and if I were the Hollywood Queen, it would be a movie. <br /> <br /> - Figgy Jones
