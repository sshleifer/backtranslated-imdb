A soap opera about a small married woman from a small town (Kay Francis), who works in a local newsagent, appears as the main lady in her local theater, but dreams of becoming a star on Broadway. When a famous actor, who is a ham, a windbag and a womanizer, goes to the city, visits him in his room with dreams of giving her directions to stardom - he pretends that his butler is his "manager" who cheats on her has everything you need to "become a big star". Her husband finds out and strikes the guy, which causes the actor's unexpected death - which leads to a murder trial, and even more unexpected: a life sentence for hubby. The next thing you know is that she joined the Burlesque tour in hopes that one day she will be able to get to Broadway and earn enough money to free the man - her baby is sleeping in the trunk all the time! <br /> <br /> This movie has a very interesting story, maybe a little stretched but very melodramatic (with tons of melodramatic music to be sure) - everything * greatly * enhanced by strong, emotional performance of Kay Francis - she just does this movie. Also helpful here is a well-made game Minny Gombell in the role of the "older forties" who work on burlesque and befriends Kay. Worth to see, especially for fans of Kay Francis.
