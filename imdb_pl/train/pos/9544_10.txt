Meatball Machine is an amazing splashing movie, it has an original story with young love, buckets of blood and strange alien creatures that mutate people into bizarre warfare. <br /> <br /> Now the film is not for everyone, people who love to splash the movies or the movie Tetsuo: Iron Man will applaud. <br /> <br /> Special effects can be tacky at some points in the movie, but the movie should not be treated very seriously. <br /> <br /> All in all, however, it's great fun if you find budding romantics infected with mucous bumps like gobbles who want to destroy themselves in bloody, filling alien battles.
