After reading some of the negative reviews about the film, I was not sure if I should spread the money for rent. However, it was a nice surprise. I did not see the original movie, but if it was better than this, I would be in heaven. <br /> <br /> Tom Cruise gives a strong performance as a seemingly unstable David, convincing me that he is more than a smile on his feet (for the third time in a career - other examples are Magnolia and Born on the fourth of July). Penelope Cruz is a bit light, but he fulfills the requirements of his role, just like Diaz. The only disappointment is somewhat bland Kurt Russell. However, in the film, it's not acting that really impresses - his movie. The growing madness of the film is perfectly done by Crowe (the short sequence in which Cruise goes through empty Time Square is incredibly effective). The soundtrack (a feature that distinguishes Crowe's film) is also sublime. <br /> <br /> You will be shocked and challenged as a spectator. The story seems a bit invented, but the issues that lie behind it can be discussed without end. The film is not perfect, but its welcome pace for Cruise and Crowe and for those brought up in the Hollywood glory should be a revelation.
