This installment makes the CIA look like a very stupid organization. In fact, maybe it is. In the end, the way the plot unfolds, it seems that one man has the power to sanction the killing of everyone, including his own people, to kill Jason Bourne. <br /> <br /> Matt Damon is doing a very credible job as Bourne tries to stay one step ahead of killing the whole movie. He's still trying to remember who he was and how he got there. He receives help from several people and it seems that every minute of the movie, someone tries to kill him. <br /> <br /> In this movie there is little time to rest, and the action sequences seem very real. There are many chase sequences shot with a shaky camera that in some way add realism and make it seem less Hollywood than many pictures. These sequences add realism to the film in the sense. <br /> <br /> The tension in some sequences is perfectly done when you are wondering if someone will die or if Bourne can fight them off. It's the kind of action you want to see when you want to party and I'm sure it will lead to the next movie in the series.
