I am completely shocked that this concert has been canceled. It lasted only one year. I recently started watching it and I love it. <br /> <br /> About 2 brothers and 2 sisters live under one roof without parents. Kurt (Joey Lawrence) plays the role of the oldest siblings and takes on a more fatherly role. /> It should last much longer than a year because it was fantastic. An amazing show with all the best actors. <br /> <br /> 10/10
