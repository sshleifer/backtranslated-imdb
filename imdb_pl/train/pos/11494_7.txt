The Unborn is a production by Roger Corman and as such is nasty and tasteless. If you hate pregnant women, check out this video because it is full of preggo kills and unsuccessful abortions. Brooke Adams plays in Virginia. Her and her husband are going to some fancy fertilization clinic because they can not have children on their own. There they meet Dr. Meyerling (James Karen from ROTLD 1 and 2). Dr. Meyerling has a very high success rate in pregnant couples. (Put in a joke here.) Is it because he creates some super-mutant genetic-killers? This is how Virginia thinks when she begins to have strange side effects and extreme moods resulting from the treatment. That's when he starts to take matters into his own hands. <br /> <br /> On this, you'll have to get the rest of the details somewhere else, because if I told you all the delicacies you had, you could hurt yourself too quickly and put him in Netflix's queue. It's a little slow, but as soon as it moves to the last third, all systems are ready! Very highly recommended by me based on his fetal violence without a computer. 33 1/2 of the seventeen stars.
