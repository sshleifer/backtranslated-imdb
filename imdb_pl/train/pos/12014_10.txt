This is by far the most amazing movie I've seen in a long time. Actors presented wonderful characters of the film's characters. The story has been thoroughly presented. The story begins with a young woman from the British Isles and her father traveling by steamboat to Nauvoo, Illinois. She became a member of the LDS Church and he did not. She thinks she is ridiculous because of traveling and discourages. He encourages him to read about Joseph Smith, the Prophet. Here begins the story of the Prophet Joseph Smith. The film accurately depicts his life and the history of the LDS Church at the same time. It was graphics sometimes, but it was needed. Emotional expression was very credible, which caused my emotions to spill over. Filming was amazing. The way in which history was presented was moving. After the movie ended, we just sat there, unable to move. I was stunned. For people who know very little about Joseph Smith, the Mormon Prophet, I encourage you to see this. If nothing else, how to get some understanding of your life. For those who are members of the Church, I invite you to see this. It will increase your testimony of this amazing man. This is a must see.
