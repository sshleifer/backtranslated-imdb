Buster absolutely shines in this episode, which is the only vehicle I saw at the end of my career, which allowed him to perform a physical (and quiet!) Comedy that made him famous. It's still a shock when I hear his gravel voice in the talkie sequences - his voice is the only thing I do not care about when it comes to Buster - but his ability to get pratfall is still unmatched. He even repeats some of the gags used in his early two rehersos with Roscoe Arbuckle. <br /> <br /> My deepest gratitude to Rod Serling for presenting this episode to us and for giving Buster the full range of genius. He did not have much time (one episode) to do it, but it is a touching tribute to Hollywood's greatest genius.
