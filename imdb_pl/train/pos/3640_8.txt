This is one of my favorite sports movies. Dennis Quaid moves and convinces in the part of a man who gave up his dream of being a baseball jug when his arm was thrown at him. As a high school trainer, he challenges his players to win the division championship by telling them that if he tries, he will try the baseball team. They win (partly because of the practice of batting with a coach who can jump over 90 miles per hour), and he keeps his side of the contract - and is signed! <br /> <br /> If you've ever decided to try something new and scary as an adult, the story of Jim Morris will resonate with you. It is moving and inspiring, and man's relationships are real. <br /> <br /> Inspiration is not the only reason I am hiring this one. Dennis Quaid is simply completely innocent, and a baseball movie about a handsome man changing a diaper is my idea of ​​heaven. Lord, if you feel like me, check it out.
