I never thought that an old cartoon would bring tears to my eyes! When I first bought Casper & Friends: Spooking About Africa, I really wanted to see the first Casper drawing titled The Friendly Ghost (1945), but when I saw the next drawing, There Good Boos To-Night (1948), I made me break down! I could not believe how sad and tragic it was that I saw Casper's fox killed! I've never seen anything like it in other Casper cartoons! This is the saddest of all! It was so depressing that I just could not watch it. It's like seeing Lassie's death at the end of the movie. I know it's a classic, but for us, old cartoon fans, there is too much to cope like me! If I wanted to watch something old and classic, I prefer to watch something happy and fun! But when I think about this cartoon Kacper, I think about my cats!
