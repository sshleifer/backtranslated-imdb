John Waters (Happy Birthday, John!) He chose something away from the deliberately disgusting things he usually does, making him a parody of the star / art world. Edward Furlong plays the title character, a teenager from the working class in Baltimore who loves to photograph things. When a New York agent (Lili Taylor) discovers his work, he offers him a great break that he accepts. But when he reaches the goal, he has to think about everything. <br /> <br /> Basically, "Pecker" looks at how he loses his friends and his normal life when he becomes a star. The kind of things that we can expect, of course, but when managing Waters there are always a few things that can shock us (you will know them when you see them). I certainly recommend it. There are also Christina Ricci, Mink Stole and Patty Hearst.
