In the first scenes of this film, the man fired shots through the hotel room into the bathroom of another man and blew out all the lights. It must have been very strong until 1936, but rather a way out and had nothing to do with the movie, Robin Hood did not come as far as I saw. However, Bette Davis (Daisey Appleby), "The Whales of August", "87", she was very young and attractive and played one of the best roles in a long career in Hollywood. Daisey never ceased to tease or be very sexy with her nightgowns and the so-called bathing suit on the yacht with George Brent (Johnny Jones), "Spiral Staircase," 46. Daisey even proposed a marriage with Johnny in the Ferris wheel upside down, and even got a black eye. Davis and Brent made a great couple, one was supposed to be very rich and the other a very poor reporter. On stage, Davis and Brent had a really hot affair, which is a good reason why sparks appeared when these two appeared in this movie. If you liked Bette Davis and George Brent, this is a movie for you!
