I saw this movie as a kid with the Creature Feature when I lived in New York. It was quite a scary movie, though not as good as the Horror Hotel. I just bought this movie on DVD and it's different from what I remember because on the DVD I bought there are several scenes where actors speak French and / or Italian and have no subtitles. Then the other actors answer in English what has been said. How strange. Also in the DVD box the names of some actors are written differently than on IMDb. <br /> <br /> Besides, this movie is different because the character Elsie takes off his clothes and provides the act shot in one scene, and in another scene Julia tries to force Elizabeth (Barbara Steele) to come in contact with her, pushing her on bed and kissing while Steele is resting. This scene existed in the television version, but it was very edited. I wonder if there is any additional material that could be included in the remastered ultra-edition? It seems sad that some of those old classic low-budget classics have been combined with bits and sold in all edited versions. Where are the mother tape and all unused material? <br /> <br /> In addition to the first boring twenty minutes before delivering Allen to the castle, the rest of the movie is quite good. There are not many special effects (but Herbert's face after Julia's clubs is good). The frightening atmosphere and strange, exotic and seductive look of Barbara Steele make the film much better than it should. I can honestly say that if Barbara Steele were not in this film, it would be a big zero. She's making a ten movie!
