I really liked this episode. Seeing Flash, Cyborg, Green Arrow and Aquaman (even though everything he did was swimming) made my eyes widen. I've been waiting for most of the Justice League founders who are trying to overthrow Lex Luthor. It sounds a little out of the question, but making a live performance in the Justice League will definitely make me have a reason to push everything I usually do during the week to watch one episode. This is the thrill of watching this episode. I would like this episode to become a bit longer, like a two-hour exception, because I felt that one hour of the Justice League would not be enough. Now, before I bore you (unless I have my wandering), I just want to say that Smallville is nice again. In a sense, he lost his touch when the show began to focus on Lana. But I'm sure the authors will simply return to this loop. :( So enjoy this episode, who knows when the next good one will come in. Catch it again on Thursday, February 22, if you missed the first airing.
