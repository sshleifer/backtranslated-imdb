"The Notorious Bettie Page" (2005) <br /> <br /> Director: Mary Harron <br /> <br /> Performers: Gretchen Mol, Chris Bauer, Lili Taylor, Sarah Paulson and David Strathairn <br /> < br /> MPAA rating: "R" (nudity, sexual content and some languages) <br /> <br /> It seems that every celebrity makes a biography about his life. From Ray Charles to Johnny Cash, biopics are now very elegant. "The Notorious Bettie Page" is the latest one that will be released on DVD. He presents Gretchen Mol as the most famous pin-up model in the world, Bettie Page, and was filmed mainly in black and white with some fragments in color. However, unlike "Ray", "Walk the Line" and "Finding Neverland", this movie will not be the one to be watched at this year's Oscars. This film lacks the emotional resonance seen in other biopsies, and most of the more dramatic moments in Bettie Page's life are either completely ignored or only suggested. This does not mean, however, that it is a bad movie. In fact, "Notorious Bettie Page" is a fully entertaining and satisfying movie - a solid work of cinema. This film focuses more on the exciting career of Page and the thin line between sexuality and pornography. The film is shot with enthusiasm and care, and the director Mary Harron captures the look and style of the period in which most filmmakers only dream about it. <br /> <br /> Everyone knows Bettie Page (played by Mol). Do you know her as an icon or a simple porn star, you know her. She is a woman who exerted a very profound influence on American culture, revealing more skin than was considered appropriate at the time. Most people now know her as one of the first sex symbols in America - the legend of many models, especially those from Playboy and other adult magazines. She was alive at a time when showing just one inch of the body under the rubbish could cause someone to be arrested, and Page-style shots were just what pushed American public opinion into the hustle and bustle. In fact, the photos began a full investigation of the common decency and difference between harmless movies and pornography. <br /> <br /> The performances on "The Notorious Bettie Page" are absolutely wonderful when Gretchen Mol stands out. Her performance as Bettie Page is simply brilliant. I understand that when the role was announced, many people were skeptical. Her name is not one that immediately strikes me when I think about big performances. Now it will be. She completely conquered this role and drew me into her sensitive, yet deeply captivating show. David Strathairn is freshly baked in last year's "Good Night and Good Luck", in which he gave one of the best performances in 2005. Here he gives one more great performance, although it is slightly under-utilized. I was shocked at how limited his screen time is, but quality over quantity is always the most important aspect of any good movie. The only spectacle I saw with Lili Taylor was "The Haunting" (1999). While most people ignored the movie, I found it pleasant, if not completely shallow, horror and I always thought Taylor was completely credible as an emotionally distraught Nell. Here, Taylor gives another credible result. It gives a very toned appearance and provides the perfect performance to compliment what Gretchen Mol. <br /> <br /> After everything was said and done, I realized that "The Notorious Bettie Page" can not be compared to other biopics, such as "Finding Neverland" and "Walk the Line" . This is incomparable because it tells the story of a woman and her career from beginning to end. Her personal life is briefly suggested, but in fact her influence on the world becomes the culmination point. We watch the movie knowing that Page will ultimately reveal everything and know what impact its decisions will have, but we rarely show the impact they will have on her personal life. She is a woman who never looked back and could change constantly. In the end, she was an adult model who became a Christian missionary. This film is not dramatic. This could have included fictional moments of the sobbing hysterical and begging God to forgive her. It could show Page running and screaming through the rain trying to escape the ghosts of its past, but not. "Notorious Bettie Page" tells a simple story and it is something rare in today's standards. Fortunately, it is quite refreshing. <br /> <br /> Final Thought: "The Notorious Bettie Page" is a relaxing movie about absolutely amazing cinematography. <br /> <br /> Overall rating: 9/10 (A)
