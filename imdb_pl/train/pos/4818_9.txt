I always have a bit of distrust about watching British movies from the era because I usually find bland and boring scenarios (such as Vanity Fair or The Other Boleyn Girl) but with a great production project, European landscapes and the thick British accents that make that films suggest artistic value that they do not really have. Fortunately, the excellent film "Young Victoria" does not fall into this situation and deserves an enthusiastic recommendation because of its fascinating history, excellent performances by Emily Blunt, Paul Bettany and Jim Broadbante, as well as costumes and locations that unexpectedly make the film quite rich in view. And I say "unexpectedly" because I usually do not pay much attention to these details. <br /> <br /> "Victorian Era" was (in my humble opinion) one of the key points in modern civilization, not only in social but also scientific, artistic and cultural aspects. To be honest, I did not really know about the beginnings of that the era, or maybe because of that, I liked the simplification of political and economic events that prepared the landing of the modern era so much. I also like the way in which Queen Victoria is portrayed as a young and intelligent monarch whose decisions were not always good, but at least inspired their good intentions. I also saw a very interesting presentation of the romance between Victoria and Prince Albert, because he is also interested in combining the Intellects and the emotions he evokes. The only thing I found in this movie is that the screenwriter Julian Fellowes used stereotypes of romantic cinema in love story, something that does not fit his scenario. /> <br /> I really liked The Young Victoria, and it really surprised her very much. I hope that more films from the era will follow the example of this film: costumes and landscapes should act as support for an interesting story, not a replacement.
