I did not see this movie in the theater. I admit to anti-Vinnie Barbarino bias. Who the hell was John Travolta, who was making movies? I remember the Oscar transmission this year, when Travolta looked completely devastated when he did not win. How does he laugh when the "real" actors are in the game? I'm sorry, John, you should win. After catching this film years ago, I fell in love with the whole film. Bud, Sissy, Uncle Bob, Wes, everything is done beautifully. I also admit that I will never give it when I surf the sewers. I need to stop and watch. Over the years I have learned to do most of the dialogues, dance with my thumbs on my waist and I've learned to appreciate Travolta more. The only disappointing thing for me was an oversight on the soundtrack of some Urban Cowboy songs. The film "Looking for love" defines the movie, but Urban Cowboy was full of classics that could not be found on the soundtrack. It should be a double CD ........
