There is so much love in this beloved comedy. Anyone who has ever built or bought a home, or even run out of space, will find that there is more to Mr. Blanding's difficult situation than the grain of truth. Melvyn Douglas, with a great comedic flame, both narrations and acts as Blandings attorney and voice of reason. Like Myrna Loy is at its best as a rather scattered but extremely patient wife. But Grant's is the best game. It is an American everyman, particularly important at the time of the premiere of this film, when the nation was in the grip of a shortage of housing after the end of the war. Topics are universal, lack of money, workload, fear of infidelity. Yes, it is terribly neat, but you have to remember that it was a time when the world was just emerging from a terrible war and wanted a happy ending. This is still valid and I have to describe the poor reviews that I consider to be current preferences for stupid comics. The look of the movie is clever, and some comedies are great, especially at the beginning. Although he may lose some of his social significance, almost sixty years after its release, it is still a jewel.
