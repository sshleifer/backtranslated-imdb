I really liked "Doctor Mordrid." It is a low-budget movie that may be daunting for some people, but I do not have a problem with it. I admire it even more, considering that it is much more entertaining than the crap that Hollywood awakens every year. It is a pity that I did not get the cinema version; I do not know about anyone else, but I would go and see him in cinemas. "Doctor Mordrid" is a very funny science fiction film that almost everyone can enjoy, especially when it comes to science fiction, like me. I do not understand why this is a movie with an R grade; only one f-word is spoken and there are no gruesome death scenes, nor is there any blood. A timeless rivalry between wizards Anton and Kabal (Anton wanted to use his powers to save the human race, while Kabal wanted to enslave them), gave the tale a sense of spell, while the mythical plot added charm to the story itself. Basically, this movie is just cool to watch. But there is one unintentional thing in this movie: seeing Jeffrey Combs holding a straight face in this stupid blue cape and suit. It makes me laugh every time I see it. But digressing ... In any case, acting is great; the main characters (Anton and his friend Samantha) are very nice; Anton is friendly and welcoming, and Samanta is friendly. Plus, the settings were great. The floating island in another dimension was very cold; however, we only see him twice; it would be great to see more scenes. The main setting was also very well cared for; Anton's apartment is very spacious and has cool devices, especially the monitoring system he uses to track events around the world. He even has a raven who keeps in his apartment named Edgar. Overall, it's a great movie; it was cool to watch, and the main actors put a lot into their roles. If you find anywhere, who rents "Doctor Mordrida", you should rent it (or, in my case, buy it. For sure the money was well spent)! <br /> <br /> My rating: 8 stars out of ten. <br /> <br />
