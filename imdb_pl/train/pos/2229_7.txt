I've read some awful things about this movie, so I was prepared for the worst. "Misleading. Although some of these accusations may be merit, this movie was not as frightening as an average DVD programmer. In fact, he had aspirations. He tried something beyond the typical nonsense of the monster / slass. And for God, there are some interesting things happening. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Barbeau is a miracle. He wears the film straight on his shoulders. <br /> <br /> It does not mean it's a masterpiece. UNHOLY finally falls under the weight of his own ambitions. There are too many (unexplained) threads trying to co-exist. And the plot gaps created by time travel are never really addressed: for example, if Hope knows her mother is angry and ultimately kills her brother, why does not she simply kill Ma in the first sequence of the movie? It looks like it would escape from traveling to the future to do it. <br /> <br /> Even so, I give UNHOLY points for the test. A little ambition is not a bad thing.
