Fact: Stargate SG-1 is a bad science-fiction series. <br /> <br /> There is no escape. How much you try to justify or explain Stargate SG-1 remains a bad science-fiction series. <br /> <br /> Stargate SG-1 borrows and steals ideas vigorously. Special special effects are not as impressive as they could be, and the action will not blow you out of the chair. Or a couch for that. <br /> <br /> But that's where I really think that Stargate SG-1 deserves all the credit it can get, for every episode or stolen idea that I think you can count at least one bad sci-fi movie, which is actually worse than a one-hour television episode. <br /> <br /> In fact, some episodes could have been probably 90 minutes and were still better than most movies. <br /> <br /> And the ability to maintain this quality throughout the show and continue the story is what makes Stargate SG-1 special. <br /> <br /> I am very picky in my choices. I only follow one or two TV series and keep quite high standards, which surprised me even more when I found myself in a trap. <br /> <br /> So for those who decide to brush Stargate SG-1 so far another cheesy science-fiction series, no. Hold on to it and you'll see what I'm talking about.
