I am grateful to Cesar Montano and his team for bringing back the once-dying Visayan film. "Panaghoy" hopes to be the precursor of rebirth in this vernacular language (which preaches more speakers than Tagalog). Details of the dialect and lifestyle closely resemble this region of the Philippines. The downside: the simplicity and thinness of the American antagonist. Another element that I did not appreciate was the lack of authenticity of the "periodic" costume with the same form, and above all its bright red set, which I suppose was supposed to go to the roadster of the 1930s. Without these small but glaring details, Panaghoy would be at least 9 out of 10 in my opinion - daghang salamat, Manoy Cesar! Appendix: this film certainly defeats Peque Gallaga's "Oro, Plata, Mat", which gave a different view of Visayas during World War II. Alos, there are fragments in which the pictures refer to Spielberg's "Purple Color" and the story begins to resemble "Noli Me Tangere".
