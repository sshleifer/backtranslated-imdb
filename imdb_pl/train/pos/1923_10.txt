8 simple dating rules My teenage daughter had a good start. Tom Shadyac was extremely talented in the project. This meant that the comedy would be no less spectacular and exactly what happened: the show remains one of the freshest, funniest and wisest performances performed for a long time. Every line, facial expression, choice of casting, stage, everything was perfect. There was not one episode, after which I thought: "A man who was not as good as the rest." Everyone was special. Again, this is the kind of perfectionism we expect from Tom. For those who do not know, Tom Shadyac is the director of Ace Ventura (the first film), The Nutty Professor (first film) and Liar Liar. Pretty life story. He is the producer here, not the director, but his magical touch is perceptible in every episode. The family consists of: <br /> <br /> Father: Paul Hennessy (John Ritter): a nice, somewhat neurotic, he can be a pusher, from time to time he works as a sports writer. John, unfortunately, died in 2003, leaving pleasant memories and almost contemplation of appeal by suits. <br /> <br /> Mother: Cate (Katey Sagal): come on, who did not fall in love with Katey when she played Peg in Married With Children? Al Bundy was our hero. We viewers gave him respect and love that he never had. But without the nonchalant, parasitic, lazy lifestyle of Peg, Al would probably be the next dad in Chicago, instead of the mess that caused Peg (life). Katey was MILF then and is still: brune now (instead of red) and just as always. Cate is a conservative mother and a loving wife. I know it sounds boring, but comedy matches perfectly. <br /> <br /> The Ditzy Blonde Daughter: Bridget (played to perfection by Kaley Cuoco): He almost never played an idiot so well. In addition to Gob on Arrested Development, Bridget may also be the initiator of any awards granted to this archetype. Bridget is shallow, self-centered, not very bright and a little quirky in his eyes. He plays a stupid blonde better than anyone IMO. Perfection. One of the most important points of the program. <br /> <br /> The Overlooked Geeky Daughter: Kerry (Amy Davidson): brune and geek, does not love life or circumstances. Most of the time, he feels overlooked, underestimated and neglected. She is the younger sister of Bridget (in fact she is older than her), and the extremely opposite personalities and brains of two people cause endless clashes, largely for our entertainment. <br /> <br /> Son: Rory (Martin Spanjers): he was the second funniest IMO character before Ritter left, then John passes, new characters appear, and Rory is not a smart word breaker he used to do: he was mainly about character David Spade. <br /> <br /> These characters were the main ones in John Ritter's time. Unfortunately, the extremely funny Larry Miller (one of my favorites) did not get much time on the screen. He played a co-worker / competitor of Paul. After the aortic dissection cost Ritter's life in 2003 (September 11), the performance was interrupted for a moment. No one thought he could come back, but later, with some new additions. It started with the second phase of the show, and the new characters were: <br /> <br /> Strict, confident school director: Ed (Adam Arkin): I saw Adam here and there on a talk show. It was the first time I saw him doing something. I am impressed and I use it. His performance was very impressive. Sad that he was not brought back earlier. He also plays Cate's potential love interest after Paul's passing. Gradual progress at this point (which would sound crazy at first) brings many praise to the creators. It was done slowly, carefully and perfectly, with constant respect for Paul (Ritter). <br /> <br /> Grandfather of Attitude: Jim Egan (James Garner): surprisingly welcome in the series, he was a cannon of karma for endless "old" jokes, mainly by ... <br /> <br /> 35-year-old unemployed, mom's shaky half-brother: CJ (played by the extremely funny heights by David Spade): I knew that Spade is funny, I just did not know THAT was FUN. Somehow the very familiar presence of Spade is sensed in its form (as opposed to a separate character), which is understandable because it is a comic and is on a comedy show. It's a strange feeling to see someone borrowing a lot of David Spade's performance in movies, talk shows and features (awards shows, etc.) and provides excellent spellcasting and spade comedy, except he IS Spade. I mean, you realize that you're not trying to play someone else or a whole new character: he's a foolish, funny Spade we've met, and takes this pleasantly entertaining formula to the absolute top. Every poem that he uttered, every sarcasm he initiated, all classics literally. Spade was CRAZY-funny; so, so funny. <br /> <br /> The humor and drama of the series were raised after the show returned, but the audience thought: "John has passed, it will not be the same anymore". This is understandable, given that we are talking about a group of people (American viewers) who gave 'Yes Dear' a free ride, but caused Andy Richter to control the universe so that it would be canceled in a short time. With the increase in the quality of the program, his grades have dropped. Soon, unfortunately, it was gone. <br /> <br /> And I've saved the best at the end: Married With Children's fans are on refreshments. And boy, what a feast it was. I'm still shaking, remembering that. It's a surprise so good it would be mad to spoil it, even if I legally do it under the pretext of "spoiler ...". Suffice it to say that you will NEVER forget. I know I will not :-)
