It is a bloody mess and quite convincing. Corbin Bernson proves this film with his skillful portrait of a practicing title maniac. Linda Hoffman plays his cheating wife and is very easy in the eye - unfortunately for her, a small "tryst" with a guy brings severe punishment in a way that a good doctor knows best - a pity for this pretty smile! The last half hour of the film is devoted to the hero Bernson, who completely loses it, and the spotlight falls on a young actress named Virginya Keehne. Extremely talented performer, focuses on the brightness of the headlamps from the moment the camera turns off. Nice legs too!
