Throughout the country, especially in the political landscape, people with any political ambitions should take some time to watch this movie. The film is called "City Hall" and with a small imagination its abstract can take place anywhere in America. It just so happens that it opens in New York. Here is the story of a popular politician, the mayor of John Pappas (Al Pacino), who has enough sense to manage a large metropolitan city with little effort. His right hand is none other than deputy mayor Kevin Calhoun (John Cusack), an equally brilliant man whose ambitions are related to his mentor and both seemed destined for a higher position. Everything points to this, as long as the police shootout does not start an investigation led by Marybeth Cogan (Bridget Fonda), who believes that the guilt points to the town hall and the mayor. Six-year-old boy and death of a police officer are accused of a professional criminal whose dubious freedom leads to visible cover-ups through political payments and corruption in the city with trade union leaders such as Danny Aiello played by Frank Anselmo, corrupt judicial officials such as Judge Walter Stern. (Martin Landau) and mafia chiefs, such as Paul Zapatti (Anthony Franciosa), who are deeply involved. It also involves party officials such as Larry Schwartz (Richard Schiff) who works in a trial office in New York. But the bond between the mayor and his deputy is picked up by accidental shooting. A great vehicle for Cusack and a confident candidate for the classics. ****
