My Take: He uses his familiar story with excellent performances and some real moments of excitement. <br /> <br /> The plot is known. The innocent man is framed in a plot to murder the president of the United States, the first traitor to the secret service of the United States. When other secret service agents pursue him, he tries to prove his innocence. Of course, we know his innocence, and the real culprit is just around the corner, but SENTINEL is still enjoying me. At the time, in which thrillers are reduced to too absurd and too abundant in action sequences, THE SENTINEL is a good lollipop for all those good, old-fashioned crime thrillers. Knowledge of the story is emphasized by neat, thrilling sequences and great performances. <br /> <br /> Michael Douglas, the perfect man to work, is a long-time Secret Service agent Pete Garrison, who is framed for being part of the plot to kill the president. Former colleagues from the secret services (Kiefer Sutherland and Eva Longoria) are chasing Harrison when he tries to find out who is behind the possible murder and traitor in the Secret Service. This leads to many chase scenes which, surprisingly (and thankfully), are never unbelievable. The script also offers a sub-theme with Garrison having an affair with the first lady (played by Kim Basinger). Fortunately, it was not necessary, like most threads for this type of movie. <br /> <br /> The director of the film is Clark Johnson (S.W.A.T.), who manages to make the film look good. Although many criticized it as "there should be a TV movie," I have to disagree. I agree, this is not a perfect movie, and many of them are inspired by other action thrills and political intrigues, such as IN THE LINE OF FIRE or an episode of TV series 24 (which is very similar to Sutherland's style and star)), but even this one the film transfers the plot to serious heights and does not give up even smaller details. The performances are great (with the highest cast, I'm sure they will be, even with the script by-the-numbers. <br /> <br /> In total, I admit it is 1/2, not perfect, but not far. < br /> <br /> Mark: *** 1/2 out of 5.
