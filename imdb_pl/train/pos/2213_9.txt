Wow, it was a totally compelling film. I could not believe I was waking up so late to watch it, but it was late ounce, I started watching, I could not stop, it had a full range of very good cast members, even Eartha Kitt and Ruby Dee Forrest Whittaker and James Earl Jones and many other well-known actors and actresses, it was more than a look into history, it was an open eye to another part of society that people do not know about, and maybe even are ashamed to speak. I have never heard of a book or film on this subject before and this is something that black history never only refers to because it was reserved and mixed, I highly recommend this film
