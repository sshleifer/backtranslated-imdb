A beautiful and moving film that deserves to be watched more than it may seem. Semra Turan plays Aicha, a Turkish second generation immigrant who is trying to break the form. Neither at home with a moderately conservative Muslim family nor with her liberal Danish friends, Aicha's martial arts experience becomes a struggle to find herself and has the strength to afford what she wants to be, despite her family and friends. <br /> <br /> The director Natasha Arthy manages to balance introspection and narrative, thanks to which she has depth without becoming a heavy philosophical discourse, and drawing on choreographic skills, Xian Gao pays off in spectacular battle sequences. In the end, this is the stunning debut of Semra Turan, who gives this spirit to the film. The raw charisma and the required skills of martial arts are complimented by the heart to make her personal drama credible. <br /> <br /> It's worth taking a moment.
