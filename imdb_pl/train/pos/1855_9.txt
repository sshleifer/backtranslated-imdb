Not seeing all the movies released in 2002, I can not say that this is the best movie of the year. I can say that this is the best movie I've seen all year. <br /> <br /> Most American films depicting black obsessed with American interest in "racial relations" or falling into the ghetto plates in the city center, with every conceivable sterotype gushing with ebony slang. Antwone Fisher is proud of himself in this regard: the race is irrelevant, except for one fight that may or may not be provoked by racist insults. <br /> <br /> Antwone Fisher's history is one that should find a resonance with every empathic unit. He is unappreciated and thoughtful, portrayed by Derek Luke. Denzel Washington, of course, using his star power to make the film, mostly sticks to the background and allows the movie to be the story of Antwone Fisher. <br /> <br /> At a time when BET and popular culture in general want to maintain the gheetisation of a large number of Americans (and Canadians too, you know), this is a film that appeals to humanity in general. I only hope that the non-black audience will go to see this film for this humanity, instead of avoiding it, because they feel that there are no heroes in the film or actors with whom they could identify. It would be a sad commentary on racial relations in North America itself. <br /> <br />
