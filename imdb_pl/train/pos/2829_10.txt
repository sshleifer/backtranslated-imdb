Without a doubt, Private Lessons II is the biggest movie I've ever seen. Japanese imports (poorly) translated into English, it's a pleasure to watch. It does not make much sense, but it does not matter. This is the best comedy that is never deliberately fun. <br /> <br /> The movie is rare and unavailable on video, but I caught it a few times late, late at night on the cable. My recorded copy has been watched several dozen times, because slowly, personally, I present this film jewel to the world. <br /> <br /> Joanna Pacula plays the tutor / lover Ken, our hero. (Apparently, she just worked on her check.) Ken is played by Goro Inagaki from the Japanese pop band SMAP, who gives his all and has great hair throughout the movie. Stacy Edwards, from the fame of "In the Company of Men", also appears in the film and is probably happy that she later found another film work. <br /> <br /> You need at least three views to find out what the story is. During repetitive viewing, you can enjoy elements such as the abnormal amount of vases Ken has in his home (at least 50) or that Ken is wearing a shirt with embossed corn husks in the final of the film. <br /> <br /> The movie is predictable, but highly cited. My friends and I reconstruct the whole scene. Yes, it looks like we are bad losers and we are ... but we are losers who saw "Private Lessons II". Be one of ten people in the world who have seen this movie. You will thank me for that.
