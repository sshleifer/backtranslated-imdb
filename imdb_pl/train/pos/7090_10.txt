Linear motion in a non-linear structure. The fact is that in 12 monkeys, time is now between the present, the future and the past. However, the linearity of the film can not be avoided: it is the work of the projector, developing the narrative. <br /> <br /> What we see underlying the subject of time is reflection on the inevitability of our actions. The world of this movie by Terry Gilliam is a world with little space for free will. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning we are informed about the prophecy of the schizophrenic, according to which plague will rule the Earth in 1997, forcing few survivors to live underground - the only place the virus can not influence. <br /> <br /> Cole's mission (Willis) is clear: return to the mid-1990s to investigate anything and who is related to the release of the virus. There is no way to change the past: all you can do is gather information that can help present scientists (this is for us, viewers, there is a future) to find a cure. Not to change what happened (the past is inevitable), but to make the present better. <br /> <br /> In his "returns" in time, Cole gradually approaches a striking dilemma: his life in the past is better than his life in the present. <br /> <br /> The latter is dark and dehumanizing, controlled by totalitarian scientists who choose "volunteers" (this word is extremely ironic) to embark on a journey into the past. <br /> <br /> Researchers have not yet achieved the highest level of time travel achievements, and Cole ends up in the wrong time - later, later in the story, he will prove his sanity for psychiatrist Kathryn (Stowe). <br /> <br /> We see, through the evolution of the story, that linearity and non-linearity intertwine in circular temporality. <br /> <br /> There is more than one moment in which the scene is the first and ends almost the last - and certainly the climate appears -. It changes, as recalled by Cole's memories that appear in his dreams. <br /> <br /> At the airport, a man is shot while running, armed with someone else. The blonde runs behind the murdered. <br /> <br /> It's a scene that connects the past (in which Cole is a child who visits the airport with his parents), present (time of narration) and future (adult Cole) Throughout the narration, Cole has the feeling that he has already lived the reality he is experiencing. His prophetic dreams are proof that you can not escape or avoid what happened. The agents who shot him stop him from killing the mad scientist Dr. Peters (Morse), who is responsible for the spread of the disease. <br /> <br /> This can not be changed. And in the case of Cole, what will happen, what will be. Eternally. <br /> <br /> The film is not fully understood by many. For me, no less than a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Other good films with a similar theme: "Return to the future trilogy" (has a different viewpoint on the figure of a "mad scientist" and although divides the atmosphere of disintegration - especially in the second movie - it is much more optimistic than work Gilliam, this is a strange photo from Hollywood). <br /> <br /> In another register is "Wild Strawberries", one of Bergman's masterpieces, It entails a striking and instructive journey to the past through dreams and memories. <br /> <br /> I never watched "La Jet√©e", but only because I can not find it.
