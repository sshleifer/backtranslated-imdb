Here Italy (I write from Venice). Why was it canceled? ABC should give him a chance to build an audience. The cast (Hope Davis, Campbell Scott, Erika Christensen, Zoe Saldana, Jay Hernandez and Bridget Moynahan) is one of the best I've seen in recent times. We need more shows that make viewers feel intelligent, not thoughtless drones. I hope that ABC will reconsider its decision or another station will pick it up.
