The name Jackie Chan is synonymous with stunts. This movie has never let you down. The best pursuit scene and the last scene of fumbling with the pole are so risky than one miracle if you know the meaning of fear. This film is very close to the best Jackie, which is PROJECT A. But the main difference is that PROJECT A has three stars in which, as in this movie, Jackie wears the whole movie on her shoulders. This is perhaps the main reason why this movie has made Jackie the biggest martial arts star, then Bruce Lee. too. What makes this film work is the ability of the Venerable One to show his venerable side, which he signed with a typical hero of martial arts. After this film there was a continuation which was good, but was quite tame compared to its predecessor.
