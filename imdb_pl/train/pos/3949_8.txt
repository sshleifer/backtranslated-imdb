Like many people on this site, I only saw the movie once when it first appeared in 1971. Some scenes remain in my memory, and the general feeling of anxiety is, as I remember, it concerns me. I would be fascinated to see him again if he was ever made available for home video. <br /> <br /> Possible spoiler: I wonder if anyone would agree that the basic settings of the story and characters could have come from the 1960s The British film, originally entitled City of the Dead, changed the name Horror Hotel to an American album? There are some similarities to the later British film The Wicker Man. <br /> <br /> One detail stays with me many years after watching the movie. This is a small but significant moment at the beginning of the film. As I recall, the minister and his wife stopped helping some people by the way, around 1870, Somewhere in the west. Friendly appearances that Ray Milland presents to himself and his daughter Yvette Mimieux, a beautiful young dumb woman. While the preacher helps Ray Milland in the wagon, the rattlesnake slides in and glances in dangerously, unnoticed by any character except Yvette Mimieux. He does not look scared at all, but he stares at the snake with quiet concentration until it disappears. In this strange, small moment, we realize that there is something unusual in these seemingly normal people, although the possible danger for the minister and his wife remains for a long time unclear and uncertain. <br /> <br /> This little scene stays with me live after all these years, along with many others. The film has a disturbing feature that does not let go, and it is not surprising that people remember it so vividly. Someone should share this video home!
