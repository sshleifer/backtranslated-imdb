I'm glad that users (from this date) who liked this movie are now approaching. I do not understand people who did not like this movie - it looks like they were expecting a serious (?!?!?) Treatment! Come on, how the hell can you seriously take the assumption of a deadly snowman? The filmmakers knew that it was a stupid assumption and did not try to deny it. A simple delivery of scenes actually makes FUNNY! Yes, there are times when low-budget programs (such as an explosion scene), but I think that an expensive look would take the fun of the movie! So if you like B movies, and a stupid message appeals to you, you'll love "Jack Frost".
