PAGE 3 **** of 4 Stars <br /> <br /> Madhvi (Konkona Sen) enters her boyfriend's house and is empty. He looks here and there, and then goes to his bedroom and you get a picture - "Ah! other girl ?? this two-faced baddie and actually his two competitive times, but this time it's GUY. And I say "Brilliant!" <br /> <br /> END OF SPOILERS (The above scene is not really a spoiler ... but for me it was so, I did not want to risk it) <br /> <br /> When I was asked how this movie looks like, my friend replied "oh, it's just an exposition of people from P3", which made me believe that I'm watching a stupid movie badly, if nothing else. When I went to the theater, I thought, "You better take a pen and paper to jot down bad things about this film," but it turned out that I was completely wrong? and then a little bit, because I could only collect good. This movie was great. Great, not because it is an unusual and non-commercial cinema, such as a plot, but because of the cunning in the script and how this movie tells you how to deal with the film genius, what could be a stupid and senseless movie if it was administered in the wrong hands. /> <br /> Konkona Sen Sharma is a grace. She is so damn beautiful that she perfectly took her role as if she were born to play this role. One of the most charming actresses I've ever seen. But it is not the only show that is good in the film, it is Sandhya Mridul, Boman Irani and Atul Kulkarni. Especially Sandhya Mridul, who is just shooting to the screen. (And guess what even the most accented Tara Sharma says normally) <br /> <br /> Films appear with some stupid old parties of silenced movie industry stars and others the movie will be about. And for about half an hour you feel almost the same through the movie. But then the movie picks up the pace by grabbing a good storyline and never lets it go. Even Boman Irani agrees with this statement? "It was a good story, Madhvi." (Thank you). The great thing about it is that it raises the question of how stupid these people are and does not manage to do it, and also solves social problems and does not make them boring. Finally, the entire roller coaster ride and Madhvi inform us, smiling to all these people. That's why I love watching movies. An ecstatic movie. The screenplay is beautiful, clever and witty.
