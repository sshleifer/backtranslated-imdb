It will probably not be the best comedy of the year, a few too many coincidences and holes in the story. However, we are talking about a film in which the attacker and the seller of white bread become buddies, so a few whims should not be too much of a surprise. Brosnan is excellent in this role, he disappeared from the wooden James Bond (the role in which he was wasted). If he manages to maintain such quality, I hope he will continue to create comedies. Greg Kinnear is also perfect as a simple Brosnan man. I read some negative comments about Hope Davis, but I thought she was pretty good as a housewife with a deeply hidden dark side. There are lots of good chuckles when Brosnan exaggerates and a few scenes where I almost died of laughter. My father (consultant) almost lost him when Julian describes himself as a "facilitator". As in the case of "Grosse Pointe Blank", the next comedy of the hit, humor can be very dark. If you're in, get ready to have fun.
