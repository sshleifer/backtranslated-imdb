I saw a series of Thin Man - Powell and Loy are definitely great, but in Powell and Arthur's chemistry there is something incredibly sweet. Jean Arthur SHINES, when he looks at Powell. There is an undoubted jump between them. This film may not be proof of the Thin Man series, but undeniably makes up for it with charm. While I was watching this, I thought for certain that Powell was having an affair with Arthur outside the screen. My friends thought the same. This is one movie in which I would like to go back in time (to roll up and block Powell's lips!). Powell, Lawrence Bradford, is probably the closest thing to a "perfect man." Ok, that sounds too funny, but I can not resist.
