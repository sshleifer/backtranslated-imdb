The performance tells the story of two sisters living together. Holly being younger has problems with teenagers on the other hand, her sister Val has a job, boyfriend, fianc√© problems like most women in the world. They try to support each other, sometimes they make mistakes, but they do not give up and continue. And the show also concerns friendship. Priorities in life. I loved this program so much. It's funny, and the actors are so good. I'm really sad that the show is over. I keep watching replays from time to time :) Amanda Bynes is very talented. Jenny Garth may be new in comedy, but the game really works. She is one of the actresses I like to watch. I like Vince and Holly's relationship, they're very natural. Gary is a natural talent and makes you laugh every time she appears. With Tina, Holly has found a real friend and I really like to spend them. The character Lauren is so funny and is a natural talent. I'd like to see her more. This show really makes you laugh. It is a pity that the concert is not over.
