I have never heard about this movie for a few weeks, but its concept got me interested when I heard it: an American man meets a European woman on his last night in Europe and they spend the night talking together. It aroused my interest, but I never expected it to be so great. Before sunrise, it is a masterpiece, as well as one of the most romantic films on the album. To my surprise, the cynicism of the nineties was completely lacking. You really can not talk about it too much, because there is no real conspiracy, so to speak (although there are many interesting things to talk about, it's kind of like My Dinner With Andre, where is the conversation but it's not ONLY talking it matters), but let me say, look. LOOK AT THIS!
