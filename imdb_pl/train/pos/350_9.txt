I wanted to see Valentine since I saw that Denise Richards and Marley Shelton are in it because they played in my favorite movies. When I watched Valentine, I was amazed at how great the story was. It kills me when I see that it has a low rating because it was not terrible at all. Actors and actresses brilliantly played these parties, and the way they ended was so brilliant and cunning. Some of the scenes were a bit unbelievable and / or weak, and I admit that in a few smaller parts it was a bit boring, but overall it was non-stop funny and full of tension. He had a twisted storyline that made you guess all the way and he does not deserve all nonsense. I recommend this movie to watch at any time, but especially on Valentine's Day, because it will certainly give you a lot of chills. Oh, and do not even pay attention to the OR trailer rating, please, NO ...
