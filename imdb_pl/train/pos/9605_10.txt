Well, I was not sure what the movie would look like, because I only saw a small clip, but I thought it would be good and I was right, I watched it twice the day I got it and this is my favorite movie. <br /> <br /> I think Alison Lohan played the role of beth well, she is such a grateful actress, and the writer had to do a lot of research to find out about bulimia, although the end when Beth is in the hospital after observation 2 Horus because he was told that 1 house is fine, and that the hospitals do not help bulimics, as iv said, which is probably the reason that I'm still at home, even if my sister and mother would like to have me hospitalized like me, have a bulimia, but this is a very grateful movie that I recommend to anyone who has or has no eating disorder or for people who know someone with eating disorders because they can let them into bulimic life and see the world, how they do a bit over the film with grate and recommend it to everyone and everyone
