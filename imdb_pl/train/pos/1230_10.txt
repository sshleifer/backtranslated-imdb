after watching this movie for the third time now I think it's almost the worst movie of Adam. PUNCH DRUNK LOVE IS POOR, I must say at the end, when Dickie is thrown out of the boat is so funny (hair is different than his and I like it when he rejects everyone.) This movie should only be brought in when you're a real fan Adama Sandler. <br /> <br /> the characters are weak compared to his funny films, such as Waterboy, who has the same people in him (Peter Dante), who is one of the killers trying to kill an Australian bird. > <br /> this movie lacks depth and a decent plot line and deserves to be at the bottom 100
