"I just wanted to see you laugh at Purple Rain." It's a great movie. He should be re-evaluated on PG-13. But in any case, Prince's first and biggest movie. Continuation sucked. But I have not seen it for years, so I remember it. The Kid (Prince) has to juggle winning the love of his life, Apollonia (alone), keeping his band together (Revolution like them) and the tension in his family. But his rival band (The Time asself) is ruining his life. Like Morris (alone) tries to steal Apollonia from The Kid. Like Saturday Night Fever, Flashdance and 8 Miles. Really good. Rent it, laugh and cry, and if you love it, buy it.
