I think this movie was reasonably good. It is strange that now Olsen twins are 13 years old and have boys and all. I really enjoyed it when they were young children at Full House. In any case, the casting was good, and the movie was a bit funny. In a sense, I've mixed up all the places of change and their names. It's just an older version of It Takes Two.
