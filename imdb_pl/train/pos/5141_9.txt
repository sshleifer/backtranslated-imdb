I must admit that I did not expect too much to watch this movie in my Japenese film class, but this movie really dispelled me. The director does a great job, following the title of his film, really portraying the madness. I think the fact that this movie is silent adds similarity to madness, helping the viewer experience the inner world of the character and not the world beyond his mind. This movie just added my feelings to foreign silent movies versus the Americans, in that foreign films work much more to train your mind and make you think instead of going to a fluffy movie always with a happy ending, imaginating very little.
