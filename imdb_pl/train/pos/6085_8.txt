Critics are stupid. This film is funny and intelligent. I really liked this movie. Why everyone hates this movie so much. I would like people to love this movie more than not. Ben Stiller and Jack Black are real comedians and have done a lot of work to make this film. I do not see you who make movies like them. So people should just watch and not comment. I like This movie. All right. There are parts that were stupid, but at least they succeeded. Jerry Stiller would love it because this movie has an acting similar to the King Of Queens show. But this is better than this. I can not believe that it was rated as low.
