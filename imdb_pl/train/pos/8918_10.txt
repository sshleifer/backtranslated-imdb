No hidden plans. Clean scifi. All fun. <br /> <br /> I saw the original on TV and I was very scared. I was a child :) <br /> <br /> The original can be appreciated more compared to the new one that I have seen and I forgot. The original, with the participation of the great movie star Steve McQueen (BULLET), is definitely the better and the only version that everyone should see. <br /> <br /> Film production is outdated, but fx has been used to create a time trial of Blob. I was convinced that this thing was moving by itself. 10/10 <br /> <br /> -Zafoid
