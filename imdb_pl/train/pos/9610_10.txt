I cried my heart, watching this movie. I have never suffered from any eating disorder, but I think it must be a very real picture. <br /> <br /> Alison Lohman is excellent! Expresses these feelings extremely well. My teenage years have come back to me so vividly. Anyone who has experienced difficult moments as a child or teenager will be able to refer to this film. I recommend everyone to see it! <br /> <br /> Music is great too - now I've discovered Diana Lorden. <br /> <br /> I am also looking forward to seeing Alison Lohman in White Ol√©ander, because I am convinced that she is great for Agnieszka's role.
