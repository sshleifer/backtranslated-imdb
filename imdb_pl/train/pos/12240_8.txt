If you are a person who is looking for a realistic movie or movie with a strong and credible story, this movie is NOT for you. No - you hate it. However, for those who like sweet, slightly comedic comedies, you will have fun watching this small movie. needed to file a tax return. Although he tries to convince them of the seriousness of their visit, everyone in the family is delighted that they have company. They keep up with him and treat him like family ... and plan to tie him to their daughter Debbie Reynolds. It really is about the entire story. But the film is getting high marks for a funny script and decent acting. Really nice little curio from the late 50's.
