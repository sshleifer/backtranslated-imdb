It was a great episode, one of the best seasons. Correct terror for change, with a story that is much higher than the average MOH episodes if there is such a thing. The man's wife is almost burnt to death in the tragic wreck of the car in which he rode. His airbag was working, not hers. It is burnt out of recognition (great makeup) and there is not much chance of life without a skin graft. BUT, even in a coma, she dies, but restored by modern technology, and when she dies for a few minutes, her spirit appears as a very vengeful ghost. Of course, there is a massacre, as well as extremely bloody killings, as well as several extremely sexy scenes. What more could you ask for, can you ask? Well, not much, because this child has everything and a very satirical ending that should leave a smile on the faces of most viewers. I just loved the direction of Rob Schmidt (Incorrect phrase), he has a great talent for horror. A great episode, I'm definitely buying it.
