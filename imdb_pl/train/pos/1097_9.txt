I stopped giving "Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House "10/10 because of the aspect that makes the 21st century a bit weird: the fact that the black man is a faithful servant (Stepin Fetchita is a bit like). But otherwise the movie is hoot. Playing a couple from New York, Jim (Cary Grant) and Muriel Blandings (Myrna Loy) from the middle class trying to build a home in Connecticut, this movie has something for everyone. she's doing well as just a wife. But Melvyn Douglas adds some real laughter as Jim and Muriel's lawyer, Bill Cole, who seems to have more plans than he says clearly. As for the house itself ... for most of the movie you'll probably feel ambiguous if you want to live there. Builders, contractors and others also provide their share of laughter. <br /> <br /> In total, a comedy classic. Starring Louise Beavers, Reginald Denny, Sharyn Moffett, Connie Marshall and Jason Robards Sr.
