it was a favorite holiday accessory that I would like to release on vhs or dvd, because my 33 RPM is lost, and all the cassettes I created have also gone. <br /> <br /> I'm not even a great John Fan Denver, but he was very impressed with the music that was mostly favorite with muppet (especially Little St. Nick!). It also contained a few little-known songs (original?). <br /> <br /> Even it was done at the end of the 70's this concert had a timeless character. I hope that we will find a copy soon !!!
