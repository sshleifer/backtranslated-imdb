I have no idea how to describe this movie, and I would like to provide others with the same opportunity I had - seeing it without prior knowledge of what to expect. I liked it a lot, but I can also say that I barely understood what was going on, if there was anything to understand. David Lynch's fans (January), especially Guy Maddin's films, should especially enjoy it, and all fans of the EIGHTBALL comic will probably enjoy their joy and delight (he came as close as any movie I've seen in the mood Dan Clowes creates it so effectively) . <br /> <br /> One small remark to warn anyone who is easily offended - this film, if it will be judged, will certainly be NC-17. Fans of male nudity full-time, however ... hmm, well ... yes. It's weird wild things.
