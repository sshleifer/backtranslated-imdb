Personally, I liked this movie and I am concerned that some people have rated it. It's a comic-based movie and it's animated, now if you do not like comics or animations, of course you will not like this movie, so why did you watch and bother with the assessment that it is beyond me. However, if you're a fan of Interesting, strong characters and heroic (sexy) women who kick ass and save the world (hell), you'll love this movie. I thought this story really drew me in and it was a very nice movie. Pretty anime-esque or more like some of the American films following this new adult animation trend. Like Titan A.E. Meet the version of the Punisher game live. In the end, I highly recommend this movie to a comic fan and a superhero or to anyone who has an open mind and looks for a cool movie.
