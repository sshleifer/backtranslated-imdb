I am at the opposite end of the previous comment. <br /> <br /> First of all, I do not think it will be the continuation of "The Jerk". I mean, there is no title "The Jerk 2" ... it's "The Jerk, Too", which leads me to believe that although many names of the characters are the same, in fact it revolves around a completely different person. /> <br /> Think about it: there is virtually no connection to the previous movie, except for the characters' names; a completely different story; other cast; and the fact that it is a partial musical. <br /> <br /> I'm saying to give this movie some recognition. He has a lot of laughter ... Mark Blankfield in his power of age.
