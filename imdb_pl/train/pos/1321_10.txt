Go the path to this important document that looks like an attractive feature. Forbidden Lie $ (2007) is simply a better (cinematic) version of the book Norma Khouri Forbidden Love, and THAT was a bestseller. Onion of literary deception and beautiful woman, Lie $ is the best in reality reality TV. <br /> <br /> Cleverly edited and colorful, Broinowski's story is hidden by the moving silhouettes of Norma Khouri eloquently smoking. I do not agree (from Variety) that it is too long; instead, my one minor problem consisted in the episodic character of key players commenting on the references recorded by others. On one watch, how your sense of narrative becomes plunged ... so I watched it twice. <br /> <br /> This Oscar-winning effort is immediately really fun, annoying and totally addictive, because it documents one lie after another. Visible developments in the Australian State of Queensland due to very personal scams of Khouri's friends and fans (!). Apparently, these friends are now "reversed", the funniest camera line belonging to QLD Khouri's neighbor, Rachel Richardson, who says his disappointment in flat, senseless bends: "I think it's a sh load! T. Personally. " <Br /> <br /> We must learn from their experiences, hence my belief in spoilers. Every eternal liar caught in a lie will just tell everything to buy time for another lie. <br /> <br /> There are several breathtaking shots of Khouri, sneering in the duplicity of this very documentalist, who instead presses her (con) "Artist" many times to confirm. <br /> <br /> Since she was wounded by Sydney Morning Heraldic journalists Caroline Overington and David Knox a year after publication, Khouri is on the run, but she tempted back to the director to pursue her name. She escaped allegedly because a) is either terrified by her cunning, more Italian-sounding husband than her husband, or b) because she needed her passport / visa to clear her name. <br /> <br /> Incredible. <br /> <br /> The more likely reason was that the FBI regained their mark in Queensland before leaving the sea again (one guess: no, not Jordan). According to the closing card, Khouri is "still being followed by the FBI" in 2007. <br /> <br /> I guessed that the public could just give Khouri the benefit of doubt as soon as he calls for the need for the greatest mystery and deception. Instead, the viewers with whom I sat slowly became as disappointed as the deceived people on the screen. When they caught, there were a lot of mockery and bribes; previously emphasized sighs emanated from viewers who simply did not know how to accept the growing contradictions of Khouri. <br /> <br /> The filmmaker gets props for such a beautiful extension of this intricate story from beginning to end, leaving nothing - not even her own dedication. <br /> <br /> Anna opens her movie thanks to a friendly book narration by Khouri herself. The alleged cause of creation is initially very reliable - the key to how a liar works throughout his life: in half-truths. Khouri, however, is very pretty and intelligent, she is 35 years old and has a quite disarming charm, and surprisingly, she developed biceps. <br /> <br /> We are gradually moving into less-adoring Australian dailies, publishers and fans who initially bought Khouri's accusations of killing honor, a hook, a rope and a sinker. Later, we see their more pathetic reactions, quite self-control and matter-of-fact, if perhaps a bit bitter. <br /> <br /> They are Jordanian (anti) murderers of activists who penetrated the deepest trauma Khouri's mistakes, because mixing sweat forced them to reduce the pace of change. There are honor killings in Jordan; it is only their prevalence that is contrary to Khouri's book - plus 72 other "facts". In 2003, these activists sent by fax (Australian) Random House with 73 meticulously tested objections. <br /> <br /> Publishers from 4 continents who have taken the opportunity to publish Khouri's first publication have never tried to check any facts. Leaving any confirmation to exclude liability in the contract with the author, they were also a fair game. So mass cheating on a hot topic was as easy to do in the world as typing it in Internet cafes. <br /> <br /> We are still shocked at the discovery that "substantive errors" relate to Khouri's biography as good. First of all, she is not only a nine-year-old virgin (her defense is that she just did not lead people out of their assumptions), but she has a slickster and two teenagers! Sometimes it's just too fast in its American accent. It also seems too comfortable in mobile phone technology and western clothing. I am aware that such observations may be detrimental to very Jordanian women who do not need any Western paternalism from me, but even if cultural signals do not interfere with Khouri's "facts", one must begin to question their source. <br /> <br /> At some point the creator came to the same conclusion. He makes admirable efforts to stop Khouri in person in Jordan. The last third absorbs the reconnaissance trip back to Amman, where one "fact" falls after another. In the end, Broinowski forces her (con) "Artist" to admit a decade of discrepancy in its history, and after that Khouri writes down his mocking secret confession in his own digital camera. The secret, because in him "American guard of Khouri" Jeremy has an Australian accent: he is an actor! (We'll never know how Anna discovered it.) <br /> <br /> So it becomes the filmmaker's triumph because it never marks its tone or involvement. Her camera revelations led her audience to learn from the mistakes of others, taking into account such a litany of justified doubts, FBI documents - and the most shocking initial crime of Khouri. <br /> <br /> Anna Broinowski (watch it now) is even clever enough to use one artistic device (key players commenting on the footage) to kill two birds - making the audience want to drink again from the same. <br /> <br /> In fact, despite her deceptively modest approach, I again confirmed that Overington and Knox really won the 2004 Walkleys in Investigate Journalism for their "Norma Khouri Investigation". <br /> <br /> Broinowski MADE ME LOOK.
