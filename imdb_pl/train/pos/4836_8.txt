I saw this movie a few days ago on video tape and although it was difficult to swallow it at one time (due to its length and history), I liked it a lot. I was impressed first with the scenario and then implementing this script. The film takes you for a ride, but it is not an easy, joyful ride; he goes through time and various political regimes and shows how they influence the lives of ordinary people. What I loved was the internal logic that the film followed; logic, which, like logic in life, was sometimes illogical and misleading, but in the end, when I thought about it, all events and twists of action made sense. It makes no sense to try to tell a story that has been spreading for over 50 years. I also liked the character of Nikita Michalkow Aleksei and the way he played it, as some critics have noticed, with restless abandonment. I did not like that later he played characters that remind me of Alekse in films like "Cruel Romance" (Zhestokij romans, which I really love) and to some extent in "The Insulted and the Injured" ("Unizhennye i oskorblyonnye") . "Sibiriada" shows, I think, a great filmmaker, Andrei Konchalovsky, before he went to Hollywood and made unforgettable films, such as "Tango and cash" and less forgotten, like "Train running away". I would prefer them to "Kurochka Ryaba" ...
