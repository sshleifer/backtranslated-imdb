I waited a moment to publish a review of this document because I saw it for the first time over 10 years ago, I wanted to think carefully about what I wanted to write. <br /> <br /> From a documentary point of view, I found it a good document. He did what he decided to do, show me something that I had no idea about and I became interested in the world he studied. I did not know anything about Drag√≥w's world, and to find out about them and "Balls" was simply spectacular to me. These people have been so talented in what they do and how they do it for the competition. Motherfuckers, complaining (even I was angry when someone told the judge that the coat that Drag Queen wore was not a male coat!), Jealous, it's all like any other competition. HOW EVERY OTHER COMPETITION like this. I felt it was a point. <br /> <br /> You had an older drag queen who talked about how they "used" Balls to compare them with newer drag queens that changed Balls and made more categories of competition - and even those who thought the future Balls will change even more when they are ready to go to the runway. It was interesting to hear that some of the players lived on the street two minutes before the ball, but they came to compete, it was so important to them! Then there were sad stories, stories about who is "home" and "home mother" that brought the best and the brightest in the competition. It was interesting. <br /> <br /> Now, to add after 10 years of watching this movie, I experienced a craze called "Madonna". I noticed a few familiar faces from this documentary who ended up with Madonna during the "Vogue" phase and rightly so. If it were not for these people, Madonna would not have the "Vogue" phase, I know it now. The loan should be provided if the loan is a DUE. I wonder if anyone else from the mainstream of America would watch this documentary, he will learn that they are not as "mainstream" as they think.
