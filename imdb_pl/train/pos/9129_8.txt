When this movie first appeared in 1984, Prince was one of the hottest actors. Everyone wanted to see this movie, which was nothing more than an extended music video. Acting was very bad, but what can you expect from musicians playing on the big screen for the first time? Even so, it was a very funny movie! Morris Day and Jerome Benton deliver classic comedy all the time, especially their version of "The Password", which will make you think about Abbott & Costello performing his "first in the world" baseball procedure. <br /> <br /> Appolina (who gave one name then) provided beautiful breasts, so you had a short nudity. Plus it is very attractive. And of course the soundtrack for this album is one of the best recorded by the prince. Prince later came up with Warner Bros. and changed his name, but at this particular moment of his career he was at the top of his game. <br /> <br /> This movie does not take place in the rankings a great time category, but it's quite fun.
