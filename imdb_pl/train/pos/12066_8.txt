It is not known if Marilyn Monroe ever met and talked to Albert Einstein (and since the mysterious disappearance of her diary after an equally mysterious death, we may never know), but for their lives it was possible. <br /> <br /> A script written by Terry Johnson of his own play, Nicolas Roeg's Inssenceance, imagines a meeting in a New York hotel room one night in 1953 between two icons plus Joe DiMaggio (Busey) and senator Joseph McCarthy (Curtis ) - but only on one level. On another level he raises - or reduces - those "personalities" (and what a bad phrase) to ordinary avatars (characters are deliberately unnamed), at the same time they become bigger and smaller. <br /> <br /> The title Does not matter is both accurate and deeply ironic; here the net value of DiMaggio has been reduced to little more than a photo on a chewing gum card. Monroe is also reduced to its component parts of the dress, hair, lipstick, wiggle and voice. Thanks to the discovery of their uncertainty and reversal of roles, the film focuses on the images of celebrities received, exploding the cult of personality. <br /> <br /> Continuing the theme, there will be another explosion in the climax of the movie: Hiroshima in a hotel apartment, in which "Actress" is burned to slag in a few seconds; literal deconstruction of fame. Good-bye, Norma Jean. History tells the script, which in turn turns the story upside down. As Roeg wondered after watching Johnson for the first time, "These figures were mythical, not invented by any person, either by the public or by the press, probably even by the characters themselves." Marilyn (intellectual from the wardrobe in real life), played by Theresa Russell, lectures on childish Einstein ("Professor" played by Emil) on the theory of relativity with balloons and flashlight, at the same time forcing the professor to show his legs in a conscious parody of his own role in The Seven-Year Itch, the movie The Actress is working on the opening of the film. <br /> <br /> History records that Monroe's husband, the disappearing baseball star DiMaggio (played by Busey as a affectionate psychotic simpleton), was dissatisfied with her iconic scene with unbuttoning a dress in the movie that accelerated their disintegration. At the very beginning we discover a jealous "Ballplayer" in the bar, mourning the fact that if "I want to see her underwear, I just go to the corner like all other guys". <br /> <br /> Unlike The Professor, The Ballplayer believes that the universe is round - a dispute shared by Native Americans. But the Great Leader (Sampson's fame from the cuckoo flight), who manages the elevator at the Roosevelt hotel, has been deprived of his own culture: "I'm not Cherokee anymore - I'm watching TV." Meanwhile, the "Senator" is investigating a professor who is on the eve of a pacifist speech at the UN, but which Senator suspects is Red. In fact, when Monroe reveals himself, Einstein is stunned by guilt for Hiroshima and what keeps the white future of warmth. However, in a seemingly godless universe, all such fears and aspirations become meaningless in the light of higher (atomic) power. <br /> <br /> Roeg is a really great director who introduces Johnson to the screen. Tortured memories of childhood and pessimistic flashes (ka-boom!) All the time draw unexpected connections between time, place and circumstance, with a repetitive visual motif of a wristwatch used to indicate the passage of time - but perhaps also to suggest that all the time is one time; every co-existing moment. As it appears from its reverse catalog, it is a kind of hobby for a director enchanted with the notion of synchronism - see in particular "Do not look now". 1920 Blessed in 1945 and penetrated to the 1980s, in which another "actor" assumed the greatest role of the president of the United States. <br /> <br /> If it all sounds pretty hard (quantum physics is certainly involved), the execution is not, because of Johnson's humorous scenario, witty direction of Roeg, opening the stage scenery - and the actors themselves who are on stellar form. Tony Curtis especially leaves traces of prostheses in paneling as a paranoid, powerless senator who is seen during the rehearsal of the congress with Monroe (real, unlike Russell), before he is disappointed by his shrinking member. <br /> <br /> Of course, Curtis once played the real Marilyn Monroe at Some Like It Hot, and his embrace was remembered as "kissing Hitler." As Roeg commented: "Everything suddenly seemed to be connected ... when the film began to take shape, even the actors themselves seemed part of this never-ending connection." Everything goes into a pot to bring in and serve in a new and fascinating way.
