It was a wonderfully clever and funny movie that I will never get tired of watching many, many times. Casting was great in matching young people to older characters. There are those of us who really appreciate good actors and intelligent story format. When it comes to Judi Dench, she is beautiful and a gift for any kind of production in which she performs. I always try to see Judi Dench in all her performances. She is a great actress and it's a pleasure to watch how every transformation of her characters comes alive. I can only be grateful if I see such an excellent picture for the majority of films that have recently lacked good characters, good screenplays and a good game. The film audience needs heroes, not perverted mannequins who lack ingenuity and talent. How great it is to see old favorites such as Leslie Caron, Olympia Dukakis and Cleo Laine. I would like this film to win the prizes it deserves. Thank you again for the amazing night of entertainment. I congratulate the writer, director, producer and all those who have done such a good job.
