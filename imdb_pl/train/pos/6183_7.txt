Leaning financially, Paramount pulled out all the stops for the stage adaptation of '34: big budget, big cast, extravagant production and Mitch Leisen labeled director. What happened? Two things: Busby Berkeley did not work for blurry rocks and the scenario of a mysterious murder that did not deserve to be in the same garbage can as Charlie Chan's worst first draft on the street. I have to believe that the cut was not in Leisena's hands, because Duke Ellington's big number is brutally fragmented, but that does not mean it's not worth a look: the number of "Sweet Marijuana" with topless backs is the mind of the blower, considering the upcoming production code, as well as thrilling Toby Wing (who unfortunately fed terrible lines and played stupid blonde in the prototype) as a fever fever for the otherwise absorbed Jack Oakiego. Actor Carl Brisson is bland as Melba Toast, but he is a competent singer. MacLaglen reaches for the new plateaus as a stereotypical stupid detective. And try to spot Lucy in the chorus. This is rated by 7.0 as a curiosity. Re-thinking in February 2010: I recently gave the film a new look and now I feel that I have wrongly disregarded Busby Berkeley's lack of production numbers. I understand Leisen's argument about more realistic production numbers in the context of the plot. I still have huge editing problems. Paramount, the largest studio in the city, faced huge problems with the Code of Production at the worst possible time in its history, saying financially, and pulled out all the stops on it (also check 1934's Search for Beauty). It is necessary to see the pre-code buffers.
