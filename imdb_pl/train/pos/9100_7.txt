Spanish films are in, if not Golden, definitely Silver Age. Pi√©dras is another example of a film that treats people and their conflicts seriously. Although feelings are strong or almost at the level of life or death, they are still not really melodramatic. This can happen. <br /> <br /> There are different stories here that connect. One is for a delayed girl who does not dare to cross the street to the next block. One applies to a middle-aged woman who finds a lover of her life in a foot fetish. Another concerns a girl with drug problems who leaves her lover. Yet another concerns Madame Brothel, who (almost) finds true love. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing. In Spain, filmmakers treat women seriously.
