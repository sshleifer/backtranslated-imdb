Sentinel is a movie that my father recommended to me many years ago and I have seen it many times. I always manage to play with me, and at the same time it is terribly frightening. Flashback scenes are what I really succeeded. Cristina Raines' father, who runs around the body with two frightening women, always manages to send shivers to my spine. it's your typical good versus evil, but at least it's fun. I consider the ending one of the best in Horror history. He has a lot of shock and tension, seeing that Burgess Meredith is doing his job like Chazen, he had me on the edge of my seat. Sentinel has excellent tension. We are never completely comfortable when Allison is on the screen. We know that something awful is always waiting for her, and that made things even more tense. This film is often dismissed by horror fans, but I personally think that this is one of the better, and certainly has enough for all Horror fans to be satisfied. <br /> <br /> Performances. Cristina Raines has her own wooden moments, but mostly to a large extent. She's beautiful, and her chemistry with Saranadon was natural. Chris Sarandon is great as a boy, Michael. He had an immediate presence on the screen and I could not help loving him. Martin Balsam, Jos√© Ferrer, John Carradine, Ava Gardner, Arthur Kennedy, Sylvia Miles, Deborah Raffin, Jerry Orbach, Richard Dreyfuss, Jeff Goldblum and Tom Berenger have memorable roles or small scenes. Burgess Meredith is wonderful as Chazen. He looks like a normal old man, but what we've discovered is absolutely terrifying. Eli Wallach and Christopher Wlaken are doing well as inept detectives. Beverly D'Angelo has one chilling scene that I will not spoil. <br /> <br /> Conclusion. Sentinel is an effective horror film that unfortunately fans of Horror neglect. It will give you the thrill and terror that you must fulfill. It's worth a look. <br /> <br /> 7/10
