Brothers with psychokinetic power (yes, really) a duel, not only for the feelings of Debra Winger, but really for the mystery of childhood, which left them in conflict with their powers. <br /> <br /> There are surrealistic touches (fire brigade, which behave like a singing Greek choir), but there is also humor, wit and romance. The soundtrack is also great. And like American Werewolf in London, he used every great Wolf song they could get ~ but with fire and I do not think I will ever forget Dennis Quaid (mmmmm Dennis Quaid), setting up his own trailer as rockin 'She's Mrs' ~ priceless;) < br /> <br /> The best line is missing in the quote section btw ~ "Once you have a clown, you never come back! "<br /> <br /> I love this movie (I just ordered a DVD from the USA) and if the comments written by people who would be more satisfied with Legally Blond 3, do not be discouraged ~ try :)
