There are many types of demonstrations of conventions. One kind is that old actors are picked up from naphthalene and focused on recreating characters that they have not played for twenty or thirty years. These results are mixed. `Return to Mayberry ', despite some stupidity, he was fine; `Return to Green Acres' as a workable (Eddie Albert used a word for a script that I will not repeat here, but for him and for the stink film); "Rescue from Gilligan's Island" filled the necessary gap in the history of castaways, although the show itself was stupid even from the point of view of "Gilligan Island". In most cases, the scripts are weak; sometimes stupidly appearing in scripts, which knows too well? and comedy is almost always fatal because the characters know that they are funny. New characters are introduced that do not match the mix. Essentially, these demonstrations of conventions are quite weak. The second type of "reunion" program is one in which the cast puts its past aside, but sits down, tells stories, memories, interspersed with flashbacks from concerts. There are also films based on programs that are rarely good; and movies based on the story of the series ("The Brady Bunch" met with them, with different results). <br /> <br /> 'Return to the Batcave' uses almost all of the above, with a wonderfully twisted viewpoint that makes it the best reunion, and raised the bar for others. <br /> <br /> Adam West and Burt Ward and called to the show of the original Batmobile. When they are there, the car is stolen. <br /> <br /> Adam West movie is a man with dementia. He called Jerry, his butler, "Alfred." He opens the bust of Shakespeare in his apartment and discovers a hidden pole that slips into the parking lot. He is obsessed with being a criminal, when in reality he is just a washed-out actor. When the Batmobile is stolen, he not only believes that his duty as a criminal is to regain him, but he draws in and does not want Burt Ward to be his assistant. <br /> <br /> The chase is largely talkative, and West and Ward recall the old days. It is interrupted by "flashbacks" with actors playing West and Ward in the old days. Contemporary scenes and "flashbacks" have a bizarre lack of reality that he maintained. There are also gags that show West is able to laugh at himself: in his book, Warda, about his time on the show, he talked frankly about the libido of the West, and also about being a dick (West makes Ward pay for everything that is in their pursuit of tips and bus fare). The tips they follow, the characters they encounter (even in flashbacks) fit into the mentality of the old series, as well as several tributes, including fistfights with written sound effects. <br /> <br /> The whole thing is extremely funny and made with great impetus. There are also scenes of Julie Newmar (looking like she had too much facelift) and Frank Gorshin, reminding us why she has such a cult. Gorshin will be a puzzle, when Jim Carey, his obvious successor, has long been forgotten. The film evolves into a fairly obvious but funny climax. <br /> <br /> This program is a model of demonstrations of conventions? unfortunately there are a few that match the pattern. This performance had actors recreating their old characters; young actors playing a movie about creating a series; memories of the actors of West and Ward; and a contemporary movie with a real Adam West playing the crazy Adam West. He has everything. If you liked the old show, it's a bottle stopper.
