Super Speedway is a great demonstration of the new DVD / bigscreen / 5.1-channel system. The IMAX camera puts you exactly in a racing car, where you swim on different tracks at high speed, recalling the Grand Prix driving sequences (as long as they appear on DVD!). I like to watch it again. <br /> <br /> The only minus and why I did not give him 10, some driving sequences look suspicious, as if the movie was accelerated. The soundtrack also requires a slight suspension of disbelief - everything you hear in a real car is an engine. You will not hear noises when you walk under bridges.
