Okay, here's what I think about Jack Frost. I looked at the morphing box of the VHS cassette and thought, it looks interesting. I rent it and take it home. Boy, I'm right, this is interesting. They placed the ghosts of a serial killer in dreams, in walking corpses and inside machines for everyday use. But this must be the most special place where you can put the spirit of a serial killer. A snowman inside the body. I liked all the snowman's friendly images, littering the landscape, the owner of the pot, snowball etc. I like the actor who played Jack, he put some fun in the killer, whom he really did not see from FREDD KRUGGER. That's right, I said. FREDDY KRUGGER. It's such a level of "goodness". I would like some puppet effects to be better, mouth movements could be better. But I remember that it's a small budget. The cast does a great job, there are some great liners and it's scary to jump to some hardcore horror fan. All this, a great story, good results, a great dialogue box and a great cast. I give JACK FROST ... 9 STARS
