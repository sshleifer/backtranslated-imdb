Like The Jeffersons, the Good Times was one of those classic American comedy series that never appeared in Britain, not to mention that it appeared in the 1970s - a decade in which I was not born yet. /> But like most fans of the show, I watched a few episodes on You Tube - and then I loved it. <br /> <br /> At the head of the Evans family stands James and Florida - two parents trying to finish meeting, and who despite the lack of qualifications, encourage their children who have their own aspirations in life, to meet them and take chances. James was a stern but loving father who did not dare to hesitate in disciplining JJ, Michael and Thelma - should they cross the line. In Florida, however, she was an honest, kind and caring mother and loving wife, although in many respects she was similar to James when it came to their relationship to parenthood and family values ​​from an Afro-American perspective. <br /> <br /> The children were just as lively and funny as the parents themselves: JJ was an aspiring artist with a stupid personality and crazy sense of humor who often wore multi-colored outfits and whose "DY-NO-MITE" slogan is the same contagious and familiar, like "Whatchoo Arnold Jackson" talking about Willis? with Diff'rent Strokes. Michael was an intelligent alumnus who dreams of becoming a lawyer while Thelma has his own dreams and hopes. Her verbal taunts with JJ were usually fun, as was the love / hatred relationship between her brother and sister, which was very well carried out by both Mike Evans and Bernadette Stanis. <br /> <br /> Throughout the season, he performed several episodic performances, primarily Janet Jackson, Debbie Allen and young Gary Coleman as himself! Actually, I prefer the Good Times, say, The Cosby Show, which was a show of the '80s, because a) I preferred the Evans family from Huxtables, both as regards the characteristics, as ib) because I felt that it solves serious and difficult social problems, in a way that resonated with many viewers. It was a comedy, but it was also a social commentary aimed at highlighting the working class life of African Americans in America in the '70s. The Cosby show tried to satisfy the mainstream audience in a "sweet-covered" way, as Huxtables were portrayed as blacks who easily assimilated into a higher-class American culture with which we would associate with Whites, while Good times as opposed to much more "edgier" "And she was not afraid to deal with topics such as abuse of drugs and children in a realistic way. In fact, I discovered that while The Cosby Show may be fun to watch at times, he missed the little sassiness that the Good Times have, and which made it more fashionable and cooler. <br /> <br /> There has been a shark jump in recent seasons, because he continued to follow John Amos, James died in a strange accident (in fact it was known that John had left the Good Times for good, so the death of his character was written as it is on the show). Without John, the show suffered and, unfortunately, lost a lot of its charm. <br /> <br /> Despite this, in the sitcom, Good Times marked all relevant fields. If only they showed it in Great Britain in the 80's. How is it for sure, as JJ would put it: "DY-NO-MITE !!" <br /> <br /> My rating: 8 and a half
