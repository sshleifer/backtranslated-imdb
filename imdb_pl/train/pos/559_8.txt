A good movie with - as for those times - an intense, extensive, rather dark story somewhat reminiscent of John Ford's The Searchers, though not so brutal. The story begins quickly and does not stop, with a few scenes of really good dialogue between (Stewart) Jeff Webster, Ronda Castle and Sheriff Gannon. This film is somewhat reminiscent of "Bend of the River" (1952), also by Mann-Stewart, but I think it is much less sentimental and more interesting. There are several objections: too fast (and rather sentimental) ending; 24-year-old Corrine Calvert is not very convincing as a na√Øve French teenager, and of course the film takes place in Mythic West, the land of a fairy tale, in which the laws of nations and physics do not apply. But these are trivial concerns. James Stewart is surprisingly good as a dark, uninvolved man who thinks he cares about anyone but himself, and the mountain scenery can not be beat. A great drama from a western costume.
