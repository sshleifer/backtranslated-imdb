Director Sidney Lumet created several masterpieces such as Network, Dog Day Afternoon or Serpico. But he did not have much luck in his latest works. Gloria (1999) was pathetic, and Find Me Guilty was an interesting but unsuccessful experiment. Now Lumet brings his best movie for decades and, in my opinion, a real masterpiece: Before the devil knows that you are dead. I think this movie is like a revival for Lumet. This movie has a wonderful story that has deep layers. I also think that the end of the movie is perfect. The performances are brilliant. Philip Seymour Hoffman brings, as always, a great performance and is undoubtedly one of the best actors of our time. Ethan Hawke is also a great actor, but he does not appreciate my point of view. His performance here is great. The rest of the cast is also excellent (especially, the great Albert Finney), but these two actors bring monumental performances, which were unfortunately ignored by the pitiful Oscars. The film has a good level of intensity, partly for performances, and partly thanks to the genius scenario. Before Devil Knows You're Dead is a true masterpiece with excellent direction, great script and excellent performances. We need more such films.
