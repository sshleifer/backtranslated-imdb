I loved the film from beginning to end. I believe that the style of the director / actor directly addressing me / the audience was very engaging. <br /> <br /> The most exciting and refreshing in this movie was to ignore - and therefore challenge - gender and class stereotypes. Characteristic features of heroes are presented as strengths, and the lack of judgment - and acceptance of themselves and each other - has enabled me to embrace them and allow them to be drawn into their world. Without teaching and intelligence, gentle and loving humor, this film has the power to open us to new possibilities and gives us hope for a world in which people see and accept each other as unique and valuable individuals. I am looking forward to more offers from this creative and talented director.
