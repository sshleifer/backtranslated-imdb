** WARNING - CONTAINS SPOILERS! ** <br /> <br /> First of all, I would like to say that I really liked this game. I got it for Christmas after two months of dropping instructions to my parents. I'm glad I did it. <br /> <br /> First of all, I would like to say that the single player was very good. The first level is probably one of the best in the game when you're at a party in London, and some bad guys are destroying him by kidnapping the prime minister's daughter. Of course, you have to save her, and this is a fairly high level, but it will probably take you at least five minutes. The best part, and I think the funniest part is that you're in the jet, and people are coming down to Big Ben. Just equip the most proven jet rocket launcher and destroy the dials of the clock and enemies. Pure fun! <br /> <br /> The rest of the levels are very good, but quite short. There are four mini-levels that you can unlock, and this is one of the competitions, because only the first two of them are really fun, and the last two to unlock are simply "kill 25 enemy targets", I mean, c 'mon! We have plenty of points to unlock these missions, and the last two bonus missions are really bad! <br /> <br /> Many players, me and some of my friends agree, it is very good and demanding, even if there is no bot. Halo did not have any bots, but it's still some great multiplayer games! You can be a load of bad guys and you can defy yourself, and you can set traps, which are the best way to kill people without looking at their character. <br /> <br /> Gameplay - 8.5 / 10 (levels can be quite repeatable, and bonus missions can be improved). Graphics - 9/10 (there is a strange bad graphics, but it is not very often). Multiplayer mode - 10/10 (you do not have to comment, just great, you drive in jet packets and vehicles). Sound - 8/10 The value of the replay - 7/10 (the only levels on which I am going back, are the level of Loondon and Istanbul part 1). <br /> <br /> I give this game: 8.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> I could improve a bit, but it's still good.
