I just managed to get the DVD "The Five Venoms" from Heavenly Region 3 and what a great job they did with it. Fantastic, digitally remastered transfer and a must-have for any Kung Fu fan. <br /> <br /> The story is quite simple and has already been mentioned, so I will not enter it again. Needless to say, these are the battle scenes that many buy a movie for, and they do not disappoint. The only problem is that they are a bit rare and seem to be practiced. Bruce Lee could take these things and drink a cup of tea at the same time! All kicks and punches come from all the important "clicks" and "whooshes" writers, which is a nice effect, though quite funny! Good, but not great. In a sense, I could have been a little better. Golden Swallow, the same director a decade earlier, had equally good history and better performance.
