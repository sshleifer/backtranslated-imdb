As if the film itself was not valuable, it is a great way to read the novel as a preface to read it. In the summer of 1968, I saw a film in New York; who enter the postgraduate school, I read the book for the first time. Part of the pleasure of reading the novel was my memory of a meticulously detailed film. And for better or worse - and now I've been reading and teaching novels for over three decades - Milo O'Shea is still Leopold Bloom.
