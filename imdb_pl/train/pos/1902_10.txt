Let's start with the theme of the song sung by Christopher Cross. The song is "If you get caught between the moon and New York." It's a great theme and song, even after all these years, it never gets tired. It's a really great song about New York. Either way, the brilliant Dudley Moore CBE performs as a spoiled drunk millionaire who is engaged to the character of Jill Eikenberry in the film. Jill later plays at LA Law. In any case, it is supported by his great British butler, Sir John Gielgud OM, who won the Oscar for his role in the film as the best supporting actor. Arthur falls in love with Lisa Minnelli, who is perfect in this film, apart from her performance in the Oscar-winning role in the cabaret. No, Liza does not sing. She plays the waitress in the restaurant. In any case, I love Geraldine Fitzgerald as the mother of the Bach family, who decides the fate of the family. In any case, she is fantastic and she should receive the Academy Award nomination for the best supporting actress herself. Barney Martin, known as Jerry's dad in Seinfeld, plays Lisa's father. He is great too. The film was well written, played and delivered to the public who wanted it.
