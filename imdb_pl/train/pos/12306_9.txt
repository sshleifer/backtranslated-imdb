In the Chinese ghost story there appears late, great Leslie Cheung as Ling Choi Sin, a penniless tax collector who decides to spend the night in an abandoned temple, where he meets and falls for a beautiful woman named Tsing (Joey Wang). When Ling discovers that Tsing is in fact a ghost who has been forced to seduce victims for the spirit of a bad tree that feeds on "chi" (life force), he decides to try to free the girl by giving her the remains of a proper burial. Using the help of the swordsman Yin (Wu ma), a mad Taoist monk, Ling successfully overcomes the spirit of the tree, but he must also fight in hell against the evil Lord Black, whom Tsing is to marry. <br /> <br /> The first Hong Kong movie that I saw, which was not purely a martial art, Chinese ghost story opened my eyes to the amazing world of Asian fantasy horror, a magical land inhabited by beautiful female ghosts, noisy innocent heroes, sword wielding Taoist monks, monstrous ghosts and dark lords of the underworld; Immediately I fell in love with the enthusiasm, energy, humor, ingenuity and visual perfection of the film. <br /> <br /> Two decades later, and this amazing movie still remains one of the best examples of this genre that I've seen? - wonderful, breathtaking masterpiece that combines horror, comedy, fantasy and romance. With the great director Siu-Tung Ching, great editing by David Wu, stunning photos and lots of imaginative special effects (including a huge killer language, many monsters and many flying heads!), Chinese Ghost Story is a completely unforgettable and completely enjoyable experience from the beginning to end.
