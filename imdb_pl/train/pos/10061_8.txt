One of the most warming foreign films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> A young girl is an amazing talent. Star performances by her (Doggie), old man (king of masks) and Liang (Living Boddhisatva). <br /> <br /> (SPOILER) The deplorable treatment of children, especially women, is worrying. /> <br /> I loved music. The original Chinese dialogue intensifies the emotional intensity of performances and stories. <br /> <br /> This is a MUST SEE - a nice family movie, though not for very young children. It would evaluate the DVD edition even higher if the soundtrack was better transferred to a DVD and the transfer included a panoramic version.
