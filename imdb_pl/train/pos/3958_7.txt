Moe and Larry are freshly married men who married demanding sister Shemp. In his music studio, Shemp learns that he will inherit a fortune if he marries someone! <br /> <br /> "Husbands Beware" is a remake of "Brideless Groom" from 1947, considered by many to be one of the best Stooge films from Shemp. The remake contains most of the material from this movie. New scenes, shot on May 17, 1955, include the story of Moe and Larry marrying Shemp's sisters, together with their turkey and turpentine cooking! At the end of the movie there are also some new scenes (you used double Dee Green, if you blink, you will miss the double look.) <br /> <br /> "Husbands beware" is a good movie with a plot of marriage with the sisters. Budget considerations, combined with a smaller number of bookings for two-drum comedy, influenced the decision to use older recordings. <br /> <br /> Although Stooges was still making entirely new films, most of their releases in 1955-56 consisted of older films with several new scenes thrown into the game. "Husbands beware", while one of these hybrids is visible and fun; We will see again the majority of "Brideless Groom", and the new scenes are so funny that they penetrate the viewer through the movie. This movie is one of the last comedies of Stooge, in which the new Shemp material appeared, and was released six weeks after his death. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10.
