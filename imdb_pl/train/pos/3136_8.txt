Strangely pleasant effort, combining appropriately stretched storyline with Adam and Burt and flashbacks with the original TV series. Most flashback scenes have been removed directly from Burt Ward's book "Boy Wonder: My Life in Tights" and I imagine that his book was an inspiration to make this movie. As in the book, fans of the original series remained thirsty for more. <br /> <br /> If you missed this broadcast, it is definitely worth trying to borrow a tape from a friend who recorded it. I'm making a copy for my children now.
