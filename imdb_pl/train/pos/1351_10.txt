Living and unbridled, ANNE OF GREEN GABLES brings unexpected happiness to the life of a lonely older sister and brother on Prince Edward Island. <br /> <br /> The adored novel by Lucy Maud Montgomery comes alive in this wonderful little movie. Excellent production values, literate script and first-class performances give the story exactly what it deserves. <br /> <br /> Taking her professional name from the character she portrayed, actress Anne Shirley is a joy because he was the head of a fourteen-year-old orphan who completely changes the lives of his new guardians. Totally confident in her main role, Miss Shirley is a delight, she entertains the viewer with Anne's unlimited imagination, fast temperament and not so secret sorrows. <br /> <br /> Playing a stern maid who gives the girl a home, Helen Westley also fully proves her role; the viewer will be glad to see this acutely deaf woman, slowly detachment from Anne's feelings and childish innocence. Australian actor OP Heggie gives one of his best performances as a shy, gentle brother of Westley, who greets Anne in his heart from the moment he arrives to take her from the train station. <br /> <br /> Tom Brown is the most-loved student who quickly catches Anne's attention. Sarah Haden is adequately prickly like a nosy neighbor. Charley Grapewin uses most of his time as an Avonlei doctor.
