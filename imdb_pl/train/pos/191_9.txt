At a time when Marion Davies had her skills and not only listened to William Randolph Hearst, she would make more films like Show People and she was much happier. In fact, when you see her first big break in a comedy with two drums, she would love to do it in her career, instead of such epics as "Knight Knight Was In Flower" and Janice Meredith. <br /> <br /> What you see in all of the accounts in Show People is a true Davies, a talented comedian, a great follower and a generous man with a good heart. She really could identify with the character Peggy Pepper called Patricia Prepoire, she lost her part in pretending to be a Hollywood star. <br /> <br /> If the Show People storyline was set at a legal stage, you would call the story behind the scenes. I think it is one of the first films about movies that can be called a movie in the back. Marion is a willing young hope who comes to Hollywood like many others, looking for this great break. She wants a drama, but her introduction to films is a foil for burlesque comic books. He gets his portion of cake and seltzer in the face, but learns to trade. And also the heart of the young comic actor William Haines wins. <br /> <br /> He gets his first big break, but he does not come for Haines, and Marion makes a legal drama with actor Paul Ralls, playing Andre Telfair, do not pretend to be Count Avignon. Someone was filming here with actor Lou Tellegen, lover and husband Sarah Bernhardt and Geraldine Farrar and others, and heard about it, one of the most despised people in the cinema. <br /> <br /> Show People was one of the first films in which unregistered stars appeared as themselves. You'll see people like Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, Mae Murray, John Gilbert, Eleanor Boardman, etc., Just being in a movie colony. This in itself makes Show People a film worth saving. <br /> <br /> Show People have made good use of Tin Pan Alley's standard songs such as, Is not We Got Fun, I'm Sitting On Top Of The World, You'd be surprised, California, I'll come here. When the film appeared on the background of the sound being introduced, a song called Crossroads was introduced to it. This is not a bad number, but you can not give credit to a boy and a girl singing in the soundtrack. I believe that since they are not seen, it was thought that no accounting was necessary. I would still like to know and I am sure that if you were lucky to see Show People. <br /> <br /> It's easy to understand why Marion Davies liked this movie so much and considered it a personal favorite. It looks so at home in this film, and its true lack of pretense shines in its performance, which makes it a real treat for the public.
