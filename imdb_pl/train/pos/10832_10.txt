If you like Deep Purple, you'll love this great movie with Stephen Rau in the lead role. The story tells the story of the most famous rock group from the 70s, Strange Fruits, and they decided to play together again. But of course, there will be a lot of problems during their concerts. Jimmy Nail and Bill Nighy are great, and the song "The Flame Still Burns" is perfect. You must watch it.
