At first glance "Written on the Wind" is a bright, shiny soap opera with sexual dysfunctions of the Texan oil family. But there is a deep, social commentary on life from the 1950s. Director Douglas Sirk wins more points with another server. Robert Stack falls in love with Lauren Bacall. The problem is that the best pal Stack, Rock Hudson, loves her too. When Stack finds that he is sterile and Bacall is pregnant, the fireworks are flying. And too good Dorothy Malone won the Oscar for portraits of the greatest nymphomaniac in Texas, which Hudson avoids. A good epic soap opera.
