A piece of subtle art. Maybe a masterpiece. Undoubtedly a special story about the ambiguity of existence. A Kafka-like story about the impossibility of winning or surviving in an eternal strange world. In this film, life is just an adaptation exercise. A lesson about limitations and original sin, about the weakness of innocence and the mistakes of its ways. <br /> <br /> Leopold Kessle is another test image of Joseph K. and the same ambiguous woman. And Europe is a symbol of a fundamental crisis that has many aspects, such as chimerical wars or ineffective search for the truth / essence / golden age. <br /> <br /> A metaphor or parable, the film is a story of disappointed evolution. War, peace, interests or lies are just details of gelatin's time. Hypocrisy is a mask. Love - convention. A method based solely on sacrifice to hope for an understanding of the painful reality.
