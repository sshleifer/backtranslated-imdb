Working in downtown Manhattan and often going to lunch on summer days in the park near the town hall, I would see the mayor who came and went. It was great to go outside the city hall and see what it looks like in the lobby and throughout the building. Al Pacino, (Mayor John Pappas), "Gigli", "03", gave excellent results throughout the picture, especially when he gave a speech in the African American church for a small boy killed. John Cusack, (deputy mayor of Kevin Calhoun), "Jaw's Fugitive," 03, was a devoted servant of the mayor and worshiped him in everything he tried to achieve. Bridget Fonda (Marybeth Cogan) falls in love with Kevin Calhoun and gives a great supporting role. Finally, Danny Aiello (Frank Anselmo), "Off Key", "01", played the mafia boss who had some very difficult choices for the rest of the picture! A great movie with great acting and fantastic photography in New York!
