No, this is not a fairy tale Alice, my friends! This fairy tale "Wonderland" is based on the true story of gruesome bloody murders in Wonderland, which took place in California in the 80s. Johnny Wad himself was in the center of this bloody bathhouse. Yes, John Holmes! Daddy ding-dong used other shotguns than his infamous 13-inch milk machine. In addition to being a legendary adult film actor, Holmes was also a hardcore drug addict who made friends with various Hollywood junkies. Val Kilmer was occasionally as majestic as Holmes, but for the moment Holmes did not wipe him completely. The film features "who" supporting players: Josh Lucas and Dylan Mcdermott as Hollywood carousing, Kate Bosworth and Lisa Kudrow as a woman in Holmes' life and Eric Bogosian as a dangerous entrepreneur Tinsletown. These characters play an integral role, directly or indirectly, in "Wonderland" murders. The most sharp and impressive of this support group was Josh Lucas, like the fiery Ron Launius. Lucas is gradually becoming the main Hollywood player with such charismatic phrases in "A Beautiful Mind" and "Sweet Home Alabama". Director James Cox turned out to be somebody strange, showing a huge amount of overly complex scenes, just like the famous Holmes organ. Holmes was finally acquitted of murders from the "Wonderland". He died of complications due to the AIDS virus. `Wonderland 'will make you wonder what really happened this bloody night and if Holmes really spread his weapon. Oops! Bad Holmes movie! Well! That's enough before I get a "punishment". Hi Holmies! *** Average
