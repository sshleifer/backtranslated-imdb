This underestimated quiet gem tells the true story of the POW's escape during World War II. The performances are amazing, especially Anthony Steele. The film works on many different levels: brain, emotional, visual and literal. Dialogue is ingenious and very real. In fact, the extraordinary all-authentic authenticity puts this person above most of the epic wars.
