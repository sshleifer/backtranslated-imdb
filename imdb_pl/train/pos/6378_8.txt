Atlantis: The Lost Empire has some of the best, most fluid animations and cleverly written dialogues with every Disney movie I've seen. And I was convinced of that in the first 15 minutes. I especially love the work of Don Novello on Vincenzo Santorini and Phil Morris as Joshua Strongbear Sweet. It is a pity that the whole film moves at a rate twice as high as would be appropriate - at least in the first act. An important aspect of any Disney movie is a satisfying antagonist - which Atlantis does not provide. At best, it's mediocre. In the middle of the film there is a mediocre turn. That's all. Even so, it's a great movie. Everyone should check it out.
