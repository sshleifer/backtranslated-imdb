As with all other reviewers, this movie has become in my head after 30 years. I remember when I went to the library, investigating everything I could in this story. I even wrote to the PBS station for more information. Nevertheless, all I could find was a story printed in a newspaper at the beginning of the 20th century. <br /> <br /> Fast until 2002, after years of searching on eBay for a week basis and there was a copy of the VHS movie. There was one more bidder, but I was determined to win the movie. The losing bidder wrote to me asking for a copy that I gave her. In spite of having a copy, I still searched and searched the site that sold the copy of the DVD movie. You can find it at: http://www.johntopping.com/Harvey%20Perr/War%20Widow/war_widow.html
