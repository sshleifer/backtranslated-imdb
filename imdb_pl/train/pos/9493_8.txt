White Fire is so good for this. With a look similar to Larry Bird, Robert Ginta, carrying a load with amazing hair and a super macho mustache, the movie rises above other low-budget actions. The charisma he has in this makes Tom Selleck look like a putz. When Ginta beat everyone, the film arouses admiration only when it comes to the history of diamond intrigue. Then add Fred Williamson, some frontal bushes, chainsaw attacks and amazing incest motives ... this movement ends on all cylinders. If you're looking for an amazing action B, it is there. Now, if I can just get this soundtrack.
