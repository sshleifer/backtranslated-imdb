Now it is one of the main roles of Big's Best, Jack Hulbert in 1931, divided into two parts for band band Waggon Askey & Murdoch. He can be proud of a great cast who is preparing to play for everything that is worth it, especially Askey, of course. Histrionics were provided by Linden Travers, melodrama by Herbert Lomas and pragmatist Richard Murdoch. <br /> <br /> A group of railway passengers who got stuck in a lonely night station found more than they expected, spectral trains for phantom porters, hairy rolls of sausage and Arthur trying to entertain them all. His payoff with everyone falls between sharing aside and weird boredom. When the formula works, it's very good, but sometimes it gets very fancy and it forces the movie to seem more obsolete than it is. But these damn treacherous fifth columnists - thank God, Great Britain is not here today! <br /> <br /> Finally a nice, harmless movie, welcome to the TV screen as an old friend, but if you expected to shake off your boards, you'll probably be very disappointed!
