This film is very interesting. I've seen it twice and it looks like Glover has hit the head with what he says he wants to achieve. I can refer to the indignation that the creator clearly expresses against the current thoughtless corporate nonsense, which is an attack in our every media center, and what we, as a culture, should not think of because of the control of corporate media. The outrage that Glover expresses himself in the "outrageous" elements of the movies is both clear in his visceral aggressiveness and beautiful in his poetic power. I am glad that I saw this film and it is even clearer that Glover is interested in something interesting with the second part of what will be a trilogy. Fine! ALL RIGHT. See it too. People who reject this movie as "unthinking" or "pretentious" really miss the boat. These are intelligent movies. If you can see it in your live performance, which he performs earlier with his books, it is also very angry. The way you walk in his way of thinking is really something. You will have experience!
