This is an almost perfect movie. Mamet would repeat the ideas, but he never said so succinctly. It is really about the failure of trust, the human condition. The film has the idea that we are all criminals, no one is innocent. Is there anyone alive today who has not seen it in our society every day? The film is very structured as a Hitchcock thriller. Except that there are no more innocent characters. The world is now completely polluted, ruined and everyone participates in the concert. Could something be more real? <br /> <br /> Do not miss the soundtrack. It is wonderful.
