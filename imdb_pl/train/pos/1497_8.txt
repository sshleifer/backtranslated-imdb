This film is quite a funny movie from the anthology of horror (in the style of Tales from the Crypt) written by Robert Bloch (author of Psycho). It's good fun for horror fans and has a great cast. The film should also be required for watching for Doctor Who fans, because Jon Pertwee (the third Doctor) has a funny role as a naughty and unbearable horror movie star!
