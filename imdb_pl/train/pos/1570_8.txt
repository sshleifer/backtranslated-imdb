OK, here's my personal list of the best Nicktoons shows like today: <br /> <br /> 1. All Grown Up / SpongeBob SquarePants <br /> <br /> 2. My life as a teen robot <br /> < br /> 3. Invader Zim <br /> <br /> 4. CATSCRATCH / Rugrats <br /> <br /> Note the word containing only uppercase letters? It means it's the Nick Show I'm talking about. <br /> <br /> "Catscratch" is basically a simple but great animated comedy about three rich cats - Mr. in a strange and REALLY surreal situation, from attempting to join the human Kimberella sleep event on root beer, to save the planet snails from the evil spacecraft. One of them is Nick showing that sooner or later you will tickle your funny bone! The theme is catchy and unforgettable. Voice actors - including Wayne Knight from the series "Seinfield" - bring heroes into a fresh life with very bizarre personalities. The stories are enjoyable (episodes of fans are "King of All Root Beer" and "Gordon's Lucky Claw"). And humor is made in some Earthworm Jim style. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, "Catscratch" is one of the Nicktoons series, for example "Invader Zim" and "MLAATR", which becomes very, very popular all over the world in just 3 seasons or less.
