All those who have been desperately looking at the emptiness and weaknesses of the recent Disney Studios production are coming something that should heal your wounds ... Once and for all, the Bug's life proves that purely synthetic images leading to a good script give more interest than false "hand-made" drawings old-Disneys "(see the Lion King, Pocahontas and all the latest productions, where you unfortunately regret that the magical background and atmosphere of Bambi have disappeared forever). <br /> <br /> The life of the bug (1001 Pattes for my French moviegoers!) It manages to avoid all the imperfections that make you wake up in the middle of the movie and say, "Hey, this thing is computer generated!" No weaknesses, a huge effort showing the effectiveness in the background and the overall appearance of the sets, an amazing 3D bird (close to perfection in imitation of reality) ... and only mention the technical aspects. <Br /> <br /> The screenplay, my friends, the real backbone of the film, has a certain thickness! Interestingly and of course, thanks to the Lasseter band, there is practically no music sequence in the life of A bug. Which means that the story is long and rich enough to free yourself from the 3-4 minutes that some children appreciate, but most do not like it (the same applies to parents or anime fans like me). This movie reminded me of an old movie with Steve Martin and Chevy Chase: 3 Amigos; basically the same story (the whole Mexican village living in fear of a few bad guys employ gunslingers (who eventually become actors) to protect them, etc.). Simple, but efficient and perfectly adapted to the colony of terrified ants, facing the anger of malicious insects. <br /> <br /> Since the Microcosm, many movies tell stories about insects, their lives, fears and hopes, but I think that the life of a worm is the funniest and best-targeted of all. The process of humanization has been perfectly realized ... And the whole audience was attracted by the adventures of Flik (aka Tilt in France). <br /> <br /> A big thank you to the Lasseter team, especially for the last 30 seconds. .. it's so weird and great when we see the whole theater caught in laughter, while worms / actors forget about their lines or hit the camera ... <br /> <br /> And finally, especially for those of you who saw French version, other congratulations for dubbing actors who have done a great synchronization of this movie. The life of a worm is really good entertainment and I think that it will soon become part of my movie collection (the privilege granted to very few films, and this is not a problem with the magazine :). Go and see it, it's an order.
