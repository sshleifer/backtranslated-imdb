I want to warn you that the comment is very sweet and bitter. Also this comment will be more meaningful to you after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Although it is tragically sad to say that this movie reminds me of my life, which is so striking that it is really terrible. The rest of you will never know exactly how the movie depicts how people who were in such situations act and react in later life. <br /> <br /> It could not have been a work of fiction; it had to be based on personal experience. <br /> <br /> My testimony of how good this movie was, is that although it was one of the best films I've ever seen, watching my life portrayed on a silver screen was such a painful experience that I would never I will be able to see him. <br /> <br /> But I strongly support it to everyone else, as an opportunity to look into the soul of another human being to an extent that you have probably never experienced before and never again. I know it for sure, because it is my soul that you will be watching.
