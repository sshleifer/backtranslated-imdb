I saw this movie for the first time when it appeared in 1994 and I just watched it recently and it is ETERNAL. I do not know if you need to understand hiphop in the 90s, but it helps if you do. In the 1990s, when NWA and Public Enemy were at the top, in groups and members there were internal conflicts when they separated their roads (Ice Cube, Easy E etc.). There are also willing, available rappers who are starting to create a stage (Vanilla Ice, Freedom Williams from C & C Music Factory, etc.). This movie laughs of it all in a way that seems to be a document. Kasi Lemmons plays an intelligence officer who spends a year in the life of a fictional rap group N.W.H. The members of the group are Ice Code (Rusty Condieff / director), Tasty Taste (Larry B Scott / Revenge of the Nerds and Tone Def (Mark Christopher Lawrence)). They are an increasingly popular rap group whose politics are controversial. What's good about this movie is that it's so popular in the hip hop industry of the 80's and that makes it great fun, but if you know rap from the 80's and 90's, you know how much of it is true. Still, without knowledge of hip-hop, it's still a funny movie, and for all who ask, so Spinal Tap was first, but Spinal Tap is not the first parody movie. equally fun and in some ways better than Spinal Tap. Like Spinal Tap to heavy metal, Fear of A Black Planet to Rap. And the songs are also hacked. DVD is a chalk full of additions to NWH music videos as a group and as solo artists. Great performances by Rusty Condieff and Larry B Scott.
