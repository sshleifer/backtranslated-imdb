Nicolas Mallet is a failure. Cashier in the bank, everyone walks after him. Then his friend, a writer whose books no one likes, has a plan to change his life. Our hero tells his boss that he is leaving. He intends to spend the rest of his life earning a lot of money and sleeping with many women. And he manages to do it. <br /> <br /> If it was not the amount of death (murder / suicide / natural causes) in the film, it would be a farce. There are many attacks on marriage, politics, journalism and ... life. <br /> <br /> Jean-Louis Trintignant is a nice amorous thief. Romy Schneider is the most attractive. It's definitely worth a look.
