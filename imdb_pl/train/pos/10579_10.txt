An energetic young producer of theater prologues (these staged performances, usually musical ones, which often preceded a film in larger cinemas in the old days) must deal with unfair competition, fraudulent partners, unfaithful lovers and amateur talent to realize their dream of making a sign on FOADLIGHT PARADE . <br /> <br /> In this film, very similar to other Warner music shows, especially GOLDDIGGER movies, there was no unique attraction: Jimmy Cagney. It is a miracle, loosely combined and flexible, as nimble as any tomcat - a creature that mimics several times during the movie. Cagney attracts the attention of viewers and never lets go, driving fast fire and clever motive with his charisma and cheerful charm. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast also gives it their all. Joan Blondell is the perfect blonde secretary with an elegant mouth, and Cagney's smashed (the main question - why did not she give her the music number?). Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler once again play lovers on stage and off; the fact that her singing and acting skills are slightly weaker, is compensated by dance; Powell still exudes boyish enthusiasm in his unusual position as a second man. <br /> <br /> Guy Kibbee and Hugh Herbert are having fun as brothers-in-law, both of them plan to deceive Cagney in various ways. Ruth Donnelly wins points as a wealthy wife Kibbee, a woman devoted to her handsome protégé. The harassed choreographer Frank McHugh is the right foil for Cagney's wit. Herman Bing is funny in his small stage as an arranger of music. Mavens will see little Billy Barty, Jimmy Conlin and maybe even John Garfield on the music numbers. <br /> <br /> Finally there is Busby Berkeley, a nonpareil choreographer. His Terpsichorean sweets, sprinkled by the decade of the 1930s, were a great example of film escapism, which the audience wanted to enjoy from depression. A big joke about Berkeley's work was, of course, that they were going to be stage productions as part of the story. But no theater would be able to hold these products of the master's imagination. They are perfect illustrations of the kind of entertainment possible only thanks to the movie camera. <br /> <br /> The musical offer of Berkeley generally accepted one of two different approaches, or a story (often rather bizarre) told by song and dance; or stunningly stunning geometrically designed digits, eye candy, generous girls with a choir, vest and romantic melody. In a spasm of strange extravagance, FOADLIGHT PARADE reaches a peak thanks to three Berkeley masterpieces: "Honeymoon Hotel" and its pre-production code about the wedding night of a couple; `By A Waterfall '- dozens of unsuccessful females, splashing, swimming and diving in excellent designs and designs (look carefully and see how synchronized effects have been achieved); and finally "Shanghai Lil" - an appropriate tribute to the talents of both Cagney and Berkeley.
