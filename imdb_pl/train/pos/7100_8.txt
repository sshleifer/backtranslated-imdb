I saw his film in Dallas, Texas, when he appeared in 1986. I remember giving away prizes for showing themselves to see the movie. After watching the movie, I see why. The film was not bad, nor was it great. The problem with this movie was that he tried to tell a story. They created a new story, new heroes, and tried to wrap it around the Saga of Champions. My biggest complaint is that the plot is about the second wave of Robotech Masters attacking Earth. They even used the same scenes with Master Saga, but with a different dialogue. As a child, I loved this movie. But unfortunately I have not seen him as an adult and I can not give a better review. Looking back, I was disappointed, but now I would like to see the film and re-evaluate my position in this matter. Having said, can anyone release this movie so that the whole world can judge him? I love Robotech and I can not wait for The Shadows Chronicles.
