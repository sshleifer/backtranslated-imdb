Some people may call Pauli's "children's" movie, but I want to say that it's something more. Probably more than anything else, this film successfully makes a lot of effort to show the difficult situation of immigrants in the United States - current in the light of recent debates. The film depicting a parrot telling a Russian immigrant (Tony Shalhoub) how he searched America for his original owners tells a few stories. There is an elderly woman (Gena Rowlands) with whom she befriends, then a Mexican immigrant (Cheech Marin) and others. <br /> <br /> In all, it's a very well made movie. Usually, I do not expect too much from this type of movie, but this is a real treat. I certainly recommend it. Starring Jay Mohr, Buddy Hackett, Bruce Davison, Hallie Eisenberg and Trini Alvarado.
