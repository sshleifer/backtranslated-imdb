Return to page 10 of this review section and work back. Go ahead; I'll wait. <br /> <br /> Done? Well, you probably noticed the same trend that I have. You could look through all sorts of jokes, obsolete time and obvious plot points, as well as "Bogusie" throughout the day, but this movie seems to be one of those that "now hate me, love me later". br /> The biggest problem of Bill and Ted was that the original appealed to children from the 80s, who followed the trends and considered themselves the best in fashion. he would be caught dead wear anything except a flannel or admission that he liked everything in the 1980s. As Ted would say: "Dude, this is a completely deep hole. Do you want to play 20 questions? <br /> <br /> They say that nostalgia goes in 20-year cycles, and it certainly seems to take place here. In 2010, those who grew up with Cindi Lauper and Megadeth begin to look back to appreciate some of these key films that (like it or not) have made us who we are. If you are one of those who look at "Bogus", as if it were outdated ("Fa gs!") Ripoff, then you lose the point and probably spent six years on enlarging your facial hair, wearing flannel and looking like you just crawled out of bed . <br /> <br /> In establishing the origin (Star Trek episode and travel time with a phone booth, B & T does not try to hide the love of its creators to homage Quentin Tarantino, someone? I do not say that "Bogus" is "true love "But I think you should appreciate what it is: a funny approach to our society in time before child psychology, Ritalin, anti-smoking, terrorist paranoia and the spread of fear of the media. <br /> <br /> So for you All B & T haters ... turn off the CD Screaming Trees, get rid of your face hair, go to the beach and get yourself in. Narcissistic depression and intellectual boredom are so corporate.
