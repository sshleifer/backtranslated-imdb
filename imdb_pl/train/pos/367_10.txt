"Purple color" is really amazing. There is no such, and I do not think it will ever be. It is a roll that costs emotion and pain that the viewer takes. The actors are unmistakable and the direction is excellent. I liked it very much. The film never enjoyed me. This is beautiful, the best way to explain it.
