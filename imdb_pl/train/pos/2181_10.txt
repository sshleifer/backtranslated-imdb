<br /> <br /> An artistic approach, the actors accurately portray their role. You get a real feeling by watching Lucienne go from poverty to the most beautiful girl in the area. A sense of tragedy to overcome the tragedy again. In total, I've seen this movie at least 10 times. And it's VERY good to say that Prix De Beute (Beauty Award, Miss Europe) is the favorite of my silent movie collection. The expressiveness of Louise Brooks is perfect and I recommend this movie EVERYONE who values ​​artistic beauty in combination with the tragic plot.
