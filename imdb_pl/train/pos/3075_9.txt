A brilliant film about family, guilt, sacrifice, betrayal and love. Macy is such a great actor. It was a pity to see him in the same scenes with Campbell, who looks like part of a neurotic sexual object, but there are no chops that could work with him at the level he called the script for. But he is such a good actor that he played to its level so that the scenes would work. I am very happy with the cast of Tracey Ullman as a neglected wife. Who knew? Sutherland is also very good. The way he moves makes his character look taller (and even younger in some scenes). Almost everyone knew what they were doing. <br /> <br /> Macy's presentation of the only situation in which his character is unable to watch is nothing but a full mastery.
