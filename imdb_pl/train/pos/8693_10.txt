I was quite young when it came out in the US, but I recorded it from television and watched it over and over until I remembered the whole thing. To this day I still catch on quoting this. The concert itself was fun and had many famous characters, from Frank Sinatra, Sylvester Stallone, to Mr. T. GÅ‚osy were great and sounded like the characters they portrayed. The puppets were also well done, though a bit scary. I was surprised when I learned recently that it was written by Rob Grant and Doug Naylor of Red Dwarf, a show that I like very much. As someone else wrote earlier, I was also robbed of this great performance by a "friend" who borrowed it and never returned it. I certainly would like there to be enough demand for this program to guarantee the release of the DVD, but I do not think that enough people have heard about it. Well, maybe I'll try e-bay ...
