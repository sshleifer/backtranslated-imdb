As an adult, I really liked this one. I watched it with my 2 granddaughters and the 3 1/2 year old was fascinated and the 15-month old giggled on mice. <br /> <br /> Music is fun and the animation is wonderful. This continuation did not fulfill what Return to Neverland. A good continuation of Cinderella's history; but what will happen to Drusilla? Another continuation? I hope!
