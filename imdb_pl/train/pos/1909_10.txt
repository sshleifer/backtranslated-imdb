I originally watched 8 simple rules on the Disney channel in the UK in the first series and became completely fascinated. When they did not show it, he was annoyed, but then abc 1 showed the second series. I did not think the next series would start after I read that John Ritter had died, but the second series was not amazing, the latest series returned to the old, excellent standard. I hope they will soon be producing more shows, even if I can watch every program a thousand times. Kaley couco is my favorite character as Bridget airhead and also performs as Charmed. Rory is good, he shares my name and Grampa. I will watch him until he is finished by that time. I hope it will be as fun as ever
