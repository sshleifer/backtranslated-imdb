Every child older enough to sit in front of the screen will be absolutely captivated by beautiful drawings and great music in this sincere and funny re-writing of the Grimms fairy tale. They will sing "Bibbity-Bobbity-Boo" before they even make a full sentence and sing for the rest of their lives. This is a classic for all children, especially adults who are young at heart.
