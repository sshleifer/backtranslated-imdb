This is not like any other movie. The closest thing I can compare is Woody Allen's movie ... But where, like Woody Allen is constantly exploring human weaknesses, Bret Carr seems to be trying to find a way to deal with one paralyzing insecurity that usually defines us on better or worse. In the case of Lou, this is the main cause of his stuttering, which can be attributed to a single trauma of the hood, which is revealed by flash backs. <br /> <br /> There are so many strange neurotic people in the world and I believe that everyone deserves a chance for redemption, although the diversity of human character is what makes the world so an intriguing place, so maybe we should not fix our neurosis anymore than we should repair our noses or breasts. /> <br /> This is an independent movie filmed for a long time, but the production value is huge, as is the film's range. I feel like a bizarre gem on the self-help market. I really can not wait to see what the filmmaker is doing next, I imagine a career like Woody Allen or Albert Brooks, although usually when a guy like this gets through, he leaves and does "X MEN" and his modest bizarre beginnings quickly forget, or are they ... X Men is a bunch of freaks, if I remember correctly :)
