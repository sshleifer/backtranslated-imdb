I was pleasantly surprised that I really enjoyed this movie. Witty writing (some "inside" jokes that I got, others that I did not have - maybe because of the actors speaking one above the other), great acting (especially John Cassini), great scenes, interesting and unique directing. I hired him to see Jeffrey Meek (very disappointed that he was in such a short time, he blinked and you will miss him!), But the movie was extremely funny. I'll really look at it again before I send Netflix. I think that actors and would-be actors will enjoy this film. The ending is somewhat anticipated but would like them to do something different (and more positive). It is a pity that the film was not received better, with the exception of the "festival" market. I suggest it to everyone who loves working in business.
