Whenever I hear a film being advertised because there is no sex, violence, bad language, special effects and so on, my b.s. the detector goes out. Usually, such a movie is a sentimental whip that is directed towards people who do not want to surprise them, but they confirm how craven folk are to us. So when THE STRAIGHT STORY by David Lynch started receiving such reviews, I was apprehensive, especially since I was not a fan of his other "uplifting" story, SUN. For all the stunning images and the good game in this film, it seemed that we were more interested in preaching to us than inspiring us. <br /> <br /> I did not have to worry. THE STRAIGHT STORY is a fair film, not saccharin. Most of this is due to the fact that Lynch and the writers John Roach and Mary Sweeney tell it in a simple and simple way. There are several Straight homilies that I could do without, and the shots of harvested cereals are repeated too much, but these are only trifles. There is no heavy message, no sentimental strings that would torment our emotions or patronize us and their characters. Instead, they depend on the plot to build their own power, and it is, so we are really moved in the final scene. <br /> <br /> Of course, Richard Farnsworth's casting adds realism to the parts. He really is someone who looks like he has lived a lot, but still perseveres, and beyond these homilies, the desire he must recover with his brother does not seem too sentimental, because you can sense that someone lived too long and I saw too much to be angry for a long time. And he knows that his time is coming to an end, so he wants to calm down, not only with his brother, but with his life. Sissy Spacek also performs a great, unmanaged job as Straight's daughter. And although I am a city and a suburban boy, the Iowa and Wisconsin landscape is beautifully filmed, which makes me want to at least visit one day.
