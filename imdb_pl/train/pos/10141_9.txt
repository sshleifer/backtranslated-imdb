I was ready to perform this episode, seeing that this "Master" really does not have any horror films under the belt ... but this is the best episode of the season. <br /> <br /> Acting was good !! I do not know how he did it, but in this episode we have some real talent! And although you've seen things coming from a mile away from the story, it was at least fun and I managed to keep me in full 56 minutes, which was missing in the series so far. <br /> <br /> I especially liked the piece at the end, not the twist of the saying, but just a funny piece, in which it becomes, as always, my husband's pockmark. <br /> <br /> Very good effort. As I said in other reviews - these are not real masters doing many of these episodes ... but they may someday become champions in the future.
