This is a real movie from the 80s: then they made maybe 100 times more movies than they do today, and that makes a lot of them quite interesting ... It was a cultural phenomenon that no longer exists. Nowadays, maybe the same kind of people who would make cheap movies "straight on video" in the eighties, make cheap porn. Porn seems to sell. Anyway, this is above the average level of the junk movie: it has a good and fascinating story, and I think it is quite well made. In one scene you can even see how the microphone sways at the top of the picture. Of course there are also small scenes of Ozzy and Gene Simmons, but they do not contribute much to the "success" of the movie, although they are good in their small roles. The monster, the singer of "Sammi Curr", looks really terrible, especially when he sings. One of the most terrible monsters I've ever seen in horror movies. I can have nightmares about him at night. Not recommended for lovers of intellectual films.
