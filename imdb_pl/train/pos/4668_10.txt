This film now appears on digital television at least once a month, I watched it a dozen or so times and never cease to delight me. If it was tomorrow, I would watch it again. This is the artistry that can be created by Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith, the two great magicians of the acting profession, helped greatly by the excellent trio of support of Karl Malden, Bob Newhart and Robert Morley. Not forgetting others in smaller roles. <br /> <br /> It is a simple story, just said, ex-con, nice defraudator, fighting and successful with "new technology of age", ie. Computers and finding a feeling in this process. Even if it's a bit (cheek) unlikely, even unbelievable, the characters are not. There is no violence, no sex, no bad language, and most importantly, there is no horrible method of action that is so common today. A real lesson for contemporary filmmakers on how to make a great show with, and virtually, nothing ... except for outstanding talents.
