If you did not like this movie, or your dead, or you hate Adam Sandler or Don Cheadle. <br /> <br /> A great cast, everyone gave good performances. This film proved that Adam Sandler is a good actor, despite what the critics say. Adam Sandler becomes a very respected actor. It all started with his performance at Big Daddy, then he made some bad movies, then broke with an amazing performance in the first 50 dates, the longest yard, then click, and now Reign Over Me. > Return to the movie. Adam Sandler plays a man who lost everything. The closest family is the mother-in-law and father-in-law. After his old collegue at college (Cheadle) came up with him, he seems to be turning his life away. I will not say more because I do not want to spoil the movie, but I definitely recommend this movie. One of the best films of 2007.
