It was a jewel. Incredible acting from the leaders Liam Cunningham, Orla Brady and the entire cast. The film covers not only the history of Ireland and Ireland, but also many communities around the world and many units of marriage in these communities. With intensity and sincerity, the film shows how religious beliefs and traditions stuck a wedge into a loving and passionate family. The title 'Divided Love' would not be better. Although it was a real story that took place in Ireland in the 50th year, seeing how the life of the entire village is eroded and the "pogroms" begin, I remembered the history of Russia. Intolerance and prejudice are still too powerful in the world and unfortunately deeply hidden in human nature. As in the film, the character Liam Cunningham says "hatred always existed under the surface." It was interesting to observe the moral choices people made in this story. Also the character of the Catholic priest and what happened to him at the end of the story was quite significant. But history gives hope that the love of two people can overcome everything, and love makes us better, stronger. Liam Cunningham's character undergoes a whole change in history, becoming the man he always wanted to be. Again, acting is at the highest level. The story is fast. The Irish countryside is as beautiful as ever. Highly recommended.
