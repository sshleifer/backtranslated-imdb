It's a stupid movie of a thinking man. If you do not expect Star Wars and enjoy British humor, it can become an iconic classic for you, just like for my wife and me - from casting "the voice" of Cary Grant and Jack Nicholson on martianes to too simplified people from Big Bean is a movie that you can either sleep or watch carefully and enjoy in any way. <br /> <br /> It's not for everyone, but if you like a relaxing, easy mood that requires a quick mind to see a joke when it eludes, you'll love this movie.
