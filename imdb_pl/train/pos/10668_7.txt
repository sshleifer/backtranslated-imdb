As many reviewers have noted, the film version is slightly different from the story version of the story. I have never seen the stage version of this story, which is why I have a more favorable film review than many other reviewers. Perhaps Richard Attenborough was not the best choice for the director of the film, but the film is still a fun introduction to several dancers who are trying to use their time in the choreographer Michael Douglas. The film is right without selecting any known actors or performers who will be in the last trial group. In this way, our attention focuses on the movements of dancers and individual stories and struggles that develop during the rehearsal of rehearsals. Douglas is probably not the best choice for this part. Apparently, some of the songs were cut in favor of the new one, and a behind-the-scenes story about the romantic relationship between the dancer and the choreographer was added. I must admit that it was the weakest part of the film. Cassie's repeated intrusions during rehearsals seem to reflect the almost desperate requests that often have to be made when engaging in artistic competitions without talent and / or happiness. However, this aspect of the movie has been made to die in the past and it is interesting to see this tired, old shoe that again rises in the heel. The apparitions of the dancers themselves began promisingly with the help of the number "I can do it", but then they got a little deeper at different times while the dancers told their stories. Honestly, their stories were not much different from real people who never have a chance. *** 4 stars.
