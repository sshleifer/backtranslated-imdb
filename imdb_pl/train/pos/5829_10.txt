This is one of my two or three favorite Stooges shorts and no doubt the best performance of Christine McIntyre with the trio. She's good at many other shorts, but here she is absolutely brilliant. Her singing is not funny at all, in fact it is beautiful, but the plot is constructed in such a way that the singing strengthens the mood and does not diminish it. We're listening to how McIntyre sings the whole Voice of Spring not less than three times, but never gets old, partly because we do not get bored of her voice, and partly because she blends in so well with Stooges' antics. The use of opera soprano in comedy resembles Kitty Carlisle in "Marx's" A Night At The Opera ", but singing is much more part of the comedy than in" Opera "and McIntyre (maybe more in other performances than here) presenting his own comedy talent, which Carlisle never did. Stooges' rebellion, McIntyre's singing and a well-constructed plot combine in 5 out of 5 stars.
