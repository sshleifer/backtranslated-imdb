Henry Fonda perfectly captured what we believed that Abraham Lincoln was similar. He is a fool. Thanks to Fonda's performance, we are convinced that Abraham Lincoln was there. But thanks to the confrontation with the mob lynch, and especially during court proceedings, you can see that under the external postures there is a genius man who knows very well what is going on around him and how to influence people around him. <br /> <br /> In this movie, Henry Fonda shows that he understands how to express humor very well. This is an aspect that he has lost over the years. When he tells stories and jokes, he has the perfect time. There is a sequence in the process that makes me laugh pretty hard. He presents this gift again in The Lady Eve in 1940. <br /> <br /> The ending of John Ford is absolutely brilliant with Henry Fonda going to the top of the hill, and in the distance a huge symbolic storm of civil war. Goes to history. Film is fiction, but insight into Lincoln is huge. It's definitely worth seeing again.
