I've also been looking for this movie for a long time and how great it would be to find it on DVD ... <br /> <br /> I saw this movie when I was 6 years old in the Netherlands. I was impressed by this. It was shown before JUNGLE BOOK Walt Disney! <br /> <br /> What I remember from this movie is fragmentary. I remember that an Indian boy was an eagle friend. It made a great impression on me. For some reason he was thrown out of his village (he did not understand the reason for this). When the other boys threw stones at him, he climbed the stone and jumped down. At that time, he turned into an eagle and flew away with his eagle friend. As an eagle he still wore a turquoise necklace. <br /> <br /> CB
