I saw this movie when I was 13 years old and I really liked that plato, which later played different hits as a kimberly drummer. I do not think it's rubbish. It was not supposed to be a continuation of a documentary film. it's just a cute movie for children with three children who are chasing men trying to find a swampy monster from the stream. men are injured and children save them with the help of creation. terrible arrows of the Arkhian swamp and scenery. it's a good movie for children, no real violence, some mild horror, but good fun for young children.
