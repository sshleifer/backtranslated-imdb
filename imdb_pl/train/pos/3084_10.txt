Oh, why? "Six Degrees" is a series about this so-called theory that we're all connected by someone. If you focus on the life of a group of people and the consequences of their actions. <br /> <br /> When I heard about this concert for the first time, it did not pay attention to me. Actually, it seemed too ordinary. Then I saw some episodes ... and I loved it! First of all, characters. They are all well written and different from each other. He is addicted to alcohol, a woman whose fianc√©e betrays her, a woman who has just lost her husband, a driver who has a troublesome brother, etc. Contrary to what we are used to, most characters interact with the victims as in our daily activities . Great! My favorites are Mae, Carlos and Whitney. <br /> <br /> Then the cast. They are all great. Jay Hernandez from "Hostel" here shows his acting skills in a more three-dimensional character than his previous job as Paxton. The others give great performances, especially Campbell Scott, who plays Steven and Bridget Moynahan, who plays Whitney. <br /> <br /> Well, when I came to IMDb, after seeing some episodes, I could not believe that it was canceled. Seriously, I do not understand low grades. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that there is no more than one season. It's a really good concert!
