This is my first comment on the IMDb site, and the reason I am writing this is because we're talking about ONE OF THE BEST FILMS EVER! "Ne goryuy!" Will make you laugh and cry at the same time, fall in love (if you are not a fan yet!) In the Georgian tradition of singing the choir and probably accept the hardships of your own existence and just feel good after seeing it :) What I really like about this film is that actors in non-leading roles create vivid and memorable characters and are as interesting and important as the main character. The film features Vahtang Kikabidze (which is great), but you'll remember every face around him in the movie. You find yourself quoting their poems that have become home names for many Russian-speaking people. A movie with which to live. Simple but deep, you will want to watch it repeatedly.
