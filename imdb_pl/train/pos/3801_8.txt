It is an animated film CGI based on the French animated series 2D. The series was briefly released on Cartoon Network, but its course was so short that it became one of the potential Oscar nominees for the best animated film this year, leaving most of the people I know, "Huh?" It's the story of Lian-Chu, nice myocardium and Whisto, the brain of the operation, which together with Hektor, his dragon-fiery dragon, is more like a dog. Travel around the world offering your services as a dragon hunter, but you will never get paid. In their life comes Zoe, a fairy tale that loves the niece of the king who blindly. It seems that the world is devoured by a huge monster and all the knights sent by the king have never returned or will return as ash if they return. In desperation, the king hires dragon hunters to stop the world eaters. Zoe of course marks ... <br /> <br /> What can I tell others why this film is hiding under the rock? It's a really good little movie that's completely out of the radar, unless it's an unlikely candidate for the Oscar. His beautifully designed, fantastic looking movie (the world in which it takes place, has floating lands and crazy creatures), which constantly forced me to "Wow". English Voice cast with Forrest Whitaker as Lian-Chu (one of the best vocal performances I've ever heard) and Rob Paulson as Gwizdo (I think Steve Bucsemi) is first class. Equally good is a script that does not appeal to the public, using some real statements that are usually not heard in animated films (not Disney or Pixar). It's all really well done. <br /> <br /> Is it perfect? No, some bits last too long, but at the same time are damn funny. <br /> <br /> If you have a chance, see this. This is one of the best animated films from 2008 and is on my nice list of surprises for 2009.
