I watched this movie after seeing Practical Magic, and the older movie was much better. I liked how the lighting, makeup and costumes changed when Gillian changed her story. Jimmy Stewart's manners have not done much for me in this movie, but I suppose they were used to emphasize Gillian's character reserve. I was also hit by the manners of Nicky and Gillian - as if the director wanted him to look effeminate, and Gillian to be manly. The gestures that Nicky makes when he shows Redlich were particularly struck by the powers. I have never considered wizards to be effeminate, so it was an interesting way to contrast these characters.
