Raoul Walsh's high-class classic from 1933, The Bowery places the owner of the salon and operator Wallace Beery against bitter rival and dandy, George Raft, the adopted street kid Jackie Cooper and handsome Faye Wray in the roles that play between them great competition. It is not clear what exactly competition is all about, but everyone follows it in everyday tabloids. Plenty of wisdom at the beginning, but the characters soften as the film progresses. In addition, there is an incredible abundance of scenes in Beery's salon. Different characters, a sexy line of choirs, a lot of drinking, the ideal creation of wickedness, which has not been overstretched by the so-called code restrictions, and later Carrie Nations led by Carrie Nation. All this creates a very vivid picture of life that has long since passed. I do not like to compare eras, but this movie is completely and completely different from anything you can see today. The film has a lot of heart and long lost innocence and is absolutely necessary.
