Michigan, Edgar Allen Poe, toaster and frying pan. . . If you do not mind a genre of psycho-thrillers or horror movies and you have a special place in your heart for this twisted movie, this is a movie for you. Extremely well-developed first film "Hatred of a Minute" contains all major hits, such as "Silence of the Lambs" and cult classics, such as "Army of Darkness". Editing and effects are well done, better than many movies in this genre. Kallio picks out a complicated tale of torment, based on both the Bible and Poe's writings. At a time when big budgets, movies with big names do not have too much content, an independent movie has revived this dying feature. If you love Michigan, a good story or a decent thriller, check "Hate to the minute".
