I saw this movie with my friend and we could not stop laughing! It means that there was nothing terrible in this movie! It was fun, all the lines that Freddy said were fun! I think they should not even make a new nightmare and just go to Freddy Vs. Jason. Although some parts were disgusting (like blowing up your head). and every street movie elm from 1 to 5 sucked. it was the best in addition to the number 1. I do not recommend this movie if you want a good horror movie. But if you have nothing else to rent, you will laugh a lot. I want to see a Texas sawing massacre. Freddy's Dead The Final Nightmare Overall rating: B-
