This movie attracts you and makes you look at the screen. The screenwriter / director is brilliant with narrative parts and the use of creative and interesting camera angles and perspectives, all of which add to the grip that holds him. Insomniac's Nightmare is original and refreshingly different from other movies you've seen. Is it a dream or reality? This indie will make you discuss the returns of actions that go through the conscious and the subconscious. He feels amazing with the dark interpretations of illusion. Dominic Monaghan really became insomnia. He is a great actor who is not hard on the eyes too! He really did his whole role in this role. From the storyline to the way it's filmed, this indie is one of my favorites. I highly recommend and eagerly look forward to more than this innovative, creative writer / director / operator !!!
