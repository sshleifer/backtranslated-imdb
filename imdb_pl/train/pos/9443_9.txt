It is a pity that Deliverance is known mainly as a movie about rape with red beaks and about Banjos duels. Even people who have seen this movie can not get away from this rape scene. It is not as bad as the rape scene in Pulp Fiction. Certainly not as bad as any female rape scene in almost every movie. People tend to long for the power of a movie that contains the infamous buggery scene. <br /> <br /> Acting, story, pictures and soundtrack of Deliverance, it feeds dark charisma. The backcountry in which it was filmed is beautiful and completely contrasts with the dark theme. Actors, both major and minor, make you feel like you are swimming down the river with them. <br /> <br /> What distinguishes this film from others is the tangible sense of fear that inspires it. Few films can make you feel like it's happening. Bottom Line: This movie is a classic. I can not really say anything more.
