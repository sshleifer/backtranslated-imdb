One of the best movies I've ever seen was an Irish movie called Philadelphia Here Here Come. I read the play before I saw the movie and I loved them both. This is the story of a young man preparing to leave Ireland to go to America because he can not earn a living in Ireland. This is being talked about from the perspective of a young man (whom other characters in the film see), as well as another young man representing his uncensored thoughts and feelings. But other characters in the film can not be seen. This is a very sad movie, but deeply moving and I recommend this film to anyone who wants to think about something. I love every Irish movie, or almost every movie about Ireland, and every movie with late Irish actor Donal McCann gets my vote. I would watch that a man chews gum for 2 hours on the screen and unfortunately I have. It is a pity that I lost him so young.
