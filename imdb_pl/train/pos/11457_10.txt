As the jacket says, this movie is "Beautifully filmed and mastered", and yes, it is mesmerizingly beautiful. The timelessness that we perceive in the stoic rock and in the constant outflow and stream of water, shows the ephemeral works at Goldsworthy's hands, so that in their very ephemeral they point to eternity. <br /> <br /> And so the beauty of his composition haunt us with just a bit of melancholy woven into it - or with the words of Matthew Arnold from "Dover Beach": <br /> <br /> Listen! you hear the rasping roar of pebbles that waves go back, and throw themselves, After their return, up the high band, start and stop, then start again, With a trembling cadence, slowly and bring eternal note of sadness. br /> <br /> At some point at the end of the movie, Goldsworthy says that "The words do their job, but what I do here says a lot more." As a self, I do not take offense and I do not think it immodest for a moment, because the combination of form and time, change and texture, and the color and composition that Goldsworthy scrupulously and intuitively creates is really more than just words. <br /> <br /> At another point he talks about "What stays here ... what is not". This is his motive. <br /> <br /> I think artists in the twentieth century realized how ephemeral even the greatest works of art are compared to the vastness of cosmic time; so they began to reflect this understanding, composing works that were deliberately ephemeral. The point was that by emphasizing how short even the most powerful works of people are, the sense of the timelessness of art will be expressed. <br /> <br /> Perhaps part of Goldsworthy's work efficiency is in this sense of expression. He scrupulously composes some form of straw or leaves, where the wave will reach her or put her in the river, where she will be swept; and in this process, both the composition and its ephemeris are combined. <br /> <br /> Both transient and timeless are essential so that we can understand our world and our place in it. It is important that these works are carried out in the context of nature, so that what is made up is embedded in the natural. So stone walls and stone eggs, which Goldsworthy constructions are quiet and solid, but we know that they are not monuments of eternity, but will remain for some indefinite time, and then disperse and return to a state similar to that which existed before our coming . <br /> <br /> It's an art that should be art, similar to spiritual. <br /> <br /> In a sense, Goldsworthy's work is an inarticulate understanding. This experience only time and form. In a sense, his work "corresponds" to Shelley's famous poem "Ozymandias", saying that the wave repays the work, and even when the river distracts expression, art lives through our experience. Similarly, we think about Tibetan paintings made of sand, carefully composed and measured, and then, when they are so beautifully and precisely finished, they are transmitted to the wind so that we can know that everything is a stream. <br /> <br /> However, in the modern world these works will survive in pictures and movies. Goldsworthy is a great photographer (I would like to say) and all his work, even the unsuccessful ones, tells us that they are photographed so that he can look at them in a more reflective mood and see what he has achieved and what he does not have. <br /> <br /> This cinema production directed by Thomas Riedelsheimer with the beautiful and appropriately haunted music of Fred Frith can not be ignored. This is one of the most beautiful documentaries I've ever seen and one of the most spiritual ones.
