This comedy, which was in the center and outside Detroit skirts, turned out to be a great comedic duo. "Noriyuki Pat Morita" is a very funny man who is a policeman from Japan on the trail of a thief of industrial secrets who stole a proto-type turbo super-proto, reluctant to go to the United States to follow a thief, after the command of his commander. Pat's character collides with the character "Jay Leno", in a quick voice, but with the type of Detroit policeman. But when they cross each other, the honorary "Ways" of Japan meet with the old police detective "Ways" from Detroit. They both stumble and stumble at first, but then they develop a "rhythm" that turns into an explosive two-layered team that solves the matter in the cold. After fighting with the city's chief of crime for stolen "equipment" and closing the case, these two pass away from themselves to be friends and work together. A little worse when it comes to wear, and for this you need longer holidays, they manage to achieve a victorious closure. I judged it as 9. The direction of Lewis makes it "an almost perfect comedy. Fun for all ages. I recommend it very much. (***)
