Well, maybe not just before Rodney King's riots, but even a few months earlier it was valid enough. My parents said they saw it, and the next thing you know, the police were acquitted and LA was burned to the ground. This shows the state of racial relations in America. The plot has a white tentacle (Kevin Kline) and an African-American Simon (Danny Glover), who become friends after Simon rescues Mack's life in the black ghetto. Meanwhile, film producer Davis (Steve Martin in a serious role) thinks that unjustified violence is really cool ... until he's shot. There is also existentialism in the film: Mack and his family realize that they do not live as they want. <br /> <br /> It seems that "Crash" slightly renewed people's interest in racial relations, but this one came out much earlier. Maybe we will never be able to maintain stable racial relations in this country. But one way or another, the Grand Canyon is a great movie. Confirms that Kevin Kline is my favorite actor. The stars also include Mary McDonnell, Mary-Louise Parker and Alfre Woodard.
