This western roaring horn and I watched it many times and is playing at every level. However, if your real facts about legends like Hickcock, Cody and Calamity Jane, look somewhere else, as John Ford suggested that it is the West, when the truth becomes a legend, print a legend. The story moves with an amazing pace, and Gary Cooper and Jean Arthur talk to two very visible stars who help create this movie. Sharp eyes among you can just see Gabby Hayes as an Indian boy scout, there is also a very young Anthony Quinn who debuts as a Cayenne Warrior. In fact, he married one of Demilles' daughters in reality. I'm done, and when the loans go down, the American sunset merges with American history. So take some time to watch this classic western.
