Some say that since the 11th season South Park has begun a trend of leaving its politically satirical satire on a shallow parody; but it can not be further from the truth. <br /> <br /> While this episode impersonates the Living Dead series, there are more of them. It's a satire about how people treat the homeless. Characters say things like "They pretend to be like us" or "They want to be people." This episode attacks the culture of people who ignore the lower class, often simply unhappy. <br /> <br /> So yes, it's still satire, and also a wonderful parody. What more could you want?
