If I'm going to watch a porn movie, I'd rather have some kind of plot and a dialogue of descent. Behind Bedroom Doors is one of the few with whom I have met these attributes. <br /> <br /> A new girl from the neighborhood deceives the human nature and weaknesses of the neighbors she concerns. Chelsea Blue (I mean Brooke LaVelle) is a chosen actress who plays the role of a blackmailing seducer and plays this role well. Chelsea Blue is a very talented and extremely beautiful actress. The film has 10 points because it is in it. Her partner in the film, Monique Alexander, is a definite cutie. They both should work with each other. In this movie, Monique, who plays Gigi, does not have much to do or say. Detriment. It looks like he has more talent to share. I like a girl who was a (possible) wife of the district prosecutor. I forgot her name, but she is quite pretty and is not a bad actress. Nicole Sheridan ... I'm still trying to figure out what some people are so excited about. It is obvious that there are parts of it bought for a fee. Which is all right, but is she finished? I'm sorry, give me a break! I am afraid that her performance here would lower some of the ratings, with the exception of Chelsea's talent and beauty, which outweigh any negatives. In general, this movie is good.
