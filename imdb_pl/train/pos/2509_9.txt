Vampires, sexy guys, weapons and some blood. Who could ask for more? Moon Child delivers everything in one nice package! Gackt is an innocent Sho - who befriends Vampire Kei (HYDE), their relationship grows over time, but as Sho gets old, Kei's immortality breaks his heart. It does not help that they both fall in love with the same woman. The special effects are quite good considering the small budget. It is a moving story full of human emotions. You will laugh, cry, laugh and then cry more. Even if you are not a fan of their music, SEE THIS FILM. It works great as an independent vampire movie. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10
