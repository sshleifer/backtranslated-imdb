One of the smartest movies of serial killer in recent history. ZODIAC KILLER offers an ingenious look at the background and story of one of the most famous serial killers. The creators of the film discover unexpectedly a good insight into the pathology of this mysterious killer and anyone who remembers the Zodiac will be intrigued. Others will want to learn more about this mysterious criminal. Unlike many serial killers, Zodiac was not crazy at all, but very methodical and self-promotional. The director plays here the viewer's expectations and pulls him away. The film is constructed as the secret of murder or a cold box-style thriller. This is a smart horror in the investigation and procedural style that discourages gore-hounds in the search for cheap emotions. <br /> <br /> Some people do not like movies shot on video. This attitude is very old and provincial. It is an attitude and a look at films that pose technical problems above the entertainment value or artistic value. These attitudes are running out. ZODIAC KILLER is undoubtedly a low-budget film, but demanding viewers will look further and find a carefully made jewel.
