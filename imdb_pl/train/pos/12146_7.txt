Return to the 36th Chamber is one of those classic Kung-Fu movies that Shaw produces in the 1970s and 1980s, whose genre is the equivalent of spaghetti westerns in Hollywood, and the hero Gordon Liu, the equivalent of West Clint Eastwood. Digitally remastered and the new print made at Fantastic Film Fest, is "Presented in Shaw Scope", just like old good times. <br /> <br /> This film is a simple story of good versus evil, told in three acts that more or less summarize the narrative of martial arts films in that era. <br /> <br /> The first act establishes the premise. The employees of the paint shop in a small village are dissatisfied with their fate, because their salaries are reduced by 20% by incoming Manchu gangsters. They can not do much about their exploitation, because none of them is a martial art capable of fighting gangsters and their boss. Initially, they had little success in persuading Liu to impersonate a highly qualified Shaolin monk (one of the best comedy sequences), but their outrage was revealed when they crossed the line of credibility, pretending too many times. <br /> <br /> The second act shows a hero who wants to return to the crowd. However, without real martial arts, he sets out on a journey to the Shaolin Temple, trying to penetrate and learn martial arts slyly. After a few moments the slapstick is finally accepted by the Abbot (whom he impersonated!), But he is disappointed with the teaching methods - a bit like the style of Mr. Miyagi in Karate Kid, but instead of painting fences, he can build scaffolding around the temple. Nothing can stop a good man, and he unconsciously builds strength, endurance and learns kung-fu in an unconventional way. <br /> <br /> The third act is the place where the martial festival begins. Thanks to cheesy sound effects, any obvious lack of contact with the film receives the maximum impact efficiency. But it is rather refreshing to watch combat scenes here, with wide shots in order to emphasize clarity and detail between sparring partners, as well as using slow motion to show acrobatics at different angles. The speed of the fight may be a little too slow, with some break between moves, but when Yuen Wo Ping and his style are used by ad-naus in Hollywood movies, they certainly do not make battle scenes like they used to! The return to the 36th chamber is repeated on Monday, so what are you waiting for if you are playing a nostalgic journey through the memory strip?
