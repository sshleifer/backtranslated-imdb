Snobs and pseudo-experts regard it as "far from the best De Siki". Those who suffer from a serious lack of innocence will find it difficult to connect with this masterpiece. De Sica spoke very simply. His Italianness does not have the intricate self-esteem of contemporary Italian filmmakers, nor the bitter parody of Pietro Germi, the acute sweetness of Mario Monicelli, the seriousness of Visconti or the cold observation of Antonioni. De Sica told us stories like a father sitting on the edge of a children's bed before going to bed. There is no attempt at intellectualization. Miracolo A Milano, and to a lesser extent Il Giudizio Universale are realistic cartoons or what we today call magic realism. The film is a jewel from start to finish, and Toto is a kind of character that you accept with an open heart, but of course it requires a heart. Cinema in the purest form. Magnificent.
