Although it is not as wild and not as popular as some of Takashi Miike's later films, this is a very good crime drama. <br /> <br /> The basic story is the story of a policeman of a Japanese policeman with Chinese parents trying to take down a Chinese gangster. Complicating is that his younger brother acts as a lawyer for the villain and his gang. The film is much more complicated, with a few complications that make things interesting and divert attention away from the central narrative sequence. This is the complication and loss of the road about an hour of the movie, which makes it less than a great movie. (It's a very good movie) It's definitely worth seeing, especially if you do not mind madness. /> <br /> A word of warning, violence when it happens is explosive and unpleasant. There are also semi-graphic depictions of gay sex. If this is not your cup of tea, proceed with caution. <br /> <br /> 7 or 8 out of 10.
