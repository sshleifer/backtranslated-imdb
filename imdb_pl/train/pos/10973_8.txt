A great movie showing the pitiful life of two naughty old ladies. They could not live together or separately. Still chattering, sometimes at the same time, they erased and rewrote the past; further and further on what could have happened. Sometimes I laughed, but mostly I was taken from how sad and abandoned these two women were. See this one.
