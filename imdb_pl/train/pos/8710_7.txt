I remember this program from Swedish television. I was only 7 years old and it terrified me beyond any doubt. <br /> <br /> I would like to re-visit this series and see if it was as perfect as remember, although I suspect that my taste and requirements have changed. <br /> <br /> Although it was released before the alien and a lot of other space thrillers, I suspect that it has its roots in scary movies from the 1950s and the political climate of the '70s. When I think about it, it was a real science fiction, a film trying to discuss scientific and political questions about who we are and what we are. The term sci-fi has since become bleak and has become a term for any movie in which spaceships are located.
