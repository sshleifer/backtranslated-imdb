I watched this movie on TV and I could not turn it off. Peter Sellers plays an unlikely guy who falls in love with the unusually warm and sweet Goldie Hawn (who would not have done it?). The way in which the character Goldie behaves from the beginning of the movie to the end is non-traditional today. This movie gave me a different perspective on interpersonal relationships, and also very funny. The role of Peter Sellers was difficult, but it seems to me that he does it well.
