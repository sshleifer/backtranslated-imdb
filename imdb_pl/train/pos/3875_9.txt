This film was made by one of the most absurd humorists in Canada, Yves P. Pelletier. For a moment I was shocked that he created a comedy ROMANTIC, but knowing that he is a tough supporter, he could be seen at every local festival and local cinematography. Hell, I was right. From the very beginning, the screenplay (written by Pelletier himself) is somewhat curled and difficult to track, but in Pelletier's fashion it is a one of a kind 90-minute jack-in-the-box. <br /> <br /> Loosely inspired and transformed allusion to Dangerous Liaisons (by Laclos) "Les Aimants" consists of a twisted game of saving notes on the fridge. Throughout the film you will have the opportunity to find out who is who and who is writing to whom on this damn refrigerator .... which appears in an interesting affair. <br /> <br /> Great plot, great photography, great quotes from other movies. Should we ask for more for the first film?
