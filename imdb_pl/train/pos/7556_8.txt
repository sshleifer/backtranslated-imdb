Ok, it was a damned good episode. Much better than the loan he receives. <br /> <br /> The camera's work is great. The best yet. I love this last shot. The atmosphere is fantastic, the costumes are great, and the cast of guests (without helpless victims) is strong. <br /> <br /> I do not like many things in this episode that remain unexplained. Why is sex changing? what is the goal? are they aliens? what kind? why have they never been shown again in later mythology? <br /> <br /> I give this section a high THREE stars. One of my favorites, but the role-playing holes disturb me. Still ... I will not let it ruin my entertainment.
