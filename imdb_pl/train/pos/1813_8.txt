In my case, I liked this movie because when I saw it, I found more than I expected. This is one of the few animated films that made me think about it even after finishing it. It speaks of death, revenge and hell in such a way that it reaches you like a blow to the face, reaching even for the sequence of dreams in the middle of the movie. It makes this movie so good: the unique ability of Don Bluth (director) to play with the feelings of people and make them love or hate characters in a short time. This and the fact that he has as many good characters as Charlie and Ann-Marie that in a sad but happy ending you have to say "I have something in my eye" to hide the others you were crying about. Everything I said is just some of the advantages of this movie. As for the rest, you must see them in the film very honestly. Don Bluth, thank you.
