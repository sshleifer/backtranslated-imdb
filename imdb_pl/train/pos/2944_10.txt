This is the most perfect show in history. I've seen a lot of standing performances, I've been to many stand-up shows and I've watched Comic View Bet, but I've never seen anyone match Murphy's skills in this program. The impressions are excellent, the skits are great and the time is perfect. You can even say that the crowd really falls in. When he did Raw a few years later, he was also very good, but it is number one in my book. It also shows that once, especially in the early eighties, Murphy was funny. My favorite part of the show is when he talks about a family barbecue and "Ice cream !!! Mooommmm !! Ice cream man is coming !!!! "Another great part is that his mother is like Clint Eastwood.
