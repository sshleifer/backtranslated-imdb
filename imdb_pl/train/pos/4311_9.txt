This work is less about the figure of Davis Steve Martin than about Kline (Mack) and Glover (Simon), Kline and McDonnell (Claire), but the dialogue introduced by Davis is considered contemplative, almost poetic existentialism. He is witty, intelligent and considerate in both providing dialogues and content. Writers deserved an Oscar. <br /> <br /> Performances are easy, relaxed and natural; just what you can expect from the actors "A List". Martin brings a performance that leads to his newer Shopgirl, leading you through life, love and pursuit of wisdom, if not happiness. Kline is a simple - suit - conformist film, and his performance is crisp and refreshing. <br /> <br /> This work is about living in all aspects. It evokes a real emotional investment in the form and gives you hope that humanity is not doomed, despite everything, regardless of what you believe in your soul. <br /> <br /> In total? It is amazing, with a difficult moment or two simple, natural dialogues that attract you, helping the public to get high pleasure from this job. It's definitely worth your time, though it may not be the best choice for Friday / Saturday entertainment. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed this interview. This is not typical and it was an unexpected surprise. Another great surprise was the sincerity presented here. Couples and friends carry out detailed conversations that feel and sound completely honest and (again) natural. I was very impressed with this work and soon I will add it to the DVD collection. <br /> <br /> Ocenia siÄ™ 9.1 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
