I always thought it would be a long and boring movie, Talking-Head, full of static interiors, old, I was wrong. "Election" is an extremely fascinating and engaging thriller, in which a deep and realistic picture is behind the beginnings of Triads-Rituals. The characters are constantly moving, and although as a viewer you always remain an outsider, you can still feel the tension resulting from certain decisions and ambitions of the characters. In addition, Johnnie manages to create really rich images thanks to meticulously composed lighting and moody contrasts of light and shadow. Although there is almost no action, the ending is still shocking because it is an absolute depiction of brutality. A nice movie that deserves more attention, and the minimalist acoustic guitar I liked a bit.
