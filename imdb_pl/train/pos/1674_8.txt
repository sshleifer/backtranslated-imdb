Lisa Baumer (Ida Galli) is an adulterous wife of a big businessman who inherits 1 million life insurance when her husband dies in a plane crash during a business trip. Initially, she is suspected of responsibility, just as her husbands have recently been changed, so she is sure she has insurance insurer Peter Lynch (George Hilton) and agent Interpol. Baumer goes to Athens in Greece to monetize his decline, but he insists on having it in cash ... a dangerous turn of events. Lynch, whose identity is now known to Baumer, tries to protect her from the lover of her husband Lara Florakis, who, however, along with his supporter Sharifem tries to kill them for the part of the money he considers legitimate. And here, our masked killer begins his brutal killings. Lynch, as is the case with our hero, is initially suspected by the Greek police and warned not to leave Athens by police inspector Stavros (Luigi Pistilli, a familiar face in Giallo and Spaghettis). Lynch is then helped by the wonderful Cl√©o Dupont (Anita Strindberg), a local journalist who helps him investigate the killings. To say that something more can ruin a movie for anyone who has not seen it, just say that there are enough red herrings from them it is likely that Mystery / Thriller fans are happy with this story driven by Giallo. DVD No Shame has an excellent transfer with both English and Italian soundtracks. He also has a very catchy result, in fact Bruno Nicolai, who will stay in your head for a moment .... altogether the first genre of Giallo.
