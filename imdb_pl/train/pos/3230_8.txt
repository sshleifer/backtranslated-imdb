OK, so Soldier is not as deep and meaningful as Blade Runner or such a big budget as Terminator 2, but overall I find it quite pleasant. <br /> <br /> The fact that Kurt Russell remained in character, did not speak and was practically emotionless moments in which his humanity broke even more piercingly. His image of limited emotional development was more touching than Arnie in T movies (and before I receive comments, I know that Arnie was a cyborg, and Kurt was a man, but the assumption of both films was the same). > <br /> So for the film itself, a reasonable American / British cast is able to develop this little story. Not sure if Gary Busey and his two deputies were bad or good things, so he could not decide if I liked them or not. The colony was a little more realistic, or a deceptive group of loving peace / gullible hicks who were wiped out of the way, nor a group of subversive aggressive paranoid terrorists about offworlders and others. Russell is good and unlike other comments, I do not think that it will have a negative impact on his career (unlike Escape from LA - the sequels are such a capricious creature!). Sean Pertwee really did take pride in his deceased father, continuing the family noble Sci-Fi line. And the rest of the cast helped to develop this pathetic group of people, taking advantage of the worst possible situation and not doing too badly. <br /> <br /> If you see it on your TV show, I recommend giving it a chance. I do not think you will be disappointed.
