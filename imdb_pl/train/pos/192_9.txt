Before I saw Show People, my impression of quiet comedy was basically slapstick and slapstick. I could not imagine how the screen comedy would be possible without relying heavily on the spoken word or on numerous pratfalls. But this masterful film proved that I was wrong. In my opinion, Davies was probably the greatest comedian who appeared before Lucille Ball. I mention Lucy first of all because Davies's mannerisms and facial expressions reminded me to such an extent that I wonder if Davies was not one of Ball's main influences. It comes from a 21-year-old who has never seen a quiet comedy before, and I must say that no matter how many specific periodic expressions (it did not happen), you will not be bored with the movie. You'll probably laugh even more than most talc comedies. It's not just my favorite quiet comedy, but easily among my ten favorite comedies of all time.
