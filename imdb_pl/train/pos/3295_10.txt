Such a film of beauty that is difficult to describe. Maybe it's a lack of unnecessary dialogue, or maybe it's an absolutely amazing soundtrack, or maybe it's just Meeny Mumari's feet, but watching this movie is still happy. I have never seen another Indian movie that would approach it, and few from any country compete for its perfection.
