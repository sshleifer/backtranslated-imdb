When I saw Birthday, I liked it so much that I decided to see every Nicole Kidman movie that I could, so that everyone would be disappointed. I theorize that although the presence of a particular star usually guarantees a certain level of quality due to their artistic control, it is due to the influence of Nicole Kidman that it is harmful to film pleasure - IMHO. Dogville, for example, even depriving the viewer of anything visual to diminish the existential insight that drives in the house, or other gay and lesbian promotion videos that are notable for anyone else, or other animal causes of Kidman. <br /> <br /> Here she is a natural woman and does a really great job. I do not know how or who could stop her, but apparently it worked. The way the film shows her openness, despite her resistance, reaches the heart of what makes a woman a woman. Consequently, what makes the most desperate human hopes are marginal. <br /> <br /> Of course, the fact that a man leads a milquetoast official to macho in the space of one movie sounds like a fantasy of male ego expansion, but his transformation is credible enough. He is not modestly invented, as in a film designed to strengthen the male ego. Instead, it accurately records the necessary growth resulting from the exceptional circumstances of the films. <br /> <br /> Also charming is the way criminals are portrayed as perfectly human, in addition to their criminal mission. Her gang has a subdued and tumultuous community that is foreign to American culture. And although they are his opponents, they are never his enemies. As a result, they teach him competition. <br /> <br /> I really admired Kidman's ability to physically appear in Russian. I wondered if her ancestors were Russians, but none of her photographs I examined showed any signs of this. Maybe it's just makeup, but it was amazing. <br /> <br /> I can only hope that they will soon knock her over so that she can make another great movie. Despite my free work on Ms. kidman, the message is that it is the best movie in every respect and probably the role of life.
