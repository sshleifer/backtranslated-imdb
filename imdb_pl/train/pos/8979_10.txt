I loved this movie, at first the clever graphics seemed strange with grainy film material, but I quickly got into it. There must have been thousands of hours of recordings, and I really admire the work done during cutting. If you are easily shocked by drugs or violence, it may not be a movie for you, but there are some great characters here (and some real tossers). Technically, I liked it too, they had to use a new de-interlacing algorithm, or maybe just a movie material, and it looked so dark, but I was not irritated by the usual artifacts visible in the video feeds. (Open water has driven me crazy, mainly because cheap, progressive cameras are available, and I do not see any excuse to not shoot one if you're going to watch in the cinema). I am sorry that this is my little trick. I definitely recommend this movie if you've ever been involved in a music scene, have tragic moments, but most of them are funny, I can be accused of laughter from other misfortunes, but it's a classic piece.
