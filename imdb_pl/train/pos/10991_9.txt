Cypher is a movie worth seeing, because it is not an ordinary science-fiction movie. The artistic approach is painted with dark scenes and a kind of macro-view of what is happening. A close-up view of the camera shows how the director retains the illusion of a story. The sci-fi aspect of the film is secondary to the plot of the film. The technology used in the film is not very impressive, but the director makes good use of props. <br /> <br /> Character development is intentionally shallow. The main character, Jeremy Northam, decides to immerse himself in the world of espionage. The audience depends on how they discover their mysterious character and this is a puzzle that attracts the audience to the very end.
