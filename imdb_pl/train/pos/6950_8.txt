On the Presidential Day of California, between midnight and 1:00 am, spy Victor Rovner sends a message from Kuala Lumpur to the USA. Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, federal agent Jack Bauer returned to the family and is in trouble at home with his teenage daughter Kimberly, who blames her mother Teri for throwing Jack out of the house. Teri and Jack decide to have a serious conversation with Kim and discover that the girl has fled home. Trying to solve his home problem, Jack is called by his colleague Nina Myers to his Counter Terrorist Unit for a meeting with his boss Richard Walsh, who reveals the threat to the life of Senator David Palmer, who is running for president, needs a finder. Later, Walsh conducts a private conversation with Jack and says that there is a conspiracy against David Palmer in the agency and he ascribes Jack to finding conspirators. When the plane explodes over the Mojave Desert, Jack has one more thing to worry about. <br /> <br /> The first episode of "24" is a promising start to a successful series, featuring Jack Bauer. I watched the program for the first time and admit that I liked what I saw: a complicated and dramatic story, with many realistic characters. Kiefer Sutherland is perfect as a family man and a reliable agent responsible for three difficult missions at the same time: find a killer to protect an important politician; find a traitor in his agency; and find his teenage daughter who is in trouble trying to save his marriage. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "12:00"
