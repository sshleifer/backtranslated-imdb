One of my best films ever, maybe because I played punk scene in the late 70s and went to many beer concerts, but the movie was a good story and played very well with beer, and Phil Daniels was not sure about his latest project Eastenders !! excellent performance of many unknown actors, who, if you have eyes wide open, will see them today in many British soaps exp exp: Carver out of the Bill, the more I watch this more of them I see, well, if you have not seen, there is still a night with film, do not forget to dig a safety pin on the nose and heavy makeup with black eyes and shave your head Mocha≈Ñski style .... Enjoy
