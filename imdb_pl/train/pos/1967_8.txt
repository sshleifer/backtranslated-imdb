I do not understand why the reviews of this movie are so bad, unless I'm just my rocker. I was sick, brilliant, twisted and mentally sophisticated. You will not go deeper into the mind of a criminal psychopath in a Hollywood movie than this one. It has layers in layers, Stone's nuanced action and story that will allow you to guess even after the end. People have to accept the fact that Sharon Stone is 48 years old, and Michael Douglas does not have it in it. I predict that this movie will be a big hit on DVD when people see it with their own eyes and stop paying attention to professional drivel released. Give him a chance, you can be glad you did it!
