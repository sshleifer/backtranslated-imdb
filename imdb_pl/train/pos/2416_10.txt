yes, it's a bit stupid movie, so if you're looking for an oscar performance, forget about it ...... but if you love John Candy's humor then you have to see it. We've lost John Candy before he made enough of his great comedy brand, and he's only better in one movie: Planes, Trains & Automobiles (with Steve Martin). A perfect performance by Eugene Levy, perhaps his best work ever, like the hot head of Sal DiPasquale. Also good actor Richard Libertini, Alley Mills and Pat Hingle. You must see this obscure and unfinished movie if you're a fan of John Candy or Eugene Levy.
