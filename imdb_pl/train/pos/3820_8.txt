This is a story about Shin-ae who moves to Milyang from Seoul with his young son Jun, to start again after the accidental death of her husband. Her husband was born here and opens a school of playing the piano, but he also has the ambition to own land with insurance money she has received from death. If that's what the movie was about, it would probably be a Hollywood movie in which she would run into some local guy and be happy with her son in a new home. But this is not Hollywood. Her son is kidnapped and murdered, allegedly because it is known that he has cash from the settlement. The process of regret, attempts to continue, attempts to clear up conscience are done splendidly, and the main actress is great. The only objection and it must be said that it is a depressing movie. You must know that this is happening. You want Shin-ae to go through her sadness and find some measure of happiness. Again, this is not Hollywood, it's Korea and Korean cinema, especially drama, they do not bring blows. Life is what happens to you. Great acting, but sometimes a difficult movie to watch because of events. If you stay, you will be rewarded. Do it.
