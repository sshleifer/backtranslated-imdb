I knew about it as a similar program like Jackass and I saw one or two episodes in Freeview and it's the same, just more extreme. Basically, three Welsh guys and one crazy British friend were connected by the love of skateboarding and total disrespect / masochistic pleasure of doing harm, health and safety. They had to puke, eat a fluffy pizza, jump in stinging nettles, cower with naked paint, joke with a smaller guy during heavy sleep / snoring, tricks in the workplace, eg army, cowboys and many other crazy feats that cause bruises, nodules, blood and vomiting, maybe not just for yourself. Starring Matthew Pritchard, who does almost everything, Lee Dainton also almost everything, Dan Joyce (British) who hardly does many physical things and has OTT laughter, and Pancho (Mike Locke) who does a lot but is more popular for being short, fat and lazy. It was something numerical in the 100 greatest fun moments. Very good!
