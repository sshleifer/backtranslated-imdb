"Come Undone" seems to evoke many opinions among the authors of this forum. It is true that this is a movie that promises to be homosexuals, which most viewers expect, and somehow moves away from this promise to an introspective view of the soul of a young man. The film has a way to stay with us even after its completion. It is a study of a character about how a young man engages in an affair with someone so different from him that he will ultimately leave Mathieu confused, wounded and depressed when things do not go according to what he hoped for a relationship would be. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen the movie, maybe you'd like to stop reading. <br /> <br /> Sebastien Lifshitz, the film's director, told his story. Mathieu's point of view. Most viewers seem to be confused by different times in the movie, but there are some hints that are not obvious, as you can see, in retrospect. The story is told in flashbacks that may add to the way some people will watch a movie. It's a story about the condemned love that Mathieu felt for Cedric and the ultimate breakdown of their lives together. <br /> <br /> First of all, Cedric, a handsome young local, chases Mathieu until he convinces him that he likes him. Mathieu also feels a train to Cedric. We realize how different the two young men are by the way, how Cedric tells the Mathieu family how he feels that the school is not for him. On the other hand, Mathieu, who wants to become an architect, finds beauty in an abandoned place where Cedric took him. We watch how Mathieu, when reading the guide, wants to draw Cedric's attention. <br /> <br /> When Mathieu goes to his mother, he tells him wisely about the importance of continuing his career. It also indicates what they will have in the future, which turns out to be true. Mathieu seems to have learned this lesson, on his own skin. He goes into uncertainty with Cedric and tries to take his own life. We watch him in the hospital talking to a psychiatrist who healed his wounded soul. <br /> <br /> The ending can be confusing to most viewers, but there is a moment in the movie when Mathieu goes to work in a bar where we see him washing his glasses and looking carefully at Pierre, a young man who visits the bar. That's why when Mathieu is looking for Pierre in his home, it seems difficult to imagine. We have seen, however, how Mathieu is naturally interested in Pierre. The last scene on the beach, when Pierre and Mathieu are seen strolling on the sand, hopes that between them will be better when they watch a young boy, apparently lost, but then realize that the father is nearby. > <br /> Jeremie Elkaim makes Mathieu one of the most complex characters of recent films. He is a young man who is difficult to understand at a simple level. Mathieu suffered a lot, firstly because of the separation of parents, then the depressive mother and loss of Cedric. Stephan Rideau, who was seen in other important French films, is as good as Cedric's tiles. <br /> <br /> While "Come Undone" shares opinions, the film deserves to be watched because of the complexity and care of Sebastian Lifshitz for the story.
