... and I love it. A lot of special effects, and for a movie that is not made in a mega budget, this movie really creates a fantastic masterpiece. I'm one of the guys who did not understand the story at all, but it was still great to watch. It's definitely there in standards that outperform Bored of the Rings and on a par with the likes of Harry Potter. What does it say about the next film, made on a fraction of the budget of these international hits. <br /> <br /> One of the things that I really love about this movie is that it's so much to cover the adventure film from Hong Kong. The subject is exotic and original. Production quality is nothing like what you see in HK for a fantasy movie, and acting is great. <br /> <br /> One of the best films that came out of Hong Kong is the Infernal Affairs of Hong Kong fantasy film and I hope they will continue to work in this field until they outdo the Hollywood adventure movies. <br /> <br /> Just fantastic.
