This film is a great lesson of Japanese history at the end of Shogunate Tokugawa shortly before Shogunate lost a big battle with a loyalist who wanted the Emperor to return to the throne and rule Japan. Really, I had to read many stories to get the whole background. <br /> <br /> Shintaro Katsu (also known as the original Zatoichi) gives a great performance as Izo Okada, one of the four Hitokiri (= Man Killer) Bakumatsu. He is a simple samurai who loses all his wealth. In order to have a good life, she becomes the guardian of Takechi Hanpei (played by Tatsuya Nakada = Ryonosuke from Sword of Doom). Hanpei is an ultra-nationalist politician who allows his Hitokiri team to kill many high-profile pro-Western politicians to achieve their political goals. Izo Okada follows his leader without thinking about what they are doing. As long as he has the money to go and drink and spend money in his whore. Okady's killings are becoming more and more brutal during the movie and he's proud of his fear-based reputation wherever he goes. <br /> <br /> This is a great portrait about the life of a simple samurai who gets involved in political matters and is really naive to realize what is happening. First, after betrayal and torture, and always talking to Sakamoto (who is a samurai who rejects violence), he changes his views and views on life. Ale za późno .... <br /> <br /> Watch the movie to see the end of Izo Okady ... <br /> <br /> Shintaro Katsu and the rest of the staff give a great performance. Each actor achieves his role. Sword fight is very special and fast ... probably faster than a few of today's movies ... <br /> <br /> See if you have a chance !!!
