This movie could have been a silent movie; certainly has the impression of one. I was extremely, very happy to see this very rare version of this movie. Extase is a "symphony of love" and goes beyond all language versions. French, which is the best romantic language, seems quite suitable for this very sensual and lyrical version. but definitely far from being pornographic. The technical features could be a bit primitive; but that does not diminish the magic spell that this movie exudes. Many lovers of early cinema would absolutely love this movie.
