The last part of the series of action thrillers is probably the most difficult hit of three films. He goes further to play the subject of anti-Bond. Bourne does not like what he does and wants to know about his blurred past. Everything in this movie goes to the heart of cinematography for choreography / stunt work to the script for acting. <br /> <br /> The movie begins to get excited when Bourne escapes from the Moscow police. It seems that the story is gaining momentum where the first movie ended. Or so? Time is a bit confused here, but we can see the fact that Bourne remembers things. A sudden flashback when she tried to purge almost caught him, but she does not kill anyone. They are not his goal. From there we get more intrigues from his past with a new player, Noah Vosen, who seems to know everything about Bourne and will protect him at all costs. Pamela Landy is back, as well as Nicky Parsons, who seems to have a past also from Bourne. <br /> <br /> Photos are on your face, following practically everything. The chase of the car is even more intense if it seems possible than the first two. And the veteran chasing Bourne is great with the nice role of Albert Finney. It also has small political undertones with regard to issuing and other government policies, but it is small and very well integrated into the story. In total, this is the best of the trilogy's proposals this year, if not the best action trilogy.
