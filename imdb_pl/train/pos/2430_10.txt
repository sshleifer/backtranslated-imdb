This is Casper the Friendly Ghost, which comes from my childhood and I watch it on YouTube (Thank GOD! For You Tube); then I love this short one and it's one of my favorite Casper pants. <br /> <br /> I love how this short beginning begins terribly with the haunting narration of Frank Gallop; until we see Casper sitting at the gravestone in the graveyard, reading. While every ghost rises from the graves to the "boo" of people, Casper decides to leave in search of a friend. But trying to create a friend, anyone who sees Casper escapes. Poor Kacper sat on a log and cried; until the little cub shuts him down. Casper and the little fox quickly merge and quickly call the puppy Ferdie and consider him his best friend. <br /> <br /> Casper and Ferdie are in great danger, but Casper does not look at Ferdi closely while playing Hide and Seek. While Ferdie hides the hunter, and two of his hunting dogs come and try to kill the little Ferdi, Ferdie runs as fast as possible until he disappears and starts to pant. While the hunter shoots shots towards Ferdie Casper, he notices that he is trying to kill him and flies towards the hunter and begs the hunter to leave Ferdi alone. And the hunter and the dogs are afraid of Kacper. Casper yells to Ferdie that the hunter and the dogs are gone and everything is fine. But Casper sees that Ferdi's body does not move and asks if it's okay. When Casper sees that Ferdie is dead, he begins to regret his pain because he lost "the only friend he ever had in his life." Casper returns to the cemetery where he buried Ferdi and made him a tomb beside Kacper's tombstone. Kacper continues to mourn for pain until he sees that Ferdie is resurrected as a ghost. Ferdie starts licking Casper on the cheek. Casper screams for joy because he has been reunited with Ferdie. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a really good shortcut; though surprisingly disturbing, showing death in a family cartoon.
