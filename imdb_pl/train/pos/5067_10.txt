Here at IMDb.com, I read the opinion that Gray Owl is the best character of Pierce Brosnan I have ever done. I do not know if he had better or worse roles, I'm not his fan, but this one was really special. <br /> <br /> The second thing - the director's impressive hand. I give my respect. Peace, beauty and the spirit of wildness are really illustrated only, I have never met such closeness in any film before. <br /> <br /> Another thing that remained in my memory after the film - it's a movie, the closest original books and the atmosphere in them. <br /> <br /> And some more. I respect the original gray owl.
