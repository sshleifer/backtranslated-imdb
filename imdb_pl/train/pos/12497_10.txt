If you have not seen Mary-Kate and Ashley yet, all I can say is, "What are you waiting for?". This is another wonderful and wonderful film of fraternal twins, who we all know and love so much! It's fun, romantic, exciting and absolutely breathtaking (in terms of landscape)! Of course; as always, Mary-Kate and Ashley are still the main scenery! Would a real fan like it in a different way? Of course not! Anyway; it's a great movie in every sense of the word, so if you have not seen it yet, you just have to! Now I mean too! So what are you waiting for? I promise you will not be disappointed! Yours sincerely, Rick Morris
