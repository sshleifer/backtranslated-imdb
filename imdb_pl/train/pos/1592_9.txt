"What I Like About You" is definitely a program that I could not wait for every day. Amanda Bynes is such a great actress that I grew up watching her show: "The Amanda Show". She is a very funny person and seems to be on the ground. "Holly" is a similar person and has a personality "outside". I liked it, as it always seemed to turn things upside down, so it sometimes fell apart. But that's what made the show so great. <br /> <br /> I especially liked the show when the character "Vince" appeared. Nick Zano is very HOT and funny, like "Gary" Wesley Jonathan. The entire cast was great, each character had its own personality and charm. Jennie Garth, Allison Munn and Leslie Grossman were very interesting. I especially loved "Lauren"; she is the best! She helped make the show fun and you never know what she will do or say! Overall, the show is really nice, but the reason I did not give it 10 was that there were no more episodes and because episodes could be longer and deeper.
