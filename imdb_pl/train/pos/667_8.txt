Although I have been a fan of Peter Weir for a long time, I have not watched any of his Australian films until I watched The Last Wave. And it was a nice, unpredictable surprise. <br /> <br /> Richard Chamberlain plays David, a lawyer invited to defend five aborigines accused of murdering another Aboriginal. For David's peers, this is an obvious case of intoxication and they think they should plead guilty and give a quick sentence. But David believes that under the murder lies the mystery associated with tribal rituals. As the investigation learns not only things about your clients, but also about yourself. <br /> <br /> Revealing more would be a corruption of one of the strangest movies I've ever seen. I can only say that this movie goes in directions that nobody will expect. <br /> <br /> There are many elements that make this film fascinating: for example Chamberlain's acting; but also the performances of David Gulpilil, who plays a young native who introduces David into tribal mysteries; and Nandjiwarra Amagula, who plays an old aborrant who is a spiritual guide. Relations between these three characters form the heart of the film. <br /> <br /> But there is also a way in which Weir suggests the supernatural character of the film. David has dreams that warn him of the future. Australia is experiencing terrible weather, storms, falling hail, and even a mysterious black rain that can be nothing more than pollution. But it is also related to the case that David defends. How it is related is one of the great revelations of the film. In addition to small events, Weir manages to create an atmosphere of fear and oppression, suggesting future horrors without showing anything. <br /> <br /> The result of Charles Wain is fantastic, especially the use of didgeridoo. Photography is also quite good. Russell Boyd, a longtime DP Weir who in 2004 won the Oscar for Master and Commander, presents a dark, terrifying world full of secrets. <br /> <br /> I also find it extraordinary that for an aboriginal film, it does not turn into an accusation against white culture or a flattering celebration of their traditions, such as Dances with Wolves or The Last Samurai. This movie is too clever to be so simple. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it can be frustrating and can upset viewers who expect a movie to end with anything that makes sense; but for those who do not mind strangeness or ambiguity, The Last Wave is a great movie to watch.
