Brothers with psychokinetic power (yes, really) a duel, not only for the feelings of Debra Winger, but really for the mystery of childhood, which left them in conflict with their powers. <br /> <br /> There are surreal accents (fire brigade, which behave like a singing Greek choir), but there is also humor and romance. The soundtrack is very similar to the one in which American Werewolf in London used every great Wolf song they could get ~ but with fire ~ and I do not think I will ever forget Dennis Quaid (mmmmm Dennis Quaid), setting up his own trailer as rockin ' to 'She is a lady' ~ priceless;) <br /> <br /> The best line is missing in the quote section btw ~ 'Once you have a clown, you never come back! '<br /> <br /> I love this movie (I ordered a DVD from USA) and if the comments written by people who would be more satisfied with Legally Blond 3, do not be discouraged ~ try :)
