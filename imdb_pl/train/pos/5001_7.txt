Aardman does it again. Alongside Pixar, Aardman Animation still proves how to make an animation. <br /> <br /> I had a great time watching the first episode of Creature Comforts. I thought it translated well for the American audience. My only concern is that most of the audience will not get subtle humor in this program. <br /> <br /> Being a fan of the BBC version and the short movie, I knew what I was in when I sat down to watch it. The animators did a great job by matching the recorded voices to the perfect animal. Look at the first episode with the Goat, which sounds stoned, and dogs on the street, which constantly call to themselves "dawg". <br /> <br /> Is it for everyone? Not by a long shot. In fact, I would be happy to see this concert throughout the season. But as I said before, the audience will not get it.
