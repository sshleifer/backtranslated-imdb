According to the book The Last of the Cowboy Heroes, which concerns Joel McCrea, Audie Murphy and Randolph Scott, the author says that Albuquerque was the only film he personally did not review because he claimed to have been lost. I have not seen for years. <br /> <br /> It's good that for western fans, someone was doing spring cleaning at Paramount, because it apparently found printing, and now it's on the open market. Albuquerque is also a pretty good western in which Scott took part in a family dispute with uncle George Cleveland. the rapidly growing settlement of Albuquerque. Cleveland is more than just a business owner, he is the head of a city that runs from a wheelchair. He even has a sheriff in his pocket. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott is not a cowboy for a reason. This includes not supporting relatives when they are villains. He goes to work in a rival outfit directed by brother and sister Russell Hayden and Catherine Craig. <br /> <br /> Cleveland is full of all kinds of tricks, and even sends the Western Mat Hari in the person of Barbara Britton to enter into the trust of his rivals. Barbara is great as a homespun vixen who develops her own program. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott's original home studio was Paramount, it was his first studio contract. Albuquerque marked the last movie he ever did for Paramount and gave him a good movie. <br /> <br /> Also notice Lon Chaney, Jr. Hayes, who is simply Gabby Hayes. <br /> <br /> Albuquerque had to be loved by Republicans across the country in 1948, when his main villain was the head of the city who rules from a wheelchair. A Democrat in a wheelchair shortened them for four straight presidential elections and disappeared. They also had high hopes of winning the White House this year, but everything went wrong and they had to settle for the fact that his boss in Albuquerque had gained his favor. I'm not sure why Cleveland was in a wheelchair because nothing in the story was done. My guess is that he was injured and played this role in this way because he had to. <br /> <br /> Albuquerque still had to have great charm on the GOP market.
