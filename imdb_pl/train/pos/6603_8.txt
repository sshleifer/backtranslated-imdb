I must mention two failures to understand that this movie worked well when he failed: "A Scanner Darkly" and "Immortel Ad Vitam". If you were excited about the concepts of these two films and you felt disappointed (like me), you'll probably like the Renaissance. It immerses you in the world of future Paris. This is not quite dystopian. They did the animation so well that I thought it was rotoscopic, but from what I can say it was not, it was just capturing the movement. The facial expression is amazing! Since TRON, I have not seen a fantasy world so well presented in hybrid animation / live. The black and white medium is used to slowly focus attention on the subject of the scene; my favorite effect was what they did to the beams of the headlights, watch out for it. The director plays with your attention and disorientation, but in the end you are happy to find a thread that wants you to find. The overall effect is a rough and rough urban world full of little surprises. <br /> <br /> The plot is secondary, but it is not terrible. This is noir-ish. There is a story for most of the main characters. It's weather. There are "sets" that make you feel like you are in different places in Paris. There is some action, and even a car chase. I will have to see it again to get everything. I also recommend a very large screen to display it because the "sets" are detailed, and the loans are small.
