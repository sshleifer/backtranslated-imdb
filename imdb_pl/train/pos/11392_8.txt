Paris is a place where you can enjoy beautiful art and music and crazyly fall in love - just like in this movie. The boy meets a girl, they fall in love, but something stands in their way to eternal happiness, a classic story. <br /> <br /> The great music of George Gerschwin completes the great dance of Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron. "American in Paris" is a fun, light, loving movie that is worth watching. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br />
