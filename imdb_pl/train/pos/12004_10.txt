This film is a real and historical movie. This is very useful for people researching the LDS church, because it is 100% real. It's an excellent movie and I recommend it. <br /> <br /> This is very factual, exciting and motivating. There are those who think that it is not factual, but it is. <br /> <br /> It's about the restoration of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and about the prophet, Joseph Smith, who restored him. He has in his life such events as the illness he had when he was a little boy, his courtship Emma Smith, Emma, ​​his wife, childbirth and so on. But most importantly, reveals the restoration of the church.
