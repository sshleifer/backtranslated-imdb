Personally, I think the movie is a pretty good watch. It presents the real situation of the triads in Hong Kong and gives the viewer an insight into how the triads are organized. <br /> <br /> Moreover, it also shows the viewer how the police from Hong Kong control the situation of the triad and why the police simply do not go out and destroy the triads. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is quite violent due to gangster methods of killing and torture. Nevertheless, the film remains true to the real world, so violence on the screen is only a reflection of what is really happening. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to any Triada / Mafia fan. Another good watch is Dragon Squad. This movie has more weapons than in this movie, because there are more knives than guns in this movie (in fact, I do not remember seeing a single gun).
