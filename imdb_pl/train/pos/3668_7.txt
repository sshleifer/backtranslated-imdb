I recently saw this movie and loved it. it gives insight into making indie movies and how much work is really involved when you have a low budget, but you need the name of an actor / actress so that people, all people can see it and give the film an exposure. Bobby Myeres played by Modine and his partner Saul - Paul Linder form the perfect combination of the eccentric Miachela Bates, the actor "NAME" played by Alan Bates was an excellent casting decision in the film and the movie. My favorite cast member was Sandy Ryan played by the wonderful and underrated Debr Kara Unger with her own special performance in the film in the movie. If you like to think while watching a comedy, this one is for you. A low budget corresponds to a lower budget due to the high laughter content.
