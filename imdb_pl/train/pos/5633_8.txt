Farrah Fawcett is outstanding in this powerful drama from 1986, in which she plays Marjorie, a woman who escapes the clutches of a would-be rapist. Well done to Farrah for the Golden Globe nomination "Best Actress." <br /> <br /> When her rapist Joe (played well by James Russo) enters her home, who shares with two roommates (who are conveniently outside!), Marjorie must play along with the frightening demands of Joe. This makes some disturbing and shocking images! <br /> <br /> When her roommates return home, they are amazed (at least) by Marjorie's actions and the great performance of Alfre Woodard, who is desperately trying to convince Marjorie to do the right thing and turn him into the police, makes the movie even more biting. <br /> <br /> I think Diana Scarwid is quite annoying, but when Joe finally admits that he came to kill them all, he makes the movie really a very emotional piece of drama. <br /> <br /> In general, Extremities is a brilliantly thought out and well-played movie and I had to watch it hundreds of times! Good job for everyone involved.
