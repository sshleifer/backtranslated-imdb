I read the book for the first time when I was a young teenager, and then saw the movie late at night. About a year ago, I checked it on IMDb and found no copies available. Then I came online and found a site that offered War Films, so joyous that I did, I ordered a copy and sat back and was able to confirm why I wanted to see it again. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, to really enjoy the movie, I suggest reading the book and then watching the movie. The book is no longer printed, but I followed its copy through E-bay, author Alan White was a commando / paratrooper during the Second World War participating in various secret operations and this was his first book. It is written by someone who knows, and this fact seems to me authentic. I did not give the film ten just because of the nature of the ending of the movie, not as good as the book. There are also several feature lines that differ from the book, which is strange because the book does not concern the large scale of the war, but the unit during the war. The film illustrates this extremely well. I have a copy of a book my son can read, and then a movie that lets him see in that order. <br /> <br /> If you can follow a book and a movie, it's definitely worth it and I would just like it to be easier to read and watch, one of my best war movies, ever!
