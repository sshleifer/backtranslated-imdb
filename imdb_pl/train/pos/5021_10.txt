I rented this movie and watched it 20 times before I took it back to the store. Bill Paxton hired talented talent to make a good thriller with interesting twists and turns. The story is original and well written. Powers Booth and Paxton ensure good results. The story is told in an interesting way, with both flashbacks from 20 years ago, and then with spots in the present, alternately back and forth. This style of story creates a good thriller that can not be boring. Bill Paxton, do more horror games, you have talent for it!
