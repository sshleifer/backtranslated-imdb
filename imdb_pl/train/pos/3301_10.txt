In addition to being one of the few films I've ever shed in a tear (bye-pa manhood), this is one of the most beautiful Indian films ever made.

Pakeezah's music is amazing, the more so if you can understand sublime poetry and this is definitely one of the films "OMG, 5 minutes another". You have the impression that imprisoned Sahibjaan is among the amazing jewelry he wears, and in the yard that passes from time to time. <br /> <br /> A parody of all dreams you've ever had ..... .....
