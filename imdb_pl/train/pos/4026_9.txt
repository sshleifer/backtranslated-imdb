Pinjar is really a masterpiece .... It's a thought provoking movie that makes you think and make you question our culture. This is without a doubt the best hindi film I have ever seen. This film should be screened at film festivals around the world and I think it would be a serious rival in Cannes. All characters were perfectly manned, and Urmila Matkondar and Manoj Bhajpai were persecuted in their roles. <br /> <br /> The story the movie tells about the partition is a very important story and should never be forgotten. <br /> There are no prejudices or prejudices and it gives the partition a human story. Here, no country is depicted as good or bad. There are bad Indians, bad Pakistani and good Indians and Pakistanis. The photos are excellent, and melodic music, meaningful and haunted. Everything in the film was amazing ... and acting was breathtaking. Everyone was perfectly staffed.
