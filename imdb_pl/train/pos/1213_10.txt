This movie defies the first when it comes to the beginnings of Care Bears and Care Bear Cousins. I will not deny it. However, if you look at "Part II" as a separate movie, it is a very good movie. I remember watching it in the early 80's (and then I adapted it to the target demographic group) and absolutely loved it much more than the first movie (not that I did not like it, it just seemed to have little of something additional to this). Sure, it's also darker than the first, but maybe that's why it's so good. And it's even darker in a deeper, subtle way (children may not quite understand, but they can still be a bit scared because of the atmosphere it gives off, and adults are certainly going to be quicker because now I watch this movie at the age of twenty) where you basically have a young girl who deals with the evil spirit / demon in exchange for something else. Get a photo? But just by watching it as a child, as I said, it could have been a bit scary, but nothing traumatic. In fact, if anything, it gave me another fantasy game that I could play when I was this age. I can not tell you how many times I pretend that Dark Heart wants to imprison me, if I can help him capture Caring Bears, I tried to force me to turn to his dark side and other similar things, etc. So this movie was also good for my imagination. And it also has a huge emotional depth. I used to watch him at least once a week. <br /> <br /> Hadley Kay was also an ideal choice for Dark Heart (I always thought and I will always be like that). <br /> <br /> It is a pity that they never created a soundtrack. Sometimes I just want to hear Growing Up without watching a movie as well as it is. <br /> <br /> "What good is love and care if it can not save her?"
