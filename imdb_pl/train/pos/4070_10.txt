I know Anime. I was in it long before it became a national phenomenon; I loved Ranma before most people knew what Dragonball Z was. And to let you know that I did not brag about mine, let me say it: of all the animes I've seen, Castle in the Sky is definitely one of the best. It's obvious that people say Spirited Away is the best, but I really do not agree with it. Most people only know this film because it is an Acedma prize; it's not an exaggeration - I showed Princess Mononoke and Castle in the Sky to people who have ever seen Spirited Away, and agree that the last two are superiors of three. Personally, I never thought anything could match Princess Mononoke until I finally saw Castle in the Sky. I still think that the previous one is better of the two, but Castle in the Sky is equally with him; in many respects Castle has the main elements that Mononoke missed. In any case, if you've only seen Spirited Away and you think that this is Miyazaki's best film, be prepared for a shaking earth.
