I love that movie. My friend Marcus and I were browsing local Hastings because we wanted to rent something that we had never seen before, and we came across this great movie. We had no idea what it was about, but it turned out to be spectacular. 2 thumbs up. I liked how the movie was filmed and the actors were very funny. If you're looking for a fun movie that makes you think I highly recommend, go quickly to your local video store and find the movie. I would tell you some of my favorite parts, but it can spoil your movie, so I will not. This movie is definitely on my list of the top 10 films. Do you really think that nothing is leaping?
