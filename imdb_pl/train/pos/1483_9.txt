Sophisticated contemporary tale about the stress that works to loosen and ultimately separate marriages. The main idea of ​​the narrative stems from the "homily" uttered by the village priest after the marriages of the young cosmopolitan couple from Milan. In it, the future course of marriage is specified, which is hard to break away from the stresses of modern life. The "moral" of this story in the story is that for a marriage to emerge, both now and in the past, it was necessary for this relationship to be based on family and friends. This film was a relative hit according to national Italian standards. It is a pity that this movie is not available on DVD or VHS.
