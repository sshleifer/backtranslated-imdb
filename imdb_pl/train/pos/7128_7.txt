This is most likely the best performance of John Thaw, in which he successfully shakes all the features of his character Morse Inspector and brings a perfect adaptation of Tom from the pages of the book on the TV screen. It is a well-made production that preserves the family atmosphere, despite some very mature topics, such as the outbreak of World War II and physical abuse of children. <br /> <br /> However, this is a relationship between Tom and the young Willie who is the heart and soul of this story. It is touching and beautiful to see this bond between a young boy evacuated from London and a grumpy old man with whom he has been in development - a real relationship between grandfather and grandson. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that this story was not done with a bigger budget with a more well-known director, because it belongs to a large screen, not shown once or twice in ten years on a Sunday afternoon. Given the right tips, John Thaw would be celebrated around the world and received many awards for his outstanding performance in this film. A great actor and a great role that should have been honored more than at that time.
