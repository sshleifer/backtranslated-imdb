This film, although it is one of the most favorite topics of Mexican producers: extreme life in our cities, has a fun way to put it on the screen. <br /> <br /> Four of the most important Mexican directors of the recent times are approaching the history of our city in various literary genres, because it may be a farce or a satire that gives us a film with an over-exposure theme in our country, but told in a completely different way that gives it freshness. <br /> <br /> Having little-known actors who interpret the excellent way they work, each of the directors in the stories reflects the abilities we have been identified anywhere in the world, the ability to laugh and pains to celebrate sadness. Perhaps for many people in our country the film was not happy, but I think that people from other countries could find attractive and share Surrealism of Mexico.
