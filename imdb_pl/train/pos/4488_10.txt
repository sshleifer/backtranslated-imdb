Here's the favorite Tom & Jerry cartoon for Halloween. I know it does not have much terror, but it has a "trick" like in "Trick or Treat", as Jerry did with Tom, with a blind and a vacuum cleaner with a shirt in a collar, the ghost; but I still want to put it on my Halloween cartoon list. In this flash, Tom listened to "Witching Hour," a ghost program that was horrified by the horror story. In the middle of the story, the drama begins to happen (the hair standing at the end, the heart jumping in the throat, the icy chills on the back). . . literally. And Jerry watched the whole thing and laughed at himself, he thought he was taller than Tom, afraid to scare him. <br /> <br /> I love the ending, it was a bit of fun. And you know, this shortcut is the first of four cartoons in which Tom attacks Mammy Two Shoes; the others are The Lonesome Mouse, A Mouse in the House and Nit-Witty Kitty. And also this short is the first of twenty-five cartoon games in which Tom speaks. The others are The Lonesome Mouse, The Zoot Cat, The Million Dollar Cat, The Bodyguard, Mouse Trouble, Mouse comes for dinner, Quiet Please !, Trap Happy, Solid Serenade, Mouse Cleaning, Texas Tom, Mucho Mouse and The Cat Above and the Mouse Below directed by Chuck Jones.
