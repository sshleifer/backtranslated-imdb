This movie should be placed on a DVD. It was so much fun and I loved it. Really, really charming and funny. Not realistic, but not supposed. The only thing I did not like was the girl's dependence on the guy too much. However, it represents a way of thinking over time. I tried to get this movie for so long and it was unavailable for the American format only in the UK and will not be played on American DVD players. This is a classic movie, unfortunately! Believe it or not, this movie can easily become a favorite cult for all ages. It is a pity that we will not legalize certain things that can really save small countries or our own. Linda is an unsinkable, positive figure that makes lemonade from lemons. She is funny and adorable. She made a sensation!
