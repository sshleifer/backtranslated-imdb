There is something in Pet Sematary that I have never felt anywhere else. Maybe the fact that I was a kid when I first saw him made this experience so unforgettable. But when I watch it, it never gets old and I never get bored. From the initial titles with this frightening song opening to a very chaotic ending, there is something crazy, sad and scary at the same time, and it still rings in your head: sometimes dead is better! <br /> <br /> I do not think it would be useful to re-link the whole story. All you need to know is that it starts with point A (the most perfect situation for a happy American family) and step by step drowns at point B (which is, believe me, the very end of all joy). Music is perfect, history makes sense, special effects are cool, and Pet Sematary is the last place in the world where I would be. As I said, sometimes dead is better!
