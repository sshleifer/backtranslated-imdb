A great concept, great cast and a pity that there was no more time to develop the story. I loved it and wanted more. Dench, Dukakis and Laine, now they are REAL women! Still, Dench and her character had enough substance to move the scenario to some of the smaller moments. I have it on tape and I will watch it, hoping that finally there will be a clue that there will be a sequel. <br /> <br /> The best drawer! - No question! - No Argument! <br /> <br />
