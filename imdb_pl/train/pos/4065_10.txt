I saw the original English version on video. The choice of Disney's voice actors looks very promising. I can not believe I'm saying that. The story is about a young boy who meets a girl with a story that is intertwined with his own. Both are drawn into one of the most fun and intriguing stories in any animated film. The quality of the animation is perfect! If you've seen Disney's work in Kiki's delivery services, you can see the quality of their production. He almost repurchases them for stealing the story of the white lion Kimba. (but not really!) Finally, Miyazaki's movies are being released correctly! I can not wait to see the rough English version of Nausicaa!
