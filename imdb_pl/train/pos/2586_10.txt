The heroes were lively and interesting, the story was great, the pyrotechnic effects were masterfully made and take to it the story of the basic love triangle and projections into a science-fiction element. I could identify with many characters, and their motivations reasoned logically within the framework of history. <br /> <br /> The camera work was great, the sound was clean and accurate, the background music perfectly matched to the effect, the singing firefighters are a nice, talented, unforgettable singularity, well-made sets and special effects performed with talented talent. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised how the whole mini carnival in the parking lot in the network The lot can be powered by one lamp socket. It seems impossible. However, the fight between the brothers at the end of the film was brilliant.
