I still remember that I first saw it on television. I could not believe TVNZ let it go! I had to own it! A lot of humor will be lost to non-NZ'ers, but give it a rest! <br /> <br /> Since the end of the Back of the Y series, Matt and Chris went to bigger and better (?) things. NZ's largest stunt stuntman Randy Campbell often appeared on the British television series Balls of Steel. Yes, he still f ^ @ does all his tricks because he is too drunk. <br /> <br /> Since then, Deja Voodoo has released 2 albums, Brown Sabbath and Back in Brown. The band consists of members of The Back of the Y and singles, such as "I can give you one of my beers (but I only have 6)" and "You were not even born in the 80's," they continue their humor. <br /> <br /> A feature film "The Devil Made Me Do It" appeared at the South-By-Southwest film festival, which will be released in early 2008 in NZ. <br /> <br /> Everything, if you do not think these guys are funny, you can just F% ^ K OFF !!
