As Peckinpah from STRAW DOGS and Kubrick from A CLOCKWORK ORANGE did, director John Boorman presents an effective film about the brutal side of Man in DELIVERANCE, probably the final horrors of the 70s. Burt Reynolds, Jon Voight, Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox portray four Atlanta businessmen who decide to go canoeing on the wild Cahulawassee river in northern Georgia before falling into something that Reynolds calls "one big, dead lake". /> <br /> But the local highlanders take a painfully obvious, foggy view of these "urban boys" who are roaming the woods. The next day Beatty and Voight get caught up and sexually assaulted (the infamous "SQUEAL!" Sequence) Two brutal highlanders (Bill McKinney, Herbert "Cowboy" Coward). So what started out as nothing more than a lark among the Appalachians has now changed into a nightmare in which our four heroes come to see a thin line between what we consider a civilization and what we consider to be barbaric. /> <br /> James Dickey adapted the script for his best-selling book, and the result is often a thrilling and disturbing shock. Often known from "SQUEAL!" And the "Dueling Banjos" sequence, DELIVERANCE is also a rather painful attempt, with four leading men in their roles, and McKinney and Coward make up for two of the most terrifying villains of all time. A compulsory film for those who want to take a chance.
