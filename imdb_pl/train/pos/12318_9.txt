Although I'm not the biggest fan of martial arts fighting movies, when the film goes straight to fantasy, not to fight, I get much more fun, and this movie is one of the best in terms of fantastic plot and crazy flying combining. Ching Siu Tung created a charming feast with a great performance and beautiful ethereal beauty. Gorgeous, tragic Leslie Cheung plays the hero of tax collectors, who remains in the haunted temple and engages in the stunning spirit of fox and crazy Taoist. The Cheungs's performance is full of naive but dignified charm, and Wu Ma is pleasantly away from the wall as a Taoist monk who shows some fencing and even gets a musical number. Perhaps the best thing is Joey Wang as a fox ghost, a true delight for every seductive and seductive gesture and gesture. The film contains elements of fantasy, horror, comedy and romance, and all this together creates a constantly entertaining package. Ching Siu Tung, directing and using choreography gives some small emotions related to the wire and fills the film with mists, shadows and incredibly charming dark colors of the forests, giving each forest scene a wonderfully charming atmosphere. Noteworthy are also sophisticated hairstyles and beautiful robes of female characters, of which, if I'm not mistaken, Joey Wang grows hair like foxes, a wonderful touch. Although the film has relatively few actions, and some may badly advise poor pop songs, it is a beautiful entertainment, with swelling characters and drawing, even the strange neat character of the bow, almost a constant supply of visual delicacies and a generous dreamy atmosphere. An unusual treasure, highly recommended.
