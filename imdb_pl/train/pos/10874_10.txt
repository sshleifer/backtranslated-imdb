<br /> <br /> I have to admit that I was expecting something completely different from my first "Cut" last night, although I was delighted with the unexpected jewel of Australian horror. I am a true horror fan as real as they appeared, and it was recognized that "Cut" is not only the best genre that Australia has ever produced, but one of the best parody / comedy movies of recent years. <br /> <br /> My only concern is that the mainstream audience may not notice many comedy elements - the movie was not very smart in its application, but it made me laugh at every step, trying to fit in EVERY possible phrase of the horror genre . I'm sure it was intended as a humor ... hoping it was intended as a humor. <br /> <br /> And of course he was gore. <br /> <br /> The use of "customized" garden shears was shiny - in addition to the expected cuts and cuts. In short, there was a lot of diversity and creativity in many violent deaths, enough to satisfy even the skeptics of the film. <br /> <br /> The appearance of both Kylie Minogue (in short, was her appearance) and Molly Ringwald was another reason to watch the movie - both performances were fantastic, as did Simon Bossell ("The Castle") in the brilliant role of a playful technician . <br /> <br /> In total, I think that this movie is one of the best horror products of the last few years, and also a beautiful satire / parody - toungue-in-cheek to the very end. <br /> <br /> I loved it. Go see him!
