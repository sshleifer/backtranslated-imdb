Okay, let's face it. this is a terrible movie. The plot (as it is) is horrible, it works worse. But the movie was made for one reason and only for one reason, like all those horrible Mario Lisa movies ... just to hear the voice of the star, in this case Pavarotti in his prime. Okay, maybe the movies in Lanzie were also an excuse for him to hit women, but this movie is about listening to Luciano. Only it is worth watching the movie. A big opera star stuck on himself stands in front of his fears, finds humility and love along the way, and repels many hit numbers. <br /> <br /> I must admit that I am prejudiced on many levels. I'm Italian. I am a big fan of Pavarotti (is there anything about Pavarotti who is not big, including his fans?). And when I saw this movie for the first time, I went out alone, seeing the growth and depth of life and love for the first time. As horrible as this movie, a beautiful voice and memories are enough to breathe life and love again. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is trivial and terrible. But the voice is immortal and timeless, and the voice is what it's all about. We give this film a high rating in the hope that someone who has never heard of Pavarotti before will listen and watch and enjoy the new level of music and love, especially since he is gone. Like Italian food you've never tried before, try it! You can be pleasantly surprised, like Luciano's lover or Pavarotti's future preview.
