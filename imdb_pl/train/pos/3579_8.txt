The Stone Boy is an almost forgotten drama from the 80's. Considering how many known or soon-to-be famous people are in the movie, you may wonder how it could have been overlooked. It is a slow, moody but touching description of the tragedy that affects the farmers' family. The film is to a lesser or greater extent an accusation of Stoic values ​​of the Midwest and suppressing emotions. The film will not be for all tastes, but everyone who can appreciate the real human drama should like OK. <br /> <br /> In the early moments of the movie, we see two brothers who set off early in the morning to pick some peas and maybe shoot a duck or two if they're lucky. While climbing through a fence of barbed wire, the gun accidentally discharges, and the younger boy mortally shoots at his older brother. These boys apparently never took part in a hunters safety course. The way two men can go through such a fence properly with a single gun is as follows: The first man enters. The other man hands him a gun over the fence. The first man puts down the weapon and helps the other through the fence. At no time should either of them have a hand or a weapon. <br /> <br /> In any case, when his brother is killed, 12-year-old Arnold returns to his world. He does not even run after help after shooting his brother. He simply goes ahead and chooses peas and later tells the family about the accident. At no time during the funeral or investigation Arnold does not seem to regret or regret at all. His family seems to avoid him. Perhaps they are even angry at him for killing his brother. The usual uncle played by Frederick Forrest is upset by Arnold, even though the death of his older brother allows him to hit the girl's kid. Arnold's parents do not seem to understand how to deal with their son. They really do not even try to talk to him. The only person he can communicate with is his grandfather, who plays Wilford Brimley in the typical skills of his grandfather. After some time, Arnold even moves into the old timer. <br /> <br /> Nothing seems to make Arnold open until he embarks on a strange journey to Reno Nevada to inexplicably look at his uncle's ex-wife. When he meets her, he begins to leave his shell after apologizing for breaking the marriage, starting all the anxiety of the family from the accident. From then on, the film becomes a quick study of reconciliation and awakening. <br /> <br /> Acting is terrible in most cases. Robert Duvall and Glenn Close create perfect Stoic parents. Forrest is good, but maybe he's trying too hard to direct Paul Newman's performance at Hud. The photos are also unique. If you like romantic photos about ordinary people, this one can be for you. Some people may even be recommended to bring some tissues. 8 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The Hound.
