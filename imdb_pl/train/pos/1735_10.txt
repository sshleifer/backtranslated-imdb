The debut of Miss DeCarlo has everything that writers could come up with - from the Franco-Prussian War to the American Civil War, the great American West, San Francisco in glory times, ballet, opera, vaudeville, bandit and Chinese junk. Just when you thought the plot could not happen, he does it. It's great, with a pinch of salt. The figure of DeCarlo (here she is called Anna Marie - NOT Salome, this is the role she dances) is loosely based on the career of the notorious Lola Montez, who was the mistress of the king of Prussia and caused a revolution when he gave her crown jewels. She escaped to the American West. In Arizona there is the town of "Salome, where she danced," based on the historical fact that Lola Montez danced the role of Salome there. StageCoach Cleve and the Russian nobleman who are under her spells are not historically valid, nor do I consider myself a Chinese sage with a Scottish accent - but this is one of my favorite classics in the time camp, and DeCarlo is stunningly beautiful.
