This is a great game! Okay, maybe he does not have some of the features he was supposed to have, but Digital Anvil still has a good game. There is some resemblance to the Elite (you can trade, collect weapons and cargo from destroyed ships, go on missions), but this game has a strong mission scripts. It's a great mission. The control system is different, it uses a mouse! Essentially, you're flying a spaceship around the system and going up! The game offers quite good graphics, even in 2003. It should work well even on a modest computer. The story includes great voice acting by John Rhys Davies, George Takei, Jennifer Hale (appears in every computer game). Stick to this story, which is getting better and better. There is even a racing section in which you and your opponent must race their spaceships around the course (this requires going through the rings). This section took some time. Adds game variations. Some sections are a bit difficult here, but generally you can beat this game. The game has an active mod scene on the web. Pick up a few mods to prolong the game. I have not played any mod yet. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the next part of this event has been canceled, it's a pity!
