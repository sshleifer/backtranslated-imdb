"I'll Take You There" tells the story of a wretched man who loses his wife in second place and finds an unlikely ally in a blind date. Unlike most romantic comedies, this little indie is mainly a comic situational comedy with Rogers and Sheeda, with little emphasis on romance. The type of travel with lots of fun and moving moments is still moving, it stays fresh and is worth seeing for the indie lovers.
