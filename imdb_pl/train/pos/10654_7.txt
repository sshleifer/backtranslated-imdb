The Haunting is a movie that boasts a truly terrifying home, good effects work and sound work, a cast that seems to believe that everything around is real and this house. There are scenes that make you jump, and the sinister aspects of what has happened in Hill House in the past, I found interesting. In the film are really terrifying moments and I liked the way ghosts manifested in sheets, curtains and the house itself. The score of Jerry Goldsmith gave him the right atmosphere, and the sound design had voices around you. I would like something more intense to happen. Jan De Bont had PG-13 rating, which he had to face and I think he refrained too much. Poltergeist scared me stupidly when I saw him many years ago and still keeps on. The Haunting could have used several successive scenes of pure terror. The ending was a bit anti-climatic for me. Overall, I liked it. Acting is good and there are moments that make you jump. I just wish it would make me more scared.
