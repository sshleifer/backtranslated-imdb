Initially, the film was a typical Western film, but it turned out to be very interesting and delighted me until the very end, which turned out to be very unusual. Charlton Heston, (Sam Burgade), "Midway", "76", had previous experiences with James Coburn, (Zach Provo), "Deadfall", 93, and Zach never forgave Sam and did not stop at anything to make sure that he would catch up with him and pay him back. Unfortunately, Barbara Hershey, (Susan Burgade), "Portrait of a lady", 96, managed to catch herself in this situation and found herself among men who craved sex, who never seemed to leave her alone. Burgade himself had to make very difficult decisions and was very surprised by the application. It's a very funny movie, and acting was great.
