A long film about a very important character from South Africa, Stephenie Biko. He is one of those black people who did not survive apartheid, who actually died long before the normal time. The old movie does not show how important Biko was, what he really represented. His life and his teaching are reduced to a small, at best a few witty remarks. The 1987 film was aimed at pushing South Africa over the edge that would lead to its liberation. The film aims to show how irrational South African supporters of apartheid are in 1987. In order to show it, the film must go beyond the death of Biko, and thus focus its discourse not on Biko, but on a white liberal journalist and his absurd escape from the system in which he lives. His escape is necessary because of victimization, which he is a victim of, together with his family, and also because he wants to publish the first book about Biko, after his death, and this can only happen in England. The film shows how to escape from South Africa, while apartheid still stands and kills. So do not expect that this method will be realistic and real. It could not be. But the film has aged very much, because it does not show South Africa with any historical distance, the same event that took place during the presidency of Nelson Mandela, and which is called forgiveness, provided that those who want to be forgiven speak. The film is strong and emotional, but this very historic limit makes it rather weak today, especially since the film does not mention the third racial community, the Indians. All panegirical books or films have the disadvantage: they look at the person they are supposed to portray, only from one point of view. This explains why the film has aged so much, it seems to have come so long ago, as if nothing has changed at all. A remake is necessary. <br /> <br /> Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris University 1 Sorbonne Pantheon, Versailles University Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID
