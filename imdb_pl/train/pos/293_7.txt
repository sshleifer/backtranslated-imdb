What could be more shocking than the idea that private detectives engage in women who are supposed to be spying? And most of the written dialogue is completely banal. <br /> <br /> But the actors turn a dialogue into something that makes sense. You can see real people behind unreal lines. And directing is great. Each scene does exactly what it needs and ends without dragging too long. <br /> <br /> I showed this to several friends in the mid-1980s, because I was embarrassed about how such bad material can be transformed into such a good movie. Friends liked it too.
