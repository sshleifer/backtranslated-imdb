I missed the show season and started watching it on the ABC website in the summer of 2007. I think the whole cast is great. This is one of my favorite programs in history. I just checked the ABC program for this fall and did not see it in the schedule. It's really sad. I hope they bring him back ... maybe they're waiting for Bridget Moynahan to have a baby? Are these just my godly wishes? <br /> <br /> I have read some of the comments posted about the series and I will see so many great comments, similar to mine. I certainly hope that ABC will reconsider its decision or hope that the next station will pick it up.
