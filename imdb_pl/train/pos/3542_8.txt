If I was familiar with the stage production of Guys and Dolls before watching the movie, maybe I would not be so liked. Although with all honesty, I would probably like this film production because of my general adoration, both Brando (for his acting) and Sinatra (for his voice, although he is also an actor, see The Manchurian Candidate or From Here to Eternity.) <br /> <br /> As for some of the other reviewers' comments on the songs, I have a Broadway soundtrack, and although Isabel Bingley's voice outshines what Jean Simmons is, it's no nicer. I think it has a rather terrible quality. The voice of Jean Simmons is much more realistic, although it is not always a serious problem in musicals. Also, the only time I particularly noticed the particularly poor vocal record of Marlon Brando was in his performance "Luck Be A Lady" and only there, because earlier I knew the version of Sinatra. I also believe that Vivian Blaine's voice is much more enjoyable in the film than on Broadway. Sinatra's voice alone would be able to buy back the shortcomings of everyone else if they really needed redemption. (They were not) It is infinitely better than Sam Levene, especially in my favorite song "Sue Me". <br /> <br /> Also a complaint that many films have been omitted in the movie for worse songs, I would like to differ. "A Bushel and a Peck" is not a jewel, and the song that replaced it, "Pet Me Poppa" and the accompanying performance are more Hot Box materials. Personally, I do not care about "Marry the Man Today" and I'm glad that it was not included in the film. I love "I've never been in love" and although it was not sung in the movie, the instrumental version can be heard when Nathan is in Adelaide's dressing room. In Love 'expresses the same feeling as well and probably to the extent that both stars could reach more. And the movie would not be the same without the song "Adelaide", which was not included on Broadway. the soundtrack for the film was available for sale, I recommend it instead of Broadway. <br /> <br /> Although I have not seen the original production, I can not imagine that the game will be better than the one from the movie actors. <br /> <br /> An important fact is that the story is as charming as ever, and the actress and son gs does not do it less.
