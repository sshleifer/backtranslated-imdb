I bought a DVD set based on a recommendation from Amazon.com based on my other interests. This time they hit the nail on the head. I remember watching the show when he was on TV, but I always wondered what happened to him. Ten years later, it's like watching everything for the first time. Lucas Black as Caleb Temple and Gary Cole as Sheriff Lucas Buck are great together, although they are slightly rivals. Almost represents good (Caleb) and evil (Sherriff Lucas Buck). I never really understood exactly what Lucas should look like, but all you have to do is say that he has some special powers that I do not believe are given by all that is Holy. It can make phones call, letters appear and even change the emotions of a person. Nevertheless, there are several episodes in which, despite everything, he becomes a good guy. To sum up, this is an excellent series that, like many others I can think of (eg Point Pleasant, Threshold, Nowhere Man and SeaQuest DSV, to name a few), was canceled ahead of time. The Dead Zone of Steven King (Sunday's USA Network) seems to be the only thing in this genre that seems to create. There is simply nothing left to watch on TV. This is because everything about Christianity and Satan is considered offensive and must be immediately withdrawn from television. In the meantime, I will simply buy DVD sets and watch programs that should still be on TV, but have been ejected from the television by religious fanatics so that we can watch "quality" programs such as Family Guy and American Dad and The Simpsons (every few nonsense , which are).
