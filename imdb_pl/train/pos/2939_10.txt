Eddie Murphy is one of the funniest comedians in history - probably MOST funniest. Delirious is the best stand-up comedy I have ever seen and is a must for anyone who loves good laughter !! I have watched this movie hundreds of times and every time I see it - I still have side entertainment. This is definitely one of your video libraries. I guarantee you will have to watch it several times to hear all the jokes, because you will laugh so much - that you will miss half of them! Delirious is funny! <br /> <br /> Although there are many funny comedians - after watching this comedy, most of them will look like second-class citizens. If you've never seen it - take it, look - and you'll love it! It will make you start to spin !!! :-)
