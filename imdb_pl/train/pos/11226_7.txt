The hidden boundary of Star Trek will surprise you in many ways. First of all, it is a series created by fans, available only on the Internet, and contains mainly friends and neighbors who have computer programs and home video cameras and sewing machines, like Mickey & Judy put it, put it out. It's definitely friends and neighbors. Many of these people are not the most beautiful-looking humans you've ever seen, neither the youngest nor the thinnest? some of them stumble over their lines, as if they were walking on balls? some of them have thick accents or just do not seem to speak well, which makes it virtually impossible to understand a single word that they say. Even so, you must admit that everything that your friends and neighbors have gathered is really fun. Yes, part of the dialogue is hokey. Yes, it's a bit strange (though a bit cool) to watch the kiss of two Starfleet males (although some kissing scenes seem to last and last). Yes, you are a little crooked when you clearly quote ST: TOS, TNG, other shows and movies, or when you hear the Galaxy Quest theme played at the beginning and end of each program. Fine. We can go through it. Why? The graphics are first. Better than almost anything you've seen. Sometimes a show or two really stand out from history? some of them are in fact real tears of tears. <br /> <br /> The Hidden Frontier is a total pleasure in every sense of the word? but you must give people credit where credit is due. Production of this size requires a lot of effort. People, sets, costumes, graphics? it is a huge effort on many parts of people. We're watching, we're coming back and thanking them.
