* First of all, although many say that this is the worst of the series, I do not think that's true, given that it perfectly reflects the 21st century mentality of teenagers. times when you would like to have the same fun as characters. <br /> <br /> * I agree with the fact that it is a movie for teenagers, but comedy movies should not be intended for teens? ... cinemas are the most common meeting place for teenagers; plus, watching such a movie during a sleepover or something like that is very good for a very good time. <br /> <br /> * Many comment on the amount of nudity in this movie. Well ... let's be real ... does not that reflect the thoughts of teenagers like you from the movie? What would you like to see ... smart books, romantic things? this is not at all what would be in the minds of these teenagers ... <br /> <br /> * In conclusion, I think that if you are a teenager, you must necessarily see a movie, and even if you're a real adult man or woman, you should see if you still have a teenager's mind or you often think about what it was like to be a teenager or something like that. Thank you for reading!
