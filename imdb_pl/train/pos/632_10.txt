OK, here's how to do it. I rate films on 10 components. Each component from nature begins with 5 points. Maybe then you lose or get 5 points for a possible 10 or 0. <br /> <br /> Mood: Action, Romance, Comedy, Drama, Suspension - I give this component 10 points. He had the perfect balance of all five aspects. The action was fun and exciting. The romance was not exaggerated, but still very emotional and moving. Throughout the movie, I laughed hard and long, and yet I was fascinated by the fantastic drama and thrilling tension. <br /> <br /> Plot - I give this component 10 points. I thought all good tales were already said. I found myself sitting in the theater, I returned to my childhood and at that moment I again believed in unicorns, wicked witches and shooting stars that make dreams come true. <br /> <br /> Cinema Photography - I give this ingredient 8 points. While the film captured this story very well in most angles, I found myself more than once trying to find out what happened just outside the camera. <br /> <br /> FX - I give this component 10 points. I love that they used C.G.I. sparingly. The epic scenes were reliable. The magical powers were frighteningly realistic. In total, less is more, and this has EVERYTHING! Cast - I give this component 10 points. Without names and experienced actors, the cast was amazing! Michelle Pfeiffer was wonderfully angry, Charlie Cox made Tristan come alive, Claire Danes gave emotions to the stars, and I will never look again and Robert De Niro will be the same again. <br /> <br /> Acting - I give this component a 10 crossover. Even novice actors did a great job. Once again, I will NEVER look the same as Robert De Niro. <br /> <br /> Character development - I give this component 9 points. It was a bit of a hurry and I think if the film was a bit longer, they could do a bit better justice to the heroes. <br /> <br /> Dialogue - I give this component 10 points. The dialogue was wise, witty, funny? even the mush had a good dialogue. <br /> <br /> Result - I give this ingredient 7 points. I can honestly remember only one small song from the entire movie. I am not complaining except that music can be more memorable. <br /> <br /> Finish - I give this element 9 points. Almost perfect ending! I feel that some aspects of the ending should be more pronounced, while others could be more subdued, but no threads remained unrelated. <br /> <br /> Total: 93% Buy a DVD? HEL YES! Do you see it in the theater? Certainly! Bottom Line: An excellent movie for everyone! EPIC! I definitely recommend seeing him in the theater, I know I'll be back for a few seconds!
