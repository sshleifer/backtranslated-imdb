Accountant Shohei Sugiyama (Kôji Yakusho) feels bored with his routine life, limits himself to hard work and stays at home with his wife Masako Sugiyama (Hideko Hara) and the daughter of his teenager. One night, traveling by train, she sees the beautiful face of Mai Kishikawa (Tamiyo Kusakari) on the balcony of a dance school, and a few days later decides to visit the school and secretly take ballroom dancing every Wednesday night. However, he is ashamed to tell his family his secret. In the meantime, Masako is feeling changes in the behavior of a happier husband and hires a private eye to investigate whether Shohei is having an affair. <br /> <br /> I just finished watching "Shall We Dansu?" and I loved it. What a beautiful and amazing movie! The story is incredibly good, with drama, comedy and romance. The cast is excellent and I was especially impressed by the cold beauty and gratitude of the wife of director Masayuki Suo and professional dancer Tamiyo Kusakari. On September 6, I saw the American remake of "Shall We Dansu"? for the first time and considered it a great entertainment. But now I can say that this is another unnecessary remake, and instead I recommend this original movie. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Dança Comigo?" ("Dance with me?")
