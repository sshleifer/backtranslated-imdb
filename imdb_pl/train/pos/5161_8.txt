Kirk and the crew land on a lonely planet where the sun is about to explode. They are planning to evacuate the inhabitants, but to find a deserted place, with the exception of Mr. Atoza, who runs a high-tech library. Despite attempts to get a simple answer from him about the whereabouts of all people, Atoz is indifferent to their questions and urges them to quickly "make choices when there is still time." They have no idea what he's talking about, but they're wandering around when they see disks similar to handheld mirrors and see images of the planet's past. Then, when the disk is in the viewer, Kirk runs through the door and is magically transferred in time to what on Earth would look like the time of Louis XIV (1660). When McCoy and Spock follow him, there is another disk in the browser that is sent to hell from the Ice Age. Too late they realize that the library is a time-travel and repository machine. <br /> <br /> Although Kirk's visit is quite short and not so exciting, Spock and McCoy are much more frightening because Spock falls on his head for Mariette Hartley - who was sent to this terrible place as a punishment. Scenes with Spock are extremely interesting and very unusual for a normally logical guy. <br /> <br /> Spock's departure from the norm, a wildly ingenious script and very diverse locations make this unique episode - one worth seeing. <br /> <br /> FYI - Ian Wolfe, an excellent character actor, played Mr. Atoz. I am a big fan of older movies and I saw him as a helper and player in countless movies in the 1930s and 1940s and he looked almost exactly like in this episode from 1969. Interestingly, despite the fact that he looked ancient, he lived another 23 years - he dies at the age of over 95 years !!
