"Sandra, the Making of a Woman" is a distinction among exploitation films, for two reasons: (1) excellent but effortless performance by Monika Gayle and (2) the fact that Gary Graver was at the forefront of the project. These two talents, both of which are quite underestimated, make "Sandra" a film that should be watched. <br /> <br /> Another key element of the film's success is its realism - there is nothing false or "Hollywood" about this film in California. It's really a piece of life. The modest house where Sandra lives at the beginning of the movie, the simple dresses worn by the heroine, the scene where Sandra wakes up in the morning to find Uschi Digart bouncing around her door, and Sandra sitting on the couch without going up while Digart tries to sell her some cosmetics, really looking like she just woke up (but still beautiful), harmless freak Sandra, who likes to love her while he wears a bra, one-room apartment in which Sandra moves - all these elements of the film seem completely real, so from the very beginning, the viewer is drawn into the small world of Sandra and is immediately interested in her and wants her to be successful. Sandra also advocates free love with eloquence and dignity, and she goes out with a great class. <br /> <br /> This movie could easily have failed in less competent hands and could go away in any of the usual sexual clues, but the Garver / Gale team makes sure that Sandra would not only be the creation of a woman, but also the creation of perfect movie.
