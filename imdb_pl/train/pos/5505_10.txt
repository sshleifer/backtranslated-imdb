This is something new. <br /> <br /> There is a coup and some Irish documentary filmmakers inside of it. <br /> <br /> A democratically elected president who uses his power to bring reading and writing to his people and encourages them to read the constitution is vilified by private media openly as a dictator, mentally unstable, new hitler, etc. without repercussions on the part of governments (like, say, silencing them with the help of crutches and other traditional dictatorial methods). Oh, and they still claim to be suppressed, of course. <br /> <br /> See how the media are murmuring about their role in the coup on television after overthrowing the government with the help of pink generals (how much stupid can you get ??). <br /> <br /> And see how people in Venezuela marched to the palace, holding the constitution in their hands and re-installing the chosen government. <br /> <br /> It sounds like a Hollywood story, but it has really happened, contrary to the express wishes of the USA. The documentary is a historical masterpiece, shot from the action center, sharp and totally embarrassing to the main advocates of the coup: Good, democratic, freedom-loving, friendly US (which continues to transfer large amounts of money to Chavez's political opponents)). <br /> <br /> Also very fun and exciting. 10 points.
