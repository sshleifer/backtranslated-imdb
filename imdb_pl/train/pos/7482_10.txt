"Vanilla Sky" was a wonderfully thought out movie. Or rather, "Abre Los Ojos" was well thought out. I watched the movie late at night, excited about what was coming. I was not disappointed. At the end of the movie I was surprised. I could not reject it. All this idea blew me away. The ending was more surprising than Shyamalan could have ever done. The plot was also something that interested me. Cast, excellent. It was a great movie. This type of film can be viewed many times and always find something new. I've seen it four or five times and I always find something new. This is a movie that interests you forever.
