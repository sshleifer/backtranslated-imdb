I really liked this mysterious thriller from 1945. About a young woman, Nina Foch (Julia Ross), who has no job and has been covered by rent and is desperate to find a job. Julia reads an ad in a local London newspaper looking for a secretary and runs out to try to get this position. Julia gets a position and is hired by Mrs. Hughes (Dame May Witty), who requires her to live with her employer in her home and wants her to have no relationship with men, and Julia tells them she has no family and is free to sacrifice all his time for this job. George Macready (Ralph Hughes) is the son of Mrs. Hughes and has very strange desires to play with knives. It was a low-budget movie, and most of the scenes were similar to avoid background costs and scenery costs. This strange family lives in a huge mansion off the coast of England in Cornwall, and there are secret doors and lots of uncertainty.
