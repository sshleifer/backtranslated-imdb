I remember seeing this movie a long time ago, even when it did not have any special effects, the acting was really good. And it still has the same message for today, although technology has changed, maybe they should do a remake of this movie, it would be interesting to see a remake. I also liked the music from this movie, Larry Norman was a really good songwriter during this period, although most Christian music nowadays is adoring and praising music. I've always been curious about what happened to Patty after the series ended? Did she make more films, or did she finally get married and raise her family? I would like to have an update.
