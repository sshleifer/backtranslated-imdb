A pleasant animation of Batman. Not on par with "Return of the Joker" or "Mask of the Phantasm", but still solid. I liked how the movie guessed who Batwoman was. It was nice. Nice action sequences. I've always thought that Batman's fairy tales are better than any of the pitiful sequels of the Batman action movie. The trend is maintained here. <br /> <br /> 7.5 out of 10
