German private television is not known for Dutch copying and ?? naturally ?? American formats. Well, in the case of Edel and Starck, xeroxing went as far as the basics: Screwball. <br /> <br /> You can not stand screwdrivers? Do not watch Edel & Starck. Seriously. If you're expecting another lawyer's drama like Law & Order, or something like that, go somewhere else. (Or, look at Law & Order as being great at what he does, but digressing.) E & S is funny, it's often motifs to think about, it's funny, romantic, funny, funny and witty. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I'm terrified that the writers did not get better offers after the series finale. And my cynical nature has to be adapted again: private German television productions. German residents will understand what I am talking about. <br /> <br /> In short: watch out. I have no idea what the English synchronization looks like, but hey, it's worth learning German just to watch four seasons. Attached pseudo-happy end.
