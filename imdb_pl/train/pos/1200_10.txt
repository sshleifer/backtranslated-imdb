Do not have illusions, this is a history of morality. Granger is a restless former buffalo hunter once again tempted by crazy Taylor on the plains. Granger sees that the end is close and feels deeply at the expense of hunting flocks, Indians and the earth itself. Taylor, on the other hand, admits that killing buffalo or Indian is "being with a woman." While the role of Granger's tortured hunter is great, Taylor steals the show as a demented, immoral "everyman" for fast zloty and good times. There is not much bang-bang here, but the story is moving fast and we're treated by Nolan as a great character. The subject of this story is as poignant today as in the relationship between people of the nineteenth century and the earth and what is on it, and racism. Considering when it was done, the Censors had to get their hankies out during scenes in the "lewd house", Taylor's relationship with squaw and a lot of dialogue. Even though it's a downbeat, it's a really great western image.
