If you delete the first twenty minutes of this movie, you'll have a fantastic comedy. In fact, I still think that it is quite a good movie, which is not a small feat considering the coma in which I found myself in the first scenes. To put it mildly, this film has a gloomy start that was not even funny or even optimistic. However, when the situation becomes more and more hungry, you are left with a comedy that is still well after more than three decades. It's definitely worth checking out, especially if you're a younger Lemmon and Matthau fan who wants to see their previous work.
