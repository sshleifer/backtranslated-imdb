Steve Carrel proves that he is a great leading man in this wonderful, original, bawdy breath of fresh air. I'm talking about how ingenious it was. <br /> <br /> Essentially, the title of the movie says it all: Andy Stitzer is a 40-year-old man who works in an electronics store. He is a bit of a nerd who loves video games and comics, and has the largest collection. His peers who work with him in the store find out that he is Virgin while playing poker filled with sexual dialogue, and then Andy has to go rather ridiculous as hell Odyssey about naughty sexual arousals, but always screwed up which leads without losing his virginity, but in he is finally lucky at the very end. <br /> <br /> Leave the youngest at home, but take the whole family to see this amazing romantic comedy for adults. From the very beginning you will start wobbling and falling apart, and before that ends, you will want to wear very thick absorbent underwear. The only thing I can say about it is a pity that Steve Carrel was not recognized as leaving 20 years ago. The best breakthrough performance in the next MTV Awards will definitely win. You can bet on this hard-earned dollar, people! <br /> <br /> I give this perfect 10!
