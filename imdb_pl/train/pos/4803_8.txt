It is difficult to find an outright historic drama, based on the lives of any number of British monarchs. Just take a respected British or Australian actor, make it look nice, and you're guaranteed the Oscar's success. <br /> <br /> Young Victoria is no exception, he gets everything that is right, striking cinematography and beautiful, with soft lights and lush colors and fabrics. In the lead role, Emily Blunt, in the role that she can finally rise, the film starts with Victoria's 18th birthday and stirs up the intrigue and problems that surrounded her eventual coming to the throne and her famous marriage to Prince Albert (Rupert Friend). As young Victoria herself laments, she is moved like a chess pawn by various parties, because she finds support and voice as one of the most influential rulers of Great Britain. <br /> <br /> While moving around the board is quite typical territory, the development of Victoria's relationship with Albert makes the movie a bit more interesting. I admit: I have a degree in history with specialization in the Victorian era, so I am a bit attached to these numbers. Despite the many disadvantages of the rulers, Victoria and Albert were among the first leaders devoted to improving civilization for their people. They left legacy in art, public health and education as well as Victoria's conservative views and the culture of mourning after Albert's death. But these things are only briefly mentioned during the movie. <br /> <br /> It is quite well established that Victoria and Albert were not only madly in love, but kept respect for each other, usually not seen between the monarchs in arranged marriages. Even if it took place behind the scenes, it certainly belonged to the most famous. Blunt and and Friend have the right kind of chemistry to make a famous pair of justice, the right mix of restraint and desperation. It's a different love, usually not shown on the screen, especially in this kind of movie. It is encouraging to finally see the relationship in which man and woman are on an equal basis. <br /> <br /> But we do not see this love enough. While film makers try to match romance to political traps, it does not quite build the dynamics that is needed to maintain high tension. In addition, without going deeper into the more advanced public work of couples, things are somewhat suspended, superficial, not intimate, and sometimes confusing. This is not such a big problem during the movie, but later the effects quickly run out and you try to remember what you just watched, despite the excellent performances leading, most notably Blunta, who even captured the expression of the famous monarch. <br /> <br /> As far as trying, Victoria is successful on many levels, but lacks a certain splendor that would change her from solid to classic.
