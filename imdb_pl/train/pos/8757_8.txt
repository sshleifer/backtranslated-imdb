I like movies that do not provide a typical "happy ending", and that's my main reason I like this movie. Alice Marano (Danes) and her best friend Darlene (Beckinsale) are arrested in Thailand for drug smuggling after an anonymous call to the Thai authorities. The film does a solid job of guessing whether (or which) the girls were involved, and Bill Pullman is perfect as their poor lawyer. Jacqueline Kim turns out to be a great performance as his more kind, generous wife, Yon, who is also a lawyer. I would like the girls to be more used in prison, as suggested by another commentator, because I have heard that Thai prisons can be quite brutal. But where this film grabs me, it's its ending. Alice surrenders to 96 years for Darlene to be pardoned, and we (viewers) realize that both are innocent. Any film that contradicts my expectations for the ending wins additional points with me, and this well-played drama certainly deserves.
