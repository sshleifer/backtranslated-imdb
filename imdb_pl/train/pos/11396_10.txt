This Oscar-winning film, released two years before I was born, has everything - rich Technicolor sets and costumes, breathtaking pictures, Gershwin's great music from wall to wall, excellent choreography, lighter air scenario and great performances Kelly, Levant, Foch , Guetary and Caron. Hollywood does not like them anymore. This is definitely my favorite movie of all time, the standard by which I rate all other films. ENJOY, ENJOY, ENJOY!
