What the director's intuition can evoke in a material that only needs to be pushed in the right direction. The young Mr. Lincoln is filled with certain "old-fashioned" values, which in retrospect, despite his two-dimensional image, are at least more respectable than could be seen in the current cinema. What makes it work as exceptionally as it is in all its simplicity and grandeur is that it is a really great court drama disguised as a history lesson. <br /> <br /> We all know Abraham Lincoln as the 16th president who emancipated and was murdered after the civil war. But as a lawyer in earlier years, he was charismatic, funny in the most unexpected places and a real gentleman. He is not some superhero who can not do anything bad (which was Fonda's only fear of this part before enrolling), but a figure with possible flaws that outweighs innate goodness and a clear view of good and evil. <br /> <br /> Just to say that John Ford is unique as a storyteller with almost no attempt. Actually it's a lie, he's trying, but he does it effortlessly in a studio system; he worked independently, and at the same time enjoyed Zanuck at the same time, so he stayed with his own concise practices of "editing in the camera" and did not move him so as not to hesitate far from the story. This is the power of conventional wisdom that somehow interacts with the material as a kind of element accompanying a full-blooded Americana in 1939, as you can see in Mr. Smith in Washington (only here is the law, not politics). <br /> <br /> Fonda is great at driving - his first with Ford - and never lets us lose Lincoln's sight except make-up and additional reinforcement of shoes. Fonda's own personality, in a sense, as in Grapes of Wrath and My Darling Clementine, appears in the form of Lincoln. No matter how unlikely it is, there is no one else in this period who could play it: he is mature and wise, but he wants to prove in this case the murder he saw and which case he made. <br /> <br /> Only in small pieces, such as the last shot, which puts Lincoln walking down the street with his monument, and a few small instances during this great parade scene in the beginning seems quite outdated. As for the goals set by Young Lincoln, everyone met with Ford and his team and staffed; it is not as hokey as it may seem, and has a strong balance of humor and true pathos.
