The book on which this movie is based was perfect; it took me a while to deal with the unconventional Houellebecq style, but when I understood the mood of writing, I was completely drawn into the world of the author's sadness. In fact, no other book influenced me so much. This is not necessarily good - it explained my personal fight and made it difficult for my own struggle to be futile. Houellebecq's observations are masterfully captured by Harel, and the apathy and indifference of the hero to the world that has rejected him is perfectly depicted. It is a film that reveals today's society for a modest man in all his horror. We hope that the situation will change in the future, but for now we have to accept the rat race, as shown in this video. It is probably best if Harel or Houellebecq do not create such a work of genius. One is enough for every man.
