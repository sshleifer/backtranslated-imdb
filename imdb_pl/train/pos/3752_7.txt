This movie is unusual and bizarre and is almost unusual and bizarre in a very good way. I give this shortcut 7 simply because it is so special and out of place, but most of the time it seems to be bizarre, just because it is bizarre. If the film could integrate more bizarre moments with some pretense of the story, it would be really fantastic. <br /> <br /> The main problem is that it seems that the creators have mixed up together. about rubbish nonsense, and then I threw in a lot more nonsense that sounded as if it were funny from the mouth of the spatula. <br /> <br /> It's definitely worth checking out, but it's not the best idea for every episode of creators.
