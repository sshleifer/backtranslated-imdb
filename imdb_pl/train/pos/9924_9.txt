Ah, Domino is actually a breath of fresh air, something new in the world of cinema. I liked the movie very much because of the complex plot, various characters and intense effects of the camera. I saw some people complaining about the camera's work and, in fact, according to the creators themselves, flashy and wild shots were the culmination of mistakes made in time. Everything you see was a desirable effect. Perhaps some people complain because they have never done something like this before, although it distinguishes it. In a deeper aspect, you see Domino seeing things in her eyes, think about it. <br /> <br /> When it comes to history, I see nothing wrong with it. Although it is "messy", according to some, it is in fact a fast form of telling stories. The plot really is not that difficult to track, if you really focus on what's going on. Maybe it's just me, because I see movies from many different aspects, such as acting, story, etc. I am not a "translator" or anyone who distributes movies, only comes to me. Having said that, I think it is a really great movie, even though it is an iconic classic, a hit or anything else. <br /> <br /> And the characters, there is no doubt about how diverse the cast is. I believe that the cast is excellent because everyone is doing great work, effectively presenting their characters, which makes the film ladies and gentlemen. All characters are very special, and the additional plus is that you can be a witness to a small piece of each of them, separating them even more. Basically, I personally loved the cast and characters. <br /> <br /> Everyone who's recording and recording this movie, maybe they just do not see it like me, or they just do not recall it. No matter it's a great movie, no, it's a great movie period.
