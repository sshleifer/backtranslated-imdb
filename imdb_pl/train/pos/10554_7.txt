Nothing (3+ out of 5 stars) Another strange premise from the director of the movie "Cube". This time there are two main characters who find themselves and their home in a mysterious white emptiness. Outside of their small two-story house, it literally has NOTHING. Certainly intriguing, but I thought that the comedy sound set for this movie from the very beginning was extremely poorly conceived. There must be some humor, certainly ... and I have no problem with humor, which ultimately comes from the difficult situation of our two heroes (their last "final game" was definitely hoot) ... but I really think that the movie would be a lot better if it was more rooted in reality at the beginning. After watching the movie, I watched the "Making of" feature on DVD, and the short trailer at the end is almost completely devoid of "stupid" aspects of comedy ... making it look like a completely different (and slightly better) movie. The last half hour of the film is the moment when things really start to meet ... just like in the last movie "Primer". The actors are doing well when they do not overdo comedy. They are really reliable in their more "normal" moments. I was probably prepared to write this film as an unsuccessful experiment halfway ... but in the end it convinced me. (And do not stop watching me to see the last scene ... just do not ask me for an explanation.)
