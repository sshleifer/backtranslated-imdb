Alexandr "Sascha" Luzhin (John Turturro) is a former leading chess player who is trying to return to the tournament in Italy. His brilliance is unquestionable, but his obsession with chess has stunted his development in all other aspects of his life. Natalia (Emily Watson) is a beautiful heiress who came to the same center with her mother, Vera (Geraldine James), to explore possible marital partners. Vera is leaning towards the handsome count, but surprisingly, Natalia is more fascinated by Sascha, whom she met during a walk. Sascha is also taken with Natalia and offers a marriage at their second meeting. But with the concentration Sascha has to give to chess games, and whether other events in his past will still cause problems, will he win the heart of Natalia? Oh, can he become a chess master? This is a beautiful film based on the Nabokov novel. Acting is amazing, with Watson very good, as the beautiful little rich girl and Turturro are perfect as a shy, awkward chess enthusiast. James gives a pretty good turn as an overbearing mother, and the other cast members are also great. When it comes to the look of the movie, it can not be better. The scenery is varied, the vintage costumes are wonderful, and the photos deserve a lot of applause. Yes, the story is extraordinary and told by retrospection, sometimes making it a film not everyone will appreciate. Then the ending is bittersweet. However, if you love romance, songs from the era, great acting, knockout scenes or the art of making movies, do not miss it. You will be defenseless, resisting a lot of charms.
