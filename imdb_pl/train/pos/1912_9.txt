I will be brief and short, the people who wrote the story of this series are brilliant, the actors are just perfect for the roles they play (CJ's character is legendary) and have so many chemistry on the screen that this is what a very successful comedy is. <br /> <br /> When I saw the new episodes for the first time, which will probably return just over 6/7 months, I was wondering what happened to Paul. I was gutted to find out that he died when I browsed Google. He was so funny and he played his character perfectly, an overprotective father who likes to keep his daughters away from the spotlight and the boys. <br /> <br /> The comedy, I think, has gone from strength to strength, even without Paul. <br /> <br /> Besides, I think most people will enjoy it.
