YETI deserves 8 stars because it is one of the biggest bad movies in history. I saw it at the northern show in L.A., and people roared and cheered in madness - this movie is one of those film wrecks in which you think there can be no stranger and IT WORKS! The millionaire who funds the project for the Yeti thaw, looks like Chris Penn and John Goodman both fell into a bad suit - the guy playing the scientist is one of the worst actors ever to appear on the screen - and yes, there is a mute boy (who in a sense it looks like a girl) and is silent since he survived the plane crash that killed his parents (hmmm - maybe therapy for a kid?). Then this hottie Italian girl is seen by Yeti (once he defrosts - which lasts FOREVER) - and instantly falls in love with it - one of the most hysterical things in the movie is that this giant Yeti does "bedroom eyes" on her - it's like great Barry White, who is trying to seduce a groupie. In fact, when the great Yeti raises the hottie and has it on her chest - she accidentally touches the Yeti nipple and yes, the film devotes time to showing her big gray nipple. Yikes of all YIKES! Besides, there is a collie dog in it, because the Italian producer had to hear that the American audience liked dogs, and he tried to get Lassie - there is also a crazy scene in which the Yeti eats a giant fish - he keeps a large fish fish and uses it to comb his hair girls "Oh, thanks Yeti - now my hair is smooth and smells like dead trout. You're the best". This movie is more bizarre than anything Ed Wood could think of. If you're a fan of classic cinema - look for this child.
