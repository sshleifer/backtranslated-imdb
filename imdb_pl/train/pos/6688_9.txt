In the history of comic books, "Mystery Men" is one of the most underrated. This is not an ordinary comic superhero! This is due to the exploits of the collected team of well-placed would-be, including Mr. Furiousa (played by Ben Stiller), Bowler (Janeane Garofalo), Shoveller (William H. Macy), Blue Rajah (Hank Azariah) and spleen (Paul Reubens). "Mystery Men" impersonates several aspects of superhero movies such as "Superman" or "Batman", such as concise sayings and secret identity questions. Most superheroes are not billionaires, such as Bruce Wayne, but types of workers with unkind work and neurotic life at home. So it seems that the director Kinka Usher makes heroes something that the average viewer can relate to. I found "Mystery Men" that are visually stimulating and very funny. Even if it does not turn into a franchise, watching is still a joy!
