The first television program by Barbra Streisand was simply fantastic! From her skitu as a child, to a mix of songs in a high-class fashion house - everything was at the highest level! It was easy to understand how these special prizes were awarded. <br /> <br /> Not disturbed by guest performances, they focused on Barbra throughout the production.
