In Budapest, Margaret Sullavan (as Klara Novak) gets a job as a clerk in a souvenir shop; there he argues with his colleague James Stewart (as Alfred Kralik). They both do not get along at work, because everyone has fallen in love with an invisible finger. Observing how Ernst Lubitsch directs these stars through inevitable is predictably satisfying. <br /> <br /> Even better is the sub-thread with the participation of the shop owner Frank Morgan (as Hugo Matuschek), who suspects that his wife is having an affair. Employing a private investigator, Mr. Morgan confirms that his wife has had sex with one of his junior employees for 22 years. Morgan, painfully realizing, "She just does not want to grow old with me," and supporting heroes are what keeps this film from aging. Shop Around the Corner (1/12/40) Ernst Lubitsch ~ James Stewart, Margaret Sullavan, Frank Morgan, Joseph Schildkraut
