"The Last Hard Men" is a typical western from the 70s. Most of them seem to be inspired by Sam Peckinpah. Also this one, but director Andrew McLaglan is a student of John Ford and this can of course be seen in many scenes. IMO the beginning is very good. In a way, McLaglan wanted to show the audience a journey from civilization to the desert. In the third part there are some illogical defects and I complain about Charlton Heston a bit. He must play an old former lawyer named Sam Burgade, but he has a fantastic physical form. I never had the impression that he really has problems climbing a horse or on a rock. For me, he was not very motivated, as usual in most of his epic movies. The same applies to the beautiful Barbara Hershey, who plays the sheriff's daughter. Maybe they both had problems with the director or were dissatisfied with their roles. Hershey and Coburn are not the best, but they are still good. If the screenwriter had John Wayne in his head as Sam Burgade? Also Michael Parks as a modern sheriff is slightly underestimated in his role. On the other hand, James Coburn is outlawed Zach Provo. Coburn is a really great villain in it. He presents the evil guy between manic hatred and cunning. His role and acting are the best in the film. <br /> <br /> Landscapes and shootings are great. The shooting scenes are bloody and the violence looks realistically. Zach Provo and his gang had some bloody and violent scenes. I miss the typical western action in the middle of the movie. I would be grateful for a bank robbery or something similar. In general, it is a funny western. This is not a great movie, but above average because of great Coburn, a very good start and a few bloody and violent scenes.
