A typical comedy of the 90s, situational comedy similar to our contemporary "My Family". Thatcher being the pinnacle of most political jokes, Bill (Belinda Lang) blames Thatcher for everything he can do. "Bloody Thatcher" probably shared with most of us. David, a typical teenager, slicing brains with bread knives, Jenny, a moody older teenager, interested only in boys and more boys. Bill and Ben are working as much as they can to keep the family afloat, fighting in the economic climate of the early 90s. Granted the first two series were not as effective as the second series, but the series 3 and the next starts with the laughter I count. In general, this program did not get the best viewing times and should have lasted a bit longer. apparently they could not continue after Gary Olsen's death, but I think they should get rid of the "office" of the "small Britain" office and restore the classics!
