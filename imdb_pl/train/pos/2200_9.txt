The 100 black and white half-hour episodes of the early comedy "Mr. Peepers" were originally broadcast in NBC in 1952-55. Like many baby boomers, "Ding Dong School" is my earliest memories of television. Since both were launched later in syndication, it is difficult to say how many of these memories are actually associated with the original broadcasts. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Peepers" is worth checking out more than the value of nostalgia. It represents a completely different style of situation comedy than programs such as "The Honeymooners" and "I Love Lucy". At that time, the genre could go in two different directions and ended up with a loud clashing path of these two performances; probably that's why they still seem contemporary. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Peepers", which was distinguished by an intelligent, restrained tone, may seem to be slow and dull compared to it. But it's really a matter of adapting to a different style. After entering the character, he will win with the most intelligent viewers. Noteworthy is the producer of the series, Fred Coe, a key figure in early television, whose dramatic anthologies are also worth checking out ("Philco Television Playhouse", "Lights Out", "Playhouse 90", "Producers Showcase", "Playwrights 56", "The Fireside Theater "etc.) Even on the kinescope. <br /> <br />" Mr. Peepers "proposed a much gentler style with Wally Cox (be the voice of" Underdog "a few years later)) in the title role, Robinson Peepers, gently brought up His glasses were his trademark and symbolic link to his name and the role of a passive observer. <br /> <br /> This series has provided Cox with an exceptional cast, Tony Randall playing the brash best friend, Harvey Weskit's history teacher, Jack Warden Frank Whip, a great strength teacher whose gentle bullying gave the program most of the elements of the conflict. <br /> <br /> There is one competition about love with the school nurse, Nancy Remington (Patricia Benoit), with viewers quickly adapting to Mr. Peepers, who seems to fit a gentle Nancy much better. Their marriage on screen at the end of the 1953-54 season attracted the attention of the nation, the early version of "Who Shot J.R."? shawl. <br /> <br /> Again what do I know? I'm just a kid.
