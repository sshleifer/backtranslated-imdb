The series were short themes originally shown in cinemas in connection with a feature film that was associated with the serialized fiction of the pulp magazine. Known as "chapter views", these were films with expanded movement divided into several segments called "chapters" or "sections". Each chapter will be shown in the same theater for a week. The series would end with the cliffhanger because the protagonist and heroine would find themselves in the last dangerous situation from which there would be no escape. <br /> <br /> The audience would have to come back next week to find out how the Hero and the heroine escaped and once again fought against the villain. The series were especially popular with children, and for many children in the first half of the twentieth century, a typical Saturday in films included the chapter of at least one series, animated cartoons, newsreels and two feature films. > <br /> The golden age of the series was 1936-1945. It was one of the best ones in those days. <br /> <br /> Zorro was seen in many movies, but Reed Hadley ("Racket Squad", The Undying Brain) was perfect in this role. <br /> <br /> The action is fixed and we run the chapter after chapter to the final goal in which we discover the identity of the villain. <br /> <br /> Zorro triumphs, as always.
