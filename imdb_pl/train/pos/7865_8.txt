Page 3 is a great movie. The story is so refreshing and interesting. I have never found myself in space in the film. Konkana Sen did a good job in the film, although I think that someone with greater splendor or enthusiasm would be better, but she did a great job. All supporting actors were also very good and helped the movie. Boman Irani did a great job. There is one thing that stands out in this movie THE STORY, it's great and very realistic, it does not hit the bush, it's very easy to send it messages. I think that more such films should be made, I'm tired of watching the same candy videos over and over again, now they are hard to digest. Everyone should watch page 3, it's a great movie. - This is my 2 cents :)
