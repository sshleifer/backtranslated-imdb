In Stand By Me, Vern and Teddy discuss who was tougher, Superman or Mighty Mouse. Me and my friends often talk about who would win the fight. Sometimes we get absurd and we compare guys like MacGyver and The Terminator or Rambo and Matrix. But now it seems that we're talking about men like Jackie Chan, Bruce Lee and Jet Li. It's a pointless comparison, because Lee is dead, but he's funny. And if you go through what we saw from Jet Li in Lethal 4 and Black Mask, you must at least say that it would fit well with Khan. In this film, he becomes the God of martial arts. <br /> <br /> The Black Mask tells about a man who was created along with many other people to be the highest fighting machines. Their only goal is to win wars that others lose. They are invincible in some way. This is the premise of the film, but what it does creates all the incredibly choreographic scenes of the fight. <br /> <br /> Jet Li is a miracle. He can do things with his body and what no man should be able to do. And that's what makes watching it so funny. <br /> <br /> In addition to martial arts in the film, the black mask is strong with humor, thanks to the chemistry Jet has with his star, the police officer. They are wonderful together. But to tell you the truth. if someone is reading this review, he wants to know if the movie is a kick in the action department. And the answer to that is loud YES !!! A lot and a lot of bloody thoughtless actions. You will love this movie.
