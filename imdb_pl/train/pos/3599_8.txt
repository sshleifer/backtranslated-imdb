This movie is a real gem. The arc of the plot is defined in the first 3 minutes, the characters are nice and clearly drawn, and their motives are completely reliable. The dialogue is fresh and so real. The situations are unique to the characters and are not at all cliched or hackneyed. Until the climax. Then it's as if the movie has broken down a bit and became a bit hokey and unbelievable. But I do not want to discourage people from watching this movie. The first 3/4 of this are really unusual. I gave it to him 8. There are some amazing performances here. Check out this movie.
