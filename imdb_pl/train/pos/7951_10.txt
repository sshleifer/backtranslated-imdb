It is a really nice and sweet movie that the whole family can enjoy. It's about two dogs and a cat that are taken away for a short time to live with someone else, but the animals do not understand and run away to find the family by themselves. The cat is called Sassy and lives according to his name. Chance is a younger dog who knows a lot about life inside a pound. A shadow is an older and smarter dog that senses things. Combine these three people with an adventure that will make the time full of joy and fun. The lips do not move any special effects, so they are not cheesy at all. It's the best talking animal movie I've seen so far. It's a really good movie for families.
