Call me a fool, but I absolutely loved the horror of 2001, Valentine. He was so well made, well-written, well-played, well-directed, etc.! Everything was wonderful about that! There were parts that were relatively routine (Lily's death), very funny (www.Bleed-Me-Dry.com), completely frightening and scary (Paige's death) and just painful (the first scene). I think the whole cast did great, especially three leaders: David Boreanaz, Denise Richards (we both met and got autographs during the filming of this movie - VERY nice people!) And Marley Shelton. br /> <br /> I have enough people who call this movie "another clone of the Scream". This film is by no means a clone of the Shout. In fact, this movie has rings around Shout. In fact, it makes SENSE! Krzyk was NOT the only film in which a masked killer was found. I'm sorry, but it looks like Scream was also a clone (ahem ..., Friday 13th, Halloween, and many other scary movies also included masked killers). I also think that the novelty of a killer with a cupid mask is brilliant. It's strange to see a sweet, Amorous face that does all these horrible things. Another novelty (bleeding from the nose) gives a fantastic ending! The end gives me shivers every time I see it !!!!! So even if you did not like it the first time, watch Valentine again and give him another chance! <br /> <br /> PS - Keep an eye on my new website (WWW.LOVE-HURTS.ORG)! Soon...
