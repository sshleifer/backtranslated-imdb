What is on this disk is the first show of the first class of bandwidth. This disc is NOT for weak hearts ... music is incredibly intense and VERY cool. What you will learn when watching this movie is the reason why Who was so huge. It is true that their albums were great, but their performances were at the top of the pile. In 1969, when this concert was filmed, the busters teenie boppers who threw jelly at the Beatles, and bands (and audiences) fixed long and often incredible displays of musical virtuosity - something that few viewers have intellectual curiosity to pursue in the era of canned Britney music and Christina. Especially you find out here about amazing things that can happen when talented musicians are encouraged to improvise. Try a concert, it's really amazing.
