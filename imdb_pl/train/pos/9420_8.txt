The Man in the White Suit is one of those great comedies that Ealing studios did so well in the 1940s and '50s. The plot is about a man who invent a fabric that does not get dirty or crack. Of course, this is a huge breakthrough in the world of textiles. However, things are not so easy, because the material threatens the lives of many people, including fabric manufacturers, employees of clothing factories, and even an elderly lady who washes herself every week. The Man in the White Suit is a film about scientific progress and the way it does not always help; as an old woman says at a certain point in the movie: "Why can not scientists just leave things alone?" <br /> <br /> Like many of Ealing's comedies, this game by Sir Alec Guinness. Alec Guinness is a fantastic actor; he has the ability to brighten the screen with his presence (and he does it in this movie, literally), but he manages to present his characters on the ground and in a credible way. It is quite scary in this film and captures the right atmosphere for your character; intelligent and ambitious, but slightly naive scientist. Along with Guinness, Joan Greenwood, a deep-voiced actress who plays alongside Guinness in the divine "Kind Hearts and Coronets" and Michael Gough, the man who will play the role of Alfred in Batman's films, appears in the film The Man in the White Suit. Acting in a movie is not always great, but it is always decent and suits the movie. <br /> <br /> A man in a white suit is a smart, provocative and witty comedy with a moral. Comedy is not always obvious and does not always work, but the movie is not meant to be a movie that provokes belly laughter, so it's excusable. I recommend this film to anyone who is a movie fan.
