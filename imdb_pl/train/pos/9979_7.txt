For starters, because this movie is a remake of the classics, the rating must already be lowered. Because this version of Viggo Mortensen's game in the main role of Kowalski, helps. <br /> <br /> Is not it like the US government to terrorize one of its citizens. Sounds like the character of Jason Priestley from the movie! But the truth is that the government will do everything possible to destroy man's life for trying to return home to his wife. A wife who works no less and can not do it. <br /> <br /> "There was a time in this country that the police would escort a man to his pregnant wife." Disc Jockey's words. <br /> <br /> There were some great shots of the scenery in this movie and great car chases and a lot of spirituality. After many considerations, I gave this film 7.
