For the first time he achieved fame thanks to the Drunken Master, Jackie Chan was again drawn into the spotlight thanks to project A in 1983, an extremely pleasant pirate film that restored him to the position of the main star. Until the release of Police Story two years later, the unusual buzz around Jackie reached its zenith, and crowds gathered to see this crazy mix of amazing stunts, brutal battle scenes and dubious comedies. It interrupted many cash records and inspired a 50 percent increase in the number of police recruits, but looking 20 years later - is this good? <br /> <br /> In the action movie Police Story, he gets up undoubtedly. There are several great battle scenes, the stunt memories of the hero Chan, Buster Keaton, and a convincing, brutal fight. Jackie's performance is also very strong, and although frequent attempts to work on a comedy somewhat affect the film's influence, his charisma moves him. What's more, presenting our hero as a borderline psychopath, whose recklessness exposes others to danger, Jackie took a significant risk ... although in the event that nobody noticed! Praising the police tale as a simple "good versus evil" battle critics, the ambiguity of the tone of the film was diminished, and although it is not the brothers Karamazov, in presenting such uncertainty the film, despite everything, was a remarkable and commendable shift from conventional ideas. > <br /> In short, it remains a qualitative movie "popcorn" * (although you can empty the stomach when many villains are pushed or placed in glass cases in the final scene of the movie) - a powerful, noisy funny action movie, which is among the best in his period.
