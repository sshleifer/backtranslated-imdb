How can you not rate this movie using 10/10? I admit that this movie is not too funny, but the goal is not tell stories but history! This is the first "real" movie from the history of cinema ("le Prince de Galles" was the first, but it was not technically good enough?) And has undoubtedly great international value. The people you see, ending the working day in the film, had the opportunity to participate in the historical moment, becoming the first people who can see themselves on the move! And above all, a shot is a beautiful shot! And it's very moving when you think about the first people who saw it! What a moment! First, historical for science (because the Lumiere brothers first invented a cinematograph for scientific reasons), and later for art. Film to worship!
