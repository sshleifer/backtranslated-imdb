Buddy is a funny family movie set in times when it "humanizes" animals, which makes them sweet, which is an accepted way to interest their people. <br /> <br /> On the basis of true history, Buddy shows the great love that the main characters have for animals and for each other, and that they will do everything for themselves. <br /> <br /> Although this is not the perfect movie, the animated gorilla is quite realistic most of the time and the chaos that takes place at home is usually fun for children. <br /> <br /> This movie skips the opportunity to deal with the mistake of bringing wild animals home as pets, but shows difficulties. <br /> <br /> Recommended movie, which was the first movie Jim Henson Productions.
