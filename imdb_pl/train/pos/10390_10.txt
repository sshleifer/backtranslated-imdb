Next to "Star Wars" and "The Wizard of Oz", it remains one of the greatest fantasy films ever. It's a real shame that it's not as well-known as the previous movies (perhaps because it's based on legends rather than on modern or science-fiction stories, and that it's British, or a smaller movie market), but it's I know wonderfully that he deserves this reputation. <br /> <br /> Like all great family movies, you can be a kid, an adult and even a teenager to enjoy this movie (I'm 18 now), but you have to appreciate the classic movies first. I absolutely love this movie. He has the unusual music of Miklos Rozsa (perhaps my favorite classical film score), which competes with any John Williams score "Star Wars", fast but not flashy pace, beautiful sets, dialogue and use of color (both set designs and photos won Oscars) ) and the most modern, Oscar-winning special effects (for now, and some are still stunning). And of course, the sensual look of June Duprez looks like the princess competes with Catherine Zeta-Jones "(in a sense, he even looks like Jones!). <br /> <br /> In summary, this is one of all my favorite movie time (next to "The Adventures of Robin Hood") and really deserves more attention. This is a real adventure with a spell, and with "Robin Hood" it is my movie on a deserted island, which I could watch many times without being upset. <br /> <br /> Stars: **** (perfect)
