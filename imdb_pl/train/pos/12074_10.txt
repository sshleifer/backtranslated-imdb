Joseph H. Lewis was one of the best directors of the film noir. It is certainly his best. <br /> <br /> There are no standard functions of what we now call a noir movie. Although made in America, it is entirely set in England. Gangsters are missing. Femme fatale is missing. There is no lack of crime. <br /> <br /> The title character responds to the ad. He is happy that he will earn some money as a secretary. Instead, he wakes up a few days later as a pawn in a terrifying conspiracy. Only a very strong person could survive such a terrifyingly troubling attempt. And Nina Foch gives the feeling of a strong woman as Julia. <br /> <br /> Part of the thrill is casting against the type: Mrs. Foch has an elegant style. He is not a screaming, curled victim. In fact, she is a little cold and patrician, though unholy. This makes her heroine more reliable. <br /> <br /> Certainly the most fascinating element is the Dame May Witty casting. She was (and is) probably best known for her charming title character in "The Lady Vanishes". It has a sweet way and a harmless, slightly distracted way. But here is far from the heroine. <br /> <br /> George Macready is perfect as her extremely worried son. The whole cast is really great. <br /> <br /> It looks like this famous and brilliant movie was made almost by accident. No doubt the director knew exactly what he was doing. But he did it with a low budget. This is the thrill and charm of film noir, the real film noir: it is small, convincingly low and, in this case, unforgettable.
