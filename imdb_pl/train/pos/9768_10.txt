This is the best movie ever made. This is a master piece that brought me a tear to my eye. I will never forget my watching. I do not understand why people do not think like me. The dinosaur turns into a performance reminiscent of De Niro in Raging Bull, Pacino in Scarface and Crowe in Gladiator. It should be released on a DVD in the Superbit format, so that I can fully enjoy it, just as it was supposed to be when you want to enjoy it when it produces and films it. Whoppi Goldberg really turns away from performances in life, as a hard, rough policeman who is against her, joins forces with a hot dinosaur shot as her partner, and then hi-jinx at least succeeds. By the way, I say that the complete opposite of what is true in this film is complete garbage.
