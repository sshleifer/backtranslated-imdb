Michael Keaton is "Johnny Dangerously" at the start in gangster films from 1984. Maureen Stapleton plays his sick mother, Griffin Dunne is his DA brother, Peter Boyle is his boss, and Marilu Henner is his girlfriend. Other stars are Danny DeVito and Joe Piscopo. Keaton plays the owner of a pet shop in the thirties, who catches a child stealing a puppy and then tells him in retrospect how he came to the pet shop. At a young age he turned to theft to take his mother for pancreatic surgery ($ 49.95, this week special) and began working for the mafia boss (Boyle). Johnny uses the name "Dangerous" in the world of the gangster. <br /> <br /> There are some funny scenes in this movie, and Stapleton will live, when Johnny's vulgar mother needs organs in her body. Peter Boyle as Johnny's boss gives a very funny performance, like Griffin Dunne, a straight DA shot that will not "play football" with the crooked Burrem (Danny De Vito). As Johnny's nemesis, Joe Piscopo is great. Richard Dimitri is outstanding as Moronie, who tortures English - but you must hear him and not read about it. The funny thing is that he does it all with an angry expression. <br /> <br /> The movie gets a bit tired at the end, but it's worth seeing, and Keaton is great as a good boy / bad boy Johnny. For some reason this movie was undervalued when it was released, and like the other Keatonic gem, "Night Shift", you can not hear much about it today. With some performances and scenes that are real gems, "Johnny Dangerously" will be extremely pleasant.
