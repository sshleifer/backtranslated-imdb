During the premiere of Vanties, a dead woman was found on the catwalk above the stage. During the concert, the policeman's attempt to kill who and why before the last curtain is continued. <br /> <br /> I've always heard that it's a great classic secret of comedy, so I was excited to find a copy. Unfortunately, no one has told me about the music numbers that are repeated. While numbers are certainly the type Hollywood did in its heyday, it becomes obtrusive because it almost stops the movie, despite attempts to weave the action around them. It would not be so bad if the music was half decent, but it is not. There is only one good song. Worse, as if the studio knew it had one song, Cocktails for Two, and we were forced to put up with four of its versions: the duo, the big production number, the Vanities final and in the background as random music. I do not think Spike Jones and his local slickers have played so much. The rest of the movie is quite good, and Victor McLaglen is a good sparring friend with Jack Oakie. Charles Middleton is very funny, his scene as an actor in love with his wardrobe. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend it, if you think you can go through music numbers or are willing to scan through them. It's a funny movie that's gone.
