I love this concert! <br /> <br /> Every time I watch an episode, I repeat this poem and remember how good this program is. I am a big science fiction fan and this program has the basics to be the most important science show (fictional?) In the history of film / television. There are so many theories in this presentation about the universe that I could start a religion. It's amazing, the season after the show season is getting better. <br /> <br /> I've been a fan of MacGyver since I was 5 years old (19 years old) and I think it's so ironic that my 2 favorite TV shows star all time Richard Dean Anderson. It is also interesting how each character is practically opposite to the other. <br /> <br /> When I saw the Stargate movie for the first time, I liked it immediately and thought it was one of my favorite science-fiction movies, and then I heard the TV program turned over. I was very excited, but I did not get showtime until the fifth season is almost over. <br /> <br /> Although I am disappointed that Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin wanted to make a film trilogy, but the studio chose the series. <br /> <br /> I said it turned out everything was fine. Maybe even better. <br /> <br /> This concert is amazing and I hope it will never die. Atlantis are here!
