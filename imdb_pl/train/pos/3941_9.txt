Young Mr. Lincoln is the first collaboration film director and star of John Ford and Henry Fonda. I remember years ago that Fonda said that as a young actor he was upset that he was playing Abraham Lincoln and was afraid he would not face the challenge. <br /> <br /> John Ford calmly calmed him down saying that he would not play the Great Liberator, only the lawyer-presenter. Embedded Fonda directed the cast, which John Ford directed to the classic film. <br /> <br /> This is not Lincoln's biographical film. It was earlier in the age of sound with Walter Huston and a year after Young Mr. Lincoln, Raymond Massey, made the prize-winning Pulitzer Prize for Robert Sherwood Abe Lincoln in Illinois. Massey still remains the ultimate Lincoln. <br /> <br /> But as Ford said, Fonda did not play the Great Emancipator only in a small town in Illinois. The film covers about 10 years of Lincoln's early life. We see him serving in a general store, which collects books on rights from the family of immigrant pioneers whose path will later go down in history. And his affair with Ann Rutledge with her early death left Lincoln the most melancholy being. <br /> <br /> Scroll forward by 10 years, and Lincoln is now a practicing attorney who is starting to get attention. He held several terms in the parliament, but he returned to private practice, not quite sure whether politics is for him. <br /> <br /> This is where most of the action takes place. The two sons of this family got law books when they are accused of murder. He offers them their defense. And not just a murder, but one of the sheriff's deputies. <br /> <br /> The process itself is fiction, but the gambit used to defend Richard Cromwell and Eddie Quillan, who played two sons, relies on a real case defended by Lincoln. I will not say more. <br /> <br /> In addition to performances, the great strength of Young Lord Lincoln is the way John Ford reflects the mood and atmosphere and the surroundings of the small town of the prairie of Illinois in the Fourth of July holiday. It's almost like watching a newsreel. And the mood of the country itself, young, alive and growing. <br /> <br /> Fans of John Ford's films recognize here two musical themes that were repeated in later films. During the romantic interlude at the beginning of Fonda and Pauline Moore, who played Ann Rutledge, background music is the same motif as in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance for Very Miles. And with dancing, the melody of Lovely Susan Brown, which Fonda and Marjorie Weaver play Mary Todd, is the same that Fonda danced with Cathy Downs in the movie My Darling Clementine while dancing to raise the church in Tombstone. <br /> <br /> Lincoln will forever be a favorite subject of biographers and playwrights for two reasons, I think. The first of these is the vivid embodiment of our American mythology of people rising from the bottom to the summit of power through their own efforts. In fact, young Mr. Lincoln graphically shows the background from which Lincoln came. Second, the fact that he was our president during the greatest crisis in American history and that he made a particularly good and moral decision to free slaves during the civil war, though for some necessary political reasons. His assassination secured him a place in history. <br/> <br /> In addition to Fonda and others I mentioned, special praise should also be given to Fred Kohler, Jr. and Ward Bond. Bond the main accuser. Also Donald Meek as prosecutor and Alice Brady, who turned out to be her last film as a pioneer of Cromwell's and Quillan's mother. And a very nice performance by Spencer Charters, who specializes in rustic characters as a judge. <br /> <br /> When it comes to a movie that captures drama and romance from the times it happens, you can not do better than Young Mr Lincoln.
