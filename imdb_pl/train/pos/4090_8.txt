This movie is simply amazing! I was expecting something completely different from the movie I saw. However, it is very insightful because it shows the aggressive nature of human sexuality and its connection with the behavior of animals. Let me warn those readers of this article who are easily offended by content that is too sexual, because the explicit sexual nature of this movie is like a high-level pornography. It even contains a scene that is very close to rape. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, I strongly suggest seeing this rare work of "sex art". By the way, every minute of the painting infuses with the sexual spirit of the seventies. Do not forget how times have changed! <br /> <br /> Check it out! It's worth your money and time!
