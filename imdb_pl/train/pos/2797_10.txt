10/10 for this movie. <br /> <br /> I am a British Indian doctor, currently in India. Beckham's word discouraged me because I'm an avid Liverpool fan and personally I think Owen is really cool. Because Liverpool and Man Utd are rivals, I was certain that I will not watch the movie. <br /> <br /> But then I was in Delhi to meet my friends, and I had an early morning flight, so I thought, "What the hell, let's give yourself time watching this movie," because it was late in the evening. <br /> <br /> What a moron. I should have seen this movie the day it was released. My guess is that by using Beckham's name I drew the audience's attraction (which in my case she shot back !!!), but then I can not really come up with a better title for the movie. <br /> <br /> And Nagra, Knightley (drop dead gorgeous), and Rhys-Myers did a great job. <br /> <br /> If you hate football, you do not like Manchester United (in this case England), this is DEFINITIONS for you. In fact, I am only 29 years old, I am a psychiatrist by profession, but I have a heart. This movie knocked out "Star Wars" from my position # 1. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, there are not many comments about this film. I wonder why? <br /> <br /> 10/10 for this movie.
