The film starts very slowly, from Wallace Napalm's lifestyle, assistant at the drop-off station. His wife was confined to her home with an ankle bracelet as a result of a judgment for arson. Wallace is a member of the volunteer fire brigade and takes fire brigade seriously. <br /> <br /> When we watch the rather boring life of Wallace, something new and shocking suddenly appears: a carnival is coming to the city. One of his stars is Wilder Napalm, Wallace's brother. He is a clown, but he has a special talent. <br /> <br /> Like Wallace. These are both pirokinetics and "pyrotechnics", people capable of starting fires through mental energy. Wallace keeps his powers secret; Wilder lets his friends know what he can do. <br /> <br /> Spoiler: Some of their differences date back to a childhood incident in which they accidentally caused the death of a tramp. Wallace refrains from using his powers; Wilder wants to make public on national television. <br /> <br /> Complicating the matter, Wilder wants Wallace's wife with whom they both came years earlier. It becomes a bone of contention and becomes one of the reasons why the brothers have literally a shootout at last. <br /> <br /> The movie is funny, but it does not laugh out loud. I think about it enough to have a copy in my library. It's a good, unusual movie.
