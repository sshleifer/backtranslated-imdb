I admit that I am addicted to vampires: I have seen many vampire movies that I lost, and this is definitely in the top ten. I was impressed by John Carpenter's original vampires, and when I discovered that there was a sequel, I went straight and bought it. This movie is not compatible with the same rules as the first one, and it is not so dark, but it is close enough and I felt that it was nicely built on the original. <br /> <br /> Jon Bon Jovi was very good as Derek Bliss: his performance was sympathetic and yet heavy enough for the viewer to believe he could survive in the world he lives in. One of my favorite parts was just after he met Zoey and goes to the bathroom to see if it's more than it seems. His comments are beautifully irreversible, and at the same time extremely practical, which contrast well with the rest of the scene when it develops. <br /> <br /> The other members of the cast were also well-matched and wielded well, creating a funny and original movie. It's not just the rebirth of the first movie and it evolved in a similar way that Fright Night II grew out of Fright Night. There are various elements that make it a new movie with a similar theme. <br /> <br /> If you like vampire movies, I recommend this movie. If you prefer to make your films less bloody, choose something else.
