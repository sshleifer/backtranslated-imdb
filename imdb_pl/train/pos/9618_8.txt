I recently bought this movie and I do not regret having it at all, so I am asking you to add this film to my collection. Matt Manfredi and Phil Hay, film directors, took less than a month to make the film and spent about EUR 1 million to produce this amazing film. It proves that not only great productions create great films. <br /> <br /> The title of this movie fits perfectly. In computer language, BUG is a program error that causes reactions in a computer function. Our reactions can cause these negative side effects, but also wonderful moments of beauty. The staggering events in this film begin with the death of BUGA. Man is a witness of "crime" on the other side of the road ... From that moment everything becomes complicated ... <br /> <br /> I pay attention to John Carrol Lynch ("Fargo"), Wallace, a man who can not do everything is fine.
