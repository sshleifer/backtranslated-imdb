Monstervision is a program in which I grew up. From nighttime hosted by Penn and Teller to Joe Bob Briggs. The performance sustained me on Friday nights in high school and provided some of the best car driving memories ever seen outside the home. <br /> <br /> No doubt the best late night television ever. If you have not stayed, you have lost. <br /> <br /> I know that John Bloom and Joe Bob live on, but I want them to return to where they belong ... MONSTERVISION! The question ... was anyone still sitting for 4 hours of the "Swarm"? q :) <br /> <br /> Long live Monstervision!
