To put it simply, I liked the movie. The reason for my interest and pleasure was not related to anything but the subject matter itself. I have heard stories from my mother and grandmother about how the northern working class and attitudes once lived (as they experienced) and this is an interesting description that seems to faithfully portray what they have told me. Especially a paternalistic, but overbearing father who "knows" what is best for his family with his stubbornness when this paradigm is questioned. (Then little changed there !!) <br /> <br /> People who saw the game will probably be disappointed with the movie, because the story is not easy to transfer to different media. In a sense, however, the film is a historical document and personally I liked it, if only because of the way it communicated the social phenomenon.
