Cowboys James Stewart and Walter Brennan take their pack from Seattle to Alaska and further to Canada to file a claim. There, they must face the seductive, cunning businesswoman of Ruth Roman and the icy, happy villain James McIntire. <br /> <br /> John Wayne can talk about more, but his good friend Stewart has some great, sharp-edged westerns, some with great director Anthony Mann. Honestly, I would take it, with solid action sequences and a great melodrama, through North To Alaska every day! <br /> <br /> Far Country offers breathtaking scenery and photos that should definitely be shot on the screen. <br /> <br /> In addition, there is some strong support from always reliable Brennan, Roman (who is great), incredibly sweet Corrine Calvet and James McIntire, who plays one of my favorite types of bad guy, such as he does not take himself too seriously. <br /> <br /> It would be a great double bill with another, highly recommended by West Mann / Stewart, west west, Bend Of The River.
