This Marian Cooper's documentary is absolutely amazing. I saw it tonight on the Turner Classic movie channel. I think I will see if I can order a copy on DVD. The film material does not look smeared and disturbed, as one might think after the silent movie of 1925. Settled in Iran in 1925. People from the nomadic tribe in the documentary film leave their desert houses and roam the raging river, men, women, children, animals ... Then go up and up the snowy mountain pass Barefoot. It is sunk or floats, climbs or dies. In search of grass for your animals. They have cows, goats, dogs, horses, mules. In one scene, a man wears a mule who is too sick to climb up. All children in the film look happy and healthy. They had such a hard life. I wonder if the nomadic tribes of Iran still live like this. It makes you appreciate modern life in the USA.
