One of the best films ever! Why is it only rated 7.6 is a mystery. This film is a window to the world of black experiences in America. It should be obligatory for all whites and all children over the age of 10. If you think that the work of Whoopi Goldberg concerns "Homer and Eddie" or "Hollywood Squares", think again. Do not miss this movie, which should have won an Oscar. (And also read the book!)
