I saw the German version of the movie on German television and I was really surprised. Generally, I like to watch documentary films, but I do not remember seeing those that are better than "Earth". I knew some scenes from videos on Youtube, which I found by random browsing. I also remember that I saw fragments of the movie in multimedia stores on high resolution display TVs. After watching the video, it's clear to me why the video is so popular with YouTube users and multimedia retail managers: it's just so amazing and spectacular that you can not not look at the screen, regardless of whether you're interested in nature documentaries or not. <br /> <br /> Without hesitation 10 out of 10. There are definitely more exciting movies, but when it comes to documentaries, "Earth" is definitely one of the best of this genre.
