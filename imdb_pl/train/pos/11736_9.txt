Those who are not familiar with Elvira Cassandra Peterson's alter-ego, this is a good place to start. <br /> <br /> "Elvira, Mistress of the Dark" begins with our heroine with the gravity of the opposing message. It seems her aunt died, who must be present in reading the will. Wanting to raise money for the show she wants to open in Las Vegas, she decides to go in the hope of getting a lot of money. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the place he must visit is the city of Fallwell, Massachusetts. She must become a spell because of the car's corruption and she finds out that her wonderful aunt has left 3 things: home, dog and cookbook. Residents of the city have mixed reactions: teenagers like her, women hate her, and men crave her (although they try to remain moral pillars of the community). Her uncle Vincent (W. Morgan Sheppard) turns out to be her worst problem because she wants her cookbook. It seems that the cookbook is a book of spells that will make him a more powerful wizard. <br /> <br /> The movie is actually quite funny, and Peterson ala Elvira uses his "gifts" and sexiness as a joke ("And do not forget, tomorrow we show a head with two things ... I mean what has two heads "). Especially funny as Edie McClurg as Chastity Pariah, the woman who is the most difficult to keep the city in line, but ends up funny (the picnic scene is a perfect example). He deserves a preview (of course the movie, not her tits).
