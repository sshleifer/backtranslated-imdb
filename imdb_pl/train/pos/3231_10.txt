A soldier is not a great movie, and all those who hate him have many good reasons. But I liked Soldier, partly because my expectations were so low that I was surprised by what I saw. <br /> <br /> First of all, the art direction is tight and well made. When it comes to science fiction backgrounds, Soldier did things with more design than 90% of the genre. Sets, costumes and props were consistent and competently made; I did not love all their future military style, but I was impressed by the effort. For me it made the film worth the time that you had to watch. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I'm a fan of Kurt Russell. I grew up watching this guy in one of the most memorable films of my youth ... The Barefoot Executive and his films by John Carpenter. A soldier is essentially an action movie, and the role of Sergeant Todd is a significant hero of the action. This is not an award-winning role, but Kurt creates convincing emotions in a VERY small dialogue. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, the battle scenes and battles are well choreographed. It is not an iron monkey, not even a matrix, but once again it significantly exceeds the average level of quality in the genre. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen it and you like science fiction action movies, pick them up if you pass in the chosen rental. Just do not expect another Blader.
