I gave this film such a high score because it was really nice, really funny and yet unpretentious. I went to see this movie while he was playing in the Philly area, and it was the central point of a great night with friends. The film is well-written and well-played, and although it seems a bit like sitcom, not a movie, it does not pick up the movie. You just will not find such comedies in which you do not have to shock people to be funny. The film focuses on a Ukrainian housewife who works for a young couple in need of help. Although he helps in the beginning, he soon adds more madness to their lives than the couple haggled. Things get out of control to ... you'll have to see! It made me laugh even when you left the theater. This movie put me in a good mood. I can not wait to be released on DVD because I want this movie in my collection.
