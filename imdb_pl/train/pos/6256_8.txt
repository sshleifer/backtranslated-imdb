Perhaps I am overtaking here, but although the film itself was a technical masterpiece in his time, I watched it piece by piece on the subject of TCM last night, the question arises: why did they do it? exposing their lives to danger, many of them died in a journey, why would they take such a life-threatening journey, just to find food for their animals (!), when they reached the "land of milk and honey", why not just there They are? Would you threaten your life and the whole community to find food for a cattle herd? Doing this only for this purpose, although dangerous, shows the inbred simplicity of this type of people. The risk of cow death? Better than me!
