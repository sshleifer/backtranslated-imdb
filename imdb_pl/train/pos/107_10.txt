Lars Von Triers Europe is a very good movie. How is it? Von Trier has a very stylized way of telling stories, at least in the case of Europe. For me, the whole movie was like an experience, even if I saw it on a small TV screen. Despite all the tricks, in my opinion, this movie is the most complete, TRUE and moving piece of cinema, and then most of the videos from the top 250 list. I also think that this is probably the most terrible, the most gothic and complete movie around. Okay, there are other good ones too, but this one is my favorite. The last scene is one of the most shocking scenes in history.
