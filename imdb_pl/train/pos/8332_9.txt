The part in which Meg visits the mechanic and says: "Does the piston shoot short?" (Suggesting poor sexual energy from her fianc√©e) was hilarious. I love Meg Ryan and it's as sweet as ever in this great movie. Very nice and very intelligent. Her innocent indignant expressions make you want her to be yours. The hero copes well with garage mechanics. Einstein had a romantic side of his psyche? The puzzle before the press and the audience was done well. It is terribly underestimated and deserves recognition and rebirth. He loses one vote for including the highly unlikely far-reaching theory bought by the US government. I do not understand why he's not in the top 20 romantic comedies of the century. A great movie, it has a presidential seal on it!
