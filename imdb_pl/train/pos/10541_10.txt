I thought it was a great movie. The theme is sweet! :) In any case, the only thing that bothered me a bit was the beginning when everything should be normal. It was very strange and unreal. A large cable company is primarily what I am talking about. In addition, the film was very creative. I think that the whole game was well made, the actors played the characters' personalities perfectly. Everything fits together well. It is a pity that this is not a soundtrack. It would be great! Because it's a Canadian movie, and because it's one of my favorites, I give this film 10 out of 10!
