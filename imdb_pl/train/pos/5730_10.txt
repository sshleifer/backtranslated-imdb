Dumbland is not for everyone. In fact, Dumbland can be for anyone but Lynch, and that makes him funny and collective. Violent? Yes. Blasphemy? Yes. Absurd? Yes. A piece of garbage? Never. Dumbland is a wonderful picture of some Americans who have no mind and are beating their wife and children for fun. From Mexico, I can say that I love it! My favorite episodes are: 1- My teeth bleed, all the noise around me and violence make me want to scream and put me behind the bed. 2- Get a stick! Yes, dear, get it and learn a lesson: some people are never grateful for your actions. 3- Ants. More Lynch episode, music, surrealism and very sweet revenge ...
