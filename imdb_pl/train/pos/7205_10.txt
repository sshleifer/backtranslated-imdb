A deadly trap is not a criminal. Who will do it first. It's so hard to describe this movie without revealing anything, so I will not mention anything more about the story. When it comes to acting, Cris Reeves is the biggest role of Clifford, the young playwright. In this movie, you see the range of his acting abilities, from "exhaling cheeseburgers" to simply frightening. Clifford is such a difficult role to play, and during stage production I have never seen Clifford playing well at both ends of the spectrum. The actor plays him as a small puppy or a deadly maniac. Reeves is the only person I've seen who has a character all the time. As for Michael Caine, he ... he's Michael Caine. One of the best actors of the last 50 years and in this movie as good as ever.
