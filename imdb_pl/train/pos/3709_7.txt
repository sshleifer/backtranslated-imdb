Any screen adaptation of John Grisham's story deserves a Hollywood approach to the mainstream, and Robert Altman talks about the last director I would like to go to the mainstream. But this fried cauldron in the south is quite good. Although he is not one of the best Altman, he certainly does not belong to the films he made, which makes you scratch your head and wonder what he was thinking about. <br /> <br /> Altman tilted his hat to a mysterious thriller with noir overtones earlier in his 1973 film The Long Goodbye. "The Gingerbread Man" is not as good as this movie, but it's good for itself. Kenneth Branagh is a conceited lawyer who considers himself a murderer after he became involved with a client (Embeth Davidtz), who gained his help in protecting her from a cuckoo father (Robert Duvall). The action takes place in Savannah, Georgia during the upcoming tropical storm, which gives the film an oppressive atmosphere that I liked very much. Turns and turns towards the end of the movie are becoming more and more crazy, and Altman proves that he is not as proficient in the shootings, but in general, the film is not a bad addition to the Altman canon. <br /> <br /> There is also Robert Downey, Jr., Daryl Hannah, Tom Berenger and Famke Janssen. <br /> <br /> Class: B
