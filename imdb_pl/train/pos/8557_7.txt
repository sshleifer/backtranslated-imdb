I have to pass it to the creative team behind the American Pie films. "Direct to DVD" is usually synonymous with cheap, incompetent filming. Last year, I was pleasantly surprised when I was having a great time in the DVD sequel "The Naked Mile". The creators of the film took advantage of the opportunity to provide a snappy, but funny video. This year they offer the continuation of "Beta House". This is the honest truth, "Beta House" makes the first few "American Pie" movies look like "The Little Mermaid". <br /> <br /> It is not forbidden, tasteless, laughter of loud fun. Sure, the story is a bit thin, but it is the beauty of the whole thing. In the first 10 minutes, we get to know all the main characters, new support characters, we get a handful of disgusting gags, we meet villains and set the general plot line. Thanks to all this, the film becomes an unlimited ride. Gags are plentiful, and they did not stop it. I am talking about male sperm, urine, vibrators, chicks, sex with sheep, female orgasms sprays and many more. Not to mention that there is no minute without tits or sex scenes. <br /> <br /> Return from "The Naked Miles" is John White, Jake Siegel, Steve Talley and Eugene Levy (in a similar supporting role). The entire cast is great. In particular, Steve Talley (Dwight Stifler) has great energy and presence on the screen. I anticipate good things for him. The film is also full of great movie references for those who have their eyes open. By far the biggest laugh for me was the parody "Deerhunter". Classic. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that if you're a fan of the series, you will feel at home with "Beta House". It really pushes the limits of good taste, but in the end it's damn funny.
