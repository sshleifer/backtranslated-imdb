Some war movies are successful where others do not, and can be judged from different points of view. Humanistic angle, one in which you can feel the raw emotions (fear of attack, camaraderie among soldiers, tedious trials faced by people in battle, etc.). They are always films that I think are attractive. Movies such as Das Boot and A Midnight Clear are just two examples of movies that you can feel as a connection to the characters in the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is also successful at this level. He speaks of the "Supreme Honor" and this honor is doing right. These 23 soldiers behaved rightly, had honor and are considered completely incompatible with Western thought, but the end is a true story of honor. An unforgettable movie. Based on facts.
