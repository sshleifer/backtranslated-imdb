This is one of the best films in the world, and a lot is said to have been for television. I really want it to be on d.v.d. <br /> <br /> Helen Hunt gave such a stern performance. She played the perfect policeman thrown in the case of a serial killer. When it crumbles because it kills another kid, it was amazing. She's so lonely, so he'll reach her. When he talks about his mother! WOW! <br /> <br /> Steven Weber as a serial killer was so shocking! He really introduced her into his dark world. It was a worthy Oscar. When he talks about killing children, he is terrified! When he realizes who he really is! What a scene !! <br /> <br /> They really do not like them anymore. It was a real thriller without being up.
