A great little thriller. I was expecting some stupid horror, but I got a short, short thriller that does not waste our time. In most of these movies, we have to tell the characters' stories so that we feel sympathy or hatred for them when people start killing. for such stupidity here. Yes, you see a few characters, but they really only work with the main ones. Such as the husband's wife at the motel, whose room was canceled. We saw them so we could see how effective Lisa was and how ineffective the new hotel clerk was. We see a little girl simply because she will have a very small but important role in the later film, when everything will fall apart. The flight ends, because we have to move the story forward in particular. A particularly bad guy needs her at the beginning of the flight. The rude guy at the airport was also important for the movie. The only 2 characters that were only 5 liners useless for the story are two young boys on the plane. It was smart because I thought they had something to do with the plot. From the first scene to the last leads the figure of a woman, the young director of the hotel Lisa. Even when Jackson shows his true colors, he does not panic. He thinks what he can do to drag the time. Any other movie in which intelligent female managers behave like idiots. But not this one. It was a very short movie and I waited for the usual feature devices to appear, because the movie was fast approaching the end. Fortunately, none of them was used. The new hotel receptionist did not call and told her what to do, and the panic drops the phone and runs out of the hotel, saying nothing, or asks the boss and tells her that he needs to drink a lot and just release her. Was Craven should do more of these types of films. Also the last comment. Brian Cox is in the movie, but I had no idea who he was. I had to come here to see that he was Lisa's father. It is completely unrecognizable.
