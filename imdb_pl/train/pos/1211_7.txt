I grew up in this movie and I remember when my brother and I played in the yard and pretended we were in Care-a-lot. Now, after all these years, I can watch a movie with my daughter and watch how she enjoys it. If you are a parent and have not watched this movie with your children, then you should just keep them in your arms and watch them bewitched by bears and care! Songs, especially "Forever Young", are very sweet and unforgettable. Parents, I highly recommend this film to all children so that they can find out how pleasant care for others can be! When it comes to all the trash that's on TV, you can raise your children to have the right mind to live with movies like these.
