This movie was perfect - the emotional power of Tom Hulce and Ray Liotta's performances brought tears to my eyes and joy to heart - this movie shows us that there is still hope in the world. If this movie was released in late 1988, instead of Rain Man, the Hulce would certainly be nominated at least for an Oscar for Best Actor. Definitely a must see!
