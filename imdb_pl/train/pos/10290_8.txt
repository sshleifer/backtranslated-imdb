Bruce Almighty is the best Jim Carrey since The Truman Show and was a pleasant surprise after his recent "Hey Hollywood - look how good I can act!" Cash disappointments. It's great to see how Jim recognizes and accepts his strengths. He will not get an Oscar, but the film itself will last longer than many Academy Award-winning films. He is at the top of his form in this latest film - it's like the return of an old friend. <br /> <br /> Carrey, Freeman and Aniston do a great job together - comfortable in their comedic roles, great comic timing and of course good fun, but without the comedy "hey mom - look how funny I am". The real surprise was Steven Carrell as Carrell's n√©ezis (Carrell of the Daily Show), who left the best and funniest scenes in the movie. I've laughed more at Carell than anyone in the last three years. <br /> <br /> I can predict that religious nuts in the United States will have an advantage over the treatment of God, but the heart of the film is faithful to all major theological beliefs - we are a mass of protoplasms trying to break through our short lives, using our free will. Without marriage With children complain, it will probably become a target for people with wrong priorities (who know the types - men decorate gold watches on Sunday morning and late on TV, selling prayers to God). And again, around 0.5% of the country will be worried about it, and 80% of the media will report it. <br /> <br /> The bottom line: this is a purely entertaining movie, every member of the audience laughs, wondering what they will do and a good frame of mind at the end of the movie. A walk on the main streets of America must confirm that God has a great sense of humor. What a better comic genius Jim Carry reminds us of. <br /> <br /> Thank you again, Jim - WONDERFUL, have you back !!
