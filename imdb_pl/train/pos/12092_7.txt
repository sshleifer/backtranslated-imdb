I remember for the first time that I saw it in the 70s, when it was shown on television late at night. It scared the hell. But then I was a teenager in those days, not as tired of movies as me. <br /> <br /> CASTLE OF BLOOD (aka: DANSE MACABRE) is a great example of the Italian horror of the 1960s, along with BLACK SUNDAY Mario Bavy (1960), CURSE OF LIVING DEAD (aka: KILL BABY KILL) ( 1966) and Mario Caiano's NIGHTMARE CASTLE (1965). If you want a ghostly atmosphere and great writing, check them out too. I also rate them with those early Poe films that Roger Corman did in the same period. <br /> <br /> I saw the new Synapse DVD, which was taken from the French print and it is a huge improvement over the old pan -and-scan print that has been making rounds on TV for years. Adds a few minutes of dialogues (in French) that do not add much to the whole movie, but it's nice to see that it's complete, without cuts. Unfortunately, the DVD does not offer any additions outside the frames from the movie. <br /> <br /> One of the flaps I noticed was on the opening stage, seeing a man with smoke effects next to the camera on the entrance door of the inn. It seems to me that the editors did not catch it, or maybe they did not care, but it was something that I did not notice the first time. These are DVD wonders. You can see all flicks, errors and details that were not visible the first time. But it does not matter. <br /> <br /> But no matter, I still get 7 on the imdb meter <br /> <br />
