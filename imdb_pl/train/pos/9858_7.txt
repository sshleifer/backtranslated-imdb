I would not go so far as to recommend this film, because the only problems I have with it arise from excessive exposure to the role models used in the movie - what seems to be common to every movie for children. It does not make it bad, it's just not something that I will go far. <br /> <br /> This is a bit of saccharine, so I can say that for the most part anyone looking for something more can be a disappointed movie for children like this one. <br /> <br /> However, all this comes out of the window when the squirrel (the one in all the trailers) appears on the screen. His time is limited, but it seems obvious that the decision makers had the wisdom to tell these people "hey, could you stick to a little squirrel?" Every time it gets unbearable. It does not save the movie, but you can leave the saying: "at least there was one aspect where I could not stop laughing." <br /> <br /> And of course, visually it will not disappoint, but it's almost from the Pixar cinema. Of all my stuff, I'd put it downstairs ... but it's not bad.
