I love this film "Spring and port wine". I was born in Leigh, a town about 7 miles from Bolton, I moved to Bolton in 1965, When I was 20 years old. My job was every day through Little Lever through Farnworth, sometimes on a bike, then a car, when I could afford a movie that brings back memories of working class neighbors who were almost always broke, but who could always help if they could. Fred Dibnah was around the corner from Bromwich St. If you have not seen the movie after the first release, you can forgive him the comparison for soap, such as Coronation St, I agree it was soap, but then it was called "Kitchen Sink Drama!" Watch this movie for a talented cast who soon became a home name from frequent roles on television. I mainly watch photos of the area and well-being of poor, but happy people!
