EA has shown us that they can create a classic 007 agent and make you feel in the world of the '60s. The graphics of the game are unique and the recording of the voice is very professional. I got this game in April 2007 (Two years after the release) and I'm still impressed with the game. It is a pity that EA will no longer create games 007. <br /> <br /> I give this game 10/10 levels that it contains, especially the level of "consulate". I recommend this game to all who are 13 years old. The only thing I did not like about the game was the level of the boat in Russia, it was too much pressure. Overall, I like the game A LOT !!
