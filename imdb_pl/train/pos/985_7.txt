This film in many respects reminds the "Enemy of the State" with Will Smith and Gene Hackman because we have an "innocent (black) man chased by the" government "using all modern technologies known to man. Usually, when the plot is copied in this way, the result is a catastrophe. This does not apply here. Of course, I love everything that David Morse does, so maybe my comments are not honest, but then there were more good things in this movie. The main test, played by Doug Hutchison, was brilliant, and the story was filled with excellent additions, such as David Paymer and Robert Pastorelli. Our hero, Alvin Sanders (played by Jamie Foxx), was however annoying. He is so out of place, breaking bad jokes, not arousing sympathy among the audience. Or at the beginning of the strange thing that he is growing on you (and on his followers!). I did not expect much when I rented it, but I was surprised by the good action movie with comedic pieces. 7/10
