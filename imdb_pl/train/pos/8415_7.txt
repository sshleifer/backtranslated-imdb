If "Caligari's office" is the father of all horrors (and German expressionist cinema), this film from before World War I is a grandfather. A titular student, hungry in an empty attic, made a deal with the Devil - the Devil gives him a bottomless sack of gold in exchange for "everything in this room". The devil chooses the reflection of the student in his mirror. He walks away from the double pupil who commits the crimes for which the student was blamed. <br /> <br /> The film is burdened with certain limitations resulting from the technically primitive state of the film from 1913; the plot requires the effects of chiaroschuro, but the film is necessarily shot in shadowless daylight. But the scene in which reflection comes from the mirror still has much to offer. <br /> <br /> More interesting for the trends she likes than for herself, the Prague Student is still worth the effort.
