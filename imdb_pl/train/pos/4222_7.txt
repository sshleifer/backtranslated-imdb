I really like this episode, Ruth Gordon is good, if not small, as always. As has been said, the music is very good and has a mood that does not exist in all episodes. <br /> <br /> But there is one main storyline, so wide that you can drive a fleet of trucks through it. It has been established that light does not work in the vault. Do not you think that a very intelligent Columbo or the rest of the police would think about checking if a light bulb works? One would think that in a short order they would unscrew the bulb and find a note. It is true that it is a TV fiction, and various holes will always appear, but it seems too glaring. <br /> <br /> It really does not make Columbo a hidden genius when the light does not work, but the testimony of "deathbed" is unjustified, apparently for many days.
