This is one of those exceptional horror movies that require a much more mature understanding of the word "horror" to be appreciated. The most important thing is that people do not realize that this story is told from the point of view of a small boy and, like most younger children, is easily afraid. Mainly because he just does not understand things, like why his father almost never has him. Watching a movie, you can see how a husband argues with his wife about the balance between work time and family time and it's easy to understand, but the boy does not. One can also imagine that the boy is afraid of the forest, as it is already said in the film that the family comes from the city. In addition, at the beginning, when the family travels home, they hit a deer, and then they are stopped, and then they argue with the locals, and this boy certainly did not consider this introduction as pleasant. <br /> <br /> "Wendigo" is ultimately what creates his young, innocent mind to explain everything. There is an American-Indian legend, but looking at the scene in which a young boy hears about it, he explains it simply and simply. Not because that's what Wendigo is, but because he understands that. When you look at a movie from this point of view, you can really start to appreciate it. Of course, it was a low-budget and cheap budget, but the assembly jumps, the use of light and general eeriness are more than just catching up. And the last question asked by the movie is: is it all in your head, is it really there? 8/10 <br /> <br /> Rated R: profanity, violence and sex scene
