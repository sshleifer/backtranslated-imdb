While prices have risen significantly, and some details have become obsolete, every homeowner who has problems with owning a home should get a lot of chuckles from the movie. I know yes. <br /> <br /> Mr. Blandings, director of Advertising in New York, decides to move his family to the suburbs of Connecticut and build a nice home there. He falls into one funny jam in turn, from mortgages to lawsuits and construction difficulties, because the costs and schedule of construction are constantly growing out of control. I thought that the funniest scenes are the place where Blandings hires a contractor to dig a well for water. They dig hundreds of feet but never find water. However, only a few days later, a few days later, the basement of his house will be flooded! <br /> <br /> Cary Grant and Myrna Loy give credible performances when the harassed Blandings couple are overwhelmed by problems they have never imagined, and Melvyn Douglas is even better as a lawyer and friend of the Blanding family. <br /> <br /> The only caveat is that social attitudes have changed very much since 1948. Mrs. Blandings is portrayed as a bit of a na√Øve jocular who has no idea how much extra trouble it causes, and there is a black maid (horrors!). So do not watch this movie through the 2003 social lens, and you'll enjoy it even more. <br /> <br />
