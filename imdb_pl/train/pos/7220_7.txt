Nothing is more pleasant to me than a story about someone who does not believe how everything ends. And this is what happens in DEATHTRAP, based on the chilling art of Ira Levin ("Rosemary's Baby"). <br /> <br /> And in this MICHAEL CAINE and CHRISTOPHER REEVE are doing something like Caine and Laurence Olivier took off in SLEUTH - with almost as much skill and puzzles that ever existed in this extremely clever game. <br /> <br /> But because it has to scare you, surprise you and guess about the result, it's hard to write a review about the story. Let's say that what we know at the beginning is all you need to know about the movie at the moment. MICHAEL CAINE is a wildly jealous playwright whose last play has failed. When a young aspiring writer, CHRISTOPHER REEVE, sends him a manuscript of his art, Caine realizes that giving him as his own will solve all his problems and regain his reputation. <br /> <br /> From this point on, it's a matter of fun and games for the audience, when Iry Levin's story unfolds, he manages to beat Agatha Christie for the number of twists and turns. <br /> <br /> Caine and Reeve play great, each brings a dynamic tension to the story, as well as humorous accents that come from a script that combines humor and humor. <br /> <br /> In summary: It's worth seeing - but not everyone is happy with the ending.
