People are too heavy in the film. Sometimes we should just sit back and enjoy the story without trying to "look through" it. <br /> <br /> The whole thing happens when Hackman decides not to press the trigger, but his goal is still falling. Then the fun begins when everyone around him "descend". <br /> <br /> Just think that JFK and all the people were in any way associated with his assassination, whose life ended suddenly and in dubious ways, and you'll appreciate what this movie suggests. <br /> <br /> I think it's a perfect interpretation of what could have happened. Although this exact story was not followed (after the fact after reading Jim Maars "Crossfire"), but what he suggests is interesting. <br /> <br /> I would like to get a copy of this to see it again. In light of what is known today, the Domino principle is in place.
