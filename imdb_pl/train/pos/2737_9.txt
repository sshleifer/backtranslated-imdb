The film was catchy from beginning to end, and its black and white photograph of an American heart is stunning. We feel that we are with them when they pass through the great country of heaven, and then to Mexico and again to America. At the end of the film, the rain reflection on Robert Blake resembles small rivers of sweat and tears running down his face. In the end, we follow them up the stairs to their last moment. <br /> <br /> Two criminals performed by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson as Perry Smith and Dick Hickock were seen on every street in every city. Hickock is a smiling boy from the neighborhood and Smith, a guy with stars in the eyes from the wrong side of the city. This point appears in the movie and it always surprises us that criminals do not differ in appearance from anyone else. Evil, even the most evil, is part of the human condition. These two delusions kill the whole family looking for a safe that is not there. Once on the run they start to write bad checks, drawing a trail for the authorities. <br /> <br /> There are many great supporting actors. I like John Forsyth as a detective in the case, Alvin Dewey. What's more, Will Geer shines in a short but excellent scene as a prosecutor. <br /> <br /> I often wanted to see this movie all the time, I just caught it in short clips; In the end, I got it after buying a DVD. The result is the best classic crime film I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this amazing movie. For me, this is just great film production.
