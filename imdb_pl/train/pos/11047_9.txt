I waited several years before this movie was finally released in England, but in many respects he was very pleased when I finally saw him. The film contains many great things, acting first. This is not something I need in a horror movie, but the people in this movie did a great job. This and constantly suspenseful and interesting script, with pleasant, Lovecraft character, give the film a real solid backbone. Add to this the surrealistic images of the nightmare and the occasional gruesome gore and movies of the winners. He also has my favorite kind of gore, supernatural and splattery. In addition, Marcus' characters, an angry transsexual bodybuilder and Daisy, his mentally retarded lover / plaything are sometimes bizarre and annoying, and give away, everything goes hand in hand with morbidly growing madness that works well with frequent Freudian overtones. This is one of the most impressive of the latest horror movies, much more shocking or more than anything Hollywood can produce. My only caveat was that I wanted the ending to be darker, but it still works, so I generally recommend it to serious horror lovers.
