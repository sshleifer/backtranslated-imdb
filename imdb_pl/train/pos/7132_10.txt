Warming film. The usual great actor John Thaw, who has recently passed. A man who has always been so modest. He was one of the top 10 actors of Englands certainly in my time. <br /> <br /> You can remember him for the famous role of Morse's inspector. As Jack Regan in the hit TV series of the 1970's Sweeney and as an attorney at Kavanah QC. Be sure to see the whole family and a great DVD for my collection. Pictures will bring a few memories to people who remember the British war and for sure those who were evacuated from London to escape the German bombardments. Interaction between the two main characters. Tom and boy William were really well-behaved and faithful to Michelle Magorian's book.
