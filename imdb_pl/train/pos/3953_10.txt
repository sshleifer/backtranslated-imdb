I saw this movie on TV when it appeared and I never saw it. Throughout my life I did not remember the title and just stumbled across it, checking Roy Thinne's film credits. An excellent, dark and terrifying television horror in the same class as "Crowhaven Farm"; "Do not be afraid of the dark"; and "School of Satan for girls", all lost satanic classics. I also think it has many similarities to Clint Eastwood's classics, "High Plains Drifter". Why will not they spend these great little movies, especially if we take into account all the latest trash that fill in the discounts for DVDs at Wal-Mart? Most of these films have a cult, so sales should not be a problem.
