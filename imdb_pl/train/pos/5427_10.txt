Three British sergeants stationed in India are sent to stop a tribe of murderers known as bandits. One of the sergeants, Cutter, runs away from the camp in search of a golden temple and is captured by the Thugge led by the sinister Guru. Gunga Din, the water boy of the regiment, returns to the camp for help, and the other two sergeants follow him, but are also captured. Now the major sends full information after three, but does not realize that they enter the trap set by Thugees. However, Gunga Din saves the day. A perfectly made buddy movie, although today it is politically incorrect. Grant, McLaglen and Fairbanks give very humorous and exciting appearances with Jaffe very well in the title role, and Cianelli very sinister as Guru. Rating - 10 out of 10.
