Blackadder 3 is probably the Blackadder series, which people have least heard of - it has basically the same rules as the second and fourth and there is nothing revolutionary about it. But it's still great - the fiery Duke of Wellington and the fat stupid Dr. Johnson (first dictionary writer in England) make this series count. In this series there are even more fun single-minded ones that bring humor to the lesser-known era - in historically accurate and enjoyable episodes. Blackadder's third appearance is not the best known and well known, but the role of Rowan Atkinson as a butler for a stupid prince is fun and effective, and Hugh Laurie is the best in this series. Very good! 9/10
