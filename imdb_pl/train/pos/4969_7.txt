It's great to see that Shane Meadows already has an international influence - LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDANT shares many topics from ROOM FOR ROMEO BRASS: unclear class identity over work, but far below the middle, clumsy father, abandoned urban environment, sense of adulthood of failure, barely hidden fascism lying at the basis of modern urban life. <br /> <br /> But if Meadows is a well-known formalist, Mariage trades in images, and his coolly composed, perfectly surrealistic, monochromatic frames serve to distance dirty and rather bleak subject matter, which, Meadows-like, turns from high farce to tragedy in a few seconds. <br /> <br /> They are long-lived and clich√©s, but Poelvoorde is insanely crazy, an ordinary man with ordinary ambitions whose attempts to realize this are dangerous; while individual sets - popcorn / pidgeon explosions; the best sequence of marriage from DEAD and DEAD - it manages to wrest the revelation from despair.
