The film begins with Bill Coles (Melvyn Douglas) telling the story of how his best friend - makes the customer - Jim Blandings (Cary Grant) and his family are packed tightly in a small apartment in New York, with insufficient storage space and too few bathrooms. When Jim's wife, Muriel (Myrna Loy), wants to renovate the apartment, she advertises Jim, who falls in love with the advertising of the house. When he buys a house, bills and frustration keep growing, because everything that goes wrong with building Jim's "dream house" goes wrong. <br /> <br /> One of Granta's and Loya's three collaborations, this is a cute little comedy - not very susceptible, without great news, but a great way to spend an hour or two. Laughter is from the beginning, when the alarm goes off, and Jim tries to turn it off to be foiled at every step by Muriel. The time and delivery of comedy lines and situations can only be given by a few experienced professionals, which Grant and Loy give us: polished performances, simple chemistry and a lot of fun. Myrna Loy is in a thankless role (it is obvious that Grant's character, Jim, has the lion's share of line and acting, and Grant, as usual, pulls off with an extraordinary calm), but gives Muriel a color, life and a bite that only Myrna Loy can give character. Melvyn Douglas also plays in merry amusement to perfection, never hitting one bad note. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite scenes must be when Bill is shut down in the "warehouse" and Jim goes "save" him ... just to imprison everyone! Every little problem that arises in the Blandings renovation project - including petty jealousy and the "Wham" advertising campaign - seems to focus everything that * can go wrong in building a new home, but it makes it credible and enjoyable. . 8/10
