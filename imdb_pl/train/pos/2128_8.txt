I just watched it in Turner's classic films last night, for the first time in history, and I loved it. I like many older movies, especially due to the lack of all dirty language and excessive violence, nudity and sex in most of today's films. I also think that they were much better in many (but not all) cases. Jimmy Stewart is my favorite favorite. I thought watching this movie was great fun and I loved it. If you think the same about older movies, I do not think you can make any mistakes with it. I believe that "You Got Got Mail" is a remake (though a slightly different and very pleasant movie) of this film. For a relaxing movie evening, you do not have to be ashamed if your kids or someone comes in to watch, get it or catch it on one of the classic movie channels.
