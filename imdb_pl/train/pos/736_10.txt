It must be any punk rocker, it is a film that made The Ramones famous in the early 80's (when it first appeared on premium cable stations). It was one of the first and best American Punk Rock movies, about the iconic classic status of The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Initially, the producers wanted Cheap Trick to be a star, but the release of the album "Live At Budakon" has just made them stars and too hot to find a low-budget movie. Good luck for the Ramones, who wanted to break out of the underground world of punk rock and enter the main market (which unfortunately never happened until the death of bands). The band, especially Dee Dee, has always disliked the movie in the 1980s, but the fans have always loved and could recite most of the film while waiting for Ramones performances. This film, like most classics, is a stupid play with classic Ramones material in times of magnificence. Do not wait anymore, you will not find. It's great fun, so enjoy yourself. Another classic movie by Allan Arkush in a similar style is Get Crazy, which features Lee Ving from the legendary hardcore punk band Fear.
