IVAN (Marco Ricca) and GILBERTO (Alexandre Borges) are partners in the company along with ESTEVÃO (George Freire), but the first ones are commissioned by a professional assassin, ANISIO, murdering ESTEVÃO (plot, at least at the beginning, do not explain why). The guy does this and after receiving the money, he begins to blackmail two partners, appearing in their company and saying that he wants to work there (as a supervisor or something ??). At the same time he meets MARINA (Marian Ximenes), daughter ESTEVÃO, and starts dating her! <br /> <br /> In a story where crime, corruption, betrayal and blackmail go hand in hand, no one is innocent or a victim, the exception is MARINA, who is the only person who does not know what happens and I did not cheat on anyone? <br /> <br /> This film depicts with sarcasm a sad and cruel reality that exists in a large metropolis like São Paulo, where crime is the presence of every day. We can feel the irony, but also the authenticity of characters such as ANISIO (brilliantly played by Paulo Miklos), which blackmailing the guys who paid him unscrupulous, and even flirting with the daughter of the guy he killed! He really must be a monster to do something like that, but of course I know there are people like him in Brazil or anywhere else? <br /> <br /> Is this a very good movie, cruel but true, about a sad reality? Acting is great and the soundtrack too.
