This movie was just absolutely brilliant. Actually, I was thinking. During the whole movie I was confused as hell. I loved everything about it ... it was so confusing and so twisted and weird that it was hard not to love it. All the actors were phenomenal and no one could do a better job ... It's one of my favorites this year ... it deserves attention.
