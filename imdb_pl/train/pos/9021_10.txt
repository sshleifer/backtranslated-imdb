me and my two sisters watched all three Tenko series and we agree that this is definitely one of the better BBC series. The whole cast was very convincing in the parts they presented, and although the third series was a bit slower, it was a convincing watching, and my evenings will not admit it without it. There is no doubt that we will be watching it again because it is a series that I will never have enough of watching. Excellent viewing and full marks for the BBC for such a brilliant series and casting. and I would recommend this series to everyone, although some age limits have to be taken into account because of some adult material. So grateful BBC for the release of this series on DVD and video.
