Taken just ten years after the actual events and set in a bunker under the Reichstag, Pabst's film is fully thrilling. It reeks of sulfur that awaits the perpetrators of the World War. I have not seen this for over three decades, but it remains strong in my visual and emotional memory. Characters seem to wait for walling in their cave. Recalling the dialogue between the two generals: "Does God exist?" "If he did, we would not do it." It is a pity that it is not more readily available for exhibition or purchase, because it would be interesting to see and compare this movie with a documentary about Traudl Junge, "Im Toten Winkel" {alias "Blind Spot: Hitler's Secretary") and "Downfall" with Bruno Ganz.
