This story was probably one of the most powerful I've ever made. John Singleton must have gone beyond the scope of this educational masterpiece. Great performances of the cast, but Epps and Rapaport found themselves in the best and most convincing career of a young star. <br /> <br /> However, as a student, many of the problems that Singleton has raised have been taken to extremes. In a sense, despite the fact that these are problems on many university campuses, they are not presented as widely as outside, because this movie will make someone believe. In some cases, it seemed almost ridiculous to think that something like this could happen. However, apart from the fact that it was a bit overly dramatic, the film was brilliant and left me stunned, unable to talk, just think. One of the things that I will remember forever was a quotation from Lawrence Fishburn: "Knowledge is power, you can not see your power without knowledge." Brilliant, simply brilliant.
