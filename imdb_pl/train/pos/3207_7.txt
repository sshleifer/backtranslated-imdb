Of course, according to the normal standard of film criticism, Soldier is really a very poor film. Kurt Russell is a futuristic super soldier brought up from birth to kill, but then he became obsolete after being repaired by a group of really great soldiers in a crazy rim that looks a bit like a Gladiator without a mat. /> Abandoned on the planet trash, befriends the community of hippies from space who teach him gardening, family life and breast. Kurt does not say much. In the end, really great soldiers appear and kill hippies, shooting them in the back when they run away. Kurt is angry and kills everyone. The planet is summed up. End. <br /> <br /> Unless the Academy starts a new category for "The Best Explosion", the Soldier will not win any prizes. However, however absurd it is, it remains a pleasant experience. Military equipment is the coolest thing from Alien times (especially APC), and after 90 minutes it does not exceed its welcome. Remember that the following sign is only a guide. Release five points if you intend to take them seriously and minimize them if you do not like miniguns. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
