I'm extremely picky about the movies I see. I heard about Moon Child completely by accident. For some time I have been a fan of L'Arc En Ciel, and recently a fan of Gackt and Mizer. <br /> <br /> I finally found out that the movie was re-released and I picked it up without a second thought. <br /> <br /> Being as critical as I am about movies, I admit that the action scenes can sometimes be hokey ... but they are also supposed to be, as another user suggested, the quintessence of calm before the storm, quoting Gary Oldman from Leona ... without getting into the spoilers, the movie hit me extremely hard because you realize that the boundaries of friendship are limitless and as they often say, true friendship is loyalty and like marriage, until death is parted. <br /> <br /> Hyde and Gackt give performances that show why they are able to dedicate such depth to their song lyrics, their passion for music happens on the big screen and creates an exemplary film that reaches the soul and evokes emotional reactions. <br /> <br /> After watching the movie for the first time I realized that it will probably remain in high rotation when it comes to my collection. I want to encourage anyone who reads this post to pick up a movie, if you want to get away from the current Hollywood trend ... it requires a completely new direction using the classic Yakuza movie elements and how you can go wrong with the episode of Ryo Ishibashi from "Audition" Takashi Miike and the celebrity "Suicide Club" <br /> <br /> Man ... I can not say enough about this film, but I will stay here. <br /> <br /> 10/10
