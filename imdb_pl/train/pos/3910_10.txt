So I'm at home, one evening I look over the canals and meet this man in heels and make-up, standing in front of a colorful background on HBO. Naturally, I made a double attempt and decided that I would watch for a moment. I did not change the channel until it was finished, it was very funny. The next time I turned on, I made sure that I recorded it on tape to be able to watch it over and over, and it remained one of my favorite things to watch. In the first few minutes you can say that the audience is not sure what to think, but quickly gains them amazing humor and wit. While many standing comedians connect in my brain, Eddie Izzard stands out as one of the best. His style is incredibly refreshing and it's nice to hear jokes about history and adolescence when most comics stick to current events. His performance stayed with me later. In the summer I went to Italy, and when I was there, I could only think about how "Italians are always on a scooter" CIAO ... "10 out of 10. See. You will not regret.
