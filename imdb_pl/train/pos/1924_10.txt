This program was great, not only for children who initially thought it was for the whole family. <br /> <br /> The first season concerned mainly the father caring for two daughters and his son, he unfortunately died in season 2, I could believe it when I heard it. <br /> <br /> I am dressed in that they continued the performance because what really happened in my life and I have to mention the episode "Goodbye" was so well done that it's so hard to film them, you can say that these were real tears in their eyes. I am a 24-year-old man and this episode forced me to cry because I know how they felt when my father died when I was 13, just like Roy. <br /> <br /> Season 2 and Season 3 had a great comedy there as season 3 also had some of my favorite such bizarre Fridays, Secrets. <br /> <br /> I still think that the show was strong enough to continue, I was disappointed that it ended, it was one of the best, it was not the best family comedy show since Home Improvement and it could be another Friends . <br /> <br /> it should never have ended, but you still love watching replays every day.
