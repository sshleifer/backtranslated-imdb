After watching this small and comic movie you will feel better. Cheer on Yves B. Pelletier, that this small, wonderful movie moment was born, which in my opinion will be considered a significant film of 2004 for Quebec. Actors Isabelle Blais, Emmanuel Bilodeau, Sylvie Moreau and Stéphane Gagnon bring a moving performance. I would compare the impression that this wonderful story gives you what Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain gave me. So if you like the great movie of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, I would say that you should also like the first movie from Yves B. Pelletier, Les Aimants
