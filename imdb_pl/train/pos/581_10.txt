A River Runs Through It is one of those movies that deserve to be seen in the theater so that you can really appreciate the majesty of its cinematography. Acting is wonderful and understated, with every gesture, smile and a bow that makes sense. Brad Pitt gives a brilliant performance, and Tom Skerrit is powerful as a preacher's father. The film moves like a river, you have to be willing to follow it through low tides and low tides, but it's worth it.
