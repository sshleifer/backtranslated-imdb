Dan Katzir has produced a great movie that takes us on a roller coaster ride through a real romance set in the troubles of modern Israel. <br /> <br /> For anyone who has ever been in love, the movie restores uncertainty, uncertainty and heartache that makes love so bittersweet. The atmosphere of fear and isolation, which appeared in difficult times in Israel at that time, serves only to strengthen this feeling. You are immediately attracted to the difficult situation of Dan and you can not help but be deeply moved. <br /> <br /> You can not write drama and passion in this way - the contrast between the realities of desperate Dan, the relationship with Iris, and the realities of the reigning state in a state of confusion make him extremely attentive. If you have a bit of passion and fall in love, see this movie.
