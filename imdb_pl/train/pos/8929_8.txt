First of all, I really liked the central idea of ​​locating "intruders", Others in the fragile Self, on different levels - mainly the subconscious, but sometimes more allegorically. In fact, intruders are ubiquitous throughout the film: on the Swiss-French border, where the pre-warrior leads a secluded life; in his recurring dream and nightmare; in his ailing body after heart transplant ... In the last half of the movie, he becomes an intruder himself, returning to the ancient French colony in the hope of redeeming the past. <br /> <br /> The general tone is rather bitter than pathetic, full of regret and guilt, the feeling of failure is more or less dominant. This is a rather gloomy picture of old age, allegedly self-sufficient, but hopelessly unimportant and lonely inside. Directer composes images more to convey the passing feelings of anxiety and desire than any explicit meanings. Some of them are hypnotic, but not devoid of humor, a kind of absurd game that you can imagine.
