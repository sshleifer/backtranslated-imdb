This film is a small ray of sunshine in the dark season. He celebrates quality best described as ordinary old age. Morgan Freeman plays a character very similar to Freeman - a successful pushing actor 70. He traveled to a small, dirty grocery store that intends to explore the part he could play as the manager of such a place. Soon, he charms employees and clients, especially the charming, spoiled young woman (Paz Vega), who chairs the "10 or less" cash register. <br /> <br /> 10 items or less do not have a big statement and do not pretend like that. He follows Freeman and Vega when they become friendly, and when an older man offers his advice, in exchange for a ride home - a gofer from a film company who is supposed to pick it up, never shows, and Freeman forgot his phone number, so he can not call for help. I had a small case of blues on a gray Sunday afternoon in New York and this movie cured what hurt me.
