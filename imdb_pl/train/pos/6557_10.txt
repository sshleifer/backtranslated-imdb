I am a 53 year old college professor. I went with my wife and 12-year-old daughter. We all liked the movie. The film is original, witty, fast and completely charming. The plot was easy for a 10-year-old to imitate, but curvy enough to interest an adult. I thought Emma Roberts did a great job and the rest of the cast was fine. My only criticism is that the sets in Los Angeles were not as interesting as they should be. They were functional, but nothing stood out. On the other hand, makeup, costume, lighting, photos, editing and directing were excellent. All in all I thought it was a completely pleasant experience. I am disappointed that professional critics (almost all grown-up men) brutally attacked the film. Apparently they have something against movies that depict strong, intelligent and independent young women. Their writings reveal more about their sexist nature than about this wonderful family movie. I highly recommend every child and every parent.
