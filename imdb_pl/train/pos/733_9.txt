How can you go wrong with the amazing Ramones? What a crime that two of them are already dead. It reminds me of Dennis Leary's wit about the great musicians who die in kitchen fires, while the useless ones live forever. I paraphrase here, but you have an idea. <br /> <br /> ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL tells the story of a group of civic children fighting against the oppressive administration of high school. These are very stupid things, but there is optimism about it being refreshing (even if they resort to blowing up the building). Who knew that it would become a concern for students around the world? ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL is a time capsule from an era in which people still believed that music matters and that it can change society. She is full of children who know that the authorities do not have the right answers. Rather, rock and roll is the only thing they can trust. <br /> <br /> But most importantly, this is pure exploitation. <br /> <br /> Do not take it seriously. Just go in and have fun. If it was not what it was in the seventies, it should be.
