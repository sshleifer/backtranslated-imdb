I was quite surprised by this move. Although their builders apparently still lacked, you must be impressed that this film took 7 years and was still good. Acting was impressive, and history really captivated me. My only complaint would be that the ending was really too violent for my taste. But hey, if your audience does not want more, this movie has succeeded. <br /> <br /> I really recommend everyone to Hollywood to check Antonella Ríos, who is a great Spanish talent (something difficult to find now with all the bad news about acting). Antonella Ríos is really a star.
