One of the directors Miike Takashi is the best. It is so good that it is difficult to express it in words. Almost fifteen years older than the target group, he delighted me from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> It resembles similar films for children from the 80s in the sense that (unlike today's) these films were not afraid - there are many unpleasant details that I found at first was jarring, but soon I realized it's no different from what I grew up with. The film is a compilation of conventions for children's films from the 80's. You call it, there is: a young boy's hero pushed from his own unhappy / dysfunctional world into another, inhabited by mythical and mystical goblins; striving to save both worlds from evil forces; a beautiful heroine in which she has a crush; sadistic henchman (Go-Go Yubari with Kill Bill volume 1); the main villain who draws his evil power from something that everyone in the world can relate to. But all these conventions of the genre acquire a fresh character and additional depth. <br /> <br /> One of the IMDb reviews starts. "Where was the movie when I was a kid?" and this is the sentiment I agree with all my heart. Even when watching him, I regretted that I did not grow up; that it was not part of my childhood, like the Labyrinth, the Masters of the Universe and, to a much lesser extent, The Endless History. These movies and others, such as The Goonies, are mentioned, but never copied - Miike constantly offers us a new look at things. <br /> <br /> Poor CGI is the basis of many of his films, sometimes because of budget constraints, but only as often the artistic choice - the willingness to portray things in a weird way. Here, CGI is usually medium, just because of budget constraints, but still does a fantastic job. CG effects combine with traditional dolls, animatronics and really unusual makeup to create a world full of rich characters (and make-up) that often borders on the visionary. <br /> <br /> This is one of the biggest children's films ever made. Not for younger and more sensitive children. <br /> <br /> Just wonderfully wonderful. Convince yourself of this and if you think that your children can deal with it / appreciate it, show it to them. Let them grow up during the Great Yokai War as a small compensation for not being able to.
