Thats My Bush is, above all, a very funny program of Parker and Stone, I thought. It is often very fun and quite subversive and crazy. Fans of South Park will definitely get something here. <br /> <br /> Another surprise here is the value of production. You had to put in a lot of money and it shows. A lot of expensive small details. This is not a small show. And Comedy Central is not an extremely rich channel, but of course they put a lot into this program. In a sense, I understand that death was also too expensive. Certainly it could have been cheaper and there was no will. <br /> <br /> The critics liked it and had a small group of fans, but they failed to win a large audience. As we know, the series stopped after 8 episodes, which is probably almost 1 season. <br /> <br /> Because I really enjoyed the show, it has its drawbacks. The problem with the performance is that he does not know what he really wants to be. It seems that he is trying to be a sitcom and a parody of sitcom at the same time. Actors do a good job, and some of them are well-manned, but I think they do not always get 100% of the bizarre humor they're going to present. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think that the show needed a few characters that were more mundane to make the program work. In South Park, you have Kyle and Stan, which are somewhat realistic in a crazier world. I think that's what makes South Park work. You need smart characters that you can relate to in a realistic way, and that makes crazy things a lot more interesting because they make you seriously take them at a certain level. If everything is archetypes and stereotypes, it is difficult to integrate it emotionally into the series, which is really my Bush's biggest problem. Kyle and Stan are characters from South Park that give meaning to the madness in the show. We do not have anything like this here, and this program suffers because of it. <br /> <br /> Another checkpoint is Parker and Stones flirting with the Republicans. It's the only thing in them that I do not really understand what they are trying to do. Not presenting Bush as anything but stupid Homer Simpsons, the sympathetic character is a subversive character in a world where many people can not stand it and think that he is the worst president from Nixon, and the parallel comedy world, so only his satire is every move. .. but it is difficult to understand if Parker and Stone really mean something. It's as if the joke was on us, but somehow did not hit the nail on the head. It seems awkward because it does not remind you of the real Bush at all. <br /> <br /> Besides, I thought that the program was very pleasant. Some jokes are fun here. The pro-life supporter who survived the aborted fetus is probably one of my favorite jokes in each program. And the program is full of great materials and sometimes it is extremely funny if you use your head a little while watching it.
