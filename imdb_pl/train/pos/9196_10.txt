Kimi wa petto is a lovely story about a girl who one day finds a boy in a box that one day is outside her apartment. He decides to introduce it and fix its cutting. Then he leaves him a note to eat something she did, and then return home, because she had to go to work. When he returns home, he states that he is still there. He tells her that he wants to live there with her like a brother or cousin. Desperate to send him back, he tells him that if he becomes her favorite, he can stay. And as a pet, he says he will not have rights and will do everything he tells him. (not so perverted!) To her surprise she agrees and since then she's known as Momo, her pet.
