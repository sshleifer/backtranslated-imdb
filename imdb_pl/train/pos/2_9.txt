Bromwell High is nothing short of brilliant. This burning parody of students and teachers at the Public School in South London leaves you literally chattering with laughter. It's vulgar, provocative, witty and sharp. Characters are an extremely caricatural cross-section of British society (and more specifically of every society). Following the escapades of Keisha, Latrina and Natelli, our three "heroes" for lack of a better definition, the series does not avoid the parody of every imaginable topic. Political correctness flies through the window in each episode. If you like performances that are not afraid to joke about every possible taboo topic, Bromwell High will not let you down!
