I have never commented on a movie before. I watched this movie with my girlfriend last night. I have read the comments that this movie stays with you. It does. Almost 24 hours have passed and I am still completely affected. This movie left me a question about myself. How can I compare to a character like Ben who is totally unselfish. I loved this movie. I love movies that guess and think to the end. I feel, above all, two emotions: happiness and sadness. Amazing, good movie and very sad. I wanted so badly that Ben and Emily would be together, but in the end they were forever. If you have not seen this movie, download it and watch it. Just make sure you do not have any entertainment. You will want to see every nuance in this photo. One for my library.
