I love this movie, but the music at all graduate meetings is simply stupid. <br /> <br /> This awful game took place in 1972. This means that the heroes graduated in 1972. dances etc. come from the 1950s and very early 1960s. <br /> <br /> After finishing the thirtieth high school meeting I can assure you that the last music to play at the congress or dance of the former high school is the music of their parents . <br /> <br /> I understand the difficulty of finding the right music from the '70s - we all know what time it was. But it was not completely deprived, and film producers should have been more caring. I found these dance scenes very shocking to my otherwise willing suspension of disbelief in the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> It was a bad decision of the director and / or producer.
