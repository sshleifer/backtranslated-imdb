Personal rules of taste when it comes to talking about movies like this precious little gem. Already in the eighties, in the early eighties, I discovered this movie, like many "Bad Patents" released at that time, and even "King Frat", tempting and teased pieces of art and stains on the back of the covers. <br /> <br /> Of course, you have such a age, films that I have already mentioned, and such things as "Screws" and many others that captured the imagination and fortunately many years later I still remember some of the fondness and some with contempt for many films that help me maintain my love for such species as parodies or pastes. <br /> <br /> Made many years after the great success of the "Animal House" and saw it fall For years I know that there would be no way that this film would overshadow the money, mentioned earlier, or remain in the memory, similar like in National Lampoon's Vacation. <br /> <br /> To be honest, not everything that brought the National Lampoon Logo, however, was a wild success. The RÃ©union class remains one of my favorite movies with instant characters, such as Bob Spinnaker played to perfection by Gerrit Graham , so good at Charles Terr's "Terrorvision," still remaining in the former glory of his youth. Or like Stephen Furst's insolent and touchy step, like lazy drunk sex at school, lazy Hubert Downs. <br /> <br /> Sweet like. What makes me wonder. As I mentioned, personal taste can not stand. People can be so cruel, so they will never win any prizes or be compared to similar peers in the world of comedy. It has some advantages. Being one of the earlier scenarios written by John Hughes, who will later do one of my favorite works of "Weird Science", and will also have a wonderful thematic title sung by the great Gary US Bonds. <br /> <br /> What more can I say is a movie that is waiting to be rediscovered again and again.
