A beautiful film, deeply touching the simple but divine aspects of humanity. <br /> <br /> This movie was almost perfect, and seeing that nothing in this world can be really perfect, it's pretty good. The only minor thing I objectively object to is stimulation at some points in the middle of the story. Acting is also very good, and all actors easily occupy leading positions in well-known films. Proper direction seems to be well thought out, and the script must have been amazing. There are a few really breathtaking moments of announcements and quite a wonderful continuation of the round composition of the story. <br /> <br /> The moment in the movie, when the protagonist achieves that the feeling of being in heaven is the perfect ending really brilliant yarn.
