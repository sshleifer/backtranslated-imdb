If you have not seen this little-known wizard, you should find him. This is the story of the inept war Sad Sack (Fred MacMurray) who is exchanged for a 4-F whenever he tries to join any branch of the army. He finds a magical lamp, which of course contains a genie (Gene Sheldon), but the genie is even more clumsy than MacMurray, sending it in time to serve in all the wrong times and places than it wants. It's sweet, cheerful and fluff, and you can not help but you like it. The plot resembles a Disney movie, especially since both stars (MacMurray and Sheldon) have made many Disney films in the 1950s and 1960s, though not together. Needless to say, everything ends well for everyone, and the viewer walks away feeling quite well.
