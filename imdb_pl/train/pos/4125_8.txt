I loved watching "Sea Hunt" in the past, I was in junior high school and I was doing my homework, and at 4:30 I would be ready to watch "Sea Hunt" and Mike Nelson in his underwater adventures. I love it ! He took you to a place inaccessible at that time under the great blue sea. Pre '' Thunderball '' or even before Cousteau became widespread, Mike Nelson stimulated children's imagination. I would be inclined to assume that more than a few children have developed their passion for oceanography or biology or one of the teachings of watching this show. Underwater photography has also progressed, fascination with exploration is easily stimulated by watching this program. Watch and enjoy !!!
