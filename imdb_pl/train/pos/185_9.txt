In the end I bought and added a copy of "Show People" to my collection. I can not say more than what previous viewers have said, and the characters, storyline and overall quality of this film without repeating their own words. Seeing the episode, the seeming performances of so many silent M-G-M stars are worth seeing in themselves. I really like the scene in which Marion Davies plays alone and meets her herself, the main character in the film, Patricia Pepoire. Make sure you read her lips because there is no title card indicating what she says when she sees Marion Davies, but it's the effect of "I do not think I like her!" Shoot the corn, throw in the tape and get ready to go back over three-quarters of a century in film making history. Enjoy!
