Maybe I'm identifying with this movie because I live in Nyc and I suffer from bad insomnia, but whatever it is, I have to praise the filmmaker for the most amazing work. do what she did without a budget ... wow, that's all I can say. really, really good. as if no money was spent on this movie, and it still dispelled me. I strongly suggest checking if you can. great direction, fantastic result and of course a script that will knock you off your ass. Look at this.
