This film, though seemingly based on a film of the same title from 1951. Published by MGM and with the participation of Janet Leigh, it is still a great movie. Danny Glover in one of his best performances brings to life George Knox, baseball manager successfully. When it comes to this "film", how to add Christopher Lloyd (his stage experience works and manifests itself in his performances on the screen, a great actor), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Third rock from the sun), Brenda Fricker (charming and well-dry Irish actress), Tony Danza (yes, even he is good in this movie), Matthew McConaughey (he stole the program in Dazed and Confused, and his role may not be so important in this film, but he got the exposure), Adrien Brody (that's what I said about Matthew McConaughey, it's the same for Adrien, except for Dazed and Confused), some great actors like Taylor Negron (David), Tony Longo (Messmer), Jay O. Sanders (Ranch Wilder), Neal McDonough (Whitt Bass) and an experienced veteran in one of his last performances, Ben Johnson (Hank Murphy, owner of California Angels), and the rest of the cast performs a great job and a great story, which uplifts a pretty lot of people, does not care about me No, what are the corners of depression. I loved filming it as a child and bringing back memories when I watch them today. I need this on DVD. I recommend to every parent who is looking for something that their children have not seen, and everything else.
