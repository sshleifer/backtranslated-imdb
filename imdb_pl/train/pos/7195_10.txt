I loved this unique serial series! History was one of the best I've ever seen! Even difficult, the picture quality was not the best, but OK. The fencing in this series is also a bit bad, but not terrible. They should only practice a little more. As I said, the story is GREAT! You are sitting there and waiting to find out who Don Del Oro is! The theme music is excellent! He is the same guy who plays music for the Zorro Walt Disney version that plays Fightin Legion music. Costumes and buildings are very good. Zorro is really cool, just like legionaries! I highly recommend this series. Buy it! <br /> <br /> I love the fact that Reed Hadley plays Zorro! He is funny, wise and brave! Mark: 6.
