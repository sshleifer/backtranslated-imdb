The best remembered films from the thirties are Dracula and Frankenstein; and there is a good reason for that, but there were many smaller, but still excellent productions, and The Invisible Ray is certainly one of them. The plot is not very original and similar themes have been seen many times (even in 1936), but the way everything is connected is certainly very ingenious, and the director Lambert Hillyer created a very nice, small, original horror movie. The plot focuses on the good heart of Dr. Janos Rukh; a man who discovered a way to recreate the history of the Earth. His discovery leads him to believe that there may be an unknown radioactive element in Africa, so he sets off with a team of valued colleagues to find him. Tragedy, however, hits the expedition, and a good doctor is exposed to the element; what makes it shine in the dark, and sends it mad ... <br /> <br /> The biggest attraction of the film is undoubtedly the fact that he plays the two greatest horror stars of that time - Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi and both they give great performances. Karloff really shows who a good actor is, and his character has a lot of meat that Karloff can surprise. Bela Lugosi has a role that is extremely different from what we are used to, and it is also a great performance from him; it's nice to see some of Lugosi's versatility. The film starts quite slowly; but things are starting to rise quickly. The second half of the movie is the best and it's really when the movie gets exciting, and Karloff has a chance to shine (literally). The film does not focus on great special effects and is largely based on the actions of the main character to make things interesting; and it works very well. The film remains interesting all the time and boils down to a very decent climax that nicely wraps everything around. In general, The Invisible Ray may not be one of the best horrors of the 1930s; but it is very good and is recommended.
