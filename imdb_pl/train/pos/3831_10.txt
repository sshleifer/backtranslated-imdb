This is a free adaptation of Clarence Mulford's novel; fans of films by Villa Boyd will probably feel a bit like at sea (and opinions on this subject reflect this so far). But I already knew about Hopalong from the novel and never worried about Boyd's films when I got to them. <br /> <br /> Christopher Coppola made a wise choice - he did not do the nostalgic "West"; instead, he approached Cassidy's story as part of what we used to call "Americana"; or what older critics once called "homespun". As the movie broke up, I was more and more remembering the great version of Mark Twain's "Hallmark Theater" "Roughing It," with James Garner's narrative. <br /> <br /> Both of these films remind us, although films about the "old west" are probably always mythical to Americans, they do not have to be "westerns"; they can just be films about what it means to be an American at the time. <br /> <br /> I never feel attached to watching this movie; there is no effort to push Boyd-Cassidy's legacy into our throats, without irony, without a camp. Therefore, I have the impression that these figures are walking - or riding on horseback - through some real western America, which I could walk one hundred years ago. <br /> <br /> Given this, the simplicity of the film - it positively avoids everything we call "style" - everything is in its favor; and the usual performance of the contractors fits perfectly; God, it really is like a story told by a bonfire on a cattle ride - no visual dressing, just quirks and good humor - and sudden violence - what we expect from a good narrative of adventure yarn. I was very pleasantly surprised by this film, and if the viewer puts aside hidden expectations, he will find a lot of pleasure in it. <br /> <br /> I would give this film to 9-stars, but give it ten only because most reviewers have not noticed this point completely; and I call them to put aside Boyd's memories and give this film another chance. <br /> <br /> Note 1: The reviewer complained that in this movie Hopalong shoots people instead of shooting at them (ala Boyd's Cassidy); first of all, Cassidy BANGES people in novels; secondly, if Cassidy were a real cowboy, he would shoot people - the problem with shooting at people's hands is that they can always get another weapon - which is part of the same movie's subtext. <br /> <br /> Note 2: I admit that I am jealous of the Coppola family, that she has the "Godfather" Director among them, who can give them all the possibilities of making films that I can not; but a good movie is a good movie; and this is a good movie. If it's someone named Coppola, it just is. America is a country of opportunity (or until Bush did not enter the office) - this is what great American novels tell.
