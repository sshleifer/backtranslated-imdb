Robin Williams makes every effort to combine comedy and pathos, but is somewhat astute. Donald Moffat is too unanimous like his father-in-law. Jeff Bridges is excellent as a quarterback, and Holly Palance and Pamela Reed are wonderful, carrying the film through most of the hardships. It fills the time nicely, but it's not much more.
