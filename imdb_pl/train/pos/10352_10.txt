Religious bigotry is spreading everywhere. Australia is not immune to this. <br /> <br /> Dingo kidnapped her and her mother was tried and sent to jail for "killing" her own child. I'm not going to ruin your story, but you need to know the basics before you get to your knees, which made this woman in prison. <br /> <br /> Buy or rent a movie to discover how deep-seated human hatred for those who are different still flourishes around the world. <br /> <br /> This is a very moving movie with a great cast of actors. <br /> <br /> Both Meryl Streep (with his famous Australian accent) and Sam Neill, whose accent is his native pronunciation, are unique. People with supporting roles are also quite good. <br /> <br /> You will remember this movie for many years. <br /> <br /> See!
