In life, we first organize stones (Piedras in Spanish), such as career, family, friendship and love. In this way, we will find a place between them for smaller stones, our small needs. If you act in the opposite way, you will not have enough room for larger stones. The five heroes of this film are women who have not been able to organize large "stones" in their lives. Ramon Salazar, the Spanish film director, defines his first film "Stones" in this way. The film tells the parallel, contradictory trajectory of five women: Anita (Monica Cervera, 1975-), Isabel (Angela Molina, 1955-), Adela (Antonia San Juan, 1961-), Leire (Najwa Nimri, 1972-) and Maricarmen (Vicky Pena , 1954 -). Everyone is trying to remove the stones that are insistently on their way or, worst of all, are in their shoes. They are five Cinderella in search of the Charming Prince and a new chance in life. The best story of these five Cinderella is Anita (Monica Cervera), who also plays in "20 centimeters", "Busco", "Crimen Ferpecto", "Entre Vivir y Sonar", "Hongos" and "Octavia".
