I liked the movie because it basically did more for less. This could become more interesting if they would further reduce it to the studio (though some plot elements would be more difficult to develop). <br /> <br /> The guy playing the DJ did a good job of showing someone scared and haunted by his memories. His dialogue with the callers was also quite funny. <br /> <br /> While you can see the fragments of the film, moving away by a mile, other parts you do not expect look the way it did. <br /> <br /> I thought most of it was a fairly minimal ghost story, focusing more on the living side of the equation. The last 5-10 minutes were quite well done, because everything was revealed. <br /> <br /> Though it was a shorter film, it seemed like it was almost the right amount of time to tell a story. Already and it will start to drag.
