"Death Lends A Hand" is one of the most important early episodes of "Columbo", which helped define the program for the next thirty years. This is the first of four performances by Robert Culp (three as a killer), playing the same role in each performance. <br /> <br /> In this case, Culp plays Brimmer, the head of a large private detective company, who is asked to investigate whether the wife of a wealthy newspaper magnate, Mr. Kennicut, has an affair. Although there is, Brimmer decides not to tell Kennicut, in the hope that he will be able to blackmail his wife in exchange for fragments of information about her husband's coworkers. He reacts badly to this suggestion, he gets into a quarrel, which quickly becomes violent when Brimmer hits her face. Because she's wearing a big ring, the blow knocks her down and kills her. <br /> <br /> There are really priceless moments in this episode. One of my favorite scenes is the place where Columbo pretends to be in hand reading, although in reality it is a trick to discover the shape and size of the Brimmer ring without acknowledging that he knows the killer wore a ring. Columbo is Columbo, reveals only what he really knows when the right moment has come to turn the screws a little. So at first he's stupidly playing the role of a rather simple man who is excited about the "lifeline over the mound of the moon", or some equally funny, reading mumbo-jumbo hand. <br /> <br /> Another great scene when Brimmer tries to offer Columbo a job for his company, effectively bribing him to stop poking his nose. Again, Columbo does not reveal that he knows what is happening, pretends to be honored and excited about this job offer. <br /> <br /> And there is another in which Columbo tells Kennicut, before Brimmer, that he wants the murderer to hear their conversation. He wants to suggest to Brimmer that he is there, without directly accusing him, so rather cruelly (but understandable in circumstances) he decides to play the game Brimmer, to scare him to panic and do something stupid. Which, of course, does! All the while, pathetic Kennicut is not aware of the implications of this conversation. It is only at the end of the Columbo that he explains everything to Kennicut (not shown on the screen). <br /> <br /> I will not tell you how Columbo finally kills deadly laws, but let's say a potato comes into play. .. <br /> <br /> Really a very good episode, probably the best of the first series. If you like it, you'll also like "Double Exposure", also with Robert Culp.
