The British horror movie was on the verge of collapse in the early seventies, but from the dark came three films that were among the best on our island. Wickerman, Blood on Satan's Claw and The House That Dripped Blood made the future look pink, although many people knew that it would not be at that moment. THTDB has a cast that could easily create a wish list, if it was not actually assembled, in the gloomy backroom of 2008, you might think you wake up. Waxworks is the most overlooked of the four stories and is of course my favorite, Cushing's life and art are so closely related that you can not say where performance ends and pain begins. One can only guess at how this role influenced such a gentle, sensitive man. Death and a virgin. RIP Peter.
