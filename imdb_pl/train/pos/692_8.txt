I saw this film for the first time at the festival. There were many good films, but hardly anyone thought about it long after that, and Nightmare An Insomniac was definitely one of them. Tess is definitely a talented filmmaker. The photos were great. Casting was perfect. Dominik shone in his role, which she perfectly created. There was nothing to know about, but she wrote the story in such a way that we cared for him. And Ellen ... I can not wait for it to end! It shows a lot of talent and I hope it will do a few more films. With a whole million dollar budget that tries to get a cheap thrill, Tess shows that it's not all that's needed, as long as there's a good story and actors. Recognition for everyone involved in this movie. And thanks to Tess and Co. for distribution on DVD!
