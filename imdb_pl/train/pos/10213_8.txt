This capricious movie had the misfortune that he was released at the same time from the very popular "Amelie," both of them having a great Audrey Tautou in the lead role. Laurent Firode, a talented director, made one of the most enjoyable films that have appeared in France recently. <br /> <br /> The film has a chance, as its English title indicates. The French title refers to how butterfly wings can create chaos over the Atlantic when they fly, as well as hurricanes in the Pacific, which can not be believed by looking only at these colorful insects. From the very beginning, the director interweaves all the characters that he sees in the film, and how everyone has a relationship with the other, which is hard to imagine, but in the context of the film seems to work well. <br /> <br /> Accidental meeting in the subway gives tone to the film. A woman who goes to work is asked by a woman sitting opposite to tell her what her sign of the Zodiac is and starts reading from the newspaper. Irene, it seems that she will cross the path and find her soul mate on the same day. After Irene leaves the train, the quiet young man sitting next to the woman tells her that she has the same date of birth as Irene. It seems that they are destined from the beginning, but unfortunately they will not connect again to the last frame of the film. <br /> <br /> Audrey Tautou is wonderful as Irene. Faudel, who plays Younes, does not have much to do to the end, but shows that he has his presence and plays his part well. The talented young cast brings valuable contributions to the success of the film, which is as light as the wings of a butterfly. <br /> <br /> We are waiting for future films of Laurent Firode, because he seems to be a director with a heart in the right place and ear in the way people are connected.
