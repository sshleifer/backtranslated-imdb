It would be so nice to see the theater in 1996. In my cinema I like the corner of the cinema, which really appreciates really well made, shocking films. <br /> <br /> "The Dentist" is sometimes panned because people usually have strong feelings about dental matters. Maybe ADA started a campaign against him, because dentists report that they have to apologize for the movie and for "The Marathon Man" (which has only one scene comparable to many in "The Dentist"). <br /> <br /> It's amazing that, according to a curiosity page, the film was shot in 21 days. Of course, post production may take longer than sometimes filming, and the edition of "Dentist" is perfect. Fast cuts increase the tension so much that in the scene where the dentist "cares" for his wife, there are only two quick cuts showing what's going on. The rest is left to our very fertile imagination! Corbin Bernsen was a good choice for this role because he has extensive experience in the psychological "disabling" of the character and completely sold the obsessive compulsive aspects of the dentist. <br /> <br /> For me, the pace of the film was only good. The creators of the film reveal their wife's rudeness in a proper way. All characters in the dental office look like they are real people working in a real office. There is a lot of tension when dealing with impatient people waiting for the arrival of the dentist. Meanwhile, the dentist is on the verge of a huge psychotic breakdown! Unlike many movies of this genre, the script is very tight. All victims fall into the dentist's trap in a very calculated way. Two types of law enforcement agencies engage even in a small thread that ends with a shock of the game at the end. <br /> <br /> Definitely not for people with a weak heart or dental phobia, but a real roller coaster ride and strongly recommended for fans of smart tests.
