This film is one of the funniest, saddest and most intimate portraits of mentality that seems to penetrate the Balkans once again, 45 years after the presented time. All typical characters and conflicts are presented with such anger, sadness and love that you can not decide if crying or laughing would be a more appropriate response. The accuracy of the portrait and the timelessness of these types, however, make watching the movie great, if someone wants to understand what led the former Yugoslavia to madness. In fact, no diplomat dealing with this region should try anything until he sees this film and his twin, * Maratonci trce pocasni krug. * Did I mention that this is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen?
