I really liked this movie, but it's nothing new. <br /> <br /> Everyone here is grouping him with other war movies, this movie has been incorrectly categorized! This is not a war movie, just like "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" is a film about asylum, or "Cool Hand Luke" is a prison movie. It is a film about individuality, incompatibility, self-confidence and costs of this type of personality. <br /> <br /> The plot is the same as "One flew over the cuckoo nest" and "Cool Hand Luke", his in the GOOD company and has its own. These films should be contrasted and compared, not "Apocalypse Now" or "Platoon". <br /> <br /> Eric
