The "Sexploitation" child is one of the most serious problems facing our world today. I was afraid that any film on this subject would immediately go to scenes with a clearly sexual character to shock and disturb the audience. After watching both "Trade" and "Holly", one movie forced me to change reality in international law. The second felt like a bad attempt to make me cry for five minutes with touching music and strange suicide. <br /> <br /> I do not believe that converting this problem into a Hollywood tear shredder is a useful or necessary strategy to adopt and I have to praise Holly's producers for their subtle but strong commitment to the terrible conditions in which these children live. forced to endure. "Trade" fluctuated between serious and stupid scenes involving the death of a cat after paintings depicting children forced to commit terrible deeds. I found this to be indecent and sometimes insulting. If I wanted a cheap laugh, I would not sign up for a movie about child trafficking. <br /> <br /> For anyone who would like to see a powerful movie that actually means something that I would suggest to save money on a cinema ticket for the release of "Holly".
