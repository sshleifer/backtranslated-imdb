This is the best movie I've come across for a long time. This is not only the best film of this type (shooting at school). The way Ben Coccio (the director) decided to shoot was great. He filmed it with teenage actors who were still in high school. He filmed it in actors' rooms and used actors as parents in the film. Actors also filmed using cameras, making them look more like a video diary. It's almost ingenious (if it's actually a word). There are a few ups, for example, when Cal calls the brads (?) Land rover to the range rover (or vice versa, it's been some time since I saw him)
