I've been looking for this movie for years, apparently he's not here in the States, so I bought a copy from Ebay. <br /> <br /> Four young hunters and three of their girls go to the forest in search of a bear, apparently killed several campers. They found that a former veterinarian from Vietnam went crazy (he killed some victims with a glove with long metal nails and a la Freddy Krueger). When night falls, one of the girls goes for a walk after a short argument with her boyfriend, she is killed. When one of the groups finds his body, everyone hides in their tents, waiting for the light of day. When the sun rises, everyone tries to get out but they fall victim one after the other. <br /> <br /> Seven bodies, not too much blood, but some good murders, especially girls' death. The boys die in a bit bloodless way (blown up in the car, shot, knife over the head). <br /> <br /> In general, INFERNAL TRAP is a cool movie from the late 80's. Nothing new, just well-preserved, fast and a few nice ladies. 10 out of 10.
