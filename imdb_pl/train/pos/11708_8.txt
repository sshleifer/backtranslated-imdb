The reason people say that this movie scared them is that they do! This means that the movie target was felt by some who saw it. When I saw this movie for the first time, it frightened me and made me think about life and religion. This is not a frightening film of blood and blood type, but one in which one might think that something could happen, just like the movie was written. Of course, non-believers will say it's just a science-fiction movie. The truth is that this movie is mandatory for your collection of thrillers, even if it has a religious view. If you're a fan of classic thrillers (Omen..etc), this is one of them and its obligatory position. I have never seen a sequel (Distant Thunder), but I believe that it ends where the movie ends.
