Why this type of compact, entertainment secret can not be filmed in the new century? As a result, the viewer thinks and guesses all the time. The cast is a great band. William Powell shows the true quality of the stars. Who knows - maybe he practiced his future as Nick Charles. He is a joy to watch. You can also see why Eugene Pallette produced over 200 films. He is a great supporting actor, and his great chemistry with Powell is a pleasure. Mary Astor performs above average work in a not too meaty role. All other hands are able to make it a very pleasant way to spend 73 minutes. I suspect Michael Curtiz had a ball to guide him. Bravo!
