For over 40 years, I have had a morbid fascination with tornadoes, because my fifth-grade teacher, a native Texan, told stories about those he had seen in his youth. Fortunately, I spent my whole life in the middle Atlantic states, where tornadoes are rare and usually not as violent as those in the Midwest, but I had two close encounters, one in PA and the other in NJ, in the past decade. <br /> <br /> I liked the family scenes, especially the conflicts between Jacek and Dan Hatch. When the tornado was close, Dan knew most of what he had to do, and he probably learned it at school because I know that tornado security is an important topic in some parts of the US, where storms are more frequent. However, the characters in the film did two things that some say should be done or are safe in tornadoes, but in reality they should not be done or are dangerous. <br /> <br /> When the siren sounded for the first time Dan and Arthur went through the house and opened the windows. For many years, people have been told about it, but websites devoted to the safety of tornados advise against this. Shows of people in the underground passage were also shown. This method has become popular thanks to the video from the early 90s written by the crew of T.V. during a relatively weak twister in Kansas. However, in the most serious tornadoes people can be sucked from these underground passages. It happened during the explosion in May 1999 in Oklahoma. <br /> <br /> Tornadoes in this film hit autumn, which is not common for them. (Then one of my close encounters took place at the end of September.) In addition, they traveled from the northwest to the southeast, while the majority of such storms in the northern hemisphere pass from the southwest to the northeast. However, this is not unusual. The famous tornado that hit Joliet, IL, in the early 90s traveled in this direction (just like the one involved in my other close encounter). <br /> <br /> I think the movie should be set to spring. This film was based on a book that in turn was based on a real event that happened on June 3, 1980. But it was still a fascinating story.
