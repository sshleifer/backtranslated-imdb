It took a long time to find a title in a special video library in Berlin and I was fortunate to find an English version with Dutch titles. I think it's one of the best horrormovies in history. It seems strange to me that some people call this film a black comedy. I must admit that I was not able to laugh at it when I saw it for the first time (and it was the same with the second time!) On the one hand, Trelkovski seems so nice and even charming in his timid behavior, but on the other hand he beats this boy in the playground and has no explanation. But the most-known thing is, of course, his transformation in Simone Choule and the fact that he does not know who he really is. His horns are the most terrifying in this movie. Of course, it's all in his mind, but is this the flat that brings out his feminine side, or was it before he moved in? I think it's an interesting question. His shizofrenic behavior is difficult to understand and it is scary to see his two sides or identities struggling with each other. The effect of this is that first he cuts his hand and then jumps out of the window. But this terrible scream - does it mean that everything will be repeated again and again ... and that his soul is in a cage or something? And these Egyptian hieroglyphs and other Egyptian things? The fact that he / she looks like a hospital mummy - this is not an incident but a hint in my point of view.
