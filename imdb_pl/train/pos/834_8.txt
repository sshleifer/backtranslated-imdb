A dark comedy? Gallows humor? How to make a comedy from murder? It can be a risky venture because the viewer has to let go of his moral values ​​and laugh at the fears of a man who kills people. So the story is solid, with a good bit of suspended reality to make it work. So, Pierce Brosnan, the Irishman's response to 007 is now filled with smoking alcohol, an alcohol addict who kills people and has a life crisis. He meets a difficult businessman named Greg Kinnear, and after a rocky start he learns that he needs a friend. But Greg is happily married to Hope Davis, and Brosnan sees in him basic things that are not there, love, home and life. Add a character actor, Philip Baker Hall, as a maniac manager and head out for the races. Brosnan is wonderfully stupid and stern as an antihero and delightful Kinnear as his counterpart, a very human businessman. Hope Davis adds glamor to the very conventional wife of Kinnear, who is fascinated by the abandoned who drifts in their lives. The ending is delightful and with some surprise. You should leave the theater, at least partially, well - if you can suspend being scared of killing people.
