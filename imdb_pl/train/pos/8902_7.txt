I would imagine that if Steve McQueen knew he would become an icon and start "Wanted: Dead of Alive" in the same year the movie was released, or would be two years later in The Magnificent Seven, he would not have done it. But he did it and we are richer for him. <br /> <br /> Sure, it's a camp classic. Horror the way it was supposed to be for the drive-in theater. It's fun and nostalgic. <br /> <br /> It is interesting that the last lines of the film were: <br /> <br /> Lieutenant Dave: At least we stopped it. Steve Andrews: Yes, until the Arctic stays cold. <br /> <br /> They never imagined 52 years ago that the Arctic would defrost. Blob will return soon.
