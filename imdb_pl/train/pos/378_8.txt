Nowadays, Spielberg's "purple color" is mainly remembered for nominating up to eleven Oscars and winning zilch. Even more disturbing is that Spielberg himself was not even nominated for the best director award. Needless to say, the filmmakers deserved more recognition than was awarded. <br /> <br /> The story relates to the trial and suffering of Celie Johnson (Whoopi Goldberg), an African-American woman initially dominated by her incestuous father, and then her abusive husband. The film covers a few years and focuses mainly on Celie's relationships with the women around her. This is definitely a woman's perspective, but you do not have to worry about it being a "chick". <br /> <br /> The story is interesting, animated by humor sometimes, although the hero's fights are the most important. Some may not appreciate changing the tone towards the end of the movie, but it did not bother me, although similar content in a smaller movie would probably make me turn my eyes. <br /> <br /> The film received three Oscar nominations for acting: Whoopi Goldberg (best actress), Oprah Winfrey (best supporting actress) and Margaret Avery (the best supporting actress). I think Goldberg and Winfrey certainly deserved, and Danny Glover was incredibly stiff. <br /> <br /> As mentioned, Spielberg has not been nominated for the best director for his efforts. Such omission brings faith because the direction of Spielberg is here at the highest level. I'm not particularly crazy about the outcome of Quincy Jones, but it's not below average. <br /> <br /> After all, the story is satisfying, told by a film master working with Pulitzer. The award-winning material. Try it, and you'll probably be as surprised as I am that it can be so badly treated on an Oscar night.
