As an employee of the Swedish Air Force, I liked the nice scenes from the Gripen and Hkp 9 flight (MBB Bo 105) in this film. One of the few disappointments was the EWS 39 damping feeder, in this case neutral bullet Rb 75 (Maverick) painted in black with the letters "EWS 39" in white along the side. The real pods of the jammers certainly do not look like that, at least not the ones I've seen. <br /> <br /> But otherwise it's a funny movie with a very funny ending (last minute). Everyone interested in watching various Swedish military units, including the legendary SSG, should see this film on the film. <br /> <br />
