Is this your typical woman in the chains of a love story in navy blue transport? Perhaps, hell, you know how the formula works now, a pretty woman is depicted in the picture, someone must fall in love with her. <br /> <br /> I think this movie follows typical threads, but it does not say anything about the content. There are great scenes from Crispen Glover, Dennis Hopper and Gary Busey, though short. Some things did not make sense, such as the necessity to participate in random fights, but watching is fun, the fights were actually well done. <br /> <br /> It's definitely a comedy above all, but it has a lot of well-being. Humor is well balanced, it does not hurt you on the stomach, but you'll keep a smile. <br /> <br /> There is a little bit of steamy action, so not for children.
