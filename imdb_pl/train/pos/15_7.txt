I think if a movie has magic, I do not need it to be liquid or fluid. It can skip information in the background, move in places too fast, in others too slow, etc. Magic in this movie: the scene in the library. There are many minor flaws in Stanley and Iris, but they do not diminish the overall positive impact of watching people help each other in areas of life that seem most incomprehensible, the most difficult to fix. Both characters are intelligent. However, Stanley can not understand enough to function because he can not read; he can not read because he had too many adventures in his childhood. Iris, though well-educated, did not have enough of an adventure, so she can not understand how to walk past the U-turns her life brought. Both in their disadvantages and powers, the characters complement each other. It is a little difficult to accept that Iris will finish work year after year in the factory or that Stanley will never hide his illiteracy enough to work in construction or other better paid jobs. And while these "secrets" are explained in the course of history, their development seems a bit invented. I assume that no one has taken the time to think about the scenario. Even so, it's a good movie. Imagine what De Niro, Fonda and Plimpton would do on screen if they had one!
