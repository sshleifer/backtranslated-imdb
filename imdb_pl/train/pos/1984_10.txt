One of the best made musicals, timeless and worth seeing again and again. Tasty! Acting, especially Ron Moody as Fagin, is great. The costumes are exquisite ... even shabby. <br /> <br /> Two young boys who play Oliver and The Artful Dodger are wonderfully talented. Oliver Reed is doing a great job of presenting Bill Sykes to where you can not help, but I hope that there will be a terrible end ... what he does. <br /> <br /> The dance is cleverly choreographed and mesmerizing. Oliver can boast of such stars as My Fair Lady, The Sound of Music, Oklahoma etc. Film for the whole family.
