Enjoying Joyce's complex novel, I wanted so much to be disappointed with the script of Joseph Strick and Fred Haines, given the fabulous complexity of the original text. However, the film turned out to be very well done and translated the tone, naturalism and lightness of the book well. <br /> <br /> It certainly helps you read the original text before watching the movie. I imagine that the latter would seem chaotic, with very strange episodes seemingly accidentally stitched together, without reading the text beforehand, to help understand the story. <br /> <br /> It's amazing how dirty the film is, given that it was filmed in Dublin in 1967. Irish film censors have only finally received it for viewing by the general public in Ireland until 2000 ( it was shown to a limited audience in a private cinema club, the Irish Film Theater, the late seventies). Joyce's eroticism is not simply naturalistic and lewd, it offers many crazy "perverse" episodes. It does not matter that so much of these fetishism was unacceptable when the book was published in 1922 - they were still taboo when the film was made in 1967. <br /> <br /> It's amazing and joyful to watch the cream of the Irish profession of an actor of the 1960s, all respectable players, bold to express and capture the extremely transgressive text of Joyce with such enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> Bravo!
