Make the world go away. Take it off my shoulder. Tell the things you said and let the world go away. <br /> <br /> Well, Dave (David Hewlett) and Andrew (Andrew Miller) were in the flood, one for embezzlement and the other for kissing a child. None of them was guilty, but in the face of the allegations and the house that was to be demolished, they found themselves, well, nothing. The whole world, with the exception of their home, left. <br /> <br /> It's kind of weird, but it's also fun. What would you do if you were alone in the world? Two friends just like company and they do what they want. But it is getting old fast, it seems. <br /> <br /> Then they start to improve their mood, hating memories. The sound effects at that time were great. <br /> <br /> Things have really become weird at the end. This film was the result of a great imagination, written and directed by Vincenzo Natali, with the help of two stars. You have to see it.
