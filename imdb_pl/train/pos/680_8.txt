"The Last Wave" is one of those movies that relies heavily on the mind. The title refers to the theory of Aboriginal fall: the last wave will erase everything. <br /> <br /> David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) is a Sydney lawyer employed to defend some Aboriginal people accused of murder. At that time, there was extremely heavy rainfall in Australia. Defending the Aborigines, David learns the latest wave theory and begins to wonder if it's just a mythology. <br /> <br /> The last sequence of the movie is a metaphor of descending into the mind. Peter Weir created a troublesome but thought-provoking movie. Aboriginal actor David Gulpilil (whom you saw in "Walkabout", "Crocodile Dundee" and "Rabbit-Proof Fence") is an interesting supporting role as one of the accused. <br /> <br /> If you get a chance, watch the "create" function on a DVD. Peter Weir explains some of the overtones of the film, some of which refer to the background of Richard Chamberlain.
