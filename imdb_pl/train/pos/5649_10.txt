I am watching the series again when it is on DVD (yay!). It strikes me as fresh, as important and intriguing as after the first broadcast. <br /> <br /> The central performances are thrilling, the scripts are layered. <br /> <br /> I will stretch my neck and set it up with The Prisoner as a series that will win new fans and will continue to be watched in 2035. <br /> <br /> I was asked to write more lines (it seems that IMDb is as unfriendly and anti-virus as never before! Pithy and of course it's not an IMDb way.) <br /> <br /> Unlike Editorial IMDb, American Gothic understands that simplicity is everything. <br /> <br /> In 22 episodes, the program includes more character development than many concerts over seven seasons. In addition, he questions personal ethics and strength of character in a way that at every step gives the viewer a question of what they would choose and what they would think about the situation. <br /> <br /> When the show was broadcast for the first time, I still regretted the Twin Peaks and thought it would be cheap. Personally, I'm starting to judge it more and I suspect that it will be better over the years. Be careful that this is not more controversial!
