Hmmmm, you want some romance with your secret? It has it. I think if romance were abandoned, it would be a better movie. But how could romance be abandoned when the story was borrowed from what is called the Harlequin Romance novel, whatever the hell it is. If romance were abandoned, the story could be a little too weak. The secret here was not too bad, it was quite interesting, but nothing at the Mission Impossible mission spy level. Well. I thought Mel Harris was pretty good; her short skirts, I think, added some sex appeal ... but this Rob Stewart probably could have been better, maybe with a more well-known television actor. The direction was decent, and the writing could be improved - both could be a little more disgusting, a bit darker, more risky. One of the things that was great was the use of real locations in Europe. It could easily be changed, so it could have been shot in Canada, but they really were in beautiful places like Budapest. Probably the disadvantage was the choice of the director and / or operator to frame specific shots. Not good. If it was a more dramatic movie made on a big screen, the perfect scenes from the picture postcard would really have to be in the back seat and be just a nice part of the background. But it was just a TV movie, so they had to add some Ummmph to the picture, and some of Ummmph came from the scenery. Overall, it was not a really bad movie. I will tell you what was absolutely the best Canadian-Hungarian production I have ever seen! (and the only one I know of.) Hereby I announce that this is an average film made for television, giving it a C- class
