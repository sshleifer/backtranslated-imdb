As the one-line summary says, two movies left such a comment when I left the theater. One was "Stir of Echoes" with Kevin Bacon, and the other "Vanilla Sky". <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies in which you are sitting deep in a theater chair and stop thinking about someone around you, stop thinking about the end of the movie and just leave the movie quickly wherever you want ... Going out of the cinema was a bit strange, like the feeling you feel when you are sick and you can not think about anything. One of those movies with which you become one with this guy and you feel that nothing else moves around you than things in the movie. <br /> <br /> One thing is certain. The actors are amazing, the soundtrack is perfect, and everything in the film is 9+. <br /> <br /> Certainly one of the best movies I've ever seen, and a movie that shocked my life and my goal in this world best and most shockingly.
