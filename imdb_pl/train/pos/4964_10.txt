I really like this concert! I've always liked the Space Ghost show from the 90s! This concert was fun and I can not believe why Adult Swim from Cartoon Network would have such a fun program like this one. I hope they put this program on DVD or something like that. The performance tells about Lack (from the Space Ghost, SGCC and Cartoon Planet cartoons), who lives his everyday life with his mom and dad and his best friend who likes to fall in a lot, Zorak! My favorite episodes are the one in which Zorak gets a really good voice, and then his voice gives him no money that Zorak made of singing at all. The next episode I like is the one in which Brak and Zorak have not finished their homework, and then they come back from Sunday to Friday and just leave, then return to the day the homework was invented, and then, when they return, the current homework did not exist! The next episode I like is the one in which Dad Braka and their neighbor, Thundercleese, Robot still get into this agrument, and then they are eaten by a giant worm. The next episode I liked was the one in which Zorak makes a pledge, and then a new guy took over his position. I like many other episodes too! One thing that will never disappoint me is that Zorak is beaten, confused!
