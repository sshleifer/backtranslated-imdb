The cast is excellent, the acting is good, the story is interesting, the evolution is full of tension ... but it is difficult to push all these elements into a movie that lasts only 80 minutes. If more time was devoted to the development of the plot and threads, it would have a much better effect. Another 30 minutes of substance would make it a very good film, not just a good one.
