The comparison with Sleuth, the earlier movie-scene, is obvious and after my first look I thought that Sleuth is better, but Deathtrap has, at least for me, many more repetitions in it than Sleuth. <Br> <br /> I bought Deathrap in a chance container at Wal-Mart, thinking he had Caine and the underestimated Reeve and he was worth $ 6. It was one of the best DVD purchases I could take. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best kept secrets that movie lovers always like to discover. And it is worth repeating. <br /> <br /> Although Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine performed in reckless appearances in Sleuth, I was doubly impressed with Christopher Reeve as Clifford Anderson. Reeve, rightly associated with his legendary portrait of Superman, stole the show in what should be worth an Oscar. I've always thought of Reeve as an actor who did not have much opportunity to shine beyond Superman's movies and some other flawed but entertaining movies like Somewhere in Time, but this movie shows that his potential was really crazy and put to use , thank God. <br /> <br /> I absolutely enjoyed the performance of Michael Caine. He was delighted, wonderfully manipulative and sadistic. And watching his work with Reeve and Dyan Cannon was an absolute pleasure. Actually, thanks to this movie I found myself in the "Michael Caine phase" and started renting as many of his things as possible. <br /> <br /> Regarding Deathtrap, there are enough juicy dialogues to fill the "unforgettable quotes" section. (Unfortunately, most of the dialogue would spoil an extremely entertaining story). <br /> <br /> Really, it's very difficult to talk about a movie without spoiling important story points that are infinitely more pleasant to discover on your own. Needless to say, you have to see it. But for me it was the biggest and most satisfying blind purchase of all time. <br /> <br /> Repeat watching is a must. <br /> <br /> I deserve to sit next to Sleuth on the DVD shelf. <br /> <br /> I will leave you with this beautifully written quote from the movie: "I wonder if it would not be ... well ... just a meticulous look at me to enter such a risky and exciting cooperation ... where I can not count on a sense of moral duty ... in general. "
