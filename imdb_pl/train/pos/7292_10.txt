I need to see this last Friday at the Los Angeles Film Festival in Laemlee, Beverly. This movie gained the most applause of all the movies this evening. Given that the two music videos opened first, I did not know what to expect, because they were very fast and attracted attention, I was not sure if I would be ready for a moment. But to my surprise I really liked it. I thought the main demon actor was really good. I was so impressed with his performance that I checked his name. I was surprised to see that he was a Witchblade guy. He's really good since then! Either that or he got a bad role or he was pushed by the director really hard for the short one. The girl did a good job. I think it's difficult because it was her first performance and she was so young. Dad did a good job too. For a short time there was a lot of really nice work, both for this and for the short game "Mexican Hat", which was also nice, but I liked it the most, because it had the most depth and emotion and really depended on the characters. The second is a very simple story. The story was quite illustrative and dark! He dealt with real topics, using a more fanciful approach to interest ADD people like me. We will not even talk about the last movie in the block that I left. My only complaint is that I would only like to see more demonic characters and start less, that's why I gave her 9 out of 10. I also thought that the final credits went a little bit slowly. Otherwise, he was beautifully told, directed and edited. The schedule was very nice with a complete change from the quick edition of MTV made today. More will come from this director in the future, as well as from the actor. Now I will think of him as a Lost Actor, not a Witchblade guy.
