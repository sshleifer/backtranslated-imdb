This film works because it is so authentic. The story is simple and realistic, perfectly reflects the joys and anxieties of youthful love and sexuality, which most / we have experienced during our teenage years. <br /> <br /> The actors are as natural as the characters in the document, but they are as convincing and charismatic as experienced performers. The dialogue is fresh and honest ... and fortunately it is not filled to the brim with sweet references to pop culture. In addition, the photos are beautiful and beautiful at the same time, which makes the Lower East Side come alive in a very tangible way. <br /> <br /> At the artistic level, I love this film because it reminds me of wonderful Italian neo-realism films such as Bike Thief and La Strada. Films rarely feel as "real" as it is ... or a Bicycle Thief. And the only other movie I've seen that treats teen sexuality with the same level of seriousness is Splendor in Elii Kazan's grass. Screenwriter / director Peter Sollett deserves great praise. This film is quite a big achievement. <br /> <br /> On a personal level, I'm always happy to see a film that treats members of ethnic America with love and respect. As an American from Italy, I hate the way my people go out in the cinema (as racist, feminine, criminal geniuses in annoyingly popular epics), and my deterioration in this number makes me very sensitive to other groups and their awful silver screen representations. Latinos and Asians in particular seem cursed to play black characters in westerns and action movies. (It's good that Gong Li did not try to become famous in America!) <br /> <br /> Of course, mainly due to the growth of indie and Miramax influences, we can see a few more pictures here and there of ethnic characters ... but Raising Victor Vargas it is easily one of the best. Although I really like My Big Fat Greek Wedding, it's a refreshing change that Raising Victor Vargas is played straight (with less exaggerated and widely drawn characters), and at the same time is very funny in itself. Finally! Latin characters are noteworthy. I have the impression that it is a movie that will be remembered. <br /> <br /> Of course now, when he made this wonderful picture about a family from Dominican Republic, I hope Peter Sollett can handle the Italian movie soon! :) - Marc DiPaolo
