If the Australian Post Office ever needed a promotional video for recruitment, that's it. It's one of those movies whose heart is in the right place and you can watch them repeatedly. Miranda's performance is moving because it shows the aspect of Australia unimaginable by many Europeans, because it can be cold, wet and gloomy, just like everywhere else, and just as everywhere else people around you are important. The film's heroes are warm and hospitable and make the career perspective move to the "dead letter office" that needs to be considered. Miranda was making bigger films, but I hope he always thinks about it.
