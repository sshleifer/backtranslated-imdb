It is a very dark and intriguing horror thriller based on the idea of ​​religious murders. The plot focuses on a mad man who lives in Texas, USA, who suddenly begins to go crazy with his two young sons after being instructed by God to redeem the world of bad people. <br /> <br /> Bill Paxton, who directs this movie, plays the Mad Father, who is known as God's Hand Slayer, while Matthew McConaughey plays his best performances so far as his eldest son, Fenton Meiks. The film revolves around Fenton, who decides that he can no longer endure the weight of his murderous childhood and uses retrospection to tell a FBI agent to Wesley Doyle (played by Powers Boothe). <br /> <br /> many movies that literally keep the viewer in the chain from start to finish, and that's definitely one of them. Even if you want to stop watching, you will not be able to because of the sheer power of this movie. <br /> <br /> Directors have filmed this film very well and help set the story in a good setting. Acting in this movie is great, but if there is a defect, some parts are very strong and can disturb some people. <br /> <br /> While the concept of this film is very dark, young children help to present the idea using brilliant acting. It really is a film with a delicate color of the spine and we guarantee that you will have it in its place. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes horror, disturbing and powerful movies or anyone who just wants to see something different. <br /> <br /> 8/10
