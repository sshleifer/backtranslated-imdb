A surprisingly interesting meditation on the nature of regret in terms of how it relates to paranoia. Much is happening because the working time is only 74 minutes, but it works. Horror is very subtle, not terrifying horror, which seem to fill the latest Asian horror movies. The way in which "horror" arises is similar to the disturbing moments in "Uninvited" (aka 4 Inyong shiktak, directed by Su-Lee Lee), but this is not nearly the same caliber. The film does a good job, balancing the classic ghost story with something more unusual and psychological. It is not perfect, but it does what it should. I recommend checking it out if you have a chance.
