A well made movie with a tragic ending. Pluses: the way history moves - it starts with the fact that Soorya tries to live, and after that, a long retrospection, why is there. Music. A disinterested look at the lives of police officers. Cons: violence and gore, but I think they add to realistic effects. Even so, you could avoid cutting people's heads and sending them in boxes and sacks. <br /> <br /> No complaints - 7/10
