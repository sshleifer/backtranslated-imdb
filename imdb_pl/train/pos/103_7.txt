when I read another commentary, I decided to watch this movie ... <br /> <br /> First, I put on Michael Madsen and Tamer Karadagli; wystarczyerful dobry ... <br /> <br /> Film, very intelligent and interesting, because the cast has many international, especially European actors and actresses, such as Turkey and Russsia ... <br /> <br /> Second , History is basic and you can guess, but if the interesting action is a good game, which in my opinion will appeal ... <br /> <br /> Third, the last chapter is not special or interesting, it is regular like other action movies . <br /> <br /> Finally, I recommend watching this movie ... And I hope you like it: D
