I waited and waited for the appearance of this movie. The trailers seemed to be turned on for years, it was worth it. I'm not a big fan of watching movies over and over, but I can not wait for it to come out and buy! He is not a big fan of Jim, but it suited him perfectly, there was so much to see, and "feel good" is out of scale, perfect for Christmas. I think Ron did a great job turning it into a movie. If you have not seen it, do it if you have it, look again, I know you want to!
