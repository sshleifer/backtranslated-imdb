At least something good resulted from Damon Runyon's mistaken attempt to send mafia sentiment. "Guys and Dolls", a seemingly indestructible stage musical, was captured on the film in 1955 by Joseph L. Mankiewicz ("All About Eve") in a colorful, pleasant movie, which included the star cast, including Vivian Blaine (from the original Show on Broadway), Jean Simmons (whose character has a strange resemblance to Audrey Hepburn in "Roman Holiday") and two outstanding leading men, Frank Sinatra and Marlon Brando, who recently won Oscars for the Best Supporting Actor ("From Here To Eternity") and Best Actor ("On the Waterfront") and they were at the top of their game. One listening to Brando singing "Luck Be a Lady Tonight" says a lot about where early Dylan got his vote. Stubby Kaye steals the show as Nicely Nicely Johnson, who brings home "Sit Down You Rocking The Boat." The ubiquitous Sheldon Leonard adds another page to his gallery of thugs from the screen. The film has a bright, cartoon look, overtaking pop art from the early 1960s. The characters speak stylized patois, apparently based on Yiddish idioms. Although social attitudes and gender roles are outdated, great fun and even gentle joking of the Salvation Army is harmless and does not reflect any real hostility towards organized religion. Just watching Sinatra and Brando in the same movie is enough to watch this movie, but it has many other attractions to offer in 149 minutes.
