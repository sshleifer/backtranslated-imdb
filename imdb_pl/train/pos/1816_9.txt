Many reviews on this site mention that this movie is a bit dark for children. It depends on the child. This is not a movie for 2-6 years; is more oriented towards an 8-year-old and older crowd. I saw this movie when I was 10, I liked it a lot. At the time, most animated films were a bit too childish for my tastes. This film is about more serious problems and therefore has a slightly greater emotional impact. In this movie characters can die and be sent to hell! It gives a bit more emotional weight to the scenes in which the heroes risk their lives. Good guys are not always sweet and nice (like other cartoons). They have "real" motivations, such as revenge and greed, but also compassion and friendship; shows that things are not always black and white. <br /> <br /> An excellent movie
