It's a great movie! Most of us have seen the Jurassic Park, where the Chaos Theory is summarized by the story of the butterfly's wings, causing a tornado on the other side of the planet. Well, Bug is this (at least on something, do not worry, it's not a spoiler) I'm definitely not a religious type and I do not believe in things that were previously intended, fate etc. you wonder if coincidence really exists. ... <br /> <br /> further, the acting and the camera are also perfect, another proves that you can still make a good movie without a million dollars
