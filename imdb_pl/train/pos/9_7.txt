The romantic drama by Martin Ritt is as unbelievable as they appear, but there are moments of pleasure mainly due to the charisma of stars Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro (both wonderful). She is a widow who can not move, is an illiterate and inventor in the closet - you can probably guess the rest. The adaptation of Pat Barker's novel Union Street (better title!) Is so laid back that it borders on vagueness, and film editing is a mess, but it is still pleasant; pink-blue fantasy. There are no conditions for serious problems (even the angle of illiteracy is just a story tool for a later love story) and there are no real fireworks, although the characters are deliberately somewhat colorless and the pencils are subdued to an interesting degree. The finale is a clear down - and the cynics will have difficulty swallowing - though these two characters deserve a happy ending and the picture would not be satisfying in any other way. *** with ****
