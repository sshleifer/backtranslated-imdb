I participate in the Filmmakers Symposium, and this film was shown after we saw a not-so-great movie and took part in a 40-minute discussion. Although it was very late and we were weary, the whole audience really liked it. <br /> <br /> Personally, I thought the movie was fun in all the right places, and I loved the bizarre cast of the character. The movie really grows on you.
