I was in France around March 5 and I love going to film festivals. I knew about it Cinémas d'Amérique Latine de Toulouse, but I never went to him. I decided to go and then I caught Cero y van 4. <br /> <br /> The movie is stunning. It did not affect me as it was for Mexican users, because it was French-language subtitles, but it's still shocking. <br /> <br /> This movie is a satire about violence in the city, kidnapping and crime on the streets of Mexico. It is a raw portrait of the city. The metropolis. Secuestro Express, with a stunning Mia Maestro, who was also a satire of abduction, almost, but with a more serious tone, and I think, yes, some relationship with Cero y van 4. A, kind, a story of redemption and how much is too much? Man on Fire, which was staggeringly strong, was not a satire, but a simple portrait on the streets of Mexico. Or he is like Brave. A film that shakes very much and hits the inside. It's like The Usual Suspects, it has some twists and turns, but it makes it even more credible. Verdict: a movie that shakes and makes you believe that there is no more security on the streets. Stunning dialogue, impressive direction and amazing performances. Cero y van 4 is a movie you will soon forget. He leaves you trembling and bewildered.
