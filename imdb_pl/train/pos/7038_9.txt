"The first war for 100% outsourcing". Dan Ackroyd's line says it all. This is a hard to describe movie; comedy, satire, action, screwdriver. It reminded me once or twice that Dr. Strangelove, especially in the scenes with Ben Kingsley (who did a remarkable job, I think). I did not have any particular expectations for this movie, although I'm a big fan of John Cusack, so I just let the movie wash over me. As a result, I was quite funny. Political satire is painfully accurate and quite condemning the US military and business complex. The predictions were in a sense predictable, but the final interweaving of the story lines made them all valuable. I can understand why this movie was not very popular in the United States, but for the rest of the world it is a current story.
