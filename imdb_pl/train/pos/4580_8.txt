Princess Tam Tam is without racist traps, in the way we think about racism in the United States, but there are more subtle (for the American viewer) claims of ethnic identity at the time. Pay attention to the placement of Alwina (Baker) in the shots, as it is addressed by other characters, the settings around her that portray her as "wild" Africa, and ask yourself if Alwina has any shred of the agency throughout the movie. I do not want to ruin anything, but in the end I pay special attention, the dichotomy between the "eastern" and "western" culture is, the least offensive, such diction is fortunately driven out in these days. The French have a turbulent past as imperial power in all of the areas shown (see Chris Statuer Les Statues Meurent Aussi 1953) and draw attention to the places that European travelers visit while in Africa and what reflects their attitudes towards the "other". I give this film 7 because I'm a sucker for Baker, much of what she did in her professional career, like Princes Tam Tam, it's regressive, she's certainly overshadowed by her efforts to integrate, her job as a mad spy (I'm squirting I'm sorry.) However, for me the film is captivating due to its performance, besides it is a telling relic of past mentality.
