Wow! this is a good movie! Acting was not good at all, but if you look at some of the moments in the movie, rewind and watch them again, it's genius! The man at the beginning of the movie goes with a suitcase against the three. WOW! I never expected it. Then he puts the cola in a suitcase and escapes. I bet that this smoking guy was one of his colleagues who later sold drugs. And the genius quotes: "nice shades, I need a pair of" yours "... if you think you can take them ..." ... simply brilliant! And the fight is the best I've seen in a while. Look at the other guy he removes after he hits the first guy on the table. WHAT HIT! And in the middle of the movie one guy in the car scored once, and then 3 guys fell down, he's really good at aiming. It costs a lot of money to hire guys like him. The end was brilliant, it was so exciting that James Cahill walks up and down the stairs for 5 minutes and shoots Jason Peters after his distracting movements. Jason Peters falls and falls over when he's dead! I can not say more how great this movie is!
