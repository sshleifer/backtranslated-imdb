In 1978, the phenomenon began. John Carpenter's "Halloween" edition caused people to queue around to witness the evil of Michael Meyers. The critics loved it, the world loved it, it was imitated and it fell as one of the best films in film history. <br /> <br /> plot: 15 years after the murder, four friends (all women) take care (and have it with their boys) on the Halloween night. After escaping from the hospital the night before, Michael Myers returns to his hometown to persecute these people. He murders three of them in silence and subtlety. He does not speak. It's going slowly. <br /> <br /> Only one of the friends escapes after being saved by Dr. Loomis (the persecutor and doctor Michaela). There is one reason why Halloween works so well. Simplicity. We do not know where Michael is, we do not know why he kills, and he scares us. These are the only reasons we are scared of. <br /> <br /> John Carpenter wrote the film and directed. It builds an unbearable tension throughout history and scares us to the point that sometimes we can not see it. And the culmination is really surprising. <br /> <br /> As a horror movie, it is necessary. It is terrifying and works well. It's also mysterious. Michael is a force, not a human. Strength that can not be denied. <br /> <br /> The next parts focused on Michael and his "history". This film focuses on the fear of the unknown. Perhaps this is why this thing is a masterpiece.
