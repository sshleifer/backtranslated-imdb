Henry Hathaway was bold as well as enthusiastic, because of his love for people from the beginnings of US history. However, criticizing the historical inaccuracies of his film about Brigham Young and Mormons is not necessary or useful in commenting on this film. In my opinion, Hathaway made a great direction that communicates what Mormon people have in the early history of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, during the period beginning with the martyrdom of Joseph Smith to the date of the film's release. In often subtle films and dialogues, he described the philosophies and teachings of Mormons in many segments and scenes. <br /> <br /> I remember watching this film on many Saturday mornings during my youth in the early fifties. It was just over 10 years after the premiere of films and before the completion of the Los Angeles Temple, which I watched when I was building, and instilled curiosity about who the Mormons were. I recently bought this movie and I will enjoy the following news, which Hathaway interpreted in his film. <br /> <br /> 1. Love for all people, regardless of their personal beliefs, 2. Charity for the needy or not, 3. The family is important, 4. Listen with respect and caution, because even opposite messages have important points to consider and accept, 5. Work hard, both individually and in community, 6. Prepare and keep needs for future days, 7. Hope is a binding link to a higher being and to our everyday life, 8. And that there is exceptional quality for each group and I appreciate those that are considered beneficial.
