Read Eric's review again. He perfectly described my own feelings towards this film, so eloquently than I ever could. I am writing here just to encourage you to look and see. <br /> <br /> I saw it many years ago on TV, I think IFC. It's such a unique movie, I hesitate before comparisons. It was filmed in northern Mexico, somewhere on the merciless terrain of Coahuila / Zacatecas / San Luis Potosi. This is not Durango in Mexico, as in the movies of John Wayne, but a truly harsh and wild place. I must now find a novel to check the original location of the story. Like the location, this movie is strange and wild, wonderful and strange and absolutely not for everyone. It is a kind of production that almost motivates me to study the film. <br /> <br /> Actually, I have not forgotten this movie, it is indelible. However, for years I forgot about its existence. I do not know anyone who has seen it, I have never read about it, nor have I seen any reference to it. Erendira is such an unusual name that I even forgot about the title. Well, I will now want to buy a copy. <br /> <br /> ** I have since the announcement has become a great fan of Gabriel Garcia Marquez and therefore I regret that I have not read it before. <br /> Regarding the MsMyth comment below; the film was shot in Mexico, but the author is a Colombian and does not comment on the history of Mexico or Mexico in any way, although Marquez currently lives in Mexico for "political" reasons. This story is universal. <br /> <br /> I'm still trying to find a copy of this movie for my library. Did I like the movie? You must read the story, and then everything that Garcia Marquz wrote. And by the way, the original location in this story is Colombia.
