This movie is beautifully designed! Has no flaws. Not in the design of the set, lighting, sounds, story. The script is an invitation to a complex game in which participants have a simple mission. <br /> <br /> Paxton is the best in this role. His manners, infections used in the tones of his voice are useless. Each shot meticulously made! Surprises appear one by one when the movie reaches its first hour. This may not be the best picture of the year, but it is a jewel that has been very well polished. This is not for a simple mind.
