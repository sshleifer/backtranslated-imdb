I read somewhere (in a panoramic overview) that it's kind of an anime live mech, and I think they're on the right line. I saw this movie for the first time when I was very young and I died to see him again, and when I finally did it recently, all the memories came back. I think that this should not be taken too seriously - it's just a bit of fun in old movies from the 80's (against a rather dark future, although this point is not underlined too much). What I admire most in this film is the fact that the dialogue did not sound general - no stereotypes, no predictable lines - all in all just fun! Maybe time was not kind to this little movie, but I still can appreciate it. It is not perfect, but it is fun and does not try to be anything else. Let the comic nerds and boys worry about technical details - who cares? See it yourself and make your own decision. The opinion of nobody else matters.
