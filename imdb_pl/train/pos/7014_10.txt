Wow ... I do not know what to say. I just looked at Seven pounds. Nobody can make me cry like Will Smith. Man is very tuned to a wide range of human emotions. This film has been skillfully and beautifully made. It is rare to find such an intense humanity in Hollywood today. I would compare it to "Pay it Forward" and "Crash" when it comes to showing both light and dark in such a harsh manner. It definitely stays with you for a long time and gives you a lot to think about. I have a deep love and passion for films like this one. Usually, this is not a "bad ending", but a seeker of the truth, which includes emotions, a harsh life and something more than shallowerness that exists in abundance all around. That's why I do not mind a little pain at the end. It is true that there are always happy endings. Sometimes it's not a happy ending that you think it should be. Many people were able to live a happy life, although the love and life of one of them was lost. If you're someone who looks a little deeper than the rest, you'll love this movie!
