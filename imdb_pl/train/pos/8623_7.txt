DER TODESKING does not belong to my favorite movie, Jorg Buttgereit - but it's still an interesting movie about suicide and its reasons and consequences. Those who are looking for a gore-fest or use in the style of NEKROMANTIK or SCHRAMM films will probably be disappointed. DER TODESKING is definitely an "art house" movie, so those that require linear, explainable narratives do not have to apply ... <br /> <br /> The basic concept of DER TODESKING is that there is an "episode" for each day a week that revolves around a strange chain that apparently causes people to commit suicide, intertwined with scenes of a slowly decaying trupa ... <br /> <br /> There are some very well made and provocative scenes, including a man telling about "problems" with my wife and concert massacre (which unfortunately lost some of my "power" because I was too busy laughing on a stage that looks just like SCORPIONS ...). But seriously - it is sometimes beautiful (the scene that shows the different angles of this huge bridge is particularly effective - especially if you understand the meaning of the scene, and the names shown are people who actually committed suicide from the jump from the bridge ...), sometimes confusing sometimes stupid (SHE WOLF OF SS cheating is quite funny), sometimes shocking (I found a scene of a guy talking with a girl in the park about his wife particularly effective) is more "experience" than entertainment, because many of these "artistic" films are supposed to be. Nevertheless, I have not found DER TODESKING as strong as NEKROMANTIK or SCHRAMM and I would probably put it on a relatively level with NEKROMANTIK 2 in terms of my personal "level of pleasure". It's definitely worth a look at every lover of the movie Buttgereit or "art". If you dump this kind of movie - check SUBCONSCIOUS CRUELTY - in my opinion THE BEST ART-HOUSE / HORROR I SEE. 7/10 for DER TODESKING
