I was attracted to DAN IN REAL LIFE with excellent reviews and thirst for the drama, which was well written - thank you Peter Hedges - and because when Steve Carell plays in the film, you know that the audience will find in LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE a very funny and rewarding performance. DAN IN REAL LIFE fulfilled this promise. <br /> <br /> The movie is so real for many families around the world that have lost a member, and yet they have continued their lives in search of something that will give them magic back before they are lost. With Steve Carell and the wonderful Juliette Binoche, their relationship was so beautifully made and written that their scenes were so real to their heroes and their journeys. The cast, sets and history made DAN IN REAL Life remind us when we set off on the upcoming holidays.
