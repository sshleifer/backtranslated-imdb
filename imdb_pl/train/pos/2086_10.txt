Faithful to the work of Pearl S. Buck, whose years were spent in China as a child of missionary parents, which provided her with a deep insight into Chinese culture and its philosophy, this adaptation of the film is excellently performed, both technically and in terms of acting. /> <br /> Wang Lung is a humble farmer grateful for the basics of life: survive from his land and be freshly married to Olan, serving a rich and powerful family in the countryside. Despite the best efforts of Wang Lung and Olan to cultivate the land, raise children, build savings and wealth, hunger threatens to destroy everything for which they worked. Not choosing to sell land, traditional Asian faith, instead, they go to a big city to wait out hunger. Being in the city, they come to begging and they are only one of hundreds of other unhappy homeless families. Although he is not a looter, Olan is caught in a mob plunder in the home of a rich man. It is summarily rounded up for execution by the army, but it is saved at the last moment. However, her luck is that she has found precious gems on the plunder site that gives her and her family the opportunity to return to the farm to start over. The newly discovered wealth transforms Wang Lung. He becomes selfish, egocentric, and takes recognition as a find. He becomes a very rich farmer, but this only exacerbates the situation because he is becoming more and more underestimated, arrogant and difficult to understand. He loses contact with the basic things in life that can not be bought with money: loyalty, commitment, trust, honesty and integrity. As a punishment, nature once again turns the table over to Wang Lung, sending a plague of locusts to destroy everything it has. Raised to his knees, Wang Lung benefits from the help of all friends, former friends, employees and family. Thanks to all this help, he manages to save the farm. From this experience, he once again returns to humility and recognition for the basics of life.
