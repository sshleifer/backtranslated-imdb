It's one of those movies I've seen so many times that I can quote them. Some of the lines in this movie are simply unbeatable. I especially like to watch him stumble and fall into a state of intoxication, go to an elegant drunk restaurant, and part to a moose. <br /> <br /> I do not know how many times I saw this sequence, but it's a fun time. From the moment Arthur gets to the place of Daddy Susan, to a piece of elk, you're laughing all the time. I remember watching the elk lifts. It disappeared as I imagined. Everyone laughed so much that it was difficult for them to film it. <br /> <br /> The late Sir John Gielgud was a great addition to this. His attitude, his one-layered and the way he dealt with Arthur were just as fun. It's always a funny moment when he hits his head with a hat or says he's broken. I laugh every time I listen to "I'm going to take a bath" and the next lines.
