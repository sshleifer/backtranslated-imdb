Yesterday I participated in the world premiere of "Descent" at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York. I had a great time. It was sold out and all major stars took part in it, including my friend from Marcus Patrick. <br /> <br /> I give a movie 7.5 out of 10 possible stars. <br /> <br /> The film starts with Maya (Rosario Dawson) in college. You can imagine a typical university environment with wild parties and flirtations. The photograph in this film was excellent. He meets Jared (Chad Faust) and becomes in love. At the beginning it looks like any other relationship. The man is looking for the attention and feelings of a woman, and the woman is difficult to get. They both played it well. A very innocent flirt between them. She invites her to her apartment and everything is falling apart. <br /> <br /> The apartment is very dark and gloomy. Eventually they get to the basement, which is very dark and illuminated by numerous candles. It actually reminded me of a dungeon. Here he shows his true colors and rapes her. It is a very dark and rough scene of rape. This scene is not for young or weak at heart. The rape scene is a bit long and difficult to do, but it is necessary later in the film. <br /> <br /> Maya starts losing his soul to drugs and sex. He falls into his abyss. He begins to attend the wildest events and wakes up one morning in the room, not remembering how she got there. She was ordered to go to Adrian (Marcus Patrick). The first thing I remember about this character is that they say "he is a person who saves everyone who needs saving." In fact, he is introducing Maya into drugs. They start a relationship that comes into play later in the movie. The club scenes at this point in the film are photographed with extraordinary professionalism. I thought they were well done and I noticed that the director was applauded at the end of the show during the subtitles by the audience. <br /> <br /> Maya is back in college as TA and is in her class - Jared her rapist !! You saw the confusion and emotions on Maya's face. What should I do?? What I should do now? Shots of her face and emotions are priceless. <br /> <br /> Next is not about what's going on. I'm interested in Jared. It looks like she wants to revive the relationship and be lovers again. I sat there saying it could really happen. There was no. Nothing can be further from the truth. <br /> <br /> Invites him to his apartment and, of course, appears. Now her apartment is dark and hard. He has to completely undress it. He thinks he will be lucky. Then he teases him like every woman. He strokes him everywhere and is excited. Note: for anyone planning to see this movie, this scene is full frontal - it may not be suitable for a younger viewer. <br /> <br /> Then he reverses the situation and becomes a beast and rapes him. Once again, the scene is dark, rough and very rough. <br /> <br /> If you're going to see a movie and you do not want to know what's going on, skip this paragraph and go to the last paragraph. <br /> <br /> This is the place where Adrian returns to the picture. Maya saved (?) Her from Adrian, doing extremely rough male sex with Jared. He thinks that this is the ultimate revenge. Adrian continues Jared's entire masculinity and deprives him of his dignity. Marcus, like Adrian, plays this scene as credibly as anyone can. He is a strong actor playing a strong character, and strength appears on the entire screen. After the film during the question and answer session, Marek explained that this scene requires a lot of trust between him and Chad. Maya believes that this revenge will save her, but I do not think it will happen. One of the last scenes has a close-up on Mays's face and you can see a tear running down her cheek. It was a great contactless scene, which triggers a continuous discussion of anyone who wants to see this film. Did she get the revenge she wanted? Was it as satisfying as she expected? In my opinion, it is not. It only makes matters worse. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie, it would play a role well and I would recommend it to anyone who thinks about watching it. I would be a little hesitant if he was less than 17 years old. Rosario, Chad and Marcus should be praised for the well-done work. Direction and photography are also recommended. It was a night I liked.
