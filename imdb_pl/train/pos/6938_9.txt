For the viewer who will appear long after his creation, "Winchester '73" has something to do with "Casablanca". While watching, you have the impression that you are looking at the sequence of stereotypes encountered so often in this genre; then you realize that the cliches have become clich√©s after copying from this particular movie and that they were copied so widely because this movie was so great. In other words, this is a groundbreaking job. <br /> <br /> "Winchester '73" is the joy of watching. Broad lines of the plot are in a sense predictable, but mainly because you've seen them copied so many times in later movies, and yet still contain many surprises. Manna's dialogue, pace and direction are excellent. Stewart shines in particular, and if you're a fan, it's "must see", but it's not the only one that provides good results. It is noteworthy that many of the most thoughtful and / or witty poems concern smaller characters. Because it makes these characters (a lot) more than cardboard cutouts, they give the film additional realism. <br /> <br /> This is an extremely underestimated movie worth paying attention to. The DVD also includes an interview with Stewart, which contains some information about the film.
