This is one of my favorite games. It is so simple and sweet - definitely romantic comedy. I really like a movie full of good quotes, and it has ... one of my favorites is when Albert Einstein says to Ed Walters "Do you think what I think," and Ed says, "What are the odds? In my opinion, the movie is fantastic, if you can watch it over and over again and enjoy the same amount of joy, and at the same time you can! I also liked the way Einstein played Walter M. I think that all characters fit together well, and the story flows nicely. There are so many times that I smile with the movie and quote my favorite lines when I watch them! I recommend this movie to anyone who has a heart and likes a good romantic comedy from time to time!
