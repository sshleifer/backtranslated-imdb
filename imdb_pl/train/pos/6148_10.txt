W KOCHANIU MEMCIA DAVIDA TOMLINSONA (1917-2000) <br /> <br /> When I first watched this movie, I was 4 years old and I was fascinated by the history of witches from World War II. The scene that made the biggest impression on me was the fight between Nazi soldiers and the medieval army. It was remarkable to see this army without walking the body, to fight with astonished singing of their march. This movie is fantastic, from traveling to Portobello Road (which has become the most fantastic place for me in London) to my trip to Naboomboo. Angela Lansbury and David Tomlinson are a really fantastic couple. She is always great, it seems that a good family aunt and David with her always astonished face is her great hero. we miss him very much.
