I'm not a big fan of most anime, but Gundam Wing is really something else. The Gundam wing does not have this stereotypical melodrama that one might think of when thinking about anime, because the number of jokes made in 17 hours would only be in double numbers, the Gundam Wing reaches the business. <br /> <br /> Gundam Wing is just as much a political thriller as a series of actions. Large parts focus on the diplomatic relations of the war, not only on battles. Although battle animations do not have extreme details in cases where animating would simply be a pain, dueling duels between them are almost works of art, given the lively use of complex mechanics and rapid movements. <br /> <br /> As far as I know, this 49 episode plus one series of films was chosen by the cartoon network in 2000 and then professionally named by them. dubbing is simply impeccable. not only does every word say it fits, but the use of voices really makes the characters more credible. Many think it's best to watch anime with subtitles in English, but I just have no determination to do it. <br /> <br /> Not only the voices are good, but the result used in the series is impressive. I will only say that he left me in vain, looking for a soundtrack. <br /> <br /> The plot of this series is what really catches the viewers, and no, do not swing like a prime time drama like Lost, which was made just to catch you. Deep explanation of the plot would lead to many spoilers, because many characters do not even have names up to several episodes of the series. The harsh idea of ​​this series is that the earth and its now independent space colonies have difficulty maintaining peace. In this way war begins leading to military coups and complicated diplomatic situations. I feel that more detailed information would begin to reveal information that is crucial to the story. <br /> <br /> I'll end up here saying that this series is great for anyone who likes anime, anyone who thinks ALL ANIMALS are stupid (they have good reasons to think so), and anyone who wants enter the anime with a serious tone.
