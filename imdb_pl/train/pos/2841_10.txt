As a Paris Je'Taime fan, I went to see New York, I Love You with very high expectations. I willingly came out with all my expectations. It was fun, sweet, fast and fun. The film starts with two hoppers (Bradley Cooper and Justin Barth) who try to reach the same area, but they argue which way to go. It was fun and then the movie goes to the best skits I've ever seen. Of all the good were four amazing. I will talk about these four. One of them is Shia LaBeouf as a bellhop who loves an old lady. The next is Orlando Bloom as the creator of music who runs business with a woman played by Christina Ricci. Another of them is Anton Yelchin and Olivia Thirbly, when two people go to the ball, the character Thirbly is disabled. The best of them is Eli Wallach and Cloris Leachman as an arguing old couple. I would like to point out that Nataile Portman makes an impressive director's directorial debut, and that he writes a skeleton about the janitor, and Ethan Hawke and Maggie Q are great as a flirting man and a whore. New York, I Love You is definitely as good if not better than Paris Je'Taime from 2006. Skits are at a good pace, and the film shows how indie movies really should be. The film does not have as many famous directors as Paris Je'Taime, so it was fantastic to live up to its perfection. If you want to laugh, see great dramatic effects, see an amazing amount of great performances and just have fun, you will definitely see New York, I Love You.
