This highly-coveted movie will be entertaining for many who have not seen some of the more obscure anime movies. I liked it the most, especially after fairly flat opening hours in the museum (although the sequence before the title is very funny and contains some better pieces of animation). James Garner as commander and Leonard Nimoy as the king give impressive performances.
