Miike creates an adventure film for children, in contrast to the Endless Story. This is actually one of my least favorite director films. Even the worst Miike is better than many good movies, and The Great Yokai War has a lot to recommend. It is at least as loud and unbearable as most American children's films. I can think that children themselves will find many things to like (DVD contains English dub), but, like all Miike movies, they may have a tendency to move very slowly. This means that you have strange inequalities in which a loud sequence of actions sometimes appears, and the next scene will go on forever when the characters talk. The story itself is also not very good, and the eternal flaw of inconsistency Miike brings her ugly head. Most of what I liked was from the technical side. This must be Miike's most expensive film and looks fantastic. "Yokai" are Japanese spirits that have different, fantastic forms, and costume designers, special effects crew and everyone else involved in the projects just did a great job. I saw a movie from 1968, which apparently is based on the movie (Monsters Yokai: Spook Warfare), and cheesy monsters from the rubber suit that you find there, have been transformed into more reliable beings using the most modern make-up movables. I especially liked the appearance of one of the bad guys (in this case, girls), Aga who grows a dark eye shadow, a tight white dress, a white hairstyle, a beehive and a whip. By the way, she played in her Chiaki Kuriyama, which you remember as a teenage girl Lucy Liu in Kill Bill: Cz. 1. The protagonist of the film is Ryunosuke Kamiki, who provided the voices for Spirited Away Miyazaki and Castle Howl's Moving.
