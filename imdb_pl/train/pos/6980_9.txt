I must admit that I was one of the skeptics who had prematurely assessed this program before any information was disseminated about him. I decided it would be a cheap spin-off run by Ronald D. Moore wielding a wand. <br /> <br /> I was wrong! <br /> <br /> The pilot leaves a great impression on the viewers. Accessibility is wonderful! Of course, experienced BSG veterans will dive into a story that focuses on the development of the Cylons before the first war. (58 years before BSG pilot events). The pilot also allows new players, clearly presenting their story and ideas in the first part of the episode. <br /> <br /> Do not be mistaken: "Caprica" ​​is not BSG. We are presented with an addictive, brain drama dotted with provocative, bold and controversial ideas. <br /> <br /> Casting maintains BSG standards; Stoltz and Morales are simply amazing. The presentation of Joseph Adama by Morales, inspired by William Olmos' presentation, gives a wonderful look at the heroic father William. The presentation of Dr. Graystone by Stoltz raises many thoughts and questions. <br /> <br /> If the quality of the pilot indicates what is to come, RDM and the creative team are ready to continue the BSG heritage as the first TV program with another masterly created TV masterpiece.
