"The Straight Story" is a really beautiful film about an older man, Alvin Straight, who drives a lawnmower all over the country to visit his distant, dying brother. But these are just basic synapses ... this movie is much more. This was Richard Farnworth's last role before he died and he will certainly be remembered. He is a stubborn old man, like many old people who you and I probably know. <br /> <br /> "The Straight Story" is a film that everyone should watch at least once in their life. It will reach down and touch some part of you, at least if you have a heart, it will happen.
