I love this movie, Jouvet, Arletty, Blier, Carné ... Almost everything has been said about the film, but there is one detail that I would like to shed some light on: no material from a real, still standing, Hôtel du Nord (are you still? that it is to be destroyed ...) was used for the film - the whole scene was rebuilt on the set, mainly because they could not stop the traffic on the St Martin Canal for several weeks.
