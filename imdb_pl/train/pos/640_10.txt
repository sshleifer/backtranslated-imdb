me and my sister saw the premiere last night ... it was so good that we were glued to everything ... hahaha .. I think I'm addicted to the season !! ... they have really good actors, something ... a coach guy and a player who likes pete, they were very good, and the story already has me, but I do not really understand how they will keep her stretched all season ... probably there will be some big twist tho..i cant wait until Tuesday .. finally Jeremy sumpter who is he? I can say it will be big !! he was so good that we fell in love with his character right away .. I can not wait for the next episode ... GO Jeremy! <br /> <br /> 'Aimee
