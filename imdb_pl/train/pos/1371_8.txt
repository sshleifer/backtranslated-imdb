This film is a delightful, light view on both sides, where the scene of the "club kid" connects with the world of art, music and performance in New York (with an episode of the ubiquitous Miss Bunny). This is "Torch Song Trilogy" for girls with perky-post-teen. "This girl" for our unhappy times affected by the millennia. <br /> <br /> Dialog is fast and funny, and Parker Posey's costume deserves - if not an academic award - the Kudos 'wave' stadium. <br /> <br /> Of course, this movie is based on the very stylish heels of the Miss Posey platform, and she is perfectly manned. Like many of her acting works, she may not be very deep, it's often a reference to herself and, well, posey ... but it's ALL WORKING. She is a talented comedian, an amazing artist, and this movie is amusing, she wears it on her shoulders like a faux leopard, and never lets her fall on the floor. <br /> <br /> Mary is a superficial party girl who does not go beyond the theft of designer clothes from a friend's wardrobe or with someone else. On a deeper level, this is the story of a girl and her friends who are carefree in every sense of the word, including other people; and the learning process that care is essential to life. <br /> <br /> The screenplay is beautifully made, funny, and the only disappointing performance is aunt, in a role that was too one-dimensional and heavy; a more nuanced performance would deepen the relationship between them ... but ... hey ... this is a comedy. A surprisingly deep role that gives this film some content and vision of the world is the seller of fallafel. We should all be so happy ... is he the one for Mary? or the one who escapes? <br /> <br /> I rate this as 8, because it is not a great moment in the history of the film, it is not a classic, and this is not a great art (all of them are getting deeper in the case of re-watching). Like "Desperately Seeking Susan", it represents something very real in its period, but over time it can become irrelevant. Still, it has everything an entertainment movie needs, and it's worth seeing it a few times for the clothes themselves!
