Pinjar Mr. Dwivedi is an amazing movie. This is by far the most extravagant and best year 2003. There are very good results in it. Dwivedi knows what can be learned from MAST Urmila. she is like never before. one real great performance. with her is a great actor Manoj bajpai who showed bollywood who he is with Bhiku Mhatre. The film is about a girl (Urmila) living in Pakistan before the division. comes from the punjabi family in a small town. She was kidnapped by a Muslim man as part of a long-lasting fight against the punjabi family. and then follows a series of twists and turns when the arranged urmila marriage is to take place in a few days. this movie is really a very good movie. the plot is solid with an amazing scenario. all performances, such as lillete dubey, isha koppikar (you do not believe, but can also act in addition to jus dancin on Khallas), kulbhushan kharbanda and many more. these sets with Pakistan from before the partitions, costumes, cinematography, sound, and the background result add to the positive points. from the very beginning until the end you got stuck on the spot with a question, what's next? This video is not worth watching, but it deserves to be part of your movie collection. the final scene is the end of the movie. I would suggest to all the crowds of No-Kabhi-Khushi-Kabhi-gum-and-No-Dil-To-Pagal-Hai watching this amazing movie. my rating: 10/10
