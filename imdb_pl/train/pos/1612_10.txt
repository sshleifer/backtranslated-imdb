This film stands above the main cinema romantic comedies. It is practically impeccable! Writing, acting, production, humor and pathos are great! Even music - from Dean Martin to La Boheme - is enchanting and delightful! <br /> <br /> Each character is particularly delightful and unforgettable, from the leads played by Cher and Nicolas Cage, to numerous supporting roles - Olympia Dukakis, Vincent Gardenia, John Mahoney, Danny Aiello - even grandfather with a pack of dogs ! Each of these performers, as well as Norman Jewison as a director, performs in his team work above its normal quality. For a few actors it was an early big exposure in the film, so casting is also unique - and we have many current actors whose careers have been changed by their effectiveness in this film. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie several times all the way - which can sometimes drain the film. What's more understandable, I realized that a few years ago, when I came to the scene from this movie - every scene - the scene was convincing and beautifully made. There are so many stunning and unforgettable scenes, like the original meeting of Cher and Nicolas Cage, where Cage tells his story about misery; Vincent Gardenia discovered with his lover in the opera, amid the splendor generated by his gold mining industry; Olympia Dukakis scolding John Mahoney for plotting with his student in the classic line about relationships with colleagues: "Do not do where you eat!"; Danny Aiello by the bed of a dying mother; Nicolas Cage "taking" Cher, when the aria's delight soars in the background! <br /> <br /> Of course there are many great romantic comedies, including Sabrina (both versions, but most of all the original Audrey Hepburn / Humphrey Bogart / William Holden); When Harry met Sally; Apartment. <br /> <br /> None equals Moonstruck!
