"Cinderella" is a film about a young girl whose mother died and her father remarried. When her father died, stepmother Cinderella became very mean to her and made her perform all the duties at home, like cleaning after two evil sisters. One day the king sent a message to all single women to take part in the Royal Ball in honor of their son to find a wife. Of course, Cinderella did not go, but her half-sisters did. Cinderella was very nervous and thought that there was no way she could attend the Royal Ball until her fairy appeared. So she did some magic and made Cinderella a beautiful woman, but she had to return before midnight, because then magic changes. On the Royal Ball, Cinderella loses time and the clock strikes midnight, so he runs out of the palace and loses the glass slipper. The king then orders the prince to find the women who wore this slipper. The prince searched every house, but finally found the women he belonged to, Cinderella. <br /> <br /> Clyde Geronimi, Wilfred Jackson and Hamilton Luske have directed one of the best animated Disney movies in the 1950s. magic tale. At the beginning of the film Cinderella was a servant of his own family and he had no one who could love her, but with a bit of magic her whole life changed and finally she found love. <br /> <br /> My favorite thing about "Cinderella" is music. When the fairy Cinderella appeared, doing her magic, she sang the song Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo. When I was a kid, it was one of my favorite songs to sing in my home, so I will never forget it. I also loved the part when Cinderella and Prince sang the song So This is Love during the dance because they realized they were in love. In general, this movie was my favorite movie when I was a small child, because every little girl wants to live a fairy-tale life.
