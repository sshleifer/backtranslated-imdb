I never heard of Man on the Moon until I saw this last evening on THIS HDTV channel. Listen, my taste is like every other, eclectic. My favorite songs run from Blue Velvet to Dr. Strangelove to The Ghost and Mrs. Muir thru The Wizard of Oz and The Loved One, Eraserhead, repo man and The Spy Within. <br /> <br /> The Man in the Moon is a great performance, gentle, full of joy and tragic movie, beautifully filmed, in which the actors really live the moment, and they do not work. This sweet story will soon be in our private library. This beautiful story of living in a much better time in rural Louisiana literally takes you into her pastoral surroundings. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to remain stoic in the last moments of the film, especially when the young girl is older, the sister's heart is burning in private pain and forgives everyone. <br /> <br /> Instead of spoiling your joy or boring you with sobbing my boring prose, I will end up with the suggestion of someone who likes movies that speak from the heart to ours. <br /> <br /> If you do not buy another movie, please buy Man in the Moon. This moving story is one in which you will experience again and again. It's a joy and a jewel, a film too rare in this world of hardened hearts. <br /> <br /> The simple virtues seen in "Man on the Moon" are joy. <br /> <br /> Paul Vincent Zecchino <br /> <br /> Manasota Key, Florida <br /> <br /> April 5, 2009
