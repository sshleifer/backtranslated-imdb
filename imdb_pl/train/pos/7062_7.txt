Deanna Durbin, Nan Gray and Barbara Read are "Three Smart Girls" from this Universal movie from 1936, which introduces Deanna Durbin to the film audience. There are also Ray Milland, Mischa Auer, Charles Winninger, John King, Binnie Barnes and Alice Brady. It's a sweet story about three young women who currently live in Switzerland with their divorced mother who hears that their father (Winninger) will get married again. Not seeing him for 10 years and knowing that his mother still loves him, they board a ship to America, with the help of a housekeeper / nanny, determined to break the wedding. Realizing that the intended, called "Precious" (Barnes) is nothing more than a seeker of gold aided and abetted by her mother (Brady), they organize her performance with a rich count. This is organized by their father's accountant (King). The man he chose is a full-time drunkard (Auer), but the girls confuse him with real wealth (Milland). What a mess. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie, not too bland or too sweet, with some nice performances, especially Auer, Milland, Barnes and Brady. Young women are nice and all are doing a good job. The emphasis is of course on the young Durbin, who is a natural actress and a beautifully trained singer. In fact, her voice as a youngster is much more equal than in the case of an adult - there are no problems with high sounds, just like later, because she put too much weight on the middle voice. She sings the charming "Il Bacio" at the police station. <br /> <br /> One of the nicest things in the movie is that the father, played by Charles Winninger, does not want his children to be around - until he sees them and meets them. Barnes, as a prospector for gold, is not so young, but the girl's mother is looking up there, so probably he was an older man who was looking for his youth with a younger, more charming woman. In fact, he finds the youth he was looking for in his daughters. <br /> <br /> Universal gives Durbin a great accumulation of stars - he has the last shot in the film. Ray Milland is still paying the premiums and probably even for fans of the movie will be surprised by how young and attractive he is. <br /> <br /> Very funny and of course this led to the continuation and big stardom for Deanna.
