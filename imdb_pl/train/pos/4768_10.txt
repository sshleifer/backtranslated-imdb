I loved it and I was so smashed that I did not do another season !!! I would like it to be so! it was the best concert ever !!!!!! probably there is no chance that they will decide not to cancel the show! ha ha it is a pity that it was not! I would be so excited !! I really would like to! I miss this! and he was particularly broken, not to know what was happening to Jason !! I think they should do another ... I also think it's stupid that you have to write ten poems to post a comment. I really want to know what would happen between Jason and Nicole ... maybe they could do it !!
