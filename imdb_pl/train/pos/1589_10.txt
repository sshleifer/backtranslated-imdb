I love this program. I watch all the replays every day, although I saw them all six times. <br /> <br /> It's about two sisters, Holly (Amanda Bynes) and Val (Jennie Garth), who live in New York. Holly lives with Val when their father is transferred to Japan. Val has a perfect life, he has a boyfriend and an ideal apartment in the Upper East Side. <br /> <br /> The show shows basically all the problems that Vall and Holly go through. The main problem is the guys, but it is also about being responsible and other life choices. <br /> <br /> Holly is 16 and is a completely free spirit, while Val is a complete opposite. She is organized, she must have a plan to do anything. <br /> <br /> Other characters are Henry, Vince, Gary, Lauren and Tina.
