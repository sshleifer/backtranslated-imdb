Poorly planted, horrible scenario full of holes, hot blonde is eaten alive, Bad scientist has a very nasty mustache, one man takes a platoon of a trained gunner and the winner comes out, terrible special effects, fix the problem, blowing a monster head ... Unbelievable. The only thing missing was an unnecessary graphic sex scene during one of the killings. Ha ha. Good fun, filled with predictable twists and funny lines. I really liked this movie, but before you watch it, make sure you have a good laugh. I recommend this movie to people who can watch a movie and not take it seriously. I can not think, in my opinion, that this film was made for people to take it seriously. But if you can watch it and sit down and just enjoy it, I really think you can enjoy this movie the way it was meant to be. Very simply. So take some popcorn and a few beers and have fun with your friends and this movie. It brought me some joy.
