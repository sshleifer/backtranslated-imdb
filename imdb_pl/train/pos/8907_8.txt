I saw this movie at midnight on On Demand the other night, not knowing what to expect. I've heard about this movie, but I've never had any opinions about it. <br /> <br /> I must say that I was impressed by what I saw. I was really scared in some parts and I remember quite a few times that I jumped into my place. <br /> <br /> Blob looked terrifying. Now I look in the jelly jar and wonder if it will click on my hand. <br /> <br /> Steve McQueen was really good as Steve Andrews, the movie's hero. At the beginning I liked the old man. <br /> <br /> For the horrors of the 1950s it was very well done even by today's standards. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
