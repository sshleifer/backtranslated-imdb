Many years ago I found a copy of the film "bargain basket" for PLN 1 or two. In many ways, this is quite accurate, because when it was made in 1933, it was a really cheap movie in Majestic's studio "poetry poverty". However, although the movie is rather a derivative, it is still worth watching and provides some surprises. <br /> <br /> History is very, very familiar, like in a Germanic city, people are upset because of some of the last deaths that seem to be the work of vampires! Dwight Frye is added to this knowledge. He played Renchet in Dracula, and here he is very, very similar - though he plays a much more harmless freak. In this case, he is obsessed with bats and people start blaming him for death. The film does a good job of providing "red herrings" (ie False Tracks) and although you do not need a genius to learn that Frye may not be responsible, WHO and WHY are intriguing and make it VERY different from the average horror. Besides, while the production did not have much to say, she still had good actors - Lionel Atwilla and Melvin Douglas - and also used Universal Studios at night (when they finished filming for that day). As a result, the film looks pretty good, although I also thought that Fay Wray is terrible as usual - he thought that the film would not bounce significantly. I've seen her in more movies than most people on IMDb and I've noticed that her characters do not have depth - she always seems to be cast as a "screaming lady" and provides little new in every movie. <br /> <br /> In general, for fans of old horror movies it is perfect and worth seeing. For people who are NOT fans of this genre, it is probably quite negligible.
