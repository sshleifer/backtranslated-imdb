I just read the main commentary on this film, which is on the first page with the results of the vote and rejected. <br /> <br /> Why some people can not make a movie for what it should be. <br /> <br /> This movie is supposed to be a light hearty, subdued cheek, family comedy, things that make children laugh and things for adults, and that's what the movie does. /> <br /> I was laughing at this movie, I thought Carey was doing a great job, and the whole movie (if it will be watched at Christmas) really gives you a little Christmas song <br /> <br /> So for all of you reviewers they stop trying to sound like movie students and knock on every movie, because it's not "Taxi Driver" or "Godfather" and they're taking movies for what they're supposed to be, entertainment !!
