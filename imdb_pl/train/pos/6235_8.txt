This is one of the best films of Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers, and at least one of my favorites. Most A-R movies contain great dance stories, but also romantic ones. It still has courtship, but not as explicit as other films. <br /> <br /> This movie contains not only great dancing but nice characters and a lot of good songs. Music is the main topic here, and it is nice to add Rogers' solos. She was not only a great dancer, but a very pretty woman and one with a huge figure. She also dances with Fred, of course, and they are always a fun couple to watch on the dance floor. <br /> <br /> Growing up in the 1950s, watching "Ozzie and Harriet" on television, it was real for the first time I saw it to see such a young Harriet Hilliard. No wonder Ozzie fell in love with this beauty. Although she had a short hairstyle from the early 30s, I recognized her voice right away. Also in this movie there are quick appearances of Betty Grable and Lucille Ball, but I must admit that I still have to get out of Ball. I can not find her, but I know she is here. <br /> <br /> Astaire, except for unpleasant chewing gum in the first third of the movie, was nice to watch and Randolph Scott - though better in westerns - is also nice. <br /> <br /> It's just a nice, good movie and good if you want to enjoy the great talents of Astaire and Rogers.
