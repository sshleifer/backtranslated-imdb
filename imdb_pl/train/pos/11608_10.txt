It's a great movie. Reading the other reviews, I see that I am not the only one who spills a tear. Tamilyn Tomita acted with such skill and conviction that she ended up with heart and was remembered. In the hands of a smaller actress her last scene would seem banal and banal. You would never guess that this movie was made in a tight, limited budget. The photos are great and there are many famous actors. The script is so great that I can see why everyone wanted to be in it. If you look at the long, long list of loans at the end, you'll see that half of Hawaii rushed to make this movie happen, and for good reason. The soundtrack (available on CD) is absolutely beautiful and sets the mood throughout the film. My only "complaint" is that I almost did not want the film to end.
