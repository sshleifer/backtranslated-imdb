This film will go down in history as one of the best, next to Citizen Kane, Casablanca and On The Waterfront. Somebody please convince Leno to make a sequel! Leno and Morita are a comedy duo that has not been seen since Abbott and Costello. The evil that emanates from Chris Sarandon, Tom Noonan and Randall "Tex" Cobb, will give you chills. Dingman's character as a buffoon oaf listens to the times of Shakespeare's comedy. And culmination. My God, culmination. I will not destroy you, but it makes the Death Star's explosion paly in comparison. If you can trace this hard-to-find gem, do yourself a favor to your family and buy it immediately. I still hope for a special DVD edition of one of these days.
