At Le Million, Rene Clair, one of the great directors and great pioneers of cinema, created the jewel of a light comedy that is light and breakthrough in a technical breakthrough that has clearly influenced other filmmakers such as the Marx Brothers, Lubitsch, and Mamoulian . The plot, witty story of a poor artist who wins a huge lottery win, but has to search the entire city in search of a missing ticket, is simply a device supporting a series of wonderfully humorous comic scenes taking place in the dream world imagination of the director. <br /> <br /> One of the most impressive things in this movie is that although it is set in the middle of Paris and contains nothing impossible, it achieves a lasting and engaging fairy tale / fantasy atmosphere in which it seems quite natural, that people sing as much as they say, or that a fight about a stolen jacket should take the form of a football match. Another unforgettable element is that Le Million contains what may be the funniest opera ever shot (Oh, that blond-braided soprano! "I laugh, ha! Ha!") The casting is also a delight: Clair has gathered a group of amazing, sharply different actors of the characters, each of which illustrates with lethal satirical accuracy the bourgeois French "type", thanks to which the film seems to be a collection of Daumier's prints alive. <br /> <br /> Cheerfulness takes some time to roll, and the characters have not been as emotionally engaging as they can even be in a light comedy (as is the case, for example, in many Lubitsch movies). For these reasons, I refrained from giving her the highest mark. But these small hollows should not divert attention from an enthusiastic recommendation. <br /> <br /> Should you see that? At all costs. I highly recommend that you want a classic and influential movie or just a funny comedy.
