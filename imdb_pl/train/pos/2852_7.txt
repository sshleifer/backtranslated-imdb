This film has a very simple but clever premise - an unemployed man tries to steal in a grocery store, and the seller grabs him in act ... a thief escapes with a shop clerk shortly after him. At all times the store clerk has trouble with the low-ranking Yakuza Chinpira (gangster). While chasing a thief, they catch the attention of the Yakuza, who is looking for a clerk in a grocery store. The story goes into a high run in the form of Tom and Jerry (cat and mouse), but it is added to the cat-chasing dog. The entire second act of D.A.N.G.A.N. Runner (can be translated into English as "PINBALL RUNNERS") is for pursuit, and the pursuit lasts to the point that at the end of the second act, the tramp forgets why he is running and the Yakuza do not remember which of the two guys he is chasing, nor does he remember why they run away from him. <br /> <br /> Like the later SABU POSTMAN BLUES movie, most of the movie is just a chase and action, with lots of physical comedy and dark humor injected to keep the audience involved. What's short is the ending where the chase stops when three men run out of steam and one of the most chaotic Mexican distances you see in a movie that looks almost like Sabu paying tribute to Tony Scott REAL ROMANS ( written by Quentin Tarantino).
