I had some reservations about this movie, I thought it would be an ordinary bill - a movie about the formula about Christmas. Being in the middle of a heat wave at the end of June, we decided to give it a chance anyway, maybe we'll see some snow. <br /> <br /> This movie turned out to be one laugh after another. Ben Affleck was credible in his character, but the real star of this is James Gandofini. He shared his lines with a real joke about him and created a great "dad". <br /> <br /> If you want to have a nice few hours, definitely check it out.
