I liked the movie. It was light, delightful and very colorful. You can see that MGM was showing Technicolor. There are hardly any colors that do not appear in this movie. Each scene is full. The choreography was great. Gene Kelly is a miracle. He is so talented. All dance numbers in this movie are perfectly made and perfectly designed. He understands that dances can tell a story just like anything else. The last part of the film, a great dance sequence, is very impressive. What makes this film special is Gershwin's music. Few American composers had a better gift for the melody. I really like Gershwin's music. It's charming. Ira Gershwin is definitely one of the greatest lyric writers. He is so witty and charming. It was a very entertaining movie.
