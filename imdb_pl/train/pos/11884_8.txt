I consider this film to be a fascinating study of the family in a crisis. When Leo, the eldest announce that he is HIV +, the reactions of family members themselves and each other were touching and at the same time weird. <br /> <br /> I have never seen a family that would be as physically demonstrative as this; no one can shout like that. I did not understand why the family felt that the youngest can not handle the news, but when it was difficult, I found this movie fully moving. <br /> <br />
