For those who think of Dame May Witty as a nice, somewhat ugly old lady from The Lady Vanishes Hitchcock, this film needs correction. Here is everything that is not nice or ugly. Instead, her son George Macready is strange. Just do not give him a knife, otherwise his eyes brighten and no furniture cushion in the house is safe. Now we know what he means to imprisoned Nina Foch if she can just get out from under Mother's dominant hand. <br /> <br /> A really tight little movie in danger that keeps the tension high. The script never goes away from Foch's dilemma. He keeps a prisoner in a big old gothic house on the edge of the angry sea. They are going to kill her, but why. Her troubles do not make sense. Tension increases when one tries to escape after another, but even strangers appear to be against it. We begin to feel her helplessness and growing paranoia when the world turns away from her. <br /> <br /> Director Joseph H. Lewis took a big step towards cult status with this film and understandably. See also how Foch runs subtly through a whole range of emotions without going to the top once. Witty also shines as a really intimidating matriarch who knows what she wants and how to get her if she can keep her son wacko in the queue. My only caveat is the climax that seems too fancy considering the time of events. Nevertheless, it is a good, nervous way to spend a little over an hour, courtesy of Columbia.
