Zentropa is the most original film I've seen for years. If you like unique thrillers, which is influenced by the noir movie, then this is the right medicine for all those Hollywood blockbusters that today drown the cinemas. Von Trier's repercussions, such as Breaking the Waves, have gained greater recognition, but this is really his best job. It is flashy without distractions and offers the perfect combination of tension and dark humor. It is a pity that he decided that handheld cameras are the wave of the future. It is difficult to say who has driven him away from the style he is setting here, but everyone loses that instead he went towards a strongly theoretical dogma.
