This movie has always been my favorite movie since I saw him for the first time as a 12-year-old kid in 1962, when he was shown in a "late show" television station in Los Angeles. The characters are very addictive from the very beginning, it's a pity that the film has never been released on video, nor is it ever shown on television (apparently due to the ban on playwright Moss Hart) / producer / director who wrote this history and for the first time presented it on the New York scene during World War II - the reason for refusing to show it is difficult to understand more than 50 years after its creation). I have not seen the movie for over 30 years when someone who was the main cast member was able to get an "illegal" copy on VHS (poor video quality but good sound). My memory was correct: it was still a captivating and fascinating movie to watch. An amazing aspect of this movie is how many of his stars, starting their career in 1944, became either movie stars or at least well-known actors (eg Judy Holliday, Edmond O'Brien, Jeanne Crain, Barry Nelson, Don Taylor, Karl Malden, Peter Lind Hayes, George "Superman") Reeves, Red Buttons, Lee J. Cobb, Kevin McCarthy and Gary Merrill). Scenes with B-24 Liberators are great, especially close-up photos, on which you can see the details of a gigantic (for those times) 4-engine bomber (then 18 000 produced, now almost extinct). Good insight into the various levels of training that the pilot-cadet passed on to the bomber (obviously VERY biased in terms of gender, just like the trend of the day: only MEN became pilots, women only supported them in their roles - almost unacceptable in today's world). I hope that one day it will be released on video for a new generation.
