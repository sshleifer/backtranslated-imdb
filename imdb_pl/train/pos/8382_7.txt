If you like mech war games, it's pretty good. Some of them are cheap, but it's worth seeing robot fights. For some time I enjoyed the field of mech war and this is the only movie I have ever seen, similar to how it is to pilot one of these great mechs. If you like types, the games you like are Mech Warrior Three and four, and if you have an Xbox and $ 350, you can save the Steel Battalion. The film is worth seeing at least once. There really must be more videos on the same topic. Less rework and more original work. <br /> <br /> Enjoy
