I watched it last night and I was charmed by the heartfelt story, perfect character development and good karmic atmosphere emanating from the game and the movie as a whole. <br /> <br /> Without giving away too much of the plot, it starts with an ordinary joe, which commutes to work in the office every day, inspiring you to dance lessons. Along the way, the hero and various characters who meet in the pursuit of smoothness on the dance floor, learn about others and themselves. <br /> <br /> The story has a prologue about what the dance in Japan symbolizes sociologically, so it's not so easy to learn to dance in Japan, like here in the US <br /> <br /> The movie is light ; You will be laughing with some of the observational gags. However, he is also dignified in a way that is difficult to describe. All characters of the movie are taken seriously, as they are, and none are minimized due to "imperfections". <br /> <br /> I was thinking about social activities with friends. It so happened that a friend loaned me a film about learning to dance. Is it synchronous or what? I think so, because now I really want to try. <br /> <br /> Watch this wonderful family movie (young children can not get it, but teenagers would definitely do it) and smile for the real care you see in it many times. <br /> <br /> they would remake Shall We Dance is a mystery because it's perfect as it is.
