I saw this movie back in the 80's and I almost forgot it when I noticed it was on TV again and watched it. I remembered that I liked this little sleeper when I first saw him, and I liked it even better during the second viewing. <br /> <br /> All actors, especially Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, Wilfred Brimley, Frederic Forrest and Jason Presson (as a twelve-year-old boy who feels responsible for the accidental death of his older brother), is wonderful. The film has a very authentic atmosphere - a discreet, quiet, deeply moving story of a family aching from sadness. Dialogue is rare but eloquent, and the non-verbal act is outstanding. It is something like a simpler rural version of an ordinary psychiatrist, but equally impressive family dynamics. <br /> <br /> Stone Boy is worth the time and emotional energy involved in watching it.
