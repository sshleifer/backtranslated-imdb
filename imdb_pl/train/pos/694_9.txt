Insomniac's Nightmare is a story of a man plunging into madness. Having chronic insomnia, Jack is harassed by hallucinations; causing that he tries to determine what is real and what is not. <br /> <br /> We learn interesting things about Jack at the end and I think that by the time we end the movie we will have "joy always after" Hollywood. Wrong. This is New York, a place where no one sleeps. <br /> <br /> Tess Nanavati (screenwriter and director) has a good movie in "An Insomniac's Nightmare". A talented director and screenwriter (she made this film right after graduating from high school), she has real potential and will be able to watch in the coming future. <br /> <br /> When I watched this short film, I was constantly uncomfortable; between music, gloomy scenery and a realistic representation of Dominic Monaghan's insomniac (as Jack) I desperately wanted to turn it off sometimes to escape.
