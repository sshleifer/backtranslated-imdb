Alive <br /> <br /> Alive is a very funny SCI-FI movie from Japan. I noticed many disappointed movie buffs who loved Versus's debut movie of the director or his third film, Azumi. I heard that they are blood-soaked movies with swords and zombies and all kinds of delicacies. Honestly, I went to the video store to get a Versus but Alive is ok. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a start to the wall-to-wall action, Alive is not your choice. There is a lot of action, but it is profitable for the whole hour of character development. Personally, I think it is well done and worth it. <br /> <br /> Of course, part of the plot is stupid, as with many SCI-Fi action movies, and I think that captions using the term foreign object could replace parasites for greater effect. This film is brutal when it must be so weak that it does not have to apply. <br /> <br /> They kept the budget for the most part, limiting the whole action to one underground building (taking an ankle stick), but the film does not suffer for it. Another advantage of this film is the intense Gothic ideas that are made with great artistic talent during many flashbacks and sequences of dreams. <br /> <br /> Rent it!
