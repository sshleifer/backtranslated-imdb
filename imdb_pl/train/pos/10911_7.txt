He enjoyed the 1936 film with many veterans of classic actors, especially William Powell (dr Lawrence Bradford), "Mister Roberts" who played the role of a doctor and a detective. Dr. Bradford was once married to Jean Arthur (Paul Bradford), "Shane" and got divorced, and yet they managed to live with each other and fight all the time. Paula wanted her husband to investigate the murder case and do everything she could to convince him that it was very important. Jean Arthur sounds rather bizarre and there are a lot of comedies from 1936, and the method of murder is something you will never believe, especially with the California Race Track jockey. Robert Armstrong, (Nick Martel) "King Kong" gave a big supporting role as a bookmaker with James Gleason, a detective who needs Dr. Bradford's help to solve this very strange murder mystery. If you see this movie, remember that it was produced and directed in 1936, and the people in the audience at that time thought it was great entertainment and it really was in those days!
