I was very pleased to see the movie "Milanese" filmed in Milan. Alessandro Alatri is a Roman director who, fortunately and correctly, understood the Milan philosophy printed in the film. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of the standard - in the career - of a Milan couple, from "birth" to death. The birth wedding is so typical of any scheme that becomes original and engages all wedding guests in a story about how the couple came over and fell in love. Life is hard in Milan's urbe and, after sweets, old times have become harder and harder, and finally the product: a child that instead of strengthening the relationship of the couple weakens because "the egoistic effect typical of modern times" personality of the metropolis. The advertising environment with all the "creative" atmosphere of stress helps you get involved in the story. We lose our life values ​​and this is well and deeply reflected in this nice and sharp film by director Senza Pelle. <br /> <br /> The actors are well-chosen, Stefania Rocca nice and well-characterized, and positive surprise, unexpected good Fabio Volo, well known by the "trash" TV series: Le Iene. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7/10
