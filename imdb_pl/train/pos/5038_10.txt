What a real feast and quite unexpected. That's the real thriller movie. I popped into the video shop, grabbed the movie without reading the whole blurb on my back and hoping for the best. I was completely surprised and delighted. I really liked the actors and their characters. I thought everyone gave a great performance and made their characters realistic. The story was well thought out, well written and directed. It interested you from the beginning to the end and never bored you for one minute. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie for those who like thrillers, especially thrillers that are at a good pace and those that attract attention. Definitely 10 out of 10 from me.
