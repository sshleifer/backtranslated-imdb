Each movie with Bette Davis stars is worth living. Before Davis, he collaborates with Leslie Howard in the movie "Of Human Bondage," in which she participated in many films. Legend has it that Davis was "robbed" of an Oscar from 1935. For the role of waitress speaking in bows, unmarried mother and manipulating user-boyfriend, Mildred Rogers. The story says that AFI comforted Davis by awarding her the first Oscar for playing Joyce Heath in "Dangerous." I imagine that fans of Davis "Of Human Bondage" who agree with the legend of plundering the Oscars, will, according to my critics, have a contrast with the 1934 film, for which AFI did not grant their performance and the film "Dangerous" from 1936 which she received her first Oscar in 1937. <br /> <br /> I tried to browse all Bette Davis films, television interviews, movies, ads from World War II and TV shows in popular series. In retrospect, it's easy to see why this film "Of Human Bondage" gave Davis a chance to be nominated for her performance. She was only 25 years old when the film was finished and she just got to the red Hollywood carpet. The audience began to notice Bette Davis as a star because of her performance in "Of Human Bondage." It makes her a legendary performance. But RKO saw her grandeur in "The Man Who Played God" and borrowed it from the Warners to play Rogers. <br /> <br /> I'm going to go with AFI, in retrospect, about 41 years after their apt decision to award Davis Oscar in the category "Best Actress" for "Dangerous" 2 years later. In this way, AFI could play a significant role in extracting the best of one of the most talented Hollywood actors in the 20th century. Because of "Of Human Bondage," Davis knew for certain that he must reach deep into himself to find performances that brought her a golden statue. No doubt she deserved more than 2 Oscars; Maybe up to 6. <br /> <br /> "Dangerous" is an example of a contrast in the depths of Davis' acting characteristics. Because in "Dangerous" (1936) he becomes the greatest actor of the 20th century. Davis is as good as Joyce Heath, he's dead on the red carpet. While in "Of Human Bondage" Davis is on the edge, still on the sidewalk and ready to take off in the rest of his 60-year acting career. <br /> <br /> Perhaps by not admitting her this legendary Oscar in 1935, instead of the birth of the star, the actor was encouraged to reach beyond the star for the greatest work of the talented actor. <br /> <br /> It is known that her contemporary opponent was Joan Crawford; a star whose performances still do not match Davis. " Even Anna Nicole Smith was a "star". Howard Stern is also the "star" of the radio host. Many people on stage and silver screen are stars. Few have become great actors. The key difference between them is something that Bette Davis can sense: the difference between wanting to do great acting or being a star. <br /> <br /> Try to compare these two movies just like me, watching them right after another. Maybe you'll recognize what I did with AFI and me. Davis was close to becoming one of the greatest actors of the 20th century at 25yo and achieved his goal at the age of 27. She spent another 50 years setting the bar so high that it was not achieved. . . <br /> <br /> If AFI sent her a message that she had come to "Of Human Bondage", Davis' life history as a great actor could have been introduced into the star.
