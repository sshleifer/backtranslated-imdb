This movie was charming. The accountant wants more from life than approved conventional success. What makes it work so well and makes it so different from a standard dance movie is that it's not really about becoming a "big one", it's just about finding a way to express yourself . The big triumph at the end is not winning the competition, not discovering a completely new lifestyle, but a simple joy of doing what you want to fulfill in other parts of your life. Nobody discovers their passion, finds their peaceful soul. <br /> <br /> The Japanese origin makes the subtle oppression and "secret life" of ballroom dancing understandable and personal. We all see ourselves in everyman.
