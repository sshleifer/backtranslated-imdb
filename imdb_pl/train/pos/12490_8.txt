Allen and Julie move into the cabin in the mountains after murdering their daughter. Nobody knows who killed a little girl, but that's why they moved to the mountains. So the couple moves into this cabin and is haunted by people who killed themselves there and no one in the nearby city wants to talk about it. <br /> <br /> This movie has a lot of terror and has many parts that made me jump. Some parts are predictable, but from time to time there is a part that I did not expect. It was a pretty good movie that was not the scariest movie in the world, but it was still scary enough to be quite good. <br /> <br /> I also liked the ending because it left the viewer to decide how it would end. It's also a sad movie, but a well-made horror movie.
