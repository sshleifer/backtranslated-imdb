A big movie with music on Broadway. Nathan (Frank Sinatra) loves to throw dice and organize illegal nonsense games. A blonde girl who loves Adelaide (Vivian Blaine) wants to marry him if she gives up her nonsense. Decides to play the last game when Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando!), Who bets big bets, is in the city. He bets Sky so he can not take the Sarah Brown mission employee (Jean Simmons) with him to Havana. This may sound like a weird summary of the story, but it's the same with the movie! <br /> <br /> This is a real mixed bag - there are some great things here. All songs are good and the dance is amazing. The real cork of the show is in the crap game at the end. Also, Brando is really quite good - it may seem strange to think that he sings and dances, but it draws you away. I must admit that the large, cumbersome Brando detached himself from the difficult dance moves was very funny! Sinatra is pretty good too, and Blaine is just wonderful as his long-suffering girlfriend. Her songs and dance numbers are clearly underlined here. <br /> <br /> Now when it comes to bad parties - Jean Simmons is a great actress, but she got stuck in a colorless role and can not do much with her. The film is too long for 150 minutes - the scenes between Brando and Simmons really stretch and should be shortened. Also, most characters speak very precisely in English - cramps are never used. Maybe I'm trying to entertain myself by leaving the mouths of gangsters, but I think that it is shocking and constantly throwing me out of the movie. <br /> <br /> It's worth grabbing for songs and dances, but it will take more than you to reach after a while. I give him 7.
