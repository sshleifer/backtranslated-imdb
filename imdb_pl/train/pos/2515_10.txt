Moon Child, with the participation of Japanese rockers Hyde and Gackt, was a better movie than I expected. In fact, I was very impressed and immediately became one of my favorite movies. <br /> <br /> The story set in Mallepia tells about a group of street orphans, Sho, brother Sho Shinji and Toshi, who rob and murder to earn a living. On one of the looters Sho meets the vampire Hyde Kei in the sun. The real nature of Kei is shown through rough events, but no one shuns him. <br /> <br /> Time passes and implies that the immortal, never-changing Kei raised Sho, and both have an extremely close proximity. Sho and Kei then meet their son in an outrageous battle with weapons and become fast friends. Both Kei and Hyde fall in love with their son's sister, Yi-Che. <br /> <br /> Time flips again and shows an adult Sho, this time deprived of Kei. He also explains that Sho and the Son have become enemies. <br /> <br /> Through the tragedy after the tragedy, the film immerses itself in the reality of life and all its difficulties, focusing on friendship and love. It is a really moving film that is both sad and beautiful. <br /> <br /> When it comes to acting, I think that Gackt did a great job. Hyde did an amazing job for the first timer. <br /> <br /> The pictures were beautiful, but there were rare and short gruesome pictures in the film. <br /> <br /> All in all I have to say this movie is amazing, moving and I highly recommend it.
