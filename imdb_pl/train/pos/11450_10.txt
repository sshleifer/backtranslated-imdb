This movie is stunningly beautiful. Goldsworthy's art really benefits from the medium of film because you can see art in its most beautiful, moving, changing and flourishing. I highly recommend this movie to everyone. I have nothing else to say about it. It's just the kind of movie you MUST see because it's so visually appealing and left me very refreshed when I left the theater.
