I lived in Tokyo for seven months. Knowing the reality of long train journeys, bicycle rides from the train station, soup stalls and other typical scenes presented so well, it certainly increased my own appreciation for this film, which I really, really liked. In this movie, there are aspects of Japanese life painted in vivid colors, but you do not have to speak Japanese to enjoy this movie. The director's tricks were mostly subtle; I found his backlighting of a character called Tamako Tamura with a soft filter, making it sublime, a little imaginary, but most of the directors' tricks were so delicate that I was fully drawn in and just danced with his heroes. Or he cried. Or he laughed loudly. Great. A +.
