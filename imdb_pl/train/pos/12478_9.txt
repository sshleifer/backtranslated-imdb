What a beautiful film warming up the heart. The story is about a small five-year-old girl who lost her daddy and can not cope. Her mother is also very worried ... only a miracle can alleviate their misfortune. Which hope of all viewers will materialize. Samantha Mathis is a genius as a little girl's mother, because she was a nanny in "Jack and Sarah", worth watching if you like both Samantha Mathis and the happy one; a year of tears jerking movies! Ellen Burstyn is always a lovely grandmother in this tender and wonderfully played movie. Jodelle Ferland (a small five-year-old) is a charming and convincing young actress. The film is based on a true story that moves him so much. "Syrenka" is a tribute to the milk of human goodness, which is clearly illustrated and clearly located around us in this difficult world in which we live. all hope, realizing that there are many lovely people in the world who have a lot of love.
