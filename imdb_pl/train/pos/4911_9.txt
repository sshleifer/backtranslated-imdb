This film over the last ten years has become one of my favorite pseudo noir experiences. The three story lines given to us by Kazan have their unique and separate pleasures. A homely chat between Bel Geddes and Widmark, traffic between rooms, small gestures, such as Barbara's telephone book, he lays on a chair under his son so he can reach the table, these small intimate exchanges between husband and wife, everything is well made and natural. More than anything else, I love their porch, the other living room where it's clear that they spend most of their summer time. The second theme is a professional relationship between many people in the film, but above all between the characters of Widmark and Douglas. Maybe it is not completely original and is a bit strange, but in total it turns out to be real, respectful and efficient. The third thread, a grungy tale about Black and his torn gang, brings us closer to the dark and scary world of noir. Blackie Balance is as cold as a block of ice. This self-styled business man, this self-proclaimed man clearly has a complexity to which we are only briefly involved. For me, this movie is still a completely satisfying experience.
