A warm, sweet and extremely charming movie about two antagonistic employees in the same store (James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan), who lead an affair through the mailbox without knowing it. The key to the success of this film is that Ernst Lubitsch does not allow any syrupy sentiment and calls his actors to give little expressive, unnecessary performances. As a result, you fall in love with all of them. <br /> <br /> The film has a very strong melancholy trend that I appreciate. Loneliness is the main theme, apparently represented by the figure of the store owner and manager, wonderfully played by Frank Morgan. He discovers that he is cheated by his wife and realizes that the successful life he has created for himself is not enough not to feel lonely when there is no partner to share it. This makes the timid romance between Stewart and Sullavan all the more moving, because they both reach out to the invisible one who thinks of himself as a soul mate before they meet. Of course, we know that everything will end in the end, but the film does not let us forget the grim feeling that each of them will feel if it turns out that reality does not fulfill fantasy. <br /> <br /> Lubitsch fills his film with a cast in a crackerjack with lots of chemistry. A small group of shop employees refer to each other in the whole film as a small family and it feels exactly like that. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful, underestimated romance. <br /> <br /> Grade: A +
