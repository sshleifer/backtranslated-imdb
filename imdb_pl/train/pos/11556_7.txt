Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau started and finished their careers together. Remember that the Grumpiest of Old Men, as well as the Oddest Couple who have ever made us laugh, Lemmon and Matthau have been one of the most-loved Hollywood comedy bands of the last 100 years. They were not as "dirty" as Pryor and Wilder, but they were a classic comedy band that reflected the more modern Marx Brothers routine. Such as a physical comedy, as well as a mix of chaos, which Marx, Chaplin and Keaton were famous for. In Odd Couple Lemmon and Matthau are playing complete opposites that create chaos. Physical comedy is as unique as Chaplins. The joke is usually on them, as opposed to passing a joke on another. This is not a typical movie for men, but it is in a way a comedy about a mature age with two old men, unlike two young teenagers. The chemistry between Lemmon and Matthau is entertaining enough. Although this movie is not for everyone, it's a great comedy.
