My grandma bought this movie for me when I was 5 (I always love scary movies) and even then I liked it. The atmosphere is amazing and the story is original and fun. I especially like the scenes where the RV is attacked in the desert. The rocks are really convincing for such a low budget. Acting is above average for this type of movie, and the music is amazing. It is definitely a valued jewel. I recommend to anyone who likes these weird films from the late seventies, early eighties, such as "Alice, sweet Alice", "Poor pretty Eddie", "Nightmare", "Hospital massacre" and "Alien Returns, Deadly Spawn". classic!
