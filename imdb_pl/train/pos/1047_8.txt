It may be (or not) considered interesting, because the only reason I really checked this movie was because I wanted to see the performance of a man who defeated Humphrey Bogart in his CASABLANCA (role 10/10 for Best actor Oscar. Oscar God, but Paul Lukas did a great job and deserved a nomination, at least.) I'm glad I checked this movie because I liked it a lot. I think the movie preached a little, but not only did not it bother me that I liked it speeches and I never got bored of them. <br /> <br /> Acting was great in this film, I especially liked Paul Lukas, Lucile Watson (rightly nominated for an Oscar), Bette Davis (unlawfully nominated), George Coulouris and Strangely enough, Eric Roberts, who plays the middle child I really liked his character: a strange-looking boy who speaks like some kind of philosopher. He just smashes me, even the name of the character (Bodo) is ridiculous. Endin g, in which Lukas' character was forced to do something that he considered bad, even though he did it for all the right reasons, he also worked for me. I agreed with why he felt he must do what he did and understand why he could not explain it. The message of this film is good and noble, the scenery (or home) is beautiful, and the acting is perfect. Watch this video if you ever get a chance. <br /> <br /> 9/10
