I have no idea why this movie is doing so bad rap so many IMDb users (some say it's his "worst film in history".) Did not any of you see Cradle 2 The Grave?) My favorite criticism is that the story is completely stupid and just a pretext to hang all the action sequences. Duh! What did you expect from the Jet Li film? Did you really believe that someone invented the story and then loaded it with the action? Of course not! A black mask is an amazing action from wall to wall for almost the entire time of its operation. It is also wonderfully macabre and we have a lot of severed limbs, decapitation and creative ways of watching bad guys (and quite a lot of innocent people!). They are killed. Most of Li's other martial arts films are pre-school compared to the Black Mask; there is no need to refrain from unreasonable violence, bloodshed or action sequences! And that made me a happy camper. Again: if you enter the movie Jet Li, expecting a great dialogue and intriguing storyline, you go for the wrong reasons. The black mask is probably my favorite movie (although watch out for scary dubbing).
