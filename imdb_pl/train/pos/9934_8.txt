"Domino" was widely condemned on this site due to the crazy style of editing and "disgusting" photography. It's critics who cite its exterior and criticize its use of "style over the substance." I could not disagree any more. I believe that Domino is the absolute peak of Tony Scott's film career. <br /> <br /> After creating the dominant style of Hollywood action movie in the late eighties and early nineties, Tony Scott was getting closer and closer to the more subjective style of cinema. Already in "Crimson Tide" Scott used his stylistic talent to portray the inner worlds of his characters - the claustrophobia and drama inherent in the conflict aboard a nuclear submarine embodied the perfect use of long lenses combined with framing at an angle. This was then transferred to "Enemy Of The State" and "Spy Game", which visually represented the worlds of surveillance and espionage. <br /> <br /> "Man On Fire" was an extreme departure, a transition to more painterly expressionism. Here Scott used an obsolete hand-held camera with an arm and a flash to express the explosive rage of his character. Although he did not quite succeed, he introduced techniques to find full expression in "Domino" <br /> <br /> In the device for framing the interrogation FBI "Domino" presents the life of the infamous bounty hunter through her narrative chaotic fragments of memory. He grasps memories, just like all fragments, flashes and short fragments. Because Domino transmits his story verbally, Scott passes it visually, illustrating not only the events he describes, but also the point of view that leads them. She has "traces of mescaline" in her system, but her individual vision is still unusual - like a woman who has avoided the luxury of hunting prizes. <br /> <br /> That's when Domino starts talking about the events that led to her captivity, and Scott really lets himself be rip. Together with the filmmaker Dan Mindel and composer Harry-Gregson Williams William, he orchestrates the postmodern canvas of modern America. We are gradually beginning to realize that although Domino is unusual, she is no more separate than the "90210" culture she has rejected. In the midst of this cultural melange, Scott makes the viewer more aware of the innocence that he destroys by the handicapped children who narrate the story. Ultimately Scott presents their salvation as the only escape from a surreal journey. <br /> <br /> Criticizing this film for being too stylized is similar to criticizing Picasso or Pollock for not representing what is recognizable human. Like every wonderful painting, the meaning in "Domino" is on the surface, and the surface is everything. <br /> <br /> I'm not affiliated with Scott Free, but I've always been and still will be a great admirer of Tony Scott's work
