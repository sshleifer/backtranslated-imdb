This is a great movie from the lost age of reactionary television drama. My favorite actor, Robert Culp, skilfully sketches the trajectory through tense liberal reason and faith in the system, kneejerk conservatism and fear of crime and murderous psychosis. Teens are a collection of pure mocking stereotypes of evil, and the possible message of this movie makes the Dragnet episodes look even in comparison. But what really shines is the great pace of the film, the gradual building of fear and paranoia, and the impression of the entire California scenery. As I remember, the cars are really great. I give this film 10 and oppose anyone who watches this movie and does not enjoy every minute. Remember that just because it is produced for television does not mean that it is not a great art.
