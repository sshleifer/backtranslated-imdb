"FULL HOME", in my opinion, is an absolute classic ABC! I'm not sure I've never seen each episode, but I still liked it. One of my favorite episodes is the marriage of Jesse (John Stamos) and Rebecca (Lori Loughlin). If you want to know how funny it was, you would have to see it yourself. It was two-part, so you had to see both parts. Another of my favorite episodes is Jesse, Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin) and Michelle (Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen) are locked up at the gas station for Michelle's birthday. You would also have to see it yourself if you want to know how and why it happened. I also have many others that I like. Everyone always gave a good performance, the spectacle was spectacular, the costumes were well designed, and the writing was always very strong. In summary, even if you can now observe this in syndication, I strongly recommend catching it in case it disappears from the air for good.
