The Invisible Ray is an excellent show of both the acting talents of Boris Karloff and Bel Lugosi. Karloff performs a flawless performance as a gloomy and conflicted scientist who seems to submit his scientific achievements over relationships with others, even with his wife. His already lonely personality becomes unbearable when he becomes paranoid. <br /> <br /> Lugosi plays a seasoned professional who is passionate about his work, but he still finds time to maintain good relations with everyone, but he still seems to have no real close friends. It was one of his few roles as a good guy and he plays very well. It is hard to hear his accent and believe he is French. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem in the film was that everything was based on "junk science", but in a sense even learning about rubbish makes it work well. Because ideas and theories are completely idiotic, they are just as "important" today as when the film was made. They are also the same far-reaching - and they will always be. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie to watch. I saw it maybe 5 times this weekend and I could easily sit for five times. Acting is great and learning is fun. I would highly recommend.
