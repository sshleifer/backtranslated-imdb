Continuation of Vincent Price from HOUSE OF WAX (1953), a film that has strengthened his reputation as a horror icon, is similarly bitter around ?? though resourceful? showman. Although the remake, the first (shot in Technicolor) remains the highest effort; that in addition to the comic resistance obligatory resort to a cheap trick (it was another 3D presentation) and sporadic narrative shortcomings (whatever happened to the missing bag, which apparently appeared on some police station with a severed head?), offers more than sufficient Emotions Guignol and the overall value of the camp (Price hamming it in various costumes as the inventor of illusions impersonating the "missing" starlets who used his genius) to stand on their own two feet. Incidentally, the commitment of director Brahm does not prove the usual coincidence? because the narrative contains elements from two horror titles (both with the participation of Laird Cregar), which he previously dealt with, namely THE LODGER (1944) and HANGOVER SQUARE (1945). Young leaders play Mary Murphy (as an assistant to Price) and Patrick O'Neal (as her police detective boy, interestingly, he would have taken the lead in a similar song, CHAMBER OF HORRORS [1966], which I acquired in time to serve as an encore for this). An interesting side line is the adoption by the innovative detection technique, fingerprints, which is crucial in bringing down Price (in a predictable but awkward fiery climax), although the persistent snooping of the amateur detective owner has at least much of this in the long run! Watching the star in a tailor-made role, the film emerges from fun? especially in tight 73 minutes.
