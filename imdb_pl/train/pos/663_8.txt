I watched this episode more often than any other episode of TFTC, it is very pleasant. And it is quite scary, but in a good, weird game. The woman kills her second husband but encounters a problem when a runaway maniac wearing a frayed Santa Claus outfit decides to pay her and her little girl right now. Mary Traynor, whom I think I remember from SNL or another comedy television show, is a bad wife, and Larry Drake plays a crazy guy in a sleazy Santa costume. I forgot that Santa had been played by Drake for years. His Nicholas is an unstoppable force and sometimes terrifying. You can probably guess how Santa finally gets home. The episode is played for laughter, but sometimes it can be very intense.
