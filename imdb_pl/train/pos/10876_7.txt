I was very excited about this movie. I thought Australia finally made a good movie ... but I was wrong. <br /> <br /> It was the most pathetic attempt in the slass movie. I'm sorry about Molly Ringwald who has to come all the way to Australia to make a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> Acting was awful (especially the Australian who tried to speak with an American accent) and the plot was also very bad. <br /> <br /> When I heard about this movie for the first time, I thought the title was pathetic (because it sounds like a cheap movie "Stab" in Scream 2), but I was happy to let him slip, if it was a good one movie. <br /> <br /> NOTE !!! MAIN SPOILERS !!! <br /> <br /> Probably the worst thing in the movie was the ending. I was expecting a great surprise about who the killer was ... but the killer was not even a man ... which changed this realistic movie into a terrifying horror. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie. . you'll probably be disappointed!
