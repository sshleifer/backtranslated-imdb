A very well made film set in the early 1960s of communist Yugoslavia. Five young actors, who are teenagers in the center of the story, give strong, sincere and emotionally deep performances. A clear presentation of how natural trust and naivety inherent in teenagers can be easily manipulated and how it affected the rest of their lives. Highly recommended.
