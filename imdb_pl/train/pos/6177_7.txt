Adaptation of the "Spirit" Willa Eisner to the television screen resulted in many other offers created on the pages of comics or comic books. (Remember that these two are not exactly the same medium). It is really ironic that this is the only adaptation (at the time of writing this text) of the smart alec, wise, bursting, super-hero Eisner. <br /> <br /> The story says that Republic Pictures was interested in making the movie version and negotiated with the copyright owner in the mid-40s, but they were never able to close the deal. The image from the left became the series THE MASKED MARVEL, one of the best in the Republic. Perhaps it was just as good, because this studio tended to DIY with a material adapted from comic books, felt-tip pens, radio and comic books. <br /> <br /> When it comes to this 1987 made for a TV movie, it's pretty obvious that it was a failed pilot for the proposed TV series. While an old, long-time comic book reader like me can be a bit harsh in the criticism of adaptation, a viewer unfamiliar with the character may be able to pass some new observations without any preconceptions about what this screen version should look like. <br /> <br /> Well, sitting and watching the story unfolding, with characters interacting with the wave of the crime, the Little Lady (my wife, Mrs. Ryan) came up with one statement. "It can not decide if it's serious or not!" It pretty well describes both the SPIRIT and its creator, Will Eisner, the true creative comic genius. <br /> <br /> The film is a sincere attempt to put Eisner's world on screen. Obsada Denny Colt / The Spirit, commissioner Dolan and Ellen were really well done. Although in the modern environment, the tradition of "good old times" still goes on when it comes to costumes, you know when men and women were still wearing hats! It evokes this one final (and meandering) point, namely that the director and the production made a conscious effort and managed to give the characters the appearance of Will Eisner in terms of facial expressions and body language. We say Kudos to them for their efforts. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that no series has come! Well, in today's comic book world, adaptations seem to be a hot subject. Maybe a big producer and director can really do SPIRIT first class on Big Screen. We can only hope. <br /> <br /> UPDATE: Dateline, Chicago, Illinois. 04/06/2008. So far, everyone who goes to the movies at Shopping Center Multiplexes, has seen a poster advertising the new movie THE SPIRIT, (subtitles, MY CITY SCREAMS); which is to be released on Christmas 2008. Well, we'll see then what we were talking about. Keep fingers crossed! ABY CONTINUE ............. <br /> <br /> UPDATE II: A few days ago we saw a new film by Wright-Director Frank Miller THE SPIRIT. We have our wish; but is it good or another case: "Watch what you ask for, because you can get it?" Read our article elsewhere on IMDb.com. THANK YOU!
