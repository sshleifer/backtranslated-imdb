When I was little, my parents got this movie to watch it. I liked it very much and watched it over and over again. Even when I was in third grade, I still observed it from time to time. Recently I watched it again, only because of longing, and although the show was not directed to my age group (I am a teenager), I still considered it to be entertaining and educational. This show teaches good lessons about imagination and good intercourse with others. Some parts I find quite funny. Also, this program does not have any bad content, so you can leave your children alone with this show and not worry about raising some bad language or something. I recommend it.
