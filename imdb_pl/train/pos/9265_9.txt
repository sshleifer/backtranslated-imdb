Various film directors from various countries have very often contributed to the development of the film. As a result, we have experienced different species when it comes to the medium. Jafar Panahi, in contrast to J.L. Godard or F. Truffault, believes in simple storytelling; Schematic narratives are one of the main features of his directing work. He has confidence in both the automatic and critical intelligence of the viewer; I do not feel any need to go to Alienation or such things to reach viewers. It is equally effective, although it is conventional. Offside (2006) is another schematic creation from him, in which gender subordination in Central and Eastern Asia gradually becomes clear to everyone, because a simple but catchy story about the film develops. Now, when we are all shouting about women's rights, this film calmly sneaks into our minds and eventually becomes a hump of our critical intelligence, relaying the message that Egality of Human Rights is nothing but an illusory good, a utopia. Paternity will never allow women to strengthen. An important football game in which a nation takes part, a teenager who understands the game well, loves his nation, has no right to enter the stadium to support his country. She was only allowed to listen to the live commentary. Her nickname could not work for her. As a result, she had to go through a few humiliating situations. From the very beginning, her worried father ran here and there for his daughter. At the end of the day, the holiday came when the nation won a match that the girl did not see when she was stopped on the outside of the stadium during the match. But celebration can not stop the issue of women's rights, which remain in every corner of the world in a different format. Jafar Panahi most effectively pointed to the problem of gender abuse, as part of conventional filming and patriarchy. The global tragedy has been dealt with easily, and sometimes with humor, which in turn irritates our being constantly.
