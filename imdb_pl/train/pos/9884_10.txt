Rawhide was a great television series of the West. Focusing on the track trail team led by the head of the Gil Favor trail. Most episodes - especially from the first three seasons, were really studies of Fawor and his people. Celebrity stars came and went, but unlike Wagon Train, they rarely dominated the episodes in which they appeared. Thanks to Eric Fleming's show, the series has become a huge hit. Of course he was greatly supported by a great cast of good actors - Clint Eastwood, Sheba Wooley, Paul Brinegar, Steve Raines, James Murdoch, Rocky Shahan, Robert Cabal. All these actors have left their mark on the history of television. Rawhide captured the taste of that period of the west, which no other series has for me so far. Later seasons had a tendency to split leads and give them individual plots. For me it did not work for a while - riding cattle and regulars provided the best stories. However, there were still some classic stories, and Rawhide remained the most important thing in the drawer. The black-and-white photography gave him a grim, realistic feeling that other Western series were rarely captured. Rustlers, Indians, Commancheroes, beautiful girls in danger, serial killers, everyone came to give our heroes problems. The end came to the series silently when the last season was reached less than half. The reason - Eric Fleming went away, and Rawhide was now a head without a body - the realism was hard to pass, Gil Favor demanded respect and emanated authority - he was never infallible, which made him all the more interesting. We will not see him again. Watch the episode whenever you can, they rarely get disappointed.
