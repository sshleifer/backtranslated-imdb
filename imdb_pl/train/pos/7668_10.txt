I loved this movie for two reasons: 1) Jeff Combs is absolutely wonderful in it. It plays the role of a modern wizard on the hilt. (And he's absolutely adorable.) 2) The movie helped to inspire a role-playing game I really like, Mage: The Awakening. I showed it at various LARP after-parties and it's always a big hit. <br /> <br /> Love D & D and Jeff-squeeing aside, it's not a masterpiece, but it's well made and totally enjoyable. The plot is fast and engages in simplicity, special effects are quite good for such a low budget, and the script, although nothing extraordinary, was not too badly made and tacky in all the right places. A good way to spend the evening.
