I love movies and have comics, comics are different than in the movie, but still I would give: 10 out of 10. It was amazing. If the films have already become amazing. I would like to have her children. And I am a woman. Read the comics you will not regret. Yes, in this movie since Brian P. died, the artist for her is not so good. I'm serious, do not get me wrong, these people did great, but different versions for different people. Different hits for different people, as the saying goes. Any guy who's not crazy about her is crazy or does not like women, or you know, just plan crazy. If I could count on my fingers, how in love and how many times I read comics, I'm sure there will be no fingers, but hey, there are always fingers.
