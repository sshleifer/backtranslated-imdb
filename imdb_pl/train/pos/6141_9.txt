Angela Lansbury plays in middle-aged Eglantine in a war torn by England during the First World War. She studies magic by mail and secretly learns her at home, she's fine, until three children who have been separated from their last raider's parents are sent to Angela Lansbury's huge home. She is not happy about having them because of her secret. They just want to go home. The oldest boy is very difficult to get along, he is a brat. The other two boys and girls are simply inquisitive about their new place of residence and the lady who is their hostess. Children learn about her secret and then the fun begins. Fun and more. Family fun. Laughter, frolic, adventure, something for everyone. The special effects are quite good. It is a musical whose melodies are as catchy as later, like any other Disney movie. Add this to your family video library. You will not be disappointed.
