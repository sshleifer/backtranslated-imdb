Somerset Maugham's characters come alive in "Of Human Bondage" RKO; but the film is too skeletal version of the novel, with star performance Bette Davis sucking all the energy. Otherwise, this is the story of Leslie Howard (as Philip Carey); He dreams of becoming a painter, but he is said to have no talent for art. As the film progresses, Mr. Howard's fight becomes a doctor. His efforts seem to point to bad advice about art; Although he was successful in medicine, his painting seemed easier - also notice the symbolism of his disability, "club foot" (explained in the film). <br /> <br /> On the way (right away, in this version), Howard falls in love with the waitress Davis (as Mildred Rogers). Davis' "Mildred" characteristics are extraordinary, culminating in a spectacular speech when he tells Howard, among other things, that he must "EXTEND MY FAITH!" after kissing him. Howard also plays well, but history does not explain his long fascination and love for Davis; so their performances are wasted. <br /> <br /> Still a movie to watch for actors, including some good supporting players. Characteristics Bette Davis was known for inspiring the "record" campaign for the Best Actress Academy award from 1934. For the sake of order, she took third place. The results were as follows: <br /> <br /> 1. Claudette Colbert - "It Happened One Night" <br /> <br /> 2. Norma Shearer - "The Barretts of Wimpole Street" <br /> <br / > 3. Bette Davis - "Of Human Bondage" <br /> <br /> 4. Grace Moore - "One Night of Love" <br /> <br /> ******* Of Human Bondage (28 / 06/34) John Cromwell ~ Leslie Howard, Bette Davis, Reginald Denny
