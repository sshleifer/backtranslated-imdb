Paul Hennessy and his wife, Cate, have to deal with two teenage daughters and a strange son ... But after the early departure of John Ritter the series began to deal more with the loss of a loved one ... <br /> <br /> I found this program one afternoon, passing through the canals, and I must say that I laughed until my ribs ached, simply in terms of the form; witty lines and a situation where Paul would mainly deal with his daughters ... Since then I caught the rest of the show when I was free and I have to say that the writing was very good ... But then I read about Death of John Ritter ... Soon then I watched part 2 "Goodbye" and I must say that I almost cried, watching the emotions of the heroes, losing a loved one ... Like Rory, he hits the wall in anger and frustration. ... As Cate deals with sleeping alone in bed ... Briget and Kerry are talking about what they should have done. <br /> <br /> But the show does not end with Jim Egan and CJ Barnes, who laughs greatly as Cate's father tries to protect his family and give Rory a "talk about problems with people" ... But the real jewel is CJ ... who is absolutely funny as a wild cousin. <br /> <br /> There will always be John Ritter's masterpiece.
