There is one detail, which is not very common in Jackie Khan's films, but which is present here. It has a very difficult and serious atmosphere inside, while fun elements are also present. Jackie is dangerous and psychotic here. He is not a hero who is attacked, and then he fights back (in the usual easy way), but he can go away and start the confusion. His way of beating this evil guy with glasses is amazing. Each time it "breaks!". I especially like the scene in which Jackie goes to the pub and throws himself at the villains who stood by his girlfriend. This is one of the best hits on the screen. In addition, the whole scene is shot against a certain action figure painted on the wall (it also looks like a poster "rabochiy" from our Soviet era) and a few lines in Russian on the left (I noticed quite accidentally). It looks great (and nostalgic for the Russians). I also like when the windows are broken in movies. There are many such things here. It's amazing that heroes padać / skaczą / biegają / drive through different windows. <br /> <br /> All three movies are great. I was preparing to watch the lower quality, but I saw the perfect trilogy with intuition and amazing acrobatics (and not only the character of Jackie Chan appears in all three films - it is also excellent and maintains continuity). <Br /> <br /> I would like to describe each movie in a few words: No. 1 - great (in every respect - it's one thrilling story from the very beginning to the very end) and funny (many scenes are funny); No. 2 - madness (Jackie is really * heard *) and painful (Jackie is tortured); No. 3 - unbelievable (the woman who fights Jackie is amazing) and bombastic (should I replace many weapons and explosions?). <br /> <br /> As for the rest - a lot has been mentioned by others. <br /> <br /> It is a trilogy that can be seen many times (at least by me). His place is in the top 10 among the action / comedy gems. In the end, it was released in Russia on DVD (the second movie has the best options - Chinese / Russian soundtracks and English / Russian subtitles). <br /> <br /> Solid 10 out of 10. Thank you for your attention.
