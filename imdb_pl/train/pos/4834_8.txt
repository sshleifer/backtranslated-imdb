For anyone who wants to get the impression of Soviet views on contemporary Russian history, this monumental film is a treasure. The story begins at the turn of the century (1900). In the yellowish sepia of old photographs, which in the middle of the century improve to black and white and to full color when history approaches modern times (eg the 1960s). /> <br /> The story focuses on a boy in a distant Siberian village, which is marked by the arrival and arrest of an anarchist in tsarist times. He later joins the Bolsheviks after the revolution and brings Soviet communism to his village. His son, thanks to local beauty, fights with Germany during World War II. When he returns to the village, the oil industry takes off and we are treated by Soviet economic idealism. <br /> <br /> This movie is long and slow, but completely logical and very well made. You can see it in three parts.
