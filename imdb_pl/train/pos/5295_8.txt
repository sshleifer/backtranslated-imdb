I thought it was a completely charming movie. History seems to be a weakly veiled autobiography of John Waters: Pecker's greatest gift is his ability to find beauty in unexpected places. Edward Furlong is doing well, but his grandmother, Mink Stole (happy episode) and all the people Patty Hearst have the best performances. It seems to me that reviewers have no basis for this. They seem to think Pecker is the worst quote of his job as a gospel when I think the movie very clearly states that he is indeed a promising artist.
