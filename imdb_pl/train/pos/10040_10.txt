For me personally this movie is in my four of all time. No exceptions. James Cameron has proven many times that he is the master of the storyteller. Through films such as Aliens, Abyss, and both Terminators, it's clear that he was a brilliant and trust director when it comes to action and science fiction. He sees the story and adds a strange quality to the film. But the Titanic is so different from his other brilliance. The film is exceptionally moving and allows for surprises, story development and interesting changes of characters in history that everyone knows. The story of a famous traveler drowning in a virgin voyage is a legend, so the challenge for Cameron was to make a real, interesting and entertaining movie on the subject. Acting is great because Leonardo DiCaprio, who plays Jack and Kate Winslet, who plays Rose, became stars from day to day with the release of the movie. more intentional, because as an older Rose (Gloria Stuart) tells her story, it's clear that it's the story of Rose and Jack, no one else. Emotionally, this is completely satisfying and can not leave a dry eye in the theater or at home. Music has become iconic and legendary. This is the best soundtrack of composer James Horner and brings so much of the film and the audience. The song has become annoying after such a long time, but I still appreciate it for the phenomenon it is and this film is. The only problem, the ordinary problem of James Cameron, is a dialogue that is memorable, but in a bad way, like in tacky points, but otherwise. James Cameron has released a masterpiece and romantic epic that will take you on a journey of life. My heart will not continue this.
