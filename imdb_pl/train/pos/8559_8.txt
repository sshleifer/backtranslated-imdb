There is a certain genius behind this film. I was laughing all the time. A scene at a telephone sex office where people discussed how love cures the look-alike was a nice trial of this genius / humor. The performance is poor, but you can see the writer's message and have some talent. The split of the look-alike at the end was like ... "OK, I did not expect it, but let's see what the movie has to say." Certainly a funny but sweet idea and very coherent with history in a strange way. <br /> <br /> Is the movie supposed to be logical or to be funny or to communicate on an emotional level? I can easily get bored with many movies, but this whole thing interested me. <br /> <br /> I think this story may have some auto-biographical roots, but that's just a guess. Terribly bad, but good. I am looking for other films that this person could have done (with more experience).
