This is one of the funniest and greatest movies ever! Although I only saw forty minutes and I have to say it's a good movie. The plot, if it's funny, and because sex is almost everywhere in this movie. It's really fun and I can not see how anyone would like to like this movie. I really really want to watch the rest of the movie. It has a little sick scene in it (believe me, it's not very pleasant), but otherwise it's a great movie. I rate this movie on 7/8 for comedy, 10/10 for sexual content and 10/10 for the story. Please, if you're a fan of American Pie and want to watch a movie that has almost all of the sex in this movie. You will like it. <br /> <br /> 10/10
