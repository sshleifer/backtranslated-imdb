You are using IMDb. <br /> <br /> You've made some powerful voices for some of your favorite movies. <br /> <br /> It's something you like to do. <br /> <br /> And that's all because of it. Fifty seconds. One world ends, another begins. <br /> <br /> How can you not get ten? I wonder about those who give it seven or eight ... exactly how could the FIRST FILM WANT better? As a reminder, the long, still opening shot is a great show, an excellent innovation, ideally suited to the situation. And a dog on a bike is a beautiful accent. All this in fifty seconds. <br /> <br /> The word genius is often misused. <br /> <br /> IT is brilliant.
