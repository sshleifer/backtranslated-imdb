In the continuation of the wonderful adventure of Bill and Ted, Bill and Ted are threatened from the future because the evil Chuck De Nomolos sends two evil robots, dressed as Bill and Ted to the ground, to kill Bill and Ted to change the future. <br /> <br /> In the great comedy list, Winter and Reeves stand out to provide the audience with a great humor in this fun continuation. Although the lack of focus on the first, Bogus Journey still has great slogans and dialogue from the leading pair, not to mention the happy performance of William Sadler, who brings a humorous side to the depths of a grim reaper. Watch out for the sequence of games, the best moment in the whole movie, but one of the many great techniques used to justify the genre. <br /> <br /> Although still full of humor, this film has a more dramatic film in this direction, Stawka is more serious and the situation is more risky. <br /> <br /> This gives the film a great dimension and another nice feature. The creators also stretch the boundaries of the fantasy genre and the use of realism, and the hell and sky are strongly symbolic and present on the story. The fantasy genre is back on the spot thanks to the use of this amazing time travel machine, though again somewhat misleading at points using timing, and objects and situations are placed before it happens in the present, which is visible in the last pair of scenes. <br /> <br /> The first watch I hated in this sequel, but the second time was a real joy because I appreciated the jokes and the story more, and although the jokes and conspiracy are not as strong as the predecessor, Bogus Journey has quite good motives, jokes and a fairly stable conspiracy to make him a good family movie.
