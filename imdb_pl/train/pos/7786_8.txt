This film was directed by Victor Nunez, who also wrote the script (Ulee's Gold). A nice and simple magazine, which was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award, looking at Ruby's everyday life. What we see is a piece of life for a young woman named Ruby. Ashley Judd (Sisters) won the Independent Spirit Award for the best woman in this role. Ruby begins to live on his own and establishes his own identity. He explores jobs, friendships, boys' friends, sex, typical searches for young adults. The film won the main jury award at the Sundance film festival. As an independent movie enthusiast, I chose the movie because of Sundance. I appreciate this kind of film because it does not carry Hollywood luggage. <br /> <br /> Although the stories are completely different, it reminded me of Nobody's Fool, with Paul Newman. The later film is a fragment of everyday life of an ordinary person. I like this. The story is very nicely told and all we had to do was sit back and enjoy the story. The only thing I'm not sure about is the title. I'm sure there are not so many worms and years in paradise, like in Florida. Because I'm allergic to mosquitoes, Florida is not a paradise for me, I think about Florida all the time. I'm changing into a complete red ulcer. I recommend this film! Favorite scenes: Ruby and her friend Rochelle Bridges, played by Allison Dean walking along the beach in Panama City, Florida. In fact, the sand is very white. I was there. Favorite quotes: "Necessity has always been a good excuse". "The whole confusion associated with finding a man is not completely different now, who will be when and why." <br /> <br />
