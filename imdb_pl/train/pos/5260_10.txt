Yes, it can be stupid and it may not seem as much fun as a lot of high budget comedies, but this movie is really funny if you really watch it. Tim Meadows always seemed funny to me during the Saturday live show. Whenever he did this character on the show, I would laugh. So after I saw that one night I would play on Comedy Central, I decided to check it out. In conclusion, I was very impressed with this movie because it was not supposed to win any Oscars or become a comedy of the year, but it entertained Saturday Night Live fans who love the character of Ladies Man. This film is also filled with several lines that can be recited for many years.
