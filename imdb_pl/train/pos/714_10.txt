Even if you're not a big fan of Ramones, Rock 'N' Roll High School is * still * the best rock'n'roll movie ever made. Why? Because in all of this abundance he treats with respect the teenagers of contempt and disgust, they often feel (and rightly) the boring, stupid, fascist, establishment world of adults. This last scene is one of the most glorious and uplifting end scenes for the movie I've ever seen. "My eyes have seen glory ..." Rock 'n' roll! <br /> <br />
