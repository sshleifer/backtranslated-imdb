If the Lion King was the version of Hamlet Disney, then the Lion King 3: Hakuna Matata is the Disney version of Guildenstern, and Rosencrantz is the Dead. Like Tom Stoppard's captivating movie, we can see the action from the point of view of two smaller characters from the original: Timon, meerkats with a love of breaking into songs and Pumbaa, a warthog with bloating problems. Following their story - instead of Simba - we can see why all the animals bowed when Simba was presented with Pride Rock. We learn what made Timon and Pumba decide to follow Simba back to Pride Rock to bring down the Scar. We learn how they dealt with the hyena once and for all. Nathan Lane as Timon wins most of the best jokes, but is skillfully supported by Ernie Sabella as Pumba. It's also good to hear how Matthew Broderick and Whoopi Goldberg revive their roles. Julie Kavner and Jerry Stiller lend their characteristic voices to two new characters: mother and uncle Timon. The only downside is the continuous device "stop-start-rewind-fast-forward", which does not always help to develop the story. That said, at the beginning of the movie there is a great zoom. With more laughter than any other Disney series movie, Hakuna Matata is worth watching - even on the stage in a hot tub, which is still fun, although it is somewhat predictable.
