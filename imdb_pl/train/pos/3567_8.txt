The world of Damon Runyon in Times Square in New York, before his Disneyfication, is the basis of this musical. Joseph L. Mankiewicz, a man who knew about the movies, directed this nostalgic tribute to the "intersection of the world", which shows us that the bottom of New York from the past. Frank Loesser's music sounds great. We are watching a great cast of characters typical of this area. People on the outskirts of society have a tendency to gravitation towards this area because of lights, actions, opportunities in this part of the city. It was the abdomen of the city that lived from such intense street life. <br /> <br /> Some songs from the original production were not included in the movie. We do not know if it makes sense, but it is not unusual that the Hollywood musical changes and changes what worked on the stage. This original cast included the wonderful Vivian Blaine and Stubby Kaye, and we are thinking about the decision not to let Robert Aldie, Sam Levene, Isabel Bigley repeat her original roles. They were outstanding actors who could make an amazing contribution. <br /> <br /> The movie is visually amazing. Appearance follows the fashion of the times. When it comes to the cast of Marlon Brando, otherwise unknown to his singing skills, Frank Sinatra and Jean Simmons seem to work in the film. Sky Masterson is after all a man who would look different if he had a different "look". Frank Sinatra is good as Nathan Detroit. Jean Simmons, as Sarah Brown, does a good job of presenting a woman from the Salvation Army who suddenly finds fulfillment in the same type of man he is trying to save. <br /> <br /> Vivian Blaine is a delight. It never ceases to amaze you like Miss Adelaide, a woman with a golden heart who is interested in the love of Nathan Detroit. Mrs. Blaine makes a fantastic impression as a show girl who is smarter than she allows. Stubby Kaye is doing a wonderful job of reactivating Nicely Nicely Johnson. <br /> <br /> Great production owes a lot to the talented Abe Burrows who made the adaptation on the screen. Irene Sharaff's suits give the right tone.
