Louise Brooks gives a great performance in this well-made French melodrama. He plays a typist named Lucienne who, despite falling in love with a man named Andre, dreams of rising above his life position. He sees a chance in a beauty contest for Miss Europe, but Andre is furious when he discovers that she has entered and then demands her withdrawal. She tries to pick up her post just to discover that she has already been chosen Miss Miss and now she will go to the main procession. <br /> <br /> This is a story of love, loss and decisions played on her passionate end. The film is very energetically filmed by director Augusto Genina and film-goers Rudolf Mate and Louis Nee. The style of filming is more like modern movies than the Hollywood movies of the 1930s and shows a different style used by Europeans. There are many quick cuts and travel photos, most often performed with great skill and verve. The high energy of the first third of the film decreases slightly in the middle, but increases again in the last 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> The performances were very good for all directors, but Louise Brooks is especially memorable. Louise relies heavily on the skills of quiet screens, although it is a talkie, but because her quiet style had a surprisingly modern, understated climate, it goes very well into gadgets. The long early stage at the fair was particularly moving when Louise used her extremely expressive eyes to convey her growing sense of distress and alienation, imprisonment in a life she no longer wants. I doubt if it has ever been done better. <br /> <br /> The film builds an excellent finale, elaborately made, strong and stylish. These are really some of the best things from the first days of the movie. And the tragic plot emphasizes only the greater tragedy, which is the last role of Louise Brooks. She was not just a great beauty who looked fantastic in a bathing suit, she was really a great acting talent who basically threw it all away. We are all the poorer. <br /> <br /> This movie is less known than her German films from G.W. Pabst, but I think it's better. I think that this crew is simply better in the story than Pabst, and while Prix de Beaute may not have the deep moral complexity of Pabst movies, it is much easier to follow and is generally a more streamlined, focused work. And it does not matter that the sung parties of Louise are performed by Edith Piaf. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is the classic film by Louise Brooks, which is worth looking for.
