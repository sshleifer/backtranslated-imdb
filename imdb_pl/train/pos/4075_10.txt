Laputa: the castle in the sky is a bomb. The message is as strong as his newer work and cleaner, fantastic and flying pirates, how could it be better! The play is completely amazing, and the soundtrack, which is used many times after this time (I'm not sure if it was the first time I heard it) and evokes in me the most emotional sentimental reaction of every soundtrack. Sheeta, the feminine advantage in this film is amazing, and the boy, Pazu, is also a great role model - he lives alone! The plot is classic Miyazaki. I will not give it back, but the end is really great. I considered it one of the three best Miyazaki in Nausicaa and Spirited Away. You can also check the movable Howl's lock when it comes out (I hope next year). If you like Miyazaki, check it out because it is easily available in the USA. Enjoy, Piper A
