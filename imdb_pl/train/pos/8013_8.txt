Yes, it's another great Muppet movie and I love them all; characters, movies, episodes of television programs (this is the best comedy or television program in history) and all artists behind it. But here they have made such a rare mistake and I am definitely talking about a strange ending !! <br /> <br /> I think it is very dangerous to engage in the American drama and ending the romance by marriage !! We, like all the poor viewers, feel so free or maybe satisfied with the lack of irritation, despair and misery! So we all like stories that gather two cute heroes as lovers with no legal relationship, such as Mickey and Minnie, Superman and Lois Lane, Dick Tracy and Tess, etc. So with all the previous pairs and their favorites, I bet you feel to be safe, calm and calm. That's why when you look at what the creators of this movie have already done, you'll be as crazy as me! <br /> <br /> They made a weak, wretched being (Kermit) married to his everyday nightmare, the most annoying woman in history (Miss Piggy)! This is a historic change resulting from the resources of the American entertainment industry! And it was quite normal to have a negative impact on the audience, who simply refused to bless or believe or was happy with this sudden marriage (even the pathetic frog did not have the time or the right opportunity to think or decide anything!). No wonder, when you know that this movie is the most unsuccessful in its movie-grade earning, earning just 25 million compared to the 65 million earned by the first (The Muppet Movie? 1979) five years earlier !! <br /> <br /> They just took Manhattan in this movie, and my rest too!
