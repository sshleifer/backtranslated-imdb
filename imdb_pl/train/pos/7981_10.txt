In Mexico City, a former CIA assassin and currently a decadent alcoholic John Creasy (Denzel Washington) is hired by industrialist Samuel Ramos (Marc Anthony), with the recommendation of his old friend Rayburn (Christopher Walken), the bodyguard of his young daughter Pita (Dakota Fanning) and his wife Lisa (Radha Mitchell). Pita changes the behavior of cold Creasy, making him live and smile again, and feel great sympathy for her. When the girl is kidnapped and Creasy is informed that she was murdered by criminals, she swears to kill everyone responsible for the kidnapping. <br /> <br /> "Man in Fire" is almost a masterpiece and will definitely become a classic in the future. The story is perfect, never banal and although it has 146 minutes of time, the viewer does not feel the passage of time. The cast consists of excellent actors and actresses, their performances are excellent, emphasizing Denzel Washington, Dakota Fanning and Radha Mitchell. The photos have great moments, and the scenario has stunning lines. Personally, I loved when Christopher Walken's character explains Manzano (Giancarlo Giannini) that Creasey's specialty is death, and he prepares his masterpiece. I agree with the user who said that "Man on Fire" is one of the best, if not the best, movie of the year in this genre. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Chamas da Vingan√ßa" ("Flames of the Revenge")
