Here is a revengeful revenge story in which tenacious Denzel Washington appears. There are three personalities here: hesitant, low-key, now drunk, former mercenary, and then a loving type of a little girl's father, and then a brutal maniac in the wild, seeking answers and revenge. <br /> <br /> The story tells us that Washington was hired as a bodyguard for a small American girl living in Mexico, where kidnapping takes place regularly (at least according to the film). actress of our time, Dakota Fanning. When Fanning is kidnapped in front of him, Washington follows responsible people and saves no one. Watch out: this movie is not for squeamish. <br /> <br /> It is a stylish creation of movies that is good and bad. I liked it, but many people found it too crazy because their work with the camera could give you a headache. I thought it suited the tense plot and it was fascinating, but it is a (shaky camera) not for all tastes. <br /> <br /> In addition to the two stars, there is always an interesting Christopher Walken, in an unusual way the role of a low key and many other great actors. <br /> <br /> The film moves to the basic emotions of all of us, but it works.
