It's amazing that the actress P.J. Soles did not become a big star after playing Riff Randall, the first fan of the Ramones punk group, in "Rock 'n' Roll High School." The soles are so lively that you do not mind that it is definitely too old to be in high school (this fact is even, because all children look 24). This movie is a quick plaything that can not cope; at the end everything is blown to pieces and it should be so. Mary Woronov, an inborn perverse and amusing presence as a Nazi director, at first makes a great, one-of-a-kind piece in which Frisbees fly dangerously close to her head (how many times have he used it or was it a fluke?), And Dey Young is very attractive as the best Soles, Kate Rambeau. The weakest link, ironically, in this "Junior High School" is "Ramones". They can not act, they are not funny, and their concert segment lasts too long. One Ramones song "I Want You Around" is treated as a fantasy and is well captured; other random tracks are good, especially the rare ballad of Paul McCartney heard at the beginning ("Did We Meet Somewhere Before?"). Great fun! *** with ****
