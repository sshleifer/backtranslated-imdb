Withdrawn from the real feats of Chuck Connors and Steve Brodi in 1890 in New York, "The Bowery" is a high-energy and good-natured character. <br /> <br /> But be careful: casual racial epithets come from the languages ​​of Wallace Beery and little Jackie Cooper. The first shot can be startling. This applies to the time in which it was set and the time it was taken. And it also talks about the diversity of populations in this neck of the forest. This certainly contributes to the taste of the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Beery as Connors is a thundering thunder in the center of the action, the protector of a loud mouth with its own fire brigade. He has a weakness for Cooper Cooper. Raft as Brodie is a more elegant, better looking rival Connors in almost every undertaking. Brodie would never deny the courage and attention, leading to the Brooklyn Bridge jump (it is still debated whether he actually jumped or used the manikin). <br /> <br /> Beery is just as bombastic as the Irish-American accent. He is just a rough kind of character that draws children, cats and ladies in danger. This is probably the most noisy character Raft has ever played, and can even throw on a small dance (and show the legs). And again, he makes mistakes against the main woman (the charming Fay Wray) for a prostitute. Cooper is just as tough as any of them, though he has the chance to incorporate tears. <br /> <br /> The highlight is not a jump from the bridge, but a fist fight between Connors and Brodie that in close-up looks like a real fight between clients. Surely someone bruised more than ego.
