For the first time, I saw this version of "A Christmas Carol" when it first appeared on television. Actually, I was expecting to see this movie when it was advertised and met my expectations. I bought a DVD and plan to watch it every year. With the exception of "It's A Wonderful Life" I consider this version of "A Christmas Carol" to be one of the best Christmas movies. George C. Scott is excellent and is surrounded by an excellent cast by Roger Rees! Scott proves once again that he is one of the best actors of our time. Scott has artistic talent and acting abilities to play every role and keep it unique. How can anyone be remembered as Patton and Scrooge? Scott does it easily. The direction is wonderful with beautiful sets, costumes and music that give the film a special character of the time, place and era presented. You just love this movie and put it among the favorites to watch during the Christmas season.
