What Irving Thalberg did in this film today will never be repeated. The creation of Chinese history with random players, even if they are, among others, the caliber of Paula Muni, Luise Rainer, Charley Grapewin and Walter Connolly. <br /> <br /> Perhaps partly because the story was written by a man from the West, Pearl Buck, who received the Pulitzer Prize for his novel in 1932. Mrs. Buck, the daughter of Chinese missionaries, probably brought China closer to America's consciousness than any other person. Not the political struggle of China, but the life and work of every day that we find in the Good Earth. Unfortunately, later, Pearl Buck became an apologist in China, Kuomintang in Chiang Kai-Shek in all its advantages and excesses. The rest of her literary output never matched the Good Earth. <br /> <br /> At The Sundowners there is a great description of the comparison between China and Australia by Peter Ustinov. When asked about the difference, Ustinov said that China is very large and full, and Australia was very large and very empty. What you see in The Good Earth, China is very large and full of people, more than it can handle. <br /> <br /> The Good Earth tells the story of Wang Lung (Paul Muni) as a young man who buys a wife from a large house in which she was a slave. The O-Lan woman (Luise Rainer) wears two sons on him and sees him through all the good and bad times, drought, hunger, revolution and the climatic plague of locusts. <br /> <br /> Luise Rainer won the second of two successive Oscars for portraying O-Lan. She could set a record in that she must be the leading Oscar achievement for the player with the least number of dialogs. Everything that she does practically performs with the help of mimicry, her performance could be on a silent film with very minimal subtitles. I think that only John Mills in Ryan's Daughter had less words and played the mentally retarded. <br /> <br /> Muni does not always appreciate how much she supports her in this male-dominated culture. Rainer helps in the field, carries and raises children, performs housework. When Muni becomes a man of property, he takes the other Chinese wife a trophy that gives him a lot of sadness. Still, Rainer has it all with stoic calm. Still, Muni is not a bad man and he is a tribute to the film and his acting and writing by Buck, that you do not hate him, and the cultural gap is bridged. <br /> <br /> We have a group of oriental players who do more than just Kung Fu movies. I am surprised. The good Earth of all films has not been redone at this time. I bet the Chinese government would even let the US company do it in a real location. <br /> <br /> Until then, we have this great classic that we appreciate and enjoy.
