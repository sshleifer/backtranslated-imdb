I loved this movie. Great plot, actors and good movie plans. He told the story in a way that I can easily understand and pay attention without falling asleep. I would like to know where I can get the soundtrack. I can not find it anywhere. Write to me if you know where I can get the soundtrack. Besides that I could not find the soundtrack, I thought the film was fascinating. Swayze did a great job. I think it's some of his best works. His previous films were fine, but he really told the story for a change. This will go down in history as one of the best TV movies ever to be aired. Congratulations to the producers and writers of such a wonderful work.
