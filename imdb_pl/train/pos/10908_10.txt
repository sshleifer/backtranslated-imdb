I could not hold back my tears when I saw this beautiful document. It was heartbreaking, disturbing and inspiring in one. I recommend this document to anyone who is looking for something that will make them think about what they do with their lives. Or just something that will make you think. You watch John live for the last few months of his life. You watch him pass his days with a positive attitude. At some point you start to notice that he is really an amazing person. You start to understand that he has something to teach us all. His life and struggles will make you cry, laugh and discover that life is much easier to live if you just take them once a day.
