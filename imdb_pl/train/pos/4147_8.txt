I think this movie is not for everyone. But I saw it this weekend in Seattle and I thought it was so funny. I have not laughed so much during the movie for a long time. I thought the whole cast did a great job. You will laugh from the first moment to the last scene. I suspect that some moviegoers (especially those who consider themselves too serious) will be excluded by this kind of humor. Not me. The film was a real surprise. The whole theater was playing with laughter during the show I went to, which makes me think that many people have had a good time and were happy that they had a good time in the movies to change. I can not wait to see it again! If you are in the mood for LOL, this is for you. Funny funny funny funny!
