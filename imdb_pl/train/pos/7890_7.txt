Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare (1991) was the last film in which Freddy Krueger performed as a solo act (not as an actor or star). Years of assassinations affected the city of Springwood. It came to the fact that the small city has become a virtual ghost town. The parents who killed Freddy Krueger many years ago paid the highest price. Only crazy people live in the city, and the survivors are scattered everywhere. But that does not stop Freddy from looking for the last revenge. No matter how they try to stop him, he always comes back for more. But this time he learns a little more about his old life. Can children finally stop Freddy for good? What's this secret hidden in Freddy's twisted mind? to find out, you'll have to watch Freddy. the end was originally filmed in 3-D. <br /> <br /> The right way to end the franchise. Freddy learns something about himself and his perverted life, and he can go out with a bang! Lisa Zane, Yaphet Kotto and Freddy Krueger play in this last installment. Rosanne, Tom Arnold and Johnny Depp have special performances. Much better than the previous one, but it is filled with a few outdated jokes. If you like the series, you do not want to miss this one. <br /> <br /> I have to recommend this film to Freddy's fans.
