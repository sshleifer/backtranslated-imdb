Brown from Harvard is a difficult movie to attach. We expect a lot more in our films, so it's worth remembering that the audience in the 1920s was a bit more innocent. William Haines is charming like a rogue who must stumble through pain and humiliation to find success and even glory. All the relationships in the film are very clear, EXCEPT the homoerotic relationship between Billy and Jack Pickford, the city sucker. The film has everything, romance, tears, love, death and even sport ... It's a great education about the change of society in the 20th century.
