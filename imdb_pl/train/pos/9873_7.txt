Lily Mars, a small town girl living in Indiana, dreams of doing it on Broadway, and her aspirations are gaining popularity when the successful Broadway producer John Thornway returns to his hometown for a visit. Lily tries everything to let Thornway see her, but she just gets annoyed by her antics. When Thornway returns to New York to set up his show, Lily follows him (of course unknown to John), and Thornway finally gives her a small role in her next show, only as a favor to her family, however, Thornway begins to fall on this young flourishing girl and romance, which makes the main character of the series, Isabel Rekay, jealous. When Isabel is fed up with the romance of John-Lily causing friction with the show, he leaves, and John decides to make Lily a star. Isabel returns later, and Thornway is forced to tell Lily that he is returning to his small role in the play, which may also threaten romance. A very charming film and a refreshing change for Garland to put comedy accents in her role (her reading of Lady MacBeth, though she was supposed to be humorous, never threatened her vocal career). Lily rather than romantic. The film was somewhat predictable, and the scenes were not so well connected, but a very nice movie. Rating, 7.
