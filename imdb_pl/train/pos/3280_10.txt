I only saw this movie once, about ten years ago. I bought a DVD two days ago and after seeing it I think it's even better than I remembered it was. <br /> <br /> Paperhouse is more than just a horror movie. He had such an amazing level of emotions and great characteristics. I especially thought Charlotte Burke was really great. It is a pity that she did nothing else because she was an excellent actress. Her image of emotions throughout the film was perfect because she had enough subtlety to convey the message, especially at the end when she realized that although Marc died, she knew it would be alright. <br /> <br /> Several scenes caused me to jump (which is rare in contemporary horror films), especially the scene in the bathtub, the scene where Anna's father chased her with a strange radio in the background and a piece in which her legs fell apart and he broke into dust. <br /> <br /> In total an excellent and very moving movie.
