John Thaw is a great actor. I must admit that I was impressed by his range as a crunchy old curmudgeon, who is reluctant to accept the evacuee from London (epoch of WWII). the film is also perfect. A very moving story with a satisfying ending. Some characters are slightly underdeveloped (especially the teacher), but none of them is necessary for the story. Essentially, the story is about the old man and boy, and the film does not require anything more.
