The turning point in "Matador" is half of the movie, when Danny, an uncomplicated man from Denver, sits on the balcony of his hotel in Mexico City, enjoying a peaceful moment. Someone is knocking on his door and knowing that Julian, a paid killer, refuses to answer. But is he really? <br /> <br /> Richard Shephard, director of "The Matador", introduces us to the figure of Julian Noble, who does not show any exchangeable traits. In fact, we've seen him in action, doing what he does best. When Julian meets Danny at the Camino Real bar in Mexico City, he spills beans and tells his new friend what he's really doing for life. <br /> <br /> Danny, who came to sell his Mexican company program, but looks like it competes with the local costume that appears to be in the first place to get a contract. Danny is a naive person who falls victim to the charisma and charm of a wiser Julian. Only some time later, in the cold winter night, the assassin appears in Danny's door, asking a friend to pay off his favor and accompany him on a trip to Tucson. It is at this very moment that the mystery that unites them together reveals itself in an unexpected way. <br /> <br /> Pierce Brosnan, against the type, makes a great contribution to his dismissive Julian Noble. Just look at how you walk around the lobby in your Speedo and shoes, which gives a good impression of its character. On the other hand, Greg Kinnear plays the simple part of this strange pair. Hope Davis appears only in a few scenes that make us despair, why not stay longer. Philip Baker Hall introduces himself as a link between Julian and his tasks. <br /> <br /> Richard Shephard directs with style working with his own material. The music comes from Rolfe Kent, and the sharp photos of David Tattersall improve everything.
