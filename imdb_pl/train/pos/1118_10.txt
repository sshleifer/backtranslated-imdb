Well, it could be one of the funniest movies of all time, and Sandy gives a tour-de-force performance! Unfortunately, her career has never taken off, but - in the end - she will always be remembered for three first-rate shots: "King of Comedy," "Dallas Doll" and "Without You I'm Nothing." He enters various characters from New York Socialite to Diana Ross to create a biting and funny critique of popular culture in America. Sexy and fierce, tender and sensual, philosophical and melancholy, she convinces the audience in every scene, and she is really "really pretty". Watch this one (if you're not from Iowa), you'll love it !!
