It was my favorite Scooby Doo series when I was younger. I thought that every episode has something more, and the villains had a lot of creative thoughts (and even very scary and reliable). Some of the best episodes are "I Left My Neck In San Francisco", "Twenty Thousand Screams Under The Sea", "The Ghoul, The Bat And The Ugly" and "When You Wish Upon A Star Creature". If you've never seen these episodes, do it. This series was a bit mixed, because there were other episodes that did not seem as sharp to them as "Rocky Mountain YIIII!". and 'The Ransom Of Scooby Chief'. Like the previous series, it was very well connected, interesting plot and well-drawn. As everyone says, without Scrappy Doo, it would be much better. The figure was tiring and distracted from the story.
