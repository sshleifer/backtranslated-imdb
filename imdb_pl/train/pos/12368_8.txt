I had a television with a white noise companion and I heard "$ 400 for a fully furnished flat". So I ran into the TV room, expecting another shift of the '70s and I got much more. Fortunately, I could rewind (DVR buffer) and press the record button to view it completely. (Cinemax uncut and HD no less!) In addition to holes in history and interrupted unlikely dialogs / events, this is an effective thriller worth your time to watch. Enough terrifying and progressive: Beverly D'Angelo's character masturbates in front of Alison Parker, played deftly by Cristina Raines, Parker stabs her father in a bloody way, a clear trio on the stage. watch) The film is COMPLETELY 70 full of bad clothes (polyester suits and cheap ascots) and decor, bad hair, bloated music score and familiar pictures. The cast is excellent, please spend a second on the main page of this movie to check it out. It was a surprise when Christopher Walken, Jerry Orbach and Jeff Goldblum were so young. Sylvia Miles - always wonderfully terrifying! ENJOY!
