Although criticized by critics, Johnny Dangerously is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. This is a film that needs to be watched carefully; some fun passages are made briefly and do not attract ordinary attention to them. For example, keep an eye on Michael Keaton's use of a price gun in a pet shop ... as well as the documentary years that appear at the beginning of the scenes. It's one of those rare films where humor hits unexpectedly, even if you know it's a comedy. Amy Heckerling, the director, is really hot here - If you liked her more well-known films (Fast Times in Ridgemont High, Clueless, European Vacation, etc.), you should check it out. > Michael Keaton is extremely sympathetic in the title role and cast (Griffin Dunne, Maureen Stapleton, Joe Piscopo, Peter Boyle) is perfect. Highly recommended.
