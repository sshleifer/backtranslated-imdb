As we all know, romantic comedy is a genre whose ending is already known. Both cords always have to meet. Later in the third act I tried to find out how it would end and how it would end. Guidance has been given from the very beginning, but you will never realize it completely. It's a simple hook, but it works. It must have been covering many ordinary areas, but whenever it is possible, it takes on a fresh character. I liked all the characters from NY and I loved these places. It's a postcard from NY. It was nice to watch the movie and not find anything offensive in it. So if you like a good old romantic movie ... then this is for you.
