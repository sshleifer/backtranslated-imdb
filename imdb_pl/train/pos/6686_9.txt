This movie was a great idea. It was original, cleverly written and very attractive to those of us who are not really "conformists". Do not get me wrong - there are some great movies that are very popular, but when you go to watch a movie based on "everyone is watching" - you know that you are either an animation or you really have no opinion. It had a wonderful subtle humor - even though most people probably only looked at the obvious. The actors impersonated the heroes with a flourish and I thought that in this film there is a much more "personal" personality. Attractive for both children and adults. Esp. nice to find a good movie that is not full of sexual references and drug innuendos! A great movie that can not be overlooked on the basis of public consumption. This one is a must purchase.
