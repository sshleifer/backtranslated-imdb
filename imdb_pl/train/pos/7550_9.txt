Wow. A really fantastic movie "trip", which has a lot of super-surreal images, dark intentions and a black, quite strange sense of how cartoon animals must see the world. It is filled with a very charming group of characters that bend and flow with a distorted background. As with all cool fantasies, the plot of the journey is secondary to the stunning visualizations and we follow the little cat and his sister zombies when death, deluge, water elephants, samurai swordsmen and pigs that catch fish meet. I have never heard of it, but now I adore it - probably because it reminded me of the surreal work of an American cartoonist; Bill Plympton. It's a crazy pleasure for fans of strange, nice things that made me stick to the screen with fear that I missed something amazing. Simply put, it is "Hello Kitty" without "o".
