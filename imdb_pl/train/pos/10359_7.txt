Meryl Streep is such a genius. Well, at least as an actress. I know that she was ridiculed for making many roles with accents, but every time she touches the accent nails. Her performance as Lindy Chamberlain was inspiring. Mrs. Chamberlain, as presented here, was not particularly nice or so intelligent. But that makes Streep's work even more remarkable. I think it is worth all 10 Oscar nominations. There were several interesting things about the film. I do not know much about Australia, but the subject of religious bigotry among public opinion has played a big role in this story. I missed this a lot when I first saw the movie a few years ago, but yesterday it was loud and clear. It seems that the Australian press is equally well achieved in the pursuit of misery and exaggerated effort as their American colleagues. Nice movie. A bit different. Rating: B
