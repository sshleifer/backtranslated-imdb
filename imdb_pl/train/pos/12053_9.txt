A well-made story about ghosts that will give you creep and some pretty honest fears along the way. History develops slowly, building the atmosphere until you're ready to see a woman in black. You will not forget her when you see her. Without blood, knives, hockey masks - simply a well-constructed story that is best viewed at night with the lights off.
