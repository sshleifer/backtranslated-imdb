I'm a huge fan of John Denver. I have a large collection of his music on vinyl. I saw this holiday addition when it was originally on TV and I liked it a lot. I have an original vinyl album and a CD. I have an original CD and a later version. In the later edition, however, there are a few songs missing. I see that it was released this year with all original songs. To my surprise, I found the original CD for sale at $ 75.00. WOW - thinking that the Christmas Cd would be worth that much. For me, no amount is worth the sale of this treasure. This is my favorite Christmas CD. I could never find it on VHS or DVD. I would like to have one version. If anyone has such access, let me know. Thanks
