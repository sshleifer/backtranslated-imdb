I saw a few comments about Brando with a southern accent, some of whom thought it was a mistake. When this movie was made, racism and discrimination were very strong in the South. Jim Crow's laws were still in force. Civil rights were in their infancy. Could it be a subtle social commentary, a southern man in love with a woman of another race? In the same way, MASH was a subtle critic of the Vietnam War? Any thoughts? <br /> <br /> Another comment was about Myoshi Umeki appearing as "cold". Everyone who was in Japan will understand. The Japanese, at least in my experience, did not show emotions to strangers. There were strict social rules, especially for men meeting solitary women. The Americans in Japan were completely alien to this culture, and the blunt attempts of meeting women were shocking for women. One of the Japanese traits was smiling when she felt embarrassed or uncomfortable, which many American soldiers took as a sign that their progress had been welcomed. Remember also that in the time presented in the film, Japan was just defeated and the occupation forces were treated with reluctance. I think that Myoshi Umeki gave very reliable results of his situation. Watching her interaction with American actors brought back a few memories of my own experiences in the country. I managed to meet a few lovely young women who, after convincing them that I'm not a typical American man, taught me language and culture during my stay in their country.
