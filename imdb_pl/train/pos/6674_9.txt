The first thing I thought after watching "Mystery Men" was how this movie could be so unpopular? This movie was so charming and funny that its status as a bomb is contrary to logic. Well, I hope that in the future it will become a cult hit and you can count on me among his fans. <br /> <br /> Simply put, and without giving too much, this movie does what the Princess Bride did "fairy tales" and "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" for comics. "He did for classic cartoons. This should give you a more accurate idea of ​​the tone of the film, and then the marketing committee, which was unfortunately signed (this is one of the cases, such as "Iron Giant", in which the studio had no idea what he has in his hands). Rent it next time you are in the mood for something out of the ordinary. You will never listen to BeeGees again in the same light.
