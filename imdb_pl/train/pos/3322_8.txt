If you want to see something for "him" and "her" to say, this is a movie to choose from. I am a sucker on com rom, but my husband is not always as eager (what a guy !!!). Anyway, I managed to force him to look, because I told him it was about sport, and you know what, he loved it! <br /> <br /> Drew Barrymore is very funny and her main character (sorry, but I can remember his name) is just as good. When I watched the movie, it was called "The Perfect Match", but I think the title was changed for the UK because it's based on the Fever Pitch book and there was already a football movie with this title (same movie, but this version brytyjska - uff!), <br /> <br /> In any case, all the reviews on this site will tell you more details, if you need to buy them a girl, take it from me, put a hubby / boy in front of the TV on a Saturday night, and together you will laugh and cry. A real gem.
