I was about 7 years old when I first saw this movie. It was not so special then, but a few years later I saw it again and this time it gave me a lot of joy :) <br /> <br /> I think the best parts of the movie are: Yeti's body language also "special effects". <br /> <br /> If you want to watch this movie, do not wait for the Hollywood hit, even this movie was made of about. 1000 dollars :) <br /> <br /> I have a copy of this movie. Film and video version also (but I do not think that it was ever shown in cinemas) <br /> <br /> Watch it, enjoy !!! Yeti forever !!!
