I saw this episode for the first time as a shock to me, it was the first time I saw "24". Speed ​​is amazing and it's so surprising, thrilling and even interesting that you're almost reading a book; after starting it is very difficult to stop. From the moment Richard Walsh talked privately with Jack about the possibility that they have a mole in CTU, I sat 6:40 hours, which means 10 episodes !!! (It sounds funny and crazy, but I'm the type of guy who when interested, he just can not stop) This series is one of the best of its kind. It's built in a way to have several different stories that are connected to each other. Recommended in every respect!
