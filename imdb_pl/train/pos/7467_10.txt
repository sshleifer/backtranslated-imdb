David Aames is a rich hunk who lives in New York. When his "sleeping partner" Julie Gianni becomes very jealous after David falls in love with Sofia's Spanish beauty, he takes David to his car and tells him that he is the only guy he loves and wants to be, but seeing that he is in love in Sofia, decides to commit suicide with David in the car, driving from the bridge. David is in a state of disaster, but remains with a disfigured face. Then he is accused of murdering Julie. The thing is, David does not know what's real and what's not because he still has those weird dreams (most of which are nightmares) and flashbacks, some of which just do not make sense to him. Everything will come back to him soon, because he begins to discover the truth. <br /> <br /> Well, there's a whole cast of the star here, including Tom Cruise, Pen√©lope Cruz, Cameron Diaz, Kurt Russell, Jason Lee and Noah Taylor, who play well in the movie. In the film, everyone puts down various things about characters, such as happiness, sadness, anger, etc. Really good. The film also features an episode from the brilliant Steven Spielberg. <br /> <br /> Vanilla Sky is a well-made, different, interesting and original film that leaves a lot to say after finishing. It is not only a thriller, but a real psychological thriller. The movie trailer is really good, but the movie is so different from what it can be. He was directed very well and there were also some really great scenes. In general, a nice movie to pay attention to. They certainly have been doing a lot of movies lately, "Are they dead, if not dead?"
