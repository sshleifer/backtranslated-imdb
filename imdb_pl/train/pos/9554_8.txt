Lock Up Your Daughters is one of the best thrilling comedies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It is misunderstood because it lacks the value of "social comments" that many films required on this day (1969) to succeed. <br /> <br /> The heroes are oversized satires of everyday people and played by all actors for this purpose. <br /> <br /> Christopher Plummer shines extremely brightly like Lord Foppington, noble with hair too big to fit in the door. <br /> <br /> The story covers ordinary things from the 18th century; they confused their identities, thwarted affairs, corrupted government officials, and joked at every step. <br /> <br /> He answers the questions: what happens when 4 confused sailor-seekers go to a small British seaside town? And with whom do they get involved and how does it all end? <br /> <br /> Despite the poor performance at the box office, he has great costumes, excellent music (based on the musical Mermaid Theater with the same name), great live acting and sets, which are obviously authentic. <br /> <br /> The fact that it has never been released on either VHS or DVD is really a shame because there are a lot of bad movies released every day.
