This movie is right. As a former USF airman, I can say that this movie has everything. Nausea of ​​the application process. I am waiting for a word. Joy of acceptance. You are worried that you will go through the course. The sadness of watching your buddies (perhaps the best) is washed away. The pain of paying the highest price - the death of student airmen. The glory of graduation. Always flying, flying, flying. Many are called, but few are chosen. We did for what we would pay with enthusiasm.
