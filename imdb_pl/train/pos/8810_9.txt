I saw this movie for the first time when a few years ago it was broadcast in the now-defunct Trio Channel, and recently I watched it again - without commercials - at Sundance. I was impressed the first time and I found that I was even more involved in the second watch. Yes, some segments are far from perfect - Amos Gitai's hysterical commentary stands out like a sore thumb - but taken together 11 09 01 is a total success. The best show: the amazing last episode of Shohei Imamura, which modern critics, such as the clumsy Mick LaSalle, somehow misinterpreted as an attack on "terrorists", but now turns out to be a masterful anti-war polemic; Samira Makhmalbaf opens a work that combines deep empathy with the victims of September 11 with a prophetic concern for the children of Afghanistan; and funny crusade of children of Idrissa Ouedraogo for Osama Bin Laden - hunting almost as serious and successful as for REAL Osama. The Youssef Chahine segment is a noble, if failed, experiment that at least dares to remind the audience that Bin Laden and al'Qaeda are basically creations of American foreign policy and CIA, and although Sean Penn's research seems out of place, it's still really sweet - a movie song. In summary, the necessary view and a better view than Oliver Stone's reactionary World Trade Center.
