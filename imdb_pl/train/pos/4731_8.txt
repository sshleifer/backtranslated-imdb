This is definitely one of the best Jet efforts. Few actors are able to play with stoic calm as Jet Li can. The action is fast-firing, and special effects are strengthened for intensity purposes. As a result, Americans can get a little scared. A small suspension of disbelief is very important in the movie Jet Li. I think that this is a great introduction to Jet's work and we are waiting for more masterpieces (especially Fist of Legend) that will hit the American market. A nice mix of shooting and physical conflict will satisfy most enthusiasts of action movies.
