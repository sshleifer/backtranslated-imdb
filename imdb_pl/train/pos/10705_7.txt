The trailer of this movie was not fair for the film. And although the film did not know what it really wants to experience, the first half of the movie is a light, romantic comedy, the second has a more serious, romantic drama, the overall impact was much better than I thought to be. This movie was more of a dating movie, but the trailer became more of a thriller that never really turned out to be. Kidman, being one of my favorites, of course I am biased, but this movie turned out to be a light, sensitive, though somewhat bizarre movie that deserved more. Three out of four stars. 9.5.02.
