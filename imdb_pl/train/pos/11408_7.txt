Etienne Girardot is simply an actor - a person whom people would almost never know by name. However, once again playing the coroner - one of the few actors in the film Philo Vance, who played his role more than once. I've seen him twice and loved him every time because he was so funny and had a breath of fresh air. This film is also great to watch, because in addition to Girardot, there are many other great actors, including Grant Mitchell, Gene Lockhart, Henry Walthal, Kent Smith, H.B. Warner and Nat Pendleton. It is quite an impressive cast and it certainly made work easier for the leading man and woman Edmund Lowe and Virginia Bruce. <br /> <br /> These great heroes are one of the main reasons why I love these old B movies. Although the mystery itself is rarely so great, because of the airy writing and acting, the movies really do. Regarding this movie, Vance is splendidly played by Lowe, but, as I said, the secret itself is just a reflection - with a stupid intrigue involving hypnosis and suicide. Unfortunately, you can not hypnotize anyone to do something like that - I train clinical hypnosis and if I can do something like a bad man in a movie, I would do it! Used car salesmen and some of my old bosses would be obvious goals !! <br /> <br /> In general, although it was not the best Philo Vance movie, he was very good and this shameful Lowe played this role only once. In fact, apart from William Powell (who played Vance five times), the series was hampered by a long, long series of actors such as Basil Rathbone, Wilfred Hyde-White and Warren William (and many others) playing at Vance. This is a similar problem that also harried the Bulldog Drummond series - just too many different actors playing the main character. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing and exciting - but also quite impossible.
