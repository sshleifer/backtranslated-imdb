This game occupies above all the space so far. I had the honor to play on PS2, so the graphics were really good. The voice was above the standard. The level of difficulty is appropriate. In my opinion, Wesker must be the best character in the RE series. This story amazed me and took on many different phrases that I did not expect. The only rating that this game deserves is great.
