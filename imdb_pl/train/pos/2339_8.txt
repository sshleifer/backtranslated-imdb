I love this program. Now, I'm not a big fan of many science fiction shows, so if something reminds them, I did not notice. I like the quality of cinematography. I even like the love story, although as I enjoy it, I wonder deeply, how the hell that this part of the story can really develop, because Ned can not touch Chuck, otherwise ... you know. I even like Chuck, I do not think it's annoying, and I generally hate too sweet, nice, perfect characters. I even like the voice of the narrator, even if it bothers one of my family members and shows some similarity to some Walgreens ads. I could think of all the other things related to Ned's situation and how the writers plan to take care of her in the future, but I prefer to just watch and wait and see what story the writers are telling.
