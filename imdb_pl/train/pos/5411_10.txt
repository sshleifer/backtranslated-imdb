I do not see the point in burying such a film in a sulfur sarcasm, when it is in no way to be anything more than a vehicle for playing with children and preparing them for the next line of goods they are begging for frantically. /> <br /> This is a fun movie. My children sat quietly through the whole thing and loved every minute of it. Of course, the villain is a bit exaggerated with his stupid costume and maniacal laugh, but it is much easier to do than the dark, grim and very morbid Pokemon 3. <br /> <br /> My children have watched Pokemon from the very beginning and soon reach to epochs in which "they will put away childish things" and pass to others. I am glad that we could enjoy this time.
