The gangster genre is now a subject that is too often parodyed. In retrospect, the series is the culmination of previous stereotypes that have been used in its genre, fortunately the writers have moved forward in this gap, creating a realism that has been applied to it. The Sopranos is an epic crime saga that illustrates its content with psychological depth, which is characterized by subtle nuances, humor and impeccable violence. The main character Tony Soprano is perceived as dangerous generally free of fear and moral values ​​by his crew, however, Tony has two personalities who is bestial while the other is contrary to guilt and dislike. Without any inhibitions and contradictions, I still firmly believe that The Sopranos has the best cast in recent times. Taking everything into account, I could make a complicated statement about the series, but I will not. If there is ever a visual dictionary of global consumerism, look for these definitions in a significant, ambiguous, unrelenting, epic, uncompromising way, and the soprano-devoured face will smile at you.
