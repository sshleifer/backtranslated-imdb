Lillian Hellman, one of the most famous American playwrights, was a woman with a mission. Her leftist views were not well perceived in the country at that time. In her memoirs, she talks about her journey to the then Soviet Union, intrigued by the so-called successes achieved by this system. "Watch over the Rhine" must have come from these years. The left in America, like all over the world, had a problem with the rise of fascism, not only in Europe but also in Japan. <br /> <br /> "Watch on the Rhine" was a production made on Broadway eight months before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. In it, Mrs. Hellman heralded America's entry into World War II. Adaptation is attributed to Mrs. Hellman and Dashiell Hammett, her longtime companion. The film, made by Herman Shumlin, was well received when it premiered in 1943. <br /> <br /> We're introducing the Muller family when the movie opens. They cross the border to the United States from Mexico. They are to continue at Mrs. Muller's home in Washington, DC, where her mother, Fanny Farrelly, is a petite hostess. The Mullers, we realize that we are fleeing Europe because of the persecution against the opponents of the ongoing totalitarian regime in Germany. In fact, in a sense, we thought the Mullers might be better justified if they were Jews, escaping some extermination. <br /> <br /> We learn that Mr. Muller had a terrible time in his homeland, as well as in other places, because his sincerity in condemning Fascim. He does not know that he is coming to his mother-in-law's home, where one of the worst representatives of this philosophy lives. <br /> <br /> The movie offers an excellent acting game around. It is a song out of curiosity thanks to the supporting role of Bette Davis. Paul Lukas, repeating his role on Broadway, is convincing as Kurt Muller, the righteous man who wants to create a better world for himself and his family. Mr. Lukas does a great job of presenting Kurt Muller, repeating the role that made him a luminarian on Broadway. . Geraldine Fitzgerald is seen as Marthe de Brancovis, guest of Farrellys, married to the contemptible Teck de Brancovis, a Nazi sympathizer, played by George Coulouris. Beulah Bondi, Donald Woods and the rest of the supporting cast give good performances led by Mr. Shumlin. <br /> <br /> The film should serve as a reminder of the evil of totalitarian rule, no matter where.
