I really do not remember who recommended it, but they said it was one of their favorite movies. It is certainly strange - like rubberizing at an accident on the highway. <br /> <br /> Someone said the truth is stranger than fiction, and the truth is something to see. I really can not understand how the feature description of this document is to be released this year. How can you improve this? Aunt and cousin Jackie Kennedy are removed from the New York Society and hiding at Hampton's. In this way, they become hermits and what is best described as "crazy cats". They would remain hidden, if not for the city's movement, to condemn property for dirt and subsequent rescue by Jackie. This movie was made after this event. All the time you could not help thinking, "how bad was it before?" This view of the higher society from the darker side is completely fascinating.
