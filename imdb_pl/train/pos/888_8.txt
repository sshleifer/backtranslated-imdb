One of the better kung fu movies, but not as flawless as I expected, given the great reviews. The movie starts quite well, the jokes are so visual that they explain the language barrier (which is less frequent than it might seem in this era) and make the dialog sequences without a fight transparent (for a kung fu movie, a great compliment). Unlike other Chinese action films that have always been pieces from the era or (in the wake of Jackie Chan's Police Story I), the drama of police officers, Pedicab Driver gives us a look at contemporary rural China. Unfortunately, in the last 1/3 of the movie, a tragic melodramatic tragedy persists, which seemed unnecessary to me. <br /> <br /> The action is generally good, it includes a duel between Sammo and 1/2 Only two Shaw Brothers, Kar-Leung Lau, and then a fight at the end with a tall guy who always plays the wrong guy from Jet Li. There are only 20 minutes of combat here, which is standard, but I am annoyed by the obvious acceleration of the camera frames. I get that they have to film half the speed to avoid mutual injury, but there are smooth changes, and then it is. It really deviates from fighting, when it's obvious that the footage was mixed up with. <br /> <br /> That being said, if you like kung fu movies, my opinion here will not discourage you, and if you do not, you just wasted 2 minutes of your life by reading this.
