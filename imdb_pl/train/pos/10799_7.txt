Ah, the seventies. The time when he was supposed to be a swing. Honestly, today is also a good time to be a swing, but then I felt more bold. <br /> <br /> Joe Sarno offers a pretty good soft-core movie. In fact, like today, some actors are known hardcore actors. Unlike today, these people were good actors, and these films had a story and character development. <br /> <br /> This is almost what you would expect from a swinger movie. Two couples with open relationships rekindle the journey from the MILF of one of the women who came to visit. A little more. <br /> <br /> Of course, when MILF is Jennifer Welles, this is another story. Not many 40-year-olds look as well undressed as Mrs. Welles. It is worth paying yourself to see how Mrs. Welles looks at herself in the mirror, as if she were an Aphrodite. He is not "Stifler's mother." She is much more sexy. <br /> <br /> I also dug Anna Chris Jordan. Jordan looks and sounds as much as Elaine Joyce, that I thought she could be her twin "from birth" and even Elaine herself. Anna always eats, but she must have an amazing metabolism. <br /> <br /> In contrast to the soft-core porn from the 90s, mild porn from the 70s has kept the realism of the hardcore film (something that the 2000 soft-core has brought back by the way, instead of years 90 music and canned orgasms) and is fully here. This is not real, but it seems real. <br /> <br /> For those who liked the "Deux Femmes En Or" produced in Quebec, you'll like this one. Another classic movie only on Drive-In Classics, the best $ 2.50 CAN per month you can spend.
