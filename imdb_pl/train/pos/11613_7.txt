Distortion is a movie that surprised me. It's a kind of multi-layered drama that focuses on a man writing art about his life experiences that are happening to him right now. To be more concise, he feels his wife is cheating on him, so he hires a private eye to follow him. His wife has no idea that this is happening. In the meantime, the actors in this play also have several people who jump out of the sleeve, fooling around with each other and, say, unscrupulous people in the world of Israel. The whole culminates in a theater in which all actors are present and predictable (but not really). <br /> <br /> The director of the song really moves things along with the cast of the characters and edits the way that makes you pay attention, it's a really funny movie that I did not mind watching and I recommend people to check out.
