Although Super Mario 64 does not resemble the rest of the games in this series, it is still classic and is as good as old games. Games with such number of repetitions are few. Plus this game has so much diversity. Each of the 15 levels includes several different tasks and many other hidden tasks. The game is not too difficult, but its lack of challenges does not deviate from the game. After beating you will want to erase the game and start again. And it is equally fun for the second time, the third time or for the hundredth time. It must be the owner of any Nintendo 64 owner and in itself is the reason for having a Nintendo 64.
