This film is the most iconic movie about metal. Premise: The kid grabs the last recording of his favorite artist Sammy Curr, who recently dies in a hotel fire. He plays him back and calls him back to take revenge in the name of heavy metal on those who torment him. Every fan of real metal will like this movie, and if you are a metal head tormented by jockeys, play the album of Sammy Curr backwards ......... do not wait that it is fictional, get it well and watch it with a fist in air, head banging and volume at 11!
