The key to joy and beauty, pain and sorrow of life is our ability to accept that life is essentially what it is, so we do not constantly struggle with this one irresistible truth. In so doing, we find peace. Elegant in its simplicity, but so difficult for most of us. <br /> <br /> In this movie the director shows us this truth, but lets us discover it in his own way. It's a beautiful but simple story, more of a fairy tale that is played very well. Watching actors is more like being in a room with real people than watching actors. <br /> <br /> I was struggling with how to write a review of this amazing movie so that others would be motivated to see it. I'm at a loss. The story is about men in the bathhouse. Sounds like a real turn off, right? But nothing can be further from the truth. The American title of this film is a Shower, but it is almost the antithesis of the main theme of the film, which is a bath. I'm still in fear. Talking about history or heroes will not do them justice. <br /> <br /> I will tell you only how much I liked watching this movie and how touching and moving it was. I was also quite funny. I was very concerned about the heroes and took great care of what happened to them. For every story that is the highest form of praise. <br /> <br /> If you've moved movies like the Mask King or Not one less, make sure you see the Shower. Netflix has it, and the quality of the DVD and sound image is excellent. I watched it in the original language with well-made and well-placed English subtitles <br /> <br />
