This is not a big movie. Acting is not amazing (some subscribers even play badly), the movie is not beautiful in any sense. Nothing really inventive or new. If you like big movies, this one is not for you. however it has a big - REALLY LARGE plus in history. Larry's story works because we know this story from our own lives. The girl we did not ask for a date, the test we failed, the friend we failed in our history. This movie works because it touches it, it's a great story because it's small. This is a life that we all have, regretfully that we all have, and yet the message is coming: every life we ​​could live in would have its drawbacks. When I first saw it, I was 15 years old. He was shown at a party at my school. 16 years later, I think about it once in a while and every time I see it, it makes me smile on my face. Watch it. It will do you good. You will be happier with what you have.
