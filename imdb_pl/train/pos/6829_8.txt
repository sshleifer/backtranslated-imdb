Gena Rowlands plays an actress who loses control over reality when she witnesses the death of her fan. She is becoming more and more deceived from reality, as a result of which her emotional turmoil distorts her work as an actress. In the sense that she breaks all the rules of the game and improvises everything, and yet manages to involve the audience, makes the film interesting (although a bit important) as a parallel fight of Cassavettes as a filmmaker. There are so many ideas, and as a result it becomes a little muddy (I still wonder about the relationship between a dead fan and Rowlands, among many other things), but the way they are presented in their purest form makes it invariably interesting and provocative to movie thinking. It would be great for a double bill from Mulholland Drive. <br /> <br />
