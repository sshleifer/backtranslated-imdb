The desperate guy tries to hit the wonderful girl on the bus. He rejects him, but when he runs after someone who tries to steal her purse, they meet. And it starts there - a relationship that is somewhat contaminated by the fact that he is a jealous and neurotic superhero. It can not be a secret that things between them will be problematic. <br /> <br /> In short, a story that could promise to grow into a nice movie. And IMO manages to be a nice movie. It's not a masterpiece, but with tears in her eyes she laughs more than once - the two leading heroes spin around in a crazy love festivity, even if the superhero goes towards the faith. > Yes. A thin story, but it was really fun, and so worth the time of the cinema. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 broken hearts
