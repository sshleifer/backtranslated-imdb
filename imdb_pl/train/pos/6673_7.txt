Many user comments that I have seen in IMDB in this video are not fair. First of all, let me just say that this film should not be taken seriously. It's supposed to be a fun, but stupid movie that does not need thinking, just to enjoy it. If you watch this movie with the intention of seeing a masterpiece in film or humor, you will be very disappointed. However, if you just want to watch a silly movie with talented actors / actresses and good returns, you'll like it.
