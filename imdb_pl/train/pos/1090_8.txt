One of Cary Grant's longest comedies is Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House. Although judging by its size, the apartment will be a dream residence today. Still Cary earned a living in the advertising industry, although he had a devil of time trying to come up with a slogan for a ham with the Wham brand. <br /> <br /> What made this film so popular was the shortage of housing after World War II. Returning veterans from the war demanded their rights under the GI Bill of Rights, which included housing loans. The problem was that there were literally not enough houses to meet demand. Around this time, the book by Eric Hodgins and the movie was so popular that Congress passed and President Truman signed the housing law Taft-Ellender-Wagner, which for the first time introduced the government into the home-building business. I had an uncle and aunt who at the same time were building their own home, which they moved into in the early fifties. Like Cary Grant and Myrna Loy, they had two daughters and wanted to get out of downtown Rochester. Their place was not as big as a Connecticut home with eighteen rooms, they still lived there for the rest of their lives, like Cary and Myrna most likely. <br /> <br /> Of course it was expensive and the costs are constantly growing, threatening to send Cary to cleaners. Cary and Myrna also have Melvyn Douglas to offer advice, usually too late. Truth be told, he's cute on Myrna and Cary knows that. <br /> <br /> The role of Myrna Loy is simply an extension of the Nora Charles. If you can imagine that Charles has moved to the country, and William Powell has a headache that Cary Grant is doing, the movie will continue to work well. <br /> <br /> Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House still works well as a comedy because situations are universal. This review is dedicated to my uncle Walter and Ciocia Kate, who have lived together in their dream home for over 40 years.
