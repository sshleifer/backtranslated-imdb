It was a perfect piece for a series of dolls, because this movie showed the entire series, from one to seven. It was about one woman trying to stop the new puppet master because I would never guess that the dolls would suffer. Plus he showed some of the series of puppet masters that I have not seen and what is bad to see, like the second part. He showed the appearance of Torch, which can rotate things and people, which is cool, and shows the return of the puppet master from the first part. He also showed small strangers from part 4, which was also cool, showed other episodes of people that could be good for them and that's what happened. Thanks to this, the Puppet Master will be a big hit.
