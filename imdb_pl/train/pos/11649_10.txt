What an absolutely stunning movie, if you have 2.5 hours to kill, watch it, you will not regret it, it's too much fun! Rajnikanth wears a movie on his shoulders and although there is nothing more than him, I still liked it. A.R.Hehman's music needs time to grow on you, but after hearing her a few times you really start to like it.
