I am amazed that such films can still be created. I watch movies all the time with my friends and I can say that this is one of the best I've ever seen. I never thought a 146-minute movie would make me think about it over and over again. <br /> <br /> Washington, as always charismatic and intense, plays Creasy, a former ex-terrorist anti-terrorist agent whose bottle was taken. When he is assigned to protect young Pita (Dakota Fanning) in Mexico City, his emotional and redemptive bow begins in a way that only a lovely little girl can provide. Inevitably, Pita is kidnapped by bandits, and Creasy decides that most Mexico City must pay the price for taking the catalyst with the teddy bear. Yes, he became ... a man on fire. <br /> <br /> You must see this movie.
