Facial expression Andie MacDowell is great again in this movie. When you go in 40 and be lonely for a moment (or your whole life), you can feel you are wasting. The film is a sweet reminder that love can be found wherever your antennas are very active. I liked the quick sexual encounter, which must be unusual for a normally booked school teacher (MacDowell). Her ex-student is sweet enough, she still loves her teacher for so long. <br /> <br /> But there are some parts that I thought were unrealistic or impractical. For example, in a scene in which the jealousy of other women is overrun and a scene set up, Andie MacDowell threw a young man, would a mature policeman (another friend MacDowell) let her friend make such a sinister act? Is it so easy for anyone to stop in front of the car? Of course, accidents happen all the time, but I was hoping to see how the heroine is a happy wife with the first man she got involved with (this was the hardest thing to believe! For such a beautiful woman who will remain lonely for so long?) ... <br /> <br /> Maybe movie producers are aware of the fact that many romances between an older woman and a younger man do not last long. Besides, they know that a happy ending would not appeal to the public, especially to the jealousy of women in their forties who are waiting for miracles. A sad ending with a flash of hope for a sad woman who lost her true love is sweet, but if this man were still alive, would it last? How long? Nobody knows. Nevertheless, it is a movie that will make you want to watch it again later ... maybe a year later.
