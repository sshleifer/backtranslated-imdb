This may be the most underrated movie of this genre. I do not remember seeing ads and advertising what could have been the reason why it did not succeed at the box office. However, Frailty is a perfect and truly original horror movie. I put him in the top ten most favorite horrors on my list. <br /> <br /> The film starts with snapshots of photos and articles about the killer, who calls himself "the hand of God." And then a man enters the police station and tells the chief officer that he knows that the murderer is his brother. Two of them leave together to go to the place where the victims were buried, which can help solve the problem. During this journey, the man begins telling his brother's story and we go back in time when the events started. Fenton and Adam are two young brothers living with their stern and religious father who one day claims to have received God's message from God, asking him to kill demons that seem to be ordinary people. He receives from God a list of the names of demons to be destroyed, and asks his sons to help him fulfill this divine mission. <br /> <br /> This is an absolutely frightening and stressful movie that will keep you on the edge of your place. Tension increases, innocent people (or demons?) Are dying, and religious experiences are questioned. At the end there is not one, but a few very intelligent twists. If you like this genre, I highly recommend Frailty for you. I am the owner of a DVD and it is one of my favorite horrors.
