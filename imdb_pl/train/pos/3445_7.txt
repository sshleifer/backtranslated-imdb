First of all, it was a BRAVE movie. I saw irreversible and understand the comparison. However, I can not understand the people who destroyed this movie. I see how the end could end extremely, but I would be lying if I did not say that I would like any guy who ever forced a woman to have sex, he deserves exactly what Jared got. And vice versa, he did not solve anything or do anything better, and the fact that the movie does not succeed is what I appreciated. <br /> <br /> The commentary before this movie was called pathetic and claimed no adult would stick. I certainly did it and carefully. I'm 24 years. The way the film drags me has made it realistic for me. People are so used to looking at sweets and quick threads on the screen that if you ask them to focus too long on one brick in the film foundation, they not only lose interest, they destroy everything that has been built, and they call it junk. When in fact their lack of patience and understanding requires precise tuning, not a product of a creative mind such as Talia Lugacy. <br /> <br /> Rosario Dawson flawlessly showed the numbness of self-destruction. I think it was very easy to show Maya before and after the attack, and the transition between them is an act that I rarely see well. Often, as in the "directed to teenagers" films mentioned in the previous commentary, the effects of rape are displayed as extremely manic and impulsive or terribly depressed, isolated and devoid of life. In my opinion, Dawson manages to balance, so many survivors fall victim to: an existence similar to a drone in waking hours, working in a dead end to survive (and distract), then overdoing vices to lose the haze of substance abuse, and not facing up to what sobriety brings. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was telling the truth and I appreciated that I finally showed people another side of rape. So many people let the end of the film engulf the middle and the beginning ... I believe Maya's face during the act was the end ... not the act itself ... not the revenge or the meaning behind it ... only her face ... < br /> <br /> thank you
