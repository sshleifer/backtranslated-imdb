I saw it as a previous viewer by accident, I've seen it twice. I really enjoyed it, no stupid, provocative news, just good fun, good songs, good characters and just a good movie. I highly recommend those of us who just like watching movies and do not analyze them. Great fun for the whole family here. I did not realize that Rosie Alvarez plays Vanessa Williams, she is perfect and very sensual. Songs like One Boy and One Last Kiss are really nice to listen to, and the tapping on Jason Alexander's legs is a complete contrast to his character in Pretty Woman ans is very good. Tyne Daley is still in my mind from Cagney and Lacey, and her voice and accent still have that memory. In general, I just loved it and I would like to buy it if it is available
