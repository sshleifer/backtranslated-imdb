I remember watching this movie, thinking was so interesting. I really wanted to know what to do next. I was amazed at how much they could fit in an eight-minute glance. We start in the school yard. . Two friends are debating about skipping classes. Kid B says to Kid A "Let's not go to classes today". And Kid A refuses, claiming that they can miss something really important. So kids B and kid A go to class. When he gets there, the teacher informs him that today they will learn the only and most important lesson they will learn. They intended to learn the meaning of life. He gives everyone a pamphlet, and when he gets to kid A, he runs out and tells the boy next to him to share. The kid will not divide, so Kid A is looking for a teacher. When he finally finds her, he receives a shocking revelation about the true meaning of life. I suggest that everyone watch this short one. It will only take 8 minutes from your life, but the message is so important that it can help you for life.
