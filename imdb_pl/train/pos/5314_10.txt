I saw this film for the first time at the sundance film festival this year, and being a teenager myself, I found this film quite attractive. these kids are unusual and very unexpected that they are in a movie of such an increase, but thanks to the appropriate dialogue and rubbish made the film a success. I liked this movie more than others, but I highly recommend the release and watching this movie. it's a mix of witty comments and merry reality. capturing the essence of high school, the high school record was at the top of my favorite list and I hope it will be released in cinemas. I really thank all the children who worked hard on this movie, it helped me that I cried with laughter.
