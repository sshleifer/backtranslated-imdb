I think it's a nice movie; I think it is a very Romanian movie in the scenery and atmosphere; I think it was not meant to be sensual (sensuality is the result, not the goal); I think it is very natural; I think he is humane; I think it was interesting; I think the actors never made me think ... wow lame acting (they're not Sean Connor and what) or the movie is not a blockbuster, they're like a movie ... a normal ppl that can work ...; I think the movie has achieved its goal; I think it made me feel things (or felt them again :)); I think I'm not objective; <br /> <br /> I really liked it ... I know it.
