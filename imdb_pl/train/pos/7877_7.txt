The word of the record <br /> <br /> What you see is what you get. Not quite! Bold and brilliant "page 3" by Madhura Bhandarkar destroys the myth associated with glam and glitterati, which colors the pages of our newspapers and whose life (reads party customs) we follow with such a manic eagerness that only our inner voyeuristic passion can explain. <br /> <br /> The phenomenon of page 3 is just as regrettable as enigmatic. How exactly he gained such control over the printed word and when he started to enter the first page, is the subject of another debate. Bhandarkar cleverly avoids this. He deals exclusively with the mechanisms of this grotesque existence. In this way, it combines different elements of this lifestyle. Like Robert Altman (although I do not compare Bhandarkar to Altman's genius), Bhandarkar uses innumerable characters to strengthen his motif. Regardless of whether it is a would-be NRI on page 3, gate robbers, a newly rich, upcoming model, a social politician or an erotic novelist; all characters are entered with a goal, and each of them has a separate character sketch, even if their parts may be small. And this is the appeal of the film. <br /> <br /> Konkona Sen Sharma plays Madhavi Sharma, a young and talented journalist who covers page 3 for Nation Today. Initially satisfied with her work, she soon begins to notice the ugliness of this abdomen, which is covered with false and cosmetic extravagance. But Bhandarkar resists the temptation to make this subject a moral film and avoids concentrating on one character. Hence the film concerns not only Madhavi, but also Deepaka Suri (Boman Irani) - editor Madhavi, who passively assumes the role of the teeth of a larger machine, Anjali Thapar (Soni Razdan) - social suffocating because of social pollution, Abhijeet (Rehan Engineer) - homosexual makeup artist and roommate Madhavi Pearl (Sandhya Mridul) - sassy airhostess and Gayatri (Tara Sharma) - an aspiring actress. It seems that it is impossible to assimilate so many characters (and more) in one story, but full of appreciation for Nina Arora and Manoj Tyaga for writing a tight script. Dialogues Sanjeev Datta and Bhandarkar were written with great attention to detail. <br /> <br /> Every narrative, no matter how good, can fail due to the lack of real performances. Fortunately, "actors" are filling up, not the stars. Konkon easily supports his role. Ditto Boman. Sandhya Mridul gets the best written part, but almost exaggerates. Atul Kulkarni, however, is wasted with a guaranteed character. Sometimes the director seems too eager to include as much as possible (pedophilia, homosexuality, etc.). But the contexts in which they are used do not make them look hurried. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, Bhandarkar's attempt is to satisfy our voyeurism, but he goes a step further. He takes us to photos and puts on the macabre realities of this sect of humanity, which seems to live in a different and distant world. These are the same people who indulge New Year's parties, while several hundred kilometers away their countrymen were ravaged by the wildness of nature! Smart writing, skilfully included songs, efficient performances and a real sense of sincerity make this film worthy despite the lack of finesse and bad production values. "Page 3" is the optimal way to enter the new year of cinema. <br /> <br /> - Abhishek Bandekar <br /> <br /> Rating- **** <br /> <br /> * Poor ** Average *** Good **** Very Good ** *** Excellent <br /> <br /> January 29, 2005
