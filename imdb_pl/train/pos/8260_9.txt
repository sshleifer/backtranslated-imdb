These French and these Germans certainly have a long history of disliking. It is worth noting that Kamerdaschaft or Companion in translation takes place in 1931. Only a few years later Hitler besieged Germany and began planning to take over the world, France is a victim of his ambitions. But these are times of peace compared to the future. A group of miners on the border trying to go to France to get a job. They are rejected, and later in the night club by their French neighbors. Then, in the French mines, a disaster strikes, and a well-prepared and written scene, a group of German miners decide to come to the rescue. A simple story, right? Pabst was a poet of silent cinema and I am not sure if this is his first sound film or not, but his poetry is to be discovered. He is not picky, but he brings heavy realism to the gehenna. It is even a retrospective of the events of World War II that tempts this story. Perhaps based on a real event, the film is proud and direct and concise. Smetimes, that's how a movie has to be.
