When I saw it for the first time, I did not laugh too much. At the time I was only fifteen and I thought that maybe the deeper humor was too mature to understand me. I had the same reaction when I watched her a second time a few months ago, and this time because the interrupted suicide attempt of Felix at the beginning of the film slightly darkened the movie. This scene has made some of the things Oscar said and did to Felix later seem unnecessarily cruel, and their personality clashes were not as much fun as they could be. If I did not know this story, I would be worried that some of Felix's Oscars might push him through. It did not happen that it did not make me laugh or smile like a TV show with Jacek Klugman and Tony Randall. All in all a pretty good movie and he gave birth to one of the biggest TV series. 7 out of 10.
