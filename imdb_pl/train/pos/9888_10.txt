Although this beautiful work of art uses some of the cinematographic vocabulary of surrealism, in reality it is nothing like that. It is a political and cultural allegory of the Mexican post-Columbian Odyssey, as evidenced by even a glimpse of the history of Mexico. <br /> <br /> In contrast to "Like Water for Chocolate", "Erendira" expects the viewer to meet her at least halfway, so that it takes some work to understand her. (A good starting point is to see a grandmother in Spain: proud, reserved, sad, and above all weighted with history.) <br /> <br /> The final actions of the heroine are unclear because the "result" of history (ie the present) is always unclear because we are too close to him to be honest about it. The refusal to carefully tie the loose ends is the only real choice available to the director, taking into account the ambitions of the film. <br /> <br /> "Erendira" is great. It would be great to experience the big screen if you can catch them at your local art home or at a university show. But if not, VHS is better than never.
