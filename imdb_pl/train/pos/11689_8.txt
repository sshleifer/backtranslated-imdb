I hope that the result has already changed thanks to my brilliant and stunning review, which convinces you all to watch the movie, thus creating an immediate chorus of "8", the real result of this film. <br /> <br /> Like the aforementioned Chris Rock is King! Before I watched the movie, I was not about it, but now I hit Chris Rock's door, begging him to take me as his protégé. This movie is really funny, if you do not find this movie fun, you REALLY need therapy and humor, which is directed to all social areas, including race (predictably), class division, love, wealth, employment, dreams, comedy. . the list is long. <br /> <br /> However, there was one slight disappointment for me. That's because when I came into this movie, I did not realize that it was a remake of "Heaven Can Wait", another pretty good movie from 1971 with Warren Beatty. As such, I was quite surprised when I watched the movie and suddenly the story began to unravel, to be clearly similar to the older movie that I watched on television a few weeks ago. Regardless, the movie is in my opinion a better version of the two of them simply because of the different areas it covers and the fact that Chris Rock is more fun than Warren Beatty every second of any day, any week of any year ... you have a photo. <br /> <br /> Well, the actual plot of the movie. <br /> <br /> Do not spoil this experience! Do not read the story! Just go and watch the movie, because so far there were two reviews of IMDb that were raving about it, go see this, because it's the funniest thing you've seen for a long time, go and see, because it's a cinema experience that does not allow you to complain na nauseum for cinema tickets. Go, look, it's a good movie!
