20 out of 10 This is a really great story about the evacuation from the war and carpenter carpentry Tom Oakley. The boy (William Beech) is associated with Tom and it can be seen that he has serious problems when he blinks the bed the first night. William is illiterate and scared, but somehow they both find solace in solitude. It turns out that William has talent as an artist and we see Tom's talent as a chorister in a funny interpretation of Jerusalem. William befriends Zachary Wrench, a young Jewish boy from London, and with Tom and Zacharia, he finally learns to read and write, and to feel part of this small, close community. The moment he settles, William is called back to London by his mother, and here we see why he is so fucked up. His mother is clearly mentally ill and when Tom does not hear from William, he travels to London to look for him. In the end, he finds him holding his dead younger sister, where he was tied up in the basement. After a period in the hospital, Tom realizes he needs to kidnap him and take him home. The culmination is a bittersweet ending when he was told he was to be adopted by Tom while at the same time, his best friend Zacharias was killed in a raid in London. For me, one of the most moving scenes was that Tom talked with an official from the Home Office. <br /> <br /> I love "them", for what it's worth, I think he loves me too. " <br /> <br /> It's just not better that it does?
