I saw this movie at the Taos Film Festival last year and I was overwhelmed by it. It's a rich, warm novel brought to the screen, beautifully played and well-directed. More than anything, it reminded me of David Lean's films, both in his ability to deal with complex history and his talent for creating powerful scenes that affect you on several different levels. The best movie I've seen for years.
