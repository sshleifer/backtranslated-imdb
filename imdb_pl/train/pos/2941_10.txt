This is the best one-man concert in which Eddie Murphy is the best. Just forget about the nut professor and respectable gentlemen, this is real Eddie Murphy. His imitations of Mr. T. (pretending to be gay), Michael Jackson and other artists are assassins. I think it is also bold to laugh at artists who were very popular at the time. My favorite act is the one where he is at the annual barbecue with his family and plays his drunken father and aunt Bunny who falls off the stairs. <br /> <br /> This show is the best medicine when you feel downstairs! If you're watching the "Raw" sequel, do not be disappointed. It is also quite good, but it does not fit into "Delirious".
