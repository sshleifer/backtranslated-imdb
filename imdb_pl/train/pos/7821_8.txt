Very rarely Denzil Washington makes a bad movie and it comes to his mind that it's about Kevin Kline and in this case it has to be one of their best films. It's more about a movie about how strong friendship can be more than the story of Steve Biko, although we have an insight into how this man was and how far the reporter and friend Donald Woods went to keep mans name and give the world knowledge of what is corrupt rotten society of South Africa. Directing is outstanding on the part of David Attenborough, as in the case of Gandhi, although if there is any criticism, it can be the length of the film. Two and a half hours is a long time to sit in a historical movie. Amazingly, how he manages to control all the extras. Thousands of people in both films. This movie really opens your eyes to what happened before the breakup of Aparthiet and you can not not move it. 8 out of 10.
