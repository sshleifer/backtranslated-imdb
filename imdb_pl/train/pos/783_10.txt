The first word that comes to mind after watching this movie is "beauty". Beauty is everywhere, in the actors 'game (as always Andie is excellent), in well-designed shots and in the idea of ​​the authors' editorial - Love. <br /> <br /> I think that Kenny's character is the only white in the boring and predictable life of these three women. His interaction makes the character Andie live as much fun as possible. When he left, it became obvious that we can not really appreciate and maintain our inner beliefs and holy desires. <br /> <br /> The fact that Andie successfully recovers this loss is nothing bad, but shows that life prevails in any form, even in this small British village, which is perfectly shown. <br /> <br /> Another reason I love this movie is that it is so British in all respects - all these houses and "pedals" and accents :))). And Andie is doing great again! It is a pity that this film has such low ratings. 10 out of 10!
