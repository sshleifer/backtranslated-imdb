Every child experiences adolescence trauma, and the active imagination of each child is the best of them, but for Jake (Anthony De Marco from the upcoming movie Clint Eastwood, CHANGING, which reminds Henry Thomas around 1982), the combination may be fatal. <br /> <br /> A lonely six-year-old whose imagination gets crazy when he is upset to learn his quarrelsome parents Peter (Sean Bridgers, late "DEADWOOD") and Jules (Brooke Bloom, "CBS: Miami") suddenly decides to divorce, leaving him on his own devices and freeing a new tenant? Zombies in your closet. <br /> <br /> Jake is actually planting his sperm while playing with a friend from the neighborhood Dillon (Matthew Josten), who provides him with a printout of the Internet FAQ about zombies. Jake is so convinced that someone wants to get him? and his family ?? he begins to rule out a plan of action to protect them before it is too late. <br /> <br /> Independent newcomer Shelli Ryan ?? who wrote and directed? combines home drama with subordinates of horror, but the first (wisely) surpasses the latter, with a decent story sustained by a great actor (De Marco is a rare race of a child actor, where he is a CHILD and does not "work" - all its nuances are very obvious to the awkward Bridgers makes his cheating husband empathic to understand that he really loves his son, while Bloom has a harder job of building sympathy as a child. a bit miserable who is quick in excitement over rationality, does not help when Dillon's mother Ruth (Monette Magrath, who resembles Laura Dern) continually feeds her implicit information, wedging the wedge between Jake and his father. Magrath also has a difficult task to do The manipulative character is relatively nice, but proves that they reveal on stage that I will not go into details, but it shows why it is what it is (and more importantly, it also affects its own child). <br /> <br/> The subjective filler camera is also well-used (many angles shown from Jake's POV at waist level or slightly skewed, i.e., upside down Piotr carrying his son in the same position while playing in the yard), and the assembly is relatively flawless. <br /> <br /> Ryan based the scenario on personal experiences of adolescence, and also witnessed a first-hand account of a friend going through the same situation and how the impact of relationships with adults can be harmful if they inflict worries, anger and stress for their children. The film here is very successful when it comes to the theme. <br /> <br /> However, the basics of horror are a bit chaotic, at least, but tribute to the films of zombies George A. Romero shows with love Ryan (Jake's mom) sleeps in front of the TV when NIGHT OF LIVING DEATH unwraps causing his undead faith to be in their home). The metaphor of a monster acting as a substitute for domestic violence can be a bit heavy, but again the child's fear of the thing under the bed is universal.
