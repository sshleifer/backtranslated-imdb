For anyone who expects a traditional superhero movie, it can be an unpleasant surprise. It's definitely more a drama than an action movie. It focuses mainly on emotions and is a bit like a Greek tragedy - regardless of what the main character does, it always goes badly. <br /> <br /> That's because Sasha, like every superhero, takes the law into his own hands and society underestimates it. Sasha becomes an outlaw. During the run, he meets a beautiful girl and falls in love, so everything becomes even more complicated for him. <br /> <br /> As you can see, the plot itself is really dramatic, but the film lacks dynamics. It reminds me a bit of the narrative of the recent Ram Gopala Varma films. Everything happens very slowly. However, when there is an action scene, it becomes so dynamic that before you realize what is happening, it's over. But the director does not want to impress us with a brilliant and effective action. What is more important here is the operation of Sasha, which is very drastic. The score is very rare, which makes it difficult to concentrate on the film. So basically you have to be very patient to watch it. <br /> <br /> Is the video worth it? This question is really difficult to answer. I do not think that this experience has enriched me so much, but somehow I still think about this film and I want to watch it. Mainly because of the atmosphere, which is really thick, but not suffocating, because Sasha and Katya hope. They are young people who have a lifetime to live. No matter how hard it happens, there is always a slightly joyful melody when they are together.
