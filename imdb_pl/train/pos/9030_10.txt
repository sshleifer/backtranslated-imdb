This movie surprised me. My friend told me that this movie was a "chick". Boy, was he wrong? This movie has a great family charm, with no sex scenes like _ other movies. Jake Gyllenhaal does an excellent job in Homer Hickam's shoes. The supporting cast is also great. <br /> <br /> Learning, maturing, family quarrels, a great train scene ... This movie has it all. The soundtrack is good, although the score is quite shapely. Music from the 1950s takes the film over the border of splendor. <br /> <br /> The DVD is definitely worth its weight in coal. The value of the replay is great - I have seen it several times.
