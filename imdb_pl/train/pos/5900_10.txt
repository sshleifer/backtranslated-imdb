I am very sorry that this charming and capricious movie (which I saw for the first time after the first release in the early fifties) has recently had such a poor reception. In my opinion it was very underestimated - but perhaps more appeals to a European sense of humor than to (for example) an American: maybe we in Europe can understand and appreciate its subtleties and situations more because we are closer to some of them in real life! Particularly noteworthy is limited but good music - especially catchy and memorable song "It's a fine, fine night", which was released separately on the album HMV 78rpm (10-inch plum label, I think!) In the fifties. I would like to encourage everyone interested to try, if you have a chance: you can have a nice surprise.
