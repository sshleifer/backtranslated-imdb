The best Sly action movie. It is an extremely pleasant movie with interesting characters, solid performances and a stylish assurance of Renny Harlins' direction. Stallone is rarely interesting in his action movies, and it certainly looks like an action scene. It was one of the best action movies of the year and one of the most exciting and enjoyable in the 90s, classic genre. As a fan, Stallone is one of my memories. Plenty of great action and Sly in the form of the main action. Action enthusiasts appreciate this film because it has all the features that make up a good academic movie. The film looks great and is very much supported by Janine Turner, Michael Rooker and John Lithgow. ****
