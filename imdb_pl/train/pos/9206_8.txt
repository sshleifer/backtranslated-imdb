We do not see films in a brother-sister relationship in the Indian cinema or in any other language or medium. This relationship has several aspects that have not been used in movies or novels. Typically, the sister is presented as a pile that can be used for ransom at the culminating moment. This film treats the topic in a completely different light. <br /> <br /> He is inspired by George Eliot's novel "Mill on the Thread". The brother is a very prosaic, very good, blue-eyed boy who is, by the way, a good son and a favorite of his mother. The sister is romantic, wild and challenging from the unwritten rules of society. Still, the brother-sister's love is the winner. <br /> <br /> This film tells the story of the love of two siblings who are separated in childhood and revive the same feelings when they meet years later. It is also a search for a toned brother to reconnect with his sister, who decided to be wild to defy the world. <br /> <br /> Although the film and the novel are set in distant from each other about 3 centuries, however, the feelings are the same and are still true.
