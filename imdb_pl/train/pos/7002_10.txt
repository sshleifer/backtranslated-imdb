Will Smith once again presents a film about a man with the burden of the world on his shoulders and crusade to repair his wrongs in a way that will affect even the most hardened hearts !!! Writer Grant Nieporte and Italian director Gabriele Muccino meet and create a masterpiece, which I highly recommend to buy and keep in your movie collection, because you will never be tired of watching / feeling this movie !!! I have the highest estimate for Will Smith, because he is not only a genius actor, but it can be said that he has a real love for people and life, which undoubtedly made him the ideal character (IRS Agent Ben Thomas), which he played in this film. You will find that you feel his pain and anger, the frustration associated with the love for Emily, played by Rosario Dawson, who by the way was fantastic. I fell in love with the fact that their heroes fell in love. Woody Harrelson also appears in the movie Top Notch. It is very difficult to write this review without revealing the key points of the plot ... All I can say is: Take care and make sure that you do not mind anything, take the phone off the hook, sit back and take it ready to try to unravel mysterious life and past of IRS agent Ben Thomas ... Thank you Will Smith for the next Great Film !!!
