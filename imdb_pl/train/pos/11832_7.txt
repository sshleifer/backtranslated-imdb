Time for a rant, eh: I thought Spirit was a great movie to watch. However, there were a few things that prevent me from being rated higher than 6 or 7 (I'm a bit generous at 7). <br /> <br /> Point 1: Matt Damon annoys me. I thought: "what a stupid voice they got for the main character" when I heard him talk for the first time - and then I realized it was Matt Damon. The man annoys me so much - his performance in "The Departed" was awful and ruined my film (before the movie had a chance to ruin, but that's another story for a while), as it almost happened "Ghost" I managed to get around this a fact because of how little the narrative was there ... thankfully. <br /> <br /> Point 2: Brian Adams sucks ... The whole result was awful ... The songs were unoriginal, general and badly made; I have never found matching music; and the lyrics were terrible. Each time one of the lame songs appeared, I was turned off. I almost thought that I would start to hear some patriotic propaganda slipping into the super-American texts in the style of freedom (I could not refrain from remembering those horrible patriotic songs that were still playing on the radio after September 11). In the light of the Native American aspects of the film, they should have come with matching music using the right instruments, not a meticulous radio, a teenager, 14-year nonsense. I thought I came back to middle school. I can not believe that I could do no better - I refuse. If not, I would classify the movie more in Disney, who knows something about originality (ok, do not bother with what I know, some of you probably think;). It is a shame that they could not hire better musicians. <br /> <br /> I liked art and animation, with the exception of some things here and there ... how sometimes the angles seem too sharp on the face and the lines too thick or dark on the body (thick / dark lines mainly at the end). It often happened that I thought that they feel too much about emotions and facial expressions, and they did not manage to draw any real emotions. But there were also times when the emotions were big. In any case, many scenes were lazy and the layers were visible. <br /> <br /> OK, I'm falling asleep here, so I'll sum it up before I start making less sense ... <br /> <br /> Nice sample of the epic movie ... though it turned out to be mediocre. Matt Damon, you suck!
