For starters, it was THE BEST Clausen movie by that date. <br /> <br /> The man always has a sense of the characters with a piece of humor, but I think that in this movie he adds a dimension incomparable to what he did before. His work - in very black "white words" - was accepted by a broad but not critical audience, and we always appreciated his sense of humor and his ability to mix it with human problems and a clear way of letting the audience know what he must say. <br /> <br /> In "Villa Paranoia, for the first time, it surprises with invisible wisdom and respect for minorities. Not only ethnic, but also normal people Fall in Jutland - in the "country" - deal with the endless issue of lack of love, but in a close and sometimes brutal way that makes you look and focus on yourself. he manages to play ab ****** d! A real b ***** d who wants the right thing, but has no idea how to get there and people are suffering. Bitterly. <br /> <br /> I must say that this is one of the best movies I've seen this year and I look forward to seeing him next.
