`The United States of Kiss My Ass' <br /> <br /> House of Games is the directorial debut of David Mamet and it is an effective and sometimes surprising psychological thriller. Lindsay Crouse appears as the best-selling psychiatrist, Margaret Ford, who decides to face a gambler who forced one of her patients to consider suicide. In doing so, he leaves the safety and comfort of his ordinary life behind and travels "to the center" to visit the place of misery, the House of Games. <br /> <br /> Player Mike (played well by Joe Mantegna) turns out to be a bit sharp and changeable. He offers the character of Crouse, if he is ready to sit with him in the game, a large game in the backroom, he cancels the patients' debts. A card game follows and soon the psychiatrist and the gambler are in the familiar line of work (winning the trust of others) and a fascinating relationship begins. What makes House of Games an interesting and important look for any fan of the film is the constant guessing who has power, be it a psychiatrist or announcer, or the famous bluff man David Mamet. > <br /> In the House of Games the direction is boring and mostly flat and uninspiring, but in every movie by David Mamet it is a story that is crucial for the whole process, not the direction. In House of Games, this is partly because of the excellent performance of the two leads (effective and distracting), but mainly as in the case of many Mamet's works, it is a dialogue that grabs you and slowly draws you into the movie. Nobody in the Game House says what they mean, and conversations become battlefields and a war of words. Everyone bluffs and bluffs twice, which resembles the natural order in poker. It is a running theme throughout the film and is used with great effect at the right moments to create great tension. House of Games can also be seen as a movie divided into "war classes". With Lindsay Crouse, we have a well-educated middle-class psychiatrist, and Joe Mantegna is the exact opposite, America's working class earns a "fair" crime. <br /> <br /> The film seduces the viewer, just like Crouse, is seduced by Mantegna, and the end result is ultimately a very satisfying piece of American cinema. And the finale of the movie is definitely something that everyone should see and be careful about, is stunning. <br /> <br /> Extremely pleasant movie experience that is worth repeating. 9/10
