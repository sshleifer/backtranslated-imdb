Cillian Murphy and Rachel McAdams play in this action / thriller written and directed by the master of tension, Wes Craven himself. The whole film starts with troubles at The Lux Atlantic, a hotel in Miami. The problem is solved by Lisa Reisert, hotel manager. Then he goes to the airport and all the trouble starts there. He meets Jackson Rippner, who does not like to be called Jack because of the name Jack the Ripper, if you know him and I mean. Then they get on the plane and crazy enough, Rippner and Reisert are sitting next to each other. For the next half hour, Lisa is terrorized, tormented and terrified by Rippner. I will not give anything. Then we go to the place where Jack chases Lisa at the airport. Then Lisa goes home to see if her father is alright, and quite madly, Rippner is already there. There is almost twelve minutes of violence and intense intensity throughout this scene. In total, about 25 minutes of intense action is coming to an end. <br /> <br /> The film was not only intense, but it had a great story in it. As I said, I will not give anything, because it is so shocking and exciting and a bit disturbing / frightening. And the action of every character in the movie, even without a line, was perfect. It was amazing. In this movie, everything was amazing! Acting, music, effects, makeup, direction, editing, writing, everything was wonderful! Wes Craven is definitely The Master of Suspense. Red Eye is definitely a must and it is definitely worth spending money. You can watch this movie over and over again and it will never be boring. <br /> <br /> Red Eye I have to say it is better than 10 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> Original MPAA rating: PG-13: Some intense sequences of violence and language <br /> <br /> My opinion MPAA: PG-13: Some very intense sequences of violence and language <br /> < br /> My Canadian rating: 14A: Violence, horrifying scenes, disturbing content
