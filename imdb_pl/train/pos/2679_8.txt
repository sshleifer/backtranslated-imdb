Delirious, almost devoid of a plot, a bit of mood and if it is more inspired by LSD than the Devil, we must remember when it was made! After a surprising opening of the SM (which is not even what it seems), we go to soft focus and dreams, imaginations or memorizing. A lot of literary and cinematic references, and indeed it is Franco's film, which Lang praised himself. A beautiful and mesmerizing film develops at a quiet pace, but it has a lot of wealth in it. A rare movie where you can die. Old Jess could force them when he tried. Great central performances, including the steadfast Jack Taylor and Howard Vernon. I have not even mentioned places in Lisbon - ah!
