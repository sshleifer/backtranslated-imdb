until HBO starts it again this month. I remember laughing aloud in the theater in 1991, and now again in my living room. If I see it is on, I need to watch it. There is no question. This is much more fun to me than other, more popular fakes like Airplane! (which I really like, BTW). In my opinion, Cathy Moriarty is stealing the program. Quotes such as "Sudden speech! The last symptoms of cerebral fever! put me on the edge. And Whoopie Goldberg is not so funny from "Jumpin 'Jack Flash". Kevin Klein, Sally Field, Robert Downey Jr., all expect excellent performance as expected. I started giving 9 out of 10 stars, but then I realized that for this type of film there is not one thing that I would change or improve. So it's 10. I have to get it on DVD, that's all.
