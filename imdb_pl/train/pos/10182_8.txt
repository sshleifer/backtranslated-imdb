good movie, good music, good background and acceptable plot. but the main point, which is again his films, is the best actor in idia and can turn dust into gold. nana patekar. it may be his second best performance after parindie (others may disagree). although other films are not far behind. one man who will never let you down. <br /> <br /> a good movie, although I think that shahrukh was a luxury without which this movie could work. you can see it in his films, others try to reach his height and work with their skins. but this man is really something worse. <br /> <br /> the movie is cool, the music and direction are excellent, the plot a bit thin, but the screen game and dialogue again very good. You have to watch.
