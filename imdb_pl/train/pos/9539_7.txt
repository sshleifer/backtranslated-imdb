For fans of Troma or the Cyberpunk genre mixed with a bit of blood and this movie for you! There is a lot of blood in this movie, and the effects can be sensitive and amazing. The plot is funny and refreshing, it is not limited to what we, viewers expect from movies these days. <br /> <br /> Also noteworthy are small aliens that I consider to be cute. All in all, this is a good movie for fans of this genre. Films such as Tetsuo: The Iron Man and Versus are also recommended for this strange Japanese approach to the film, filled with wonderful ambiguities and bloodshed. Of course, when you see this movie, you should already know about these two.
