the film is much more sophisticated and intelligent is its exploration of sexual tension than the American tests, like 9 and a half weeks ... the court scene itself ... with a couple copulating in the cage, while the heroine pleads for their orgasm ... is amazing ... I have not seen this movie for 20 years ... but I have made indelible pictures in my head ... it is rich in texture and effectively creates a world where sex is the driving force of all activity, and at the bottom of it is the yawning anger that lives in all of us ... the conspiracy is European and a little meandering, but the same is true for life ... especially when you are 17 and you are constantly working hard ....
