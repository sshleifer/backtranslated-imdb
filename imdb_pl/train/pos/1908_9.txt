This performance is beautifully made. When it came to mind for the first time, it's nothing but a light family comedy with a few good single lines. It seemed that many families express very well the different concepts of both the parent and the child, but as I said, I never thought about it any more than about good evening watching. However, my view was shot in another window when the tragic death of the fantastically funny John Ritter was born. The program became the foundation and really praised the lives of the characters in a very gentle way, which also touched the hearts of all the admired members of John Ritter, a fantastic actor with the talent to do everything. When the show was aired after passing Ritters, I really wanted to embrace my dad and let him know how much he meant to me. I thought it shone with the acting talent of three children, especially Bridget, who was worried about the last words she said to him. It reminded me that no matter what horrible things I say to Dad, I do not mean them and it's very important that he knows that. Great show
