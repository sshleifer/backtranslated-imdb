EUROPE (ZENTROPA) is a masterpiece that gives the viewer the emotions that must have appeared with the birth of a narrative film almost a century ago. This film is really unique and brilliant. Camerography and editing are brilliant and, combined with the narrative traces of alienation used in the film, create an amazing and unforgettable film adventure. <br /> <br /> The participation of Barbara Suwkowa and Eddie Constantine in the cast are two guilty pleasures to be seen and enjoyed. Max Von Sydow provides his wonderful voice as a narrator. <br /> <br /> One-of-a-kind movie! Four stars (highest rating).
