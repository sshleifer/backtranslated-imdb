First of all, I saw this movie without knowing anything about it. I only knew that Joel Schumacher did it and that was enough for me. A friend and I went to see him at a Danish film festival called the festival of night movies, which is a lot of different films shown after hours, the festival specializes mainly in showing films that otherwise would not be shown in Danish theaters. /> <br /> Anyway, my friend and I went to see him and we were amazed at how it really seemed and that it really hit our feelings, we really fell into a conspiracy, unable to understand the ending which is a great plus in our book. <br /> <br /> The film is recorded in a style reminiscent of the Danish initiative "dogma 95", which was initiated by 4 Danish directors, including Lars Von Trier (Dancer In the Dark). <br /> <br /> In summary, the movie is really worth seeing, because it gives a different perspective on how American GI Joe looked out of school and expects him to serve his country in battle far away from home. <br /> <br /> Also Colin Farrell is unique in this movie that I have not seen before, but I can not wait to see more of it. <br /> <br /> Lars P.
