This film has a rotting core of flexible morality, and at the same time a bizarre sense of justice. So many ordinary Joes among us would like to "stick it to MAN". "MAN" in this case is represented by several different characters. Mr. Keller, whom Carla reports in her office. Later Paul owes 70 years to Mr. Marchand the owner of the club. And then there's Paul's Parole Officer. There seem to be so many questions about the side story of this last character. Reviewers indicate this as a weakness in a well-prepared underground ping-pong game between our two heroes, escalating the fetish until their lives change dramatically. They depend on every "HUMAN" agent. One or both can be released, killed or imprisoned if they do not do what they were told. <br /> <br /> The movie has a sense of relief at the end. Carla is finally put together. Her boss is forced to be a moron. Mr. Club Owner is a pulsating mess in your own bathroom. They get $ $ $. And ... they do not have to worry about reporting to the Conditional Layback Officer because HIS moral weakness leads him to hide his wandering wife in the basement (or whatever the police found to arrest him). This is a critical subconscious trigger to the cylinder lock that collapsed us so much. It does not matter that someone else can later get Paul's file to oversee his release; for now they are free! Maybe they can do it! <br /> <br /> Woohoo ... <br /> <br /> THEY STOP HIM!
