Trudy Lintz (Rene Russo) was one very happy woman many years ago. She was the wife of a wealthy doctor and had plenty of extra money. Her passion was animals and she devoted herself to providing shelter for furs in its area. Trudy also raised two chimpanzees at home to be more like children. They dressed in clothes and had many amenities. One day he learns about an abandoned baby gorilla. Not knowing anything about big monkeys, she relies on her husband's medical abilities and professional advice to save the life of a gorilla. After leaving the danger, Trudy decides to raise the gorilla as one of her children. It's been working well for years, and Buddy, the gorilla, is a really smart addition to her home. But Buddy is also a gorilla, and his strength and curiosity become enormous. Will Trudy be able to keep Buddy under control? For those who love animals, Buddy is a compulsory movie. Based on a true story, Trudy and her monkey develop a relationship that is unique in animal and historical history. Of course, Buddy is not a real gorilla, but a mechanical one in the film, but he is very close to real appearances. Russo gives a good performance as a lady ahead of her time, and supporting players are also pretty nice. The costumes are exemplary, as befits the previous era of the story, and the settings and production values ​​are excellent. But most importantly, animals are abundant here, not just Buddha, but cute chimpanzees, ducks, rabbits and so on. For those who want to watch a movie and be transported to the sky of animals, here on earth is a great selection of films. All animal lovers, and even those who just want to watch a great family movie, will go "ape" over the Buddha.
