**Warning! Mild Spoilers Ahead! ** <br /> <br /> (Yes, I realize that it is difficult to spoil a historical document, but I reveal some history and methods.) <br /> <br /> This is a unique document not only because of the extraordinary film material, but also because of the history behind it. Because the Naudets were not about to tell the story of September 11, but rather about the novice firefighter, the emotions of men and their connection with them are more real and powerful than in the standard retrospection. <br /> <br /> In the film sense, "9/11" is a textbook. If the events were a real scenario, it would be great when the characters were fixed and then a curve was cast on which they must react. This is all the more amazing considering the pain and excitement of the raw material that the directors had to go through to combine this story together. <br /> <br /> The first part of the movie provides a look at life in the fire station; specifically, as a greenhorn assimilates with a crew of veterans. This part is quite good and if the document were allowed to complete the intended course, it would probably be solid. The brothers seem to be realistic about the process of becoming a firefighter in New York. <br /> <br /> Then, of course, hell broke loose. The chaos after the WTC attacks is clearly visible, because the various characters we have known fall into horrific situations. Seeing not only attacks but also first-hand reactions is a very moving picture of extreme human emotions. <br /> <br /> The consequences in which firefighters are lost and found, is a human drama at the top. Life and death are hanging in balance. Unlike many movies, the viewer not only does not know who will live and die, but really cares about them. <br /> <br /> The only negative thing I have to say about this is that the blur Robert DeNiro (which I like) was uninformed, unnecessary and did not make history a thing of the past. They were probably just added to attract more TV viewers. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: The best document I've ever seen. Indecent portraits of raw human emotions and drama. 9.5 out of 10.
