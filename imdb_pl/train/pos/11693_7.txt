This movie is a remake of two films that were much better. The last one, Heaven Can Wait, was great, I suggest you see it. This one is not so great. The last third of the movie is not so bad, and Chris Rock begins to show the comic fun that led him to where he is today. I do not know, however, what happened to the first two parts of this film. It plays like a really bad movie "B" in which people sound like they're in some bad television sitcom. Situations are forced and it is as if they were just trying to convey the story so that they could start a real movie. Everything seems real and the edition is just bad. I do not know how they could release this movie in this way. Either way, the last part is not bad, so wait for the video and see it then.
