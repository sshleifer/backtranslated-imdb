In general, I think that Loretta Young is difficult to accept, too worried about her appearance and too feminine in every respect. But in this lyrical romance of Frank Borzage, and although she's playing a patis about low self-esteem, who abolishes too much tyranny on the part of a loving Spencer Tracy, she's direct, honest and irresistible. It's a strange little movie, played mainly in a one-room hut in Hooverville, extremely privileged in the depression but romantic and idealized. Tracy, playing a furious, difficult to accept "ordinary guy" who would be a terrible chauvinist and bullied by today's standards, soothes the hard edge of his character and almost makes him appealing. Marjorie Rambeau and Glenda Farrell (who have never reached as far as it should) are well supported, and the scenario of Jo Swerling is modest and effective. But the real heroes are Borzage, who always liked to dramatize true love in a lyrical close-up and Young. In a sense, you want to hit her and tell her character to be smart, she's too good for this guy, but she's so dewy and convincing that you're looking at how their story unfolds to a satisfying ending.
