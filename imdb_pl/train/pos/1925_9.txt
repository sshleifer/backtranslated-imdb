It must be one of the best comedies on TV at the moment. It requires a sweet-sweet idea for a show revolving around a close family and transforms it into a quite realistic, but funny picture of a typical family with siblings and parents, brothers, overprotective fathers and sisters bimbo. I'm almost surprised that it's Disney! <br /> <br /> Based on it, "8 simple rules" knows that it is a comedy and does not try to be more. Too many concerts (eg "Sister, Sister" and "Lizzie McGuire") think that precisely because their heroes are now teens, they should take care of social issues and eventually lose their sense of humor, being too hard. It is a trap that "8 simple rules" has been avoided; he can deal with some problems (such as being a school outcast), but he does it well. In fact, the only time he really was serious was to understand that he had dealt with the tragic death of John Ritter and his character with sensitivity. <br /> <br /> And I think that although John Ritter will unfortunately be absent, because the show was the reason the show became a hallmark, "8 Simple Rules" can still handle well if he remembers his mood and does not make his father Cate a second version Paula Hennessy.
