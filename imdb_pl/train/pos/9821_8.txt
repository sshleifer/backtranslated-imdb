I saw this movie on True Movies (which automatically raised me skeptically), but actually - it was good. Why? Not because of the amazing twists or breathtaking dialogues (which are not enough), but because, in fact, despite what people say, I thought the movie was accurate in presenting teenagers dealing with pregnancy. <br /> <br /> NOT Dawson's Creek, they are not grateful, cool witty characters who go through sexuality without knowledge. They are children and behave like children. <br /> <br /> They are dumb, awkward and annoyingly confused. Yes, it may be a coincidence and they may just be bad actors, but I do not think so. Dermot Mulroney gives (when not trying to be cool) a very credible performance and I loved him for it. Patricia Arquette is stupid and annoying, but she was pregnant and was a teenager? The combination of these two elements is not exactly the lavender on the pillow. The plot was VERY predictable, but so what? I believed them, his stress and his inability to cope - her courageous but somewhat erroneous attempts to bring them closer together. I think that the characters in which someone else was playing, WERE really annoying and unbelievable, but they were not. It reflects the surrealism of the situation in which they are located, that sits in the classroom, and she goes with the child on campus. I felt angry at her, I felt angry at him for being such a child and blaming her. I felt it all. <br /> <br /> In the end I loved it and recommend it. <br /> <br /> Watch out for the scene in which Dermot Mulroney escapes from a catastrophic counseling session - professional performances.
