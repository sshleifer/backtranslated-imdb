Carter Wong plays a noble hero in search of a healing book that leads him to ultimate revenge! The pace is good in this movie and there are many battle scenes to keep the movie. Flying guillotines look wicked, and the main villain has no problems using them. Although the story is not strong, the action is fun and attracts you to the very end (which I felt could have a sequel). <br /> <br /> Campy and dark, this is great ol skool kung fu !!
