This film is a sharp political commentary as a tale of puberty. Annoying is that it works effectively on both levels. It should not, but it is. This story about four boys and a girl growing up in communist Belgrade in 1953 is warmer. This is what you gentlemen call classic cinema. Of course, Belgrade in 1953 is not as harsh as dictatorial and fascist environments, because often communist society is presented. You can listen to rock and roll music, one of the played songs is the song "Hey Babu Riba", as well as the title of the movie. But you can not buy jeans or some illegal drugs. In contrast to the heavy criticism of communist society, this film shows how it affects the lives of five heroes who call themselves like us, four. A girl who has a father in exile in Italy and is waiting for a passport for her mother and her to set off to join him, a piano taken from communion from one of the boys, a sudden dedication of home and quarters to your new companions, because they need it. The boys spend a lot of time listening to music and it is clear that they despise fascism, which created communism, when they engage in tiffs with a fascist charlatan who has Stalin tattooed on his hands. All this leads to the activities that they undertake later, and memories of waning time, because this film was released in 1986. At the dusk of the Soviet empire. A great movie that is worth watching many times. "Penance is not your enemy, but he is also a friend of no one."
