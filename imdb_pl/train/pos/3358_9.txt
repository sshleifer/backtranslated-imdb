First of all, for this movie I have only one word: "wow". This is probably one of the best films that touched me, from its history to performances, so wonderfully played by Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni. I was very impressed by the latter, because it really brought the depth of the character, because it was a very difficult role. Nevertheless, they both created a pair that surprised me from the beginning to the end, showing on the way a friendship full of love, which develops throughout the day, embedded in the film. The plot takes some time, because the introduction of the characters is long, but in the end we get a wonderful story about love and humanity. If you have a chance, see this because it is a movie that will remain in your mind for many years. Just amazing - 9/10.
