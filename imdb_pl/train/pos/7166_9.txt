Holes, a novel, were imposed on me during the educational course. I did not think I would want a novel for children; plus, a few other books that I had to read for the class were really bad. But to my surprise I absolutely loved Hole. This is really one of the best written novels I've ever read. I think it has a rare quality that makes it appealing to teens, teenagers and adults. I think that anyone who reads it will leave the better person. Although I can not say that in the movie, I am happy to say that they did it properly. I do not think that the viewers of the film will go as enriched, but they will certainly have fun, without the side effect of being stupid when they sit down. This is a smart story and is well told. I think it moves a little too fast. The novel takes more time to develop the character. And memories come and go so fast that they do not have much time to register. Interracial romance in the past seems more banal and banal than in the novel. And the ending that connects all the loose threads seems very funny. This is exactly the same in the novel, but there is a sense of absurdity that does not exist in the film. It works much better. I do not like a lot of pop songs. I would like Disney not to feel the need to sell soundtracks. The cast is excellent, from the youngest to old professionals. Jon Voight is especially great. We do not know, however, why we need Catwoman and Fonze. 9/10.
