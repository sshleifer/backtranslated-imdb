My first contact with "Whale Music" was Rheostatics album of the same name, which I bought around 1993. I read line notes and the band said the album, which remains prominently in my collection, was inspired by the Canadian book by Paul Quarrington. <br /> <br /> I picked up the book a few months later and swallowed it! Amazing reading! Since then, I have repeatedly read the book, each time finding a new element in Desmond and his willingness to complete the Whale Music. <br /> <br /> I found the movie in 1996. I did not have many good experiences with the Canadian film, but this one worked for me. Claire's role could have been different, but overall I think Paul Quarrington's vision was transferred nicely from book to screen. <br /> <br /> Maury Chaykin gives a moving performance as an isolated genius. The film deals with family relationships, love and finding someone who understands. I definitely recommend "Whale Music" not only to music fans, but to anyone who has ever lost something or someone and tried to find their way back to the world.
