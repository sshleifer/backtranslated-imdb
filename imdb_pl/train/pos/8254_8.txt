This dark comedy set in the neighborhood of the middle class in the imaginary town of Willard in the 1950s contains light toys with American obsessions such as gun mania and violence, materialism and keeping up with Jones, fear of others, slavery, golf, and getting rid of the dead. Yes, it all sounds a bit hard, but believe me, it's almost as light as a feather. <br /> <br /> Zombies are distinguished among characters. Key questions arise, such as: who will be the zombie (90% of Willard's people choose this final path, and only 10% prefer the traditional funeral)? Who is the owner of zombies that are supposed to bid like robots (have become a sign of social status)? And what is the range of possible relationships that can be developed between the living and those who have reincarnated? <br /> <br /> Somehow, director Andrew Currie, who was also the co-author of the lively scenario (with Robert Chomiak and Dennis Heaton), maintains this unlikely material for an hour and a half, sometimes missing due to lack of good laughter. Super cast: Carrie-Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Dylan Baker, Henry Czerny, Tim Blake Nelson, Mary Black and Sonja Bennett are directors, assisted by young K'Sun Ray as Timmy, an innocent kid with a good heart, he acts as an honest witness of the whole adult madness. (Seeing it only in "Memento" and "The Matrix", I had no idea that Mrs. Moss has such great comedy cutlery.) <br /> <br /> Set design and music are excellent 50th, for tee. Maybe this one is not for everyone. It will certainly be a difficult movie to beat for my annual Bizarro award. But intelligent comedies, which are fun from beginning to end, are among the most difficult achievements in the field of film production. For me, "Fido" is hoot! My ratings: 8.5 / 10 (A-) (seen on 30/30/07)
