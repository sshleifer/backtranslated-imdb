When John Singleton is on, he's * on * !! And this is one of his better movies. Not as cramped as Boyz-n-the-Hood, but close to him (and with the same stellar cast). This movie was very well written, well-matched and very well filmed. There is little to criticize, and most of my complaints are superficial (eg: where Fudge got money for 6 years of studies and a lot of expensive things? No mention of a rich background ... And why not Professor Phibbs Professor of his rank * should * have * .. And when we're at it, for an engineering student, hick or not, Remy is a pretty stupid hero - I think he'll have some more in the way of basic intelligence - he says and behaves like a total buffoon). <br /> <br /> But otherwise the movie was very sharp. A good set of characters and viewpoints; and Singleton does not advocate the story - many characters are unpleasant and do a good job, intertwining the Panthers and Supremacy scenes to show the madness on both sides. <br /> <br /> Many photos were excellent; I especially liked the scene where Kirsty Swanson intimately integrates with Taryn and Wayne, each scene combines really well. Also, the Malik / Deja scenes were really well made. <br /> <br /> Dialog was sometimes a little more difficult; this movie tended to sometimes * really * teach, and it tended to drive points that it created over your head when the points were equally clear without dumbness (we did not really need the US flag after writing the word "UNLEARN" on it, give me some credit, we're not morons ...). And in addition, although * most * time, Singleton uses the melodrama quite well, sometimes it gets * too * sober (like Deja's death, which is okay until he yells "WHY !!!", which just ruined the effect and the scene ). <br /> <br /> But the acting was at the very top. Great performances of Omar Epps (maybe the best I've ever seen), Kirsty Swanson (who knew that Buffy could work?), Michael Rapaport (I was surprised by the hell ... after True Romance and Beautiful Girls and although the actor in one role ) and of course Ice Cube and Laurence Fishburne are * always * outstanding. <br /> <br /> Minus? Jennifer Connelly was flat; though not entirely her fault: her role was stereotypical and one-dimensional. Generic to the highest degree. And Tyra Banks, who had this role, was nothing but horrible. She moaned, moaned and moaned. Another in a long line of actress models who have failed (though there are a few who prove an exception to this rule). <br /> <br /> Finally, the soundtrack! Wow! Incredible soundtrack (definitely worth the purchase!) That fits the film like a glove. Each stage has a twin song (although Tori Amos songs * really * upset me completely ... not her best job). Liz Phair, Rage Against the Machine, Ice Cube ... how can you be wrong? <br /> <br /> In total: really good watch, really strong cast, great screenplay, great movie. 8/10.
