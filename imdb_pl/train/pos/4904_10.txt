This charming film is perfect in every respect if you are in the mood for well-being. If you love jazz music, you must see it. If you like to see nice characters that make you smile, you can bring a tear to your eye and swing, as there is no tomorrow this movie is for you. If you're looking for an intense, deep, hard work of art that can be analyzed and analyzed, it's best to stick to something from Darren Aronofsky (in other words - djjohn's reviewer brightens up, you do not know the good time when you see him)! My only complaint is that the film was too short. I think I will just have to watch it a few times to get my supplement.
