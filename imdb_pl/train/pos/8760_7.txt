It's refreshing to watch a movie that you think will end happily, like almost any other American movie, and then be surprised when it does not happen. I like a happy ending the same as the next guy, but sometimes it's better to present things in a more realistic way, and I thought Brokedown Palace did it very well. <br /> <br /> The ending, basically one friend, dedicating herself for another, and thus the salvation of her previous bad behavior, which first led them to the situation, was very moving. I would almost do it without a last line, which proved that she did not actually do the act she confessed because it would make the film more about the friendship between the two girls and less about the crime. Whether she did it or not was not so important. <br /> <br /> The tale itself bordered with phrases, but the actresses drew my attention with great performances. Very realistic, very addictive. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10.
