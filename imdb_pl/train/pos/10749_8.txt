I rented it for my son who recently became interested in September 11th. He was a kindergarten teacher and he had no idea what was going on. I liked the way it was presented as a "document". If there was one movie I would like to see on September 11, then this one would be! Usually you see a movie that has well-known actors. This film was not known to anyone. You also see the movie on September 11, you hear about a firefighter or two who lose their lives saving people. I did not feel it had anything like that! I have rented this movie and I will definitely consider adding it to my collection! Very well done! My heart goes to the survivors and families of the September 11 victims!
