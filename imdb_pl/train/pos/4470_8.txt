As in "On the Town", this musical about sailors on land does not suit the later classic in terms of the pace and quality of songs, but it has its own charms. Kelly has three great dance routines: one with Jerry, a cartoon fame game "Tom and Jerry", one with a little girl, and a fantasy sequence in which he is a Spanish lover determined to reach his mistress on a high balcony. Sinatra, who plays shy, inexperienced friend Kelly, and Grayson, a woman who serves as love for both men, performs most of the singing. Iturbi provides great piano playing. Almost two and a half hours is a bit too long for a light musical, but it does not pull.
