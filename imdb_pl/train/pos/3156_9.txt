Like the characters from this series, I was also a teenager in the 70's. The producers really mastered the whole spirit of the time, being a suburban teenager in the '70s. Fashion for the '70s, cars, home furnishings, dishes and fashions are very authentic at this concert. <br /> <br /> The show can boast of a very talented team that perfectly fits in the camera. I really like unique movie sequences in the psychedelic style. No other show does such tricks with a camera. These innovative movie sequences really help convey the abundance of hypnotism that characterized the 1970s era. <br /> <br /> Generally it is a very funny sitcom. The only thing that worries me about this program is excessive reliance on cruel humor to make me laugh. In this way, I think this series tries to be too similar to Married With Children. While Married with Children is a great sitcom, it's cheesy that the creators of the 70s show they are trying to imitate it. <br /> <br /> I recommend the show from the '70s, mainly due to the nostalgia factor. However, it would be even better if the writers relied more on witty dialogue than on lewd, tasteless jokes and pranks.
