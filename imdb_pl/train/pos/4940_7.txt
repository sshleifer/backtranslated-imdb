This film concerns interpersonal relationships. Charming, funny and well written, with meaningful text. It looks like Morgan Freeman is certainly enjoying the set. Good music too. Paz Vega is a beautiful and smart woman. I really like her acting. A woman like her is a good motivation to learn Spanish. From the moment of meeting Morgan Freeman with sweet Paz Vega, an intimate journey takes place with two strangers learning to look after where their lives are going. 10 items or less means the joy of life. If you like this movie, also see "The Chase of Happiness" with Will Smith and his son. This is not an action movie or a naked comedy. It's about interpersonal relations.
