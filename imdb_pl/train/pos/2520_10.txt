Despite what others have said (* cough *), this is my favorite movie of all time. I do not know how long I've been waiting to see it, but when I finally did it, I fell in love immediately. Sure, it's weird, but it gives it a more exciting flavor. For those who do not know, Moonchild is one of the first films of Gackt and Hyde. They did not do much at all, maybe three or four vertices. So give them some credit. We all know that Adam Sandler was not the best at the beginning. I believe that they are throwing strange situations there, but I look beyond to find the best points of this film, emotions and whatever. That's why I gave and I will always give this film 10 out of 10.
