Wow. What a great movie. The screenplay is almost perfect, it seems that it is the only film written by Mingluna Wei, I hope it has more history in it. <br /> <br /> Acting is sublime. Renying Zhou as Doggie was amazing - very natural talent, and Xu Zhu was a delight - very credible as a jaded old traditionalist. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was very effective, leading without overwhelming. <br /> <br /> If there were more such films, whether in Hollywood or in Hong Kong - a family, well-played, well-written, well-directed, almost a perfect jewel.
