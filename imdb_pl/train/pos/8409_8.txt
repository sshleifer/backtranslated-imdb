A good movie, and one I watch a few times. Rich (the previous commentator) is right: there is much more going on here than the title tables show, and I have to think about how much the translation has suffered. Was there more in the original? Or maybe the audience in their mother tongue would read lip more? Was - because the script was written by the author of the novel on which he was based - was it now a popular story with which the audience was already very well known? In short, it's worth a look, but it probably requires more work than modern viewers than the original audience from 1913. <br /> <br /> The release of Alpha Video impresses with the new organ sound, but the music is not suited to the progression of the plot in any way. Of course, it starts promising, but it turns into a repetitive, resembling Phillip, monotony that does not reflect anything on the screen. After a longer listening session, I turned off the sound and just watched: much better!
