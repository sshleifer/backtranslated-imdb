Something surprised me in this film - it was actually original. It was not the same old paper that came from Hollywood every month. <br /> <br /> I saw this video on video because I did not even know about it before I saw it in my local video store. If you see this movie available - borrow it - you will not regret it. Building tension throughout the text and ending the twist is perfect. <br /> <br />
