I've seen hundreds of silent movies. Some will always be classics (such as Nosferatu, Metropolis, The General and Wings), but among them my favorite is this movie (maybe not the best - but favorite, yes). In fact, when I browsed IMDb, I noticed that I immediately laughed at myself because the movie was so cute and well made. Marion Davies proved in this film that she really has great talent and was not the mistress of William Randolph Hearst. <br /> <br /> This story is associated with a hika from Georgia coming to Hollywood with every expectation that it will become a star! Her experiences and interesting scenes with the stars of this era make it a real treat for cinema lovers and a must-have!
