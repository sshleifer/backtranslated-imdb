As a lover of bad movies I definitely hit paydirt this. The story is not so bad, but there are a few cases where you really have to ask yourself "what's going on?" There are many things that make it the funniest bad movie. First of all, Rudy Ray Moore was so fat and slow when the movie was filmed, that special effects consist in accelerating the battle scenes to double the time. There are also scenes in which there is an immediate repetition in slow motion, jumping on a ten-foot wall (by playing it back), naked men coming out of capital letters and having sex that literally brings the roof the cable supporting the roof in the fire). <br /> <br /> Of course, no film by Rudy Ray Moore would be complete without a totally free and accidental comedy scene in which Rudy ridicules all customers to make a strange dance. There are so many bad things in this movie, but they're bad in a fun way, and if you look away from the movie you can miss another mistake. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/10 for the actual value, 10/10 for cheese, 10/10 for catching errors and errors, average to 7/10.
