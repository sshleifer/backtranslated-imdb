In 2054, Paris, Avalon, a computer-generated system, controls the city, and when a young woman is kidnapped, Detective Karas (Craig) must go against Avalon to find her. <br /> <br /> Renaissance is a great blend of film combining with a conceptual futuristic narrative that illuminates the screen in a shocking mansion with the ideology of noir and conceptual montages that should delight many. <br /> <br /> Pixar are animation masters. Their numerous Oscar-winning films are endless, from the charming Toy Story to the mysterious Wall-E, so every company or director has a real challenge to bring them down to the perch. However, Renaissance is not a film directed at a young audience, and like Persepolis from 2007, it brings a strong and mature approach to the genre of animation, so that the older and more difficult film will reach the older generation. <br /> <br /> In 2005, Robert Rodriguez released the shockingly brilliant Sinan City, which shook the entire use of a green screen with a great balance of filming in black and white with strange color impulses, and a year later Christian Volckman took a similar approach with equally visually masterful shooting of movies. <br /> <br /> Volckman's picture is full of animation, but most of the time it does not look realistic for half an hour and 40 minutes. The characters' faces are well illustrated, and in particular this film must be the best in history when it comes to the use of shadow. The fact that we never know if his night or day is irrelevant when he just stares at the stony faces as the shadows mingle with their expressions. It is almost a clever use of a pitiful mistake and is also perfectly directed. <br /> <br /> For anyone who has seen Persepolis, you have come to the conclusion that this is one of the best directed animations ever to be shown for a simple but highly conceptual art style Marjane Satrapi <br /> <br /> Renaissance it is on par with this image and in many cases competes with stronger graphics and a darker shade to reflect the mood. One scene, especially when Karas appears from the dark, is beautifully shot. <br /> <br /> The narrative focuses on the stubborn and nosy political government that controls every citizen. The course of Paris comes down to the mysterious Avalon, which we can not see enough to get the essence of its true domination. The Renaissance controls the narrative around the tired cop's attempts to save a mysterious woman, and then we see a tired and boring policeman Craig trying to save himself by fighting other elements. There are many mistakes with the scripts, not to mention that the tired and irritated cop procedure is old, but there is a lot of stunning adrenaline and a bouncy banter between characters to keep it alive until the wonderfully shaking last episode.
