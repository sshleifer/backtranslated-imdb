Well, it's probably one of the best movies I've seen and I love it so much that I remember most of the script (especially the scene in the magazine when Jerry Lee breaks the wind) and even the script in my head I still like watching it for Jerry Lee that the German Shepherd is hysterical and really tries to see who is smarter. The designation is also important. Not to mention acting, but Christine Tucci sounds different in a whisper (check out the CSI filmography if you do not know what I mean). It is a pity that this movie only contained the single Dooley and Jerry Lee, it would be nice to see the tricks that Zeus and Welles had in store.
