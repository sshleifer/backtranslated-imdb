"Le Locataire" ("Tenant") is undoubtedly one of the most important horrors ever produced. the previous tenant tried to commit suicide by jumping from the apartment window. Trelkovsky is forced to visit her in the hospital and there he meets Stella (Isabelle Adjani). His happiness was soon replaced by the waves of paranoia, when he becomes more and more suspicious of his neighbors, who try to provoke Trelkovsky to repeat the suicide of the previous tenant. This movie is great. atmosphere of fear and paranoia. Many great moments, such as the classic scene in which Trelkovsky discovers the tooth of the previous tenant in the hole in the wall or a dream of fever, in which he walks into the bathroom building to find walls covered with hieroglyphs. The photo by Sven Nykvist is really beautiful. "Tenant" is a neglected jewel. It can be difficult to track down, but it is worth more than effort.
