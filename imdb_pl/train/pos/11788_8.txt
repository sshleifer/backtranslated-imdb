I really think that in this case people take the wrong approach. First of all, I think this short film is very funny and interesting. I just take it for what it is. I think that tension and mystery are ingenious in their innuendo towards the observer. Another thing that appealed to me was that she immediately engages the viewer, even though there is no clear history, only hints and pauses and emotions played by characters that give the impression that everything is happening. No one else could do better than Lynch. This is the essence of lynching at its best. Sure, I agree with everyone that people who start to perceive it with the desire to be entertained without any creative work on the part of the viewer will be disappointed. And good. Lynch is not about that. At least this Lynch page is not. The one who helped create Lost Highway / Mulholland Dr. is full here, and people who look forward to entertainment, as if they were watching anything else, simply do not understand what this is all about. In my opinion, the Darkened Room is about manipulating your animal core, your instinctive self, giving you the means (image, sound, situation) through which you react instinctively. It's not about pleasure, it's about getting the desired reaction. And this, my friend, is pure art.
