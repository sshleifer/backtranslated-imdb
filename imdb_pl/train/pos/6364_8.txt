"Atlantis: The Lost Empire" was everything the announcements indicated. It does not happen often. In most cases, the previews show only the best parts, and the rest of the movie is awful. Not so with this. I was happy with the original story, even though the threads were not. The animation was not broken like "Shrek", but it was still good. The plot and the plot were well presented and there were only a few vacancies in them. It interests you. I found myself enjoying it. Atlantis gets and keeps your attention. You also have to think a little, but not too much. When you think about it a little, you can find out what needs to happen, but you really do not know how it will happen. <br /> <br /> Casting was also good. Michael J. Fox, because Milo was a great choice. His personality fits nicely. The surly character commander Rourke was also well-chosen with James Garner. His character reminded me of his performance in "Maverick", which I liked too. I really liked Claudia Christian's cast as Helgi Sinclair. Her ability to play without nonsense makes the movie more interesting. It is a pity that he is a villain. <br /> <br /> In general, definitely worth it (8 out of 10).
