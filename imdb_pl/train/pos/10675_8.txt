I have long wanted to see this film, being a fan of both Peter Cushing and David McCallum. I agree that the romantic sub-story was a waste of time, but McCallum's talent shines through this young role. Thank God for Turner Classic who broadcast the program last week. I can imagine that after the war there were many problems with children, especially with what happened in the fifties. Some boys are a bit scary. I certainly would not like to meet them on a well-lit street, let alone the dark one. There are also good insights about fiery feelings or what they call a firefly.
