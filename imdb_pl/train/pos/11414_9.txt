A great story with a message. Joan Plowright is great as "Phoebe", Mike Kops is as funny as "trainer", and Richard de Klerk plays the role of "Carmine" perfectly. Mischa Barton as "Frankie" is doing a good job, and Ingrid as "Hazel" plays his first role well. This film is superbly directed by Jo-Beth Williams. Editing is first.
