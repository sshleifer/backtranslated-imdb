I caught this film at the IFC and I liked it, although I had the impression that the work on the editing was a bit difficult, although it could be deliberate. I had some difficulty determining what was going on at the beginning because it seemed that they were going to do a little non-linear Pulp Fiction plot presentation. However, it seemed a bit forced. I certainly think that the movie is worth watching, but I think he could clean up a bit. Some scenes do not seem to make sense to others. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that the rating here is as low as it is. It is not outstanding, but there are no serious problems. I gave him 7/10. The film showed at least that Laurence Fishburne can act when she wants. They just had to tell him that he was not in the Matrix movies.
