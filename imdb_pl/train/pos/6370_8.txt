To my surprise, I really liked the latest Disney animation. The film had its weaknesses, but overall I felt that the story is strong and the characters are easy to make. It was also nice to see Animated Disney, which was not a musical. I was pushed to the border with Tarzan. Fortunately, they gave the music peace. Another interesting feature of this movie is that the comedy was not completely suppressed (a la Hercules), rather subtle, so it still made the children laugh, and did not make adults feel dizzy or just stupid. One disappointment was animation. With all the wonderful animated films going on outside of Disney studios, one would think that they would move and catch up. There is something to say about tradition, but imagine the possibilities associated with the history of Atlantis! Overall, the movie was fun and definitely worth the trip to the multiplex. <br /> <br />
