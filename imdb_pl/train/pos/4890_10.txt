Great cast, more please! <br /> <br /> If you can catch something else written by Plater (or with the participation of these great actors). For anyone who does not know, Plater has a real sense of jazz, my recommendation is to see the Beiderbecke trilogy whenever you can. <br /> <br /> "There are three types of jazz - Hot, Cool and 'What time does the melody begin? "
