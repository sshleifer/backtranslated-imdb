A sweet, funny story about 2 people who walk the paths preparing for the wedding. The former policeman writer and public school teacher fall into each other in this wonderful New York, even though they are marrying other people. Maybe it's a bit trivial that "partners" are A-type personalities, while our heroes are much more relaxed. Nothing heavy, but I smiled. And hey for the boys - sell the angle of Natasha Henstridge, and the girls - sell them this sweet affair, everyone wins!
