For me, this is the most perfect Ealing Studio film - as fresh and important as half a century later, as was the day on which it was released. <br /> <br /> As a satire on the subject of the economic concept of "growth" and the need for commercial embedded obsolete, it can not be more current. And from what other movie can you say that the hero literally bears a story? <br /> <br /> Strangely, there are parallels with the Jurassic Park, where the confusion in the surroundings will literally turn around and bite. But Spielberg abandoned the genius idea of ​​the book to deal with nonsense about "children." Hmmm. <br /> <br /> In "Man in a White Suit", Alec Guiness plays an idealistic young scientist who invent a material that never gets dirty and never gets worn out. Suddenly, employees and capital in the North-English mill in which they work are united as never before in the protection of their livelihoods. <br /> <br /> Of course, being Ealing, it's a comedy, but it did not have to be like that. Complicated mutual influence of interests (which should be appropriate?). It works beautifully because, one by one, all parties realize that "progress" is a threat, and the availability and waste make the loom revolve. /> But yes, this is a comedy - though pointed - and there are exquisite performances and good old-fashioned laughter among political ironies. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it is a virulent satire that lasts - dazzling and white.
