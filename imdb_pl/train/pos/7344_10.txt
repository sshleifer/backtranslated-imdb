In my opinion, this is a good example of a film that could be much better if it was short 10 years earlier. I doubt that it would benefit from modern technologies, but it would look much better if it were at least 90 minutes instead of 70. <br /> <br /> The artists and animators did a great job. In my opinion, this film can boast of the best art in the background and one of the best character designs. The animation is extremely smooth and realistic. During the film you believe in the world you see, so everyone did a great job. She can also boast one of the sexiest animated female characters, if not the sexiest, easily overcomes typical anime girls. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, in this movie there are some bad things that make it not so attractive at the moment. First of all, the plot and performance are comparable to modern adventure movies and are really old-fashioned according to modern standards. Secondly, due to the duration of many benefits, it would bring an additional 20 minutes of dialogues. Finally, the setting is not so popular at the moment. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: a great alternative to another short story about Conan Barbarian, but not for a novel.
