People do not seem to give Lensman enough credit if it's due. A few issues are overlooked that are crucial to understanding Lensman's experience. <br /> <br /> Year: In the year in which it was made, Lensman offers some of the most stunning effects I've ever seen. As a person who watches many early 80s, the Lensman animation is unique in using what appears to be computer-generated images while the computers were very primitive. Kim's fight with geometric warheads in a laser maze can be a perfect example. Every time I watch, I have to tell myself that it was 1984, when it happened. <br /> <br /> Soundtrack: Lensman has one of the craziest soundtracks I've ever heard and this crazy beat hysteria penetrates every corner of the movie. Lensman borrowed heavily on two Western mistakes and managed to deal with the first one - the need to fill every second of silence in the film with the music and the heroine's need. While the music is well-tuned and galvanizing scenes such as the motorcycle battle at Thionite Factory on Radelyx, the heroine's subject fails because of Chris's pure annoying value. It is worth noting that continuous music thwarted my attempts to remove noise when I archived the lensman from analogue tape to digital format - because there was not a single second of silence available as a reference point. <br /> <br /> Western Influences: Helmut - sounds like a "helmet" and has more or less the same voice as Darth Vader. Clarissa Fairborn - she has the same hairstyle as Princess SW, and her name sounds suspiciously like Marissa Fairborn from Transformers. He takes over the role of Han Solos, flying the ship and having some technical knowledge. Buzzkirk - definitely improving Chewbaki. Lens - a nice concrete copy of strength, which turns out to be less opportunity to proclaim Christianity in the audience than in the original SW. While strength is based on faith to a much greater extent than concentration, the lens is a pure tool of concentration. In theory, anyone can wield a lens. The lens is much more limited than the Power - it is only defensive / offensive weapon. <br /> <br /> Technology: The boskone alliance has interesting ships with a sponge. They look like stormtroopers only with red uniforms instead of whites. The idea of ​​a DNA weapon was nice if it was developed. Galactic Alliance looked like Starblazers (or whatever it was called - a series from the 1960s in which they fought with Xylons). The ship was not enough for me to send battles - it's much better in the second film of Lensman. <br /> <br /> Finally, a note about Worzel. This character is a unique and very interesting character design, which fortunately continues the second film. <br /> <br />
