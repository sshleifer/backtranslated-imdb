I was surprised by how fascinating this movie was. The performances were exceptionally good, especially Rea as a compassionate detective with no nonsense. <br /> <br /> Despite the low budget, the lack of big effects or brilliant photos, Citizen X somehow manages to overcome most similar large Hollywood movies simply. Eloquent. The. History. <br /> <br /> Real stories end with a wail rather than a bang, and it is in this case, but otherwise it is a highly recommended detective yarn.
