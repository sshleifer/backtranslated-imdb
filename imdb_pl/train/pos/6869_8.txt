This movie may seem outdated today, but remember that it was made in 1974 - before Saturday Night Live, before Howard Stern, when George Carlin was just going out of Weatherman Hippie Dippie and heavy satirical humor. This movie is their grandfather. Enjoy its historical significance as well as its strong entertainment value.
