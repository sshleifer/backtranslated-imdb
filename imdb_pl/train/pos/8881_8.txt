First, take into account the period in which this movie was made. 1995. The rappers were in it and it encouraged him. <br /> <br /> Remy was an awkward teenager trying to find his way and he could not, until he met and did not make friends with the Nazis. They accepted him. The Nazis are not that awkward, but like most gangs, they fill the emptiness that is missing, both economic, social, emotional, whatever. Michael Rappaport played this role perfectly. <br /> <br /> Omar Epps was the star of the race track, with dubious work ethic and a chip on his shoulder. He tried to sympathize with himself and his situation, he had his girlfriend and professor to straighten him. <br /> <br /> Kristen was a young white girl trying to find herself and try to fit in until she was raped on a date. Then she discovered that she was experimenting with her sexuality and getting involved politically. <br /> <br /> This film deals with racism and, like most things about racism, people's own perspectives come into play. <br /> <br /> I read so many comments about how there were no black "bad" characters, but he was a bad white (Nazis). So what? Remy was not portrayed as angry at all, he tried to find his way and wailed until some of the skinheads accepted him. He was afraid, it was sad to see him take over what he did. He even says just before he kills himself, I did not mean it, I wanted to become an engineer. <br /> <br /> Ice Cube and Busta Rhymes were furious black people, Ice Cube was in a sense an intellectual and Busta Rhymes was presented as a stupid bandit. Both did not pay attention to roommates and generally do not like whites. They were angry like Nazis, but not at the level of the Nazis in terms of general evil. I'm sorry if it makes it seem unfair, but are there really black groups like the Nazis? No. <br /> <br /> People say they show white = -bad black = good. Not true, the only evil white figures were the Nazis and the police, which is more or less true in real life. Kristen was a good girl, her boyfriend (roommate omar epps) was a good guy, and even Remy was a good guy, he was just wrong. <br /> <br /> Omar Epps, Ice Cube and Busta were seriously flawed characters, angry and thoughtless. Although their constant harassment by the police seemed to justify part of their anger. Remy's inability to adjust seemed to justify his anger. <br /> <br /> A good movie, well done. Like all films that deal with racism, this is a great piece that can lead to discussion. <br /> <br /> I do not think Cube and Busta can defeat these Nazis.
