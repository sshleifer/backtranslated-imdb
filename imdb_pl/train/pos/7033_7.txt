First of all, DO NOT call it a remake of the movie from '63. Although this version is more real to play on stage, it is extremely long. The cast was good with a few exceptions. Chyna Phillips was not a good choice. In this film she was almost 30 years old and it was hard to believe she was a teenager. Jason Alexander was a good choice, but after a while he gave me a headache. Tyne Daly exaggerates his role as Mae Peterson. George Wendt was as funny as Harry McAffee and showed that he could even play the melody. Like in the movie from 63, they cast unknown games from Conrad Birdie. Marc Kudisch had fun with his role as Birdie and it showed. I even have a soundtrack and I love to listen to his singing. So what made these TV ratings drop? It took a long time. They put new songs and scenes. Although some of the new songs were good (eg "Let's Settle Down"), was it really necessary? Do not get me wrong, I liked it, but I prefer watching the movie from '63 (see my review). It was only a case of some actors exaggerating with roles, introducing some changes and once again LENGTH. One more thing I forgot about is Vanessa Williams. He does a good job with role and music. Give her some lyrics and she'll be able to sing them. Here is my advice from someone who made several productions by Bye Birdie: If you want to watch a funny game, watch the movie from '63. If you want to see a version that is more real to play, watch the '95 version. Take it however in moderation. Do not be a hero and try to watch it all at once.
