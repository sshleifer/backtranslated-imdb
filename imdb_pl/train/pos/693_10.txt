It is a movie almost without Jack's action, insomnia that undergoes hallucinations, is visited by dead friends, jumps out of the building and most of the time can not tell reality from hallucinations. br /> <br /> Dominic Monaghan, as Jack, is really credible. Confused and terrified, but lethargic and sometimes expressionless, accepting what he sees, we follow him, trying to explain what he sees and find a way to sleep. <br /> <br /> Introduce the talking dog (another hallucination) and children who suddenly appear in the bathroom of Jack and the bedroom without any explanation of how they got there (more hallucinations) and you have an interesting, amazing mind, 43 minutes A scene under The shower is enough to make every House fan come back for more.
