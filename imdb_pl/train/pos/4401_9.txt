Ride With The Devil directed by Anga Lee (Crouching Tiger) is another gem in this cap of excellent directors. For those who do not know the history of border wars in Kansas-Missouri during the Civil War. Watch this movie and visit a sad piece of Americana. In addition to several great action scenes (sometimes quite bloody). It is a story of love and devotion between men and one woman in particular. There are Toby Maguire, Skeet Ulrich Jeffrey Wright, and as a young lady Jewel, I have never heard or seen her before, I want to see her more. Acting is at the highest level, great production value, very well written novel. <br /> <br /> This is a long film of 128 minutes, but it's worth seeing. <br /> <br /> my rating is **** <br /> <br /> respectively <br /> <br /> Jay Harris <br /> <br />
