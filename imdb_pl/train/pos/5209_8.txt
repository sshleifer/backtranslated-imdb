I saw this important intense movie tonight. The most important and best work of Richard Gere and Claire Dane. Gere deserves an Oscar for a great portrait of a man forced to retire early as a criminal registry administrator. Claire Danes catches the attention of a woman who has replaced him with a handpick - a woman who is trying to teach everything that is possible by examining one last case in which Gere's figure is convinced that one of those who was entrusted with control may have hostage of a young girl. The subject is shocking, sexual criminals and those who monitor them, but this film will not be forgotten soon. I know that I have been persecuted by Gere for a very long time. Not since Anthony Hopkins played the role of a serial killer, his portrait was terrified and he was so involved. The film begins with shocking statistics, so do not miss the initial points. Intense and unforgettable. The best role of Richard Gere proving that a person can act. The Danes are doing equally well and both are doing great in this often difficult film. <br /> <br /> This is a kitschy movie, and Gere gives a multi-layered, deeply perceptible performance. Give him an Oscar now ... he deserves it!
