I believe that they have been telling the truth all the time. You can not trust anything in the wild ... The family has gone through hell. These poor boys were too young to understand what was going on around them. But I still have gossip. As well as dealing with the loss of their younger sister. I can not believe that this case has lasted so long. It seems that the jury did not see the truth, even if it stuck in the ass. I feel this family, and if I could tell them, I hate what happened, no, I have no idea what they went through, I can not even imagine. After watching this movie, I had tears and I had to check my little girl in bed ... I think everyone should watch this.
