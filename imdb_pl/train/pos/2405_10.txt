Wow, I can not believe I'm the first and only one who posted a commentary on this amazing movie. <br /> <br /> Although the movie itself seemed quite interesting, the real thing that attracted me was Matt lillard, I admitted that most people probably think that it is too happy or just sucks caffeine, but we are both in the same age and come from the same generation and have watched this guy so many times that he is now one of my favorites. This is one of the few films in which he is a great photographer and the main star, as in SLC Punk, another great film by Lillard. <br /> <br /> Baiscally is a story about your ordinary panic movies, but with more twists and turns that are starting to be crazy. Also in this film is another great actor, Vincent D'onofrio, a very underestimated person in the film industry. The woman in the film is a novice and is not so bad, although you know that they hired her mainly because of her accent and naked scene =) <br /> <br /> It is a game in the fight with Jack and Jill you want to enjoy the benefits, but do not share with anyone. Everyone tries to kill each other and it is a time bomb waiting to explode. Matt shows his real efficiency as an intriguing JACK that initially starts the whole scheme. Vincent and the woman play a few art thieves who need money because of a lack of interest. Vince's character is a bit deranged and skitz in the whole movie, but it only increases the intensity of the movie. <br /> <br /> Surprises from left and right are welcome, and the ending is very unquestionable and makes you feel happy, maybe it depends on the type of endings you like. I was very interested in this movie, except that Matt was in it, it's a great movie and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes movies. Critics probably will not like this movie, but they do not watch movies because they like movies anyway.
