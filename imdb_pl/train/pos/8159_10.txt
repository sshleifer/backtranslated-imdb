Fine. This film is pure pleasure. He always has such a violent mixed horror with a small pendant and a lot of black comedy. The dentist really starts to lose his mind and looks at it pleasantly. This movie is for some people, though. Either you love him or you hate him completely. A good movie to rent and watch When you have nothing else to do. Also recommended: Psycho III
