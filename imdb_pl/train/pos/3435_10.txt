This film is a wonderfully simplified work. Pleasant from the beginning to the end is both sad and uplifting at the same time. Performances by Miranda Otto (oh, she deserves more recognition!) And George del Hoya are beautiful, yet almost painful to watch, because two tortured souls begin to understand. The staff supporting the employees of the Office of the Dead Letter is a great part of themselves, just like the long-suffering boy Alice, whom I could not resist, but I am a bit sorry. There is one particular scene that I can watch over and over again (and I have!). It's such a shame that such films do not gain recognition, and therefore bring them closer to the public, so that more people can enjoy. I cried, I laughed and sighed. I recommend this movie to everyone.
