Although too young to remember the first show of the series (being only a child), I later caught him on television in the late 80's, when I was interested in the war and all its aspects. It was my grandfather who first showed me the series and also gave me my first interests related to the stories of his time in the Royal Navy in Malta and later in the Pacific. Since then, I have absorbed many books and watched many TV series about the World War II, with different opinions. British television stations are generally very good at producing them, as it is easy to prove The World At War, with many jewels from both BBC and independent companies. I definitely recommend such titles as "Nazis - a warning from history", "Blitz" and the BBC series about Dunkirk. "Britain At War In Color" with the accompanying series "Japan", "Germany" and "America" ​​have a very high standard. The World At War is by far the best and despite its age it never fails. There will always be new revelations about the war that will appear, which of course is not included in the series and of course World War II took place on such a large canvas that producing a series with EVERY detail would require more time and money then any other, even if such the venture was even possible. I feel that I have to tell those who recognize that it does not contain everything, that The World At War can not physically do it as a series, but it may as well lead to further research and make it pleasant . It certainly worked for me: I now have a very extensive library of books, films, DVDs, tapes and CDs. I recommend to everyone, even with interest. The series was so well made that it would be difficult to disagree that it is high-quality programming and very informative.
