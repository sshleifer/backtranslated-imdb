His selection of films, the basic "conceit" of production (which puts him in the sets or simulators of films that he comments on) and his delivery is brilliant! But if you want Freud, remember that you get the version of Lacan Zizka, which should not be confused with Lacan itself. As always, Zizek enthusiastically convey complex ideas and convincingly. It is to argue that it is also quite mercantile, so it may be more in its taste than in the actual content. Kinematically is a gem. From a psychological point of view, people of all persuasion (Freudians, Lacanian and Jung) scratch their heads, but reach for popcorn. Zizek is a phenomenon and a pop icon for herself.
