It could be a 1987 Autumn's Tale remake after eleven years, according to director Mabel Cheung. Mabel uses rock music as a medium in this film to express his personal attitude to life, in which love, desire and the resulting frustration play an important role. Rock music may not be the best way to convey a deep sentiment, and yet it is not too inappropriate to use it, because the life of underground rock musicians is bitterly more intense than ordinary music. The director focuses on presenting a subtle feeling and the ultimate vanity of life, not ordinary rock music. Love between father and son, lovers and friends is delicate and moving thanks to the wonderful performance. Mabel does not try to embellish rock musicians in general as artists, instead tries to recreate real life on the screen, making huge efforts over years of work on this project and gathering information in underground pubs in Beijing. <br /> <br /> Daniel probably gave the best performance in all his films. His innate reluctance and restraint perfectly match the blue mood of the film.
