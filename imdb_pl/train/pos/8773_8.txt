Errol Flynn is "Gentleman Jim" in the movie about boxer Jim Corbett from 1942, known as the man who defeated John L. Sullivan. The film is directed by Flynn's good friend Raoul Walsh; Alexis Smith, Jack Carson, Alan Hale Sr., William Frawley and Ward Bond also appear in the film. Flynn plays an ambitious, selfish young man who has a natural boxing talent and is sponsored by the exclusive San Francisco Olympic Club at the end of the 19th century. Although good-natured, the fact that he is a "shanty of the Irish" and a social climber, he builds reluctance in the members of the Olympic Club; most of them can not wait to see him lose the fight and bet on him. Even so, he gains fame and even works as an actor. In the end, he gets the chance he was waiting for, the match with the world champion, John L. Sullivan (Ward Bond). Sullivan demands a $ 10,000 deposit to make sure Corbett will fight for $ 25,000 of the portfolio. Corbett and his manager (Frawley) despair about getting money. However, help comes in the form of a very unlikely person. <br /> <br /> It's a very funny movie, and Jim Corbett is the perfect role of Flynn, who was once a professional warrior himself. Has the necessary charm, good looks and athleticism for the role. Alexis Smith plays Victoria Ware, his romantic interest, which he insists he hates. In real life it seems that it did not exist; Corbett was married to Olive Lake Morris from 1886 to 1895. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on Corbett and his career, not on the history of boxing. Corbett used scientific techniques and innovations and is considered to be the man who made the award for art. In the film Corbett is a fleet of feet and avoids being hit by enemies; It is believed that in this way he dressed John L. Sullivan. <br /> <br /> A good movie to catch Flynn at the top of his too-short time as a superstar.
