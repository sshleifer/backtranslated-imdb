Pleasant small potboiler, whose 65-minute length does not seem too short, My Name is Julia Ross refers to the English tradition of things that are not what they seem - an example may be The Lady Vanishes Hitchcock. Work outside the home Julia Ross (Nina Foch) finds a dream job at a new employment agency in London, whose ominous representative seems very eager to determine if he has a living relative or boyfriend. After reporting to the service, he wakes up (after taking drugs) on a huge heap similar to Manderley on the Cornwall coast, allegedly as the wife of George Macready, who shows an alarming interest in knives and ice cream. His delightful, supportive mother is irresistible Dame May Whitty (this time a model of lively performance on the other side of good against evil, than she took on The Lady Vanishes). The nightmare vision of this story develops claustrophobically; we know what is happening, but we are not able to tell poor Julia. This film, interestingly, regularly receives an honorary place as one of the earliest (and very few British) films noir. I think this is closer to the Gothic tradition of the old dark house than the American one with wet cobblestone and urban corruption; this, however, manifests itself in a more modern, psychoanalytic mind. Regardless of what you call it, it remains a very satisfying thriller.
