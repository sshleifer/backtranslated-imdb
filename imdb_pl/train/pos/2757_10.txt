If you would like to see a different kind of movie, if you feel Love in your heart, even if you miss the Lord, this movie makes you think. Although Georges is mentally handicapped, you can see the ultimate intelligence at the end when love gives you directions, not the brain. I'm not emotional, but this movie makes you feel human. In my opinion, the movie is as good as Forrest Gump. Foreign films are sometimes more interesting, but there are not enough ads to make them popular. "Rang-e khoda" (God's Color) Majid Majidi is another example of such foreign films, almost similar in taste.
