Val Kilmer ... I love him or insult him, sometimes he gets under the skin of the character and pulls out a show that makes you go "Hey! This guy is a GREAT actor! He did it in Jim's leather pants in The Doors, and he did it again in John's leather pants. <br /> <br /> Turning around the fall and fall of John Holmes' porn king, Kilmer strode to his knees, unraveling one of the greatest murder mysteries that hollywood has never resolved for more than twenty years, and Holmes is the key suspect of a brutal slaughter in Manson style. <br /> <br /> What Kilmer does effortlessly is a delightful celebrity, they do anything to anyone who wants to overwhelm anyone who has it, and then lose it. Go to him, you'll know what I mean.
