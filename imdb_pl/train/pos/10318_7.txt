He said both films and baseball were thriving during the Great Depression. It seems that the gloomy reality of a nation entangled in the aftermath of this economic catastrophe has created the need for occasional relief for the population. A temporary escape can be found in the "Baseball" soap opera. <br /> <br /> Similarly, an occasional 2 or 3 hour trip to darkened cinema auditoriums. The presence of Radio in almost every home maintained the Epoch of Depression in America immediately adapted to world events and provided many drama shows and (especially) a comedy for a pleasant break from harsh reality. <br /> <br /> Literature has also blossomed at all levels at this time. The habits of reading juveniles have helped to create a comic book, as we know it, thanks to all fantastic characters and amazing adventures. But the comic simply did not appear magically, all fully developed with all the colorful 4 colored pages, all in themselves. There were family media for them. Of course, Gazeta Komiksowa was one of the parents, providing a visual / narrative method of telling stories. <br /> <br /> The second direct ancestor was the Pulp Magazine. Inexpensive prose publications that included many stories about the same heroes of adventures, though not necessarily serialized, tales. The cellulose agent has existed for several decades and introduced TARZAN Edgar Rice Borrough and ZORRO Johnston McCulley. The thirties brought a bumper, because the heroes, such as THE SHADOW, THE AVENGER, G8's BATTLE ACES and THE SPIDER, MASTER of MEN, found themselves among the information stands, among many others. <br /> <br /> One other was DOC SAVAGE, a full-blooded super hero of the written story; the pulp covers probably had the only "image" of the hero. Possessing extraordinary strength, super sharp senses and a protean intellect of the genius class, Doc was a prototype Super Hero. <br /> <br /> He also collected 5 of his former War Army in a small, free adventurers' team. Each of them was an expert in a given field. We had the highest rating: chemist, lawyer, construction engineer, electrician, geologist-archeologist-paleontologist, etc. <br /> <br /> Doc Savage stories were very popular in the 30's and 40's and were published in the mid-1950s ies. Then they parted for a good 12-15 years. Then came a brainstorm to repack old novels in a new "container", a paperback book. A fresh look at the cover was introduced, with a highly stylized series of pictures of a very muscular Doctor, with an eternally torn shirt. <br /> <br /> The re-introduction proved very successful, thanks to the publication of the title monthly (and for a while). Soon there was a rumor about the movie Doc Savage! But when, according to which producer? Well, the venerable "Bronze Man" was back at the information stands for over 10 years before any real project was combined. He was a veteran of Stop-Action animation and producer of the best special effects films, Geoprge Pal, who made the film together with Warner Brothers. <br /> <br /> When DOC SAVAGE, MAN OF BRONZE appeared in Movie Houses, he boasted a well-manned team of actors, albeit largely "Untitled", as yet familiar with the audience. With the former Tarzan television, almost perfect casting by Ron Ely, the upcoming Beauty of a Starlette, Pamela Hensley in the female role and veteran Paul Wexler (as villain, Captain Seas); no other name would be recognized. Or maybe in this case it was a plus. <br /> <br /> The story copes well with the fact that the majority of viewers got to know an amazing group and at the same time acted. The use of narration by Paul Frees and short film clips is a method whose aim is to transfer the introduction to the main part of the story. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning, there are hints that this story will go with the same type of humor "Camp" as the television series Batman. Some really great-looking early scenes involving Doc and the entire team performing their individual specialties are thrown at humor by Paul Frees' narrative and unexpected, unbelievable results. (For example, the Doca experiment with a miniature rocket / rocket turns out to be part of the method of catching fish, small.) The whole story takes place this way, hitting the viewer with a small "Camp". so often to remind us not to take it too seriously. We are also surprised that Mr. George Pal is the producer (his last). The one that was so well known for special effects is certainly a factor that can be well used in the Pulp Character world sci-fi scenario. <br /> <br /> I remember that I saw it quite live. Mrs. Ryan (Deanna) was in the hospital, she just gave birth to our second child, Michelle (08/14/75). Our older girlfriend, Jennifer, visited her grandmother, so after hours of visiting the maternity ward, it was straight to the old Marquette theater, 63 and Kedzie, here in Chicago. <br /> <br /> After watching and being a guy well familiar with Doc, I was somewhat disappointed with the final product. I could accept some of this "camp" business, but I would not object if Mr. Pall would consider it necessary to let everything hang and that some real neat dinosaurs and volcanoes would give him some more miazgi / komiksu / Serial type excitement. <br /> <br /> And yet the cast, headed by Mr. Ely and others, has made the whole movie sympathetic, if not nice. The sets and locations were, as you can see, very similar to those from the 1930s adventure series that would be nice for everyone. <br /> <br /> And maybe this is what DOC SAVAGE, MAN of BRONZE tried with this DOC.
