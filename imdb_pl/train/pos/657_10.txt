La Maman and la Putain must be viewed as a movie that is related to the time in which it was released (after 68) and eternal in many respects. It's true, the actors do not "work" ... They say a lot, but what they say is what makes life worth living ... or dying. The very long monologue uttered by Françoise Lebrun is perhaps the most accurate and moving text ever written about femininity, masculinity and love. However, it is not easy to translate exactly. This film is a statement about the difficulties of being a man and a woman (or two women in this case). And IMHO, Jean Pierre Léaud is one of the biggest French actors.
