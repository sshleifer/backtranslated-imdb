Wow, praise IMDb and Google, because I've been trying to remember the name of this amazing movie for over 15 years. Slaughtering High, man! Hells yeah! <br /> <br /> I will not bore you with a summary of the plot, actors and yadda yadda yadda, because you all know what's going on. That's why you are here anyway. What I will do is explain the nice memory I have in connection with this typical D-Movie mix from the 80s. <br /> <br /> In 1987, when I was 7 years old, my father rented these horrors. Does he care that his children are watching him with him? No. At this young age I saw Slaughter High. What I saw in this film was stuck in my memory. I have not seen him since, but I still remember most of the funny killings in the movie. For example, the post-sex scene (why is there a metal bed at school?) She gets electrocuted. Or, the guy is drowned in the pool. Come on! My personal favorite ... exploding stomach of contaminated beer. Amazing! How can you honestly hate a movie in which one of the characters finds a beer in an abandoned school, say 10 or 15 years later, and think that it would be good to drink it? Then his stomach explodes? What!? And this great line: take my car ... it always starts. Classic nonsense. <br /> <br /> I mean, now I look back, almost 20 years later and I laugh about it. But when I was 7, I was scared. That clown hat (or maybe it was a mask?), Through which deadly rocks frightened me f * ck out! <br /> <br /> In total, yes, shit movie. But for the sake of nostalgia and humor, this movie gets from me 9 out of 10. Or stop every night really late and hope we'll catch it at the same late-night movie concert, or hunt for a copy of VHS and dust the VCR.
