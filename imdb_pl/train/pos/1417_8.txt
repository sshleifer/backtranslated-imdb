I saw this movie with my family and it was great! This film is more than just a document (which offers no more than cold facts) with long mono / -ologists and many charts ... The full "power" of this movie comes from impressive underwater filmed films, in air or the Arctic. Watching this movie, you can learn more about our planet than reading a book, it shows that we are embedded in the circulation of life. This movie is intended not only for "environmental fanatics", but people who want to look good with the news should watch it. This film taught me that we are not only living on earth ... we live with and through the earth, and all plants and animals grow and die with us.
