Diagnosis The murder has been shown on most afternoon afternoons at the BBC1 since I watched it during school sickness 10 years ago - I know I should not really like it, in the same way that I should not enjoy "The murder she wrote" " but I'm totally addicted to both, and I even have DVD sets ... OK, I know it's sad! <br /> <br /> Dick Van Dyke brings the show when he plays as Dr.Mark Sloan and a doctor at Community General Hospital in Los Angeles, who is also a LAPD police consultant - his son Steve (Barry van Dyke - real son of Dick ) is a policeman who needs his father's help in many suspected deaths. <br /> <br /> The ride is Dr. Amanda Bentley (Victoria Bentley) resident pathologist at Community General and for the first few seasons you played Scott Baio playing Dr. Jack Stewart, who raised and left the series in 1995, hoping for bigger and better things ... he should have stayed where he was, he did not do anything good ... and his only theatrical appearance for many years was in Baby Geniuses 2: Superbabies .... Ouch !!! <br /> <br /> Anyway, Dr.Jack Stewart was replaced by the younger Dr.Jesse Travis played by Charlie Schlatter, who quite comfortably entered Baia's shoes. <br /> <br /> The series is highly unlikely, but what is not the Whodunit series? (The murder she wrote - wherever Jessica goes, someone ends up dead, or the Unappreciated father of Dowling Mysteries about the murder solving the priest with the nun's help) <br /> <br /> The series was much lighter until 1997 because she had cast supporter, which included the inept director of the hospital Norman Briggs played by Michael Tucci and secretary Nurse and Marek Dolores played by Delores Hall, after 1997 both these characters were not included anymore, and the series became more gloomy with a larger budget, some of them episodes included much more shares, one section of the entire hospital was blown up. <br /> <br /> It was a family show for Van Dyke, because apart from Dick's Son Barry, you also had Dick's Daughter and all his grandchildren appearing in different episodes. <br /> <br /> Because the series lasted, it got a bit stupid, one episode that I remember Dick van Dike plays his whole family, which was a bit unusual, but in the whole "Diagnosis Murder" there was a really good TV program that had many good guest stars. <br /> <br /> Since the end of this program in 2001, Dick & Barry re-appeared in the MURDER 101 television series produced by The Hallmark Channel, a nice following the same path and still enjoyable. Dick, who is now in the mid-1980s, does not seem to change too much and it looks like he will work until the end. <br /> <br /> TV SHOW **** OUT OF *** **
