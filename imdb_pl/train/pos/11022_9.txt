FORGETHER FORGUMENESS <br /> <br /> You can not expect credibility in action movies in which a superhero must perform an infinite number of unbelievable feats, being trodden in the process, but recovering lightning and transforming harmless gadgets into deadly weapons ... especially when Renny Harlin directs. <br /> <br /> "CLIFFHANGER" is no exception. But the film has many advantages: breathtaking landscapes of wonderfully photographed, stunning special and visual effects (the first five minutes are catchy and give a tone of film), excellent musical score, welcome releases and a solid cast: two heroes (Stallone, star and cowriter, he has the lion's share of material, but exquisite Michael Rooker more than his base), adorable heroin (Janine Turner) and one of the most terrifying groups of villains in history (priceless John Lithgow and deceptively feminine Caroline Goodall, but also Rex Linn - in longer than usual parts and who fully uses them, Leon, Craig Fairbrass) Good, solid entertainment, if there is no credibility. As Roger Ebert wrote (for another film) "It's a kind of movie where you can sit and enjoy until you make a mistake thinking too much." <br /> <br />
