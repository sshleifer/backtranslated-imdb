It's been a long time since I watched this LOTR. I am currently looking for a copy to buy. Bakshi's work is quite consistent with the original work. Visualizations are immersive and sometimes haunt. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages? Sometimes a movie is confusing or confusing. It is one or two times when the plot slows down to creep. But overall - buy this movie. It is great for children, adults and collectors.
