Dennis Hopper and JT Walsh are stealing the program here. Cage and Boyle are doing well, but what gives this juice to neo-noir is the horrifying, brutal character of Hopper and the deceitfulness of JT Walsh. <br /> <br /> Drifter gets a mistake to break the cake out of him, but he falls into his head. <br /> <br /> I found a strange parallel in the initial scene of this movie when Cage enters the trailer in Wyoming to do the drilling work with the help of his buddy ... and the opening scene at Brokeback Mountain when the character does the same! But this is another story. <br /> <br /> Dennis Hopper is the best here ... conceited, hideous, hideous, boozing and violently violent. JT Walsh (RIP) is also great as a man with a dark past, trying to live up to the law (well, almost). <br /> <br /> There are only 4 real characters here, except for the hard-working deputy in Red Rock, Wyoming. The first turns get early, and from there is a nice neo-noir adventure in some sleepy town. Satisfying. 8 points
