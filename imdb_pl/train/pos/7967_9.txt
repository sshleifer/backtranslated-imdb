This is definitely one of the biggest Disney films ever. It is a real pleasure for everyone. It will make you laugh, make you cry, and this will lead to tension. <br /> <br /> Essentially, what Homeward Bound is is three pets that are sent to live on the farm while their owners go on vacation. They do not know what's going on and they desperately want to go home, run away from the farm and try to find their way home through the desert. <br /> <br /> This is one of the last films Don played in Ameche. He provided the voice of Shadow, an old, wise and friendly golden retriever. Sally Field also appeared in this film, which was the voice of Sassy, ​​a Himalayan cat. But seriously, this is all Chance movie! Expressed by Michael J. Fox (my favorite actor), Chance is basically everything you can expect from a dog, nice, playful, energetic and stupid, and every time I break down while watching this movie, it's because of Chance ' a; it's like the comedy never ends! <br /> <br /> This movie is also very sad. Sometimes it reminds people of times when they were alone or when they lost their animals. <br /> <br /> One scene that always puts me in suspense is the scene in which the trio tries to get away from the pound; I especially feel shocked at the part where Chance catches the collar and almost does not. The film had other tense moments, but none of them seem more uncertain than this one. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a great family movie. If you liked this video, you'll probably like the sequel too. I give this film a solid 9 out of 10!
