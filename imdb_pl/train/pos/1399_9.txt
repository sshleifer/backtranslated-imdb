This is one of the toughest episodes in which the story really seemed like a pretext to have fun. BUT, I appreciate this carefree approach and it is really one of the best episodes that you can see at a purely fun level. Think about it - crew members meet with a white rabbit and Alice from Wonderland, Bengal tiger, samurai warrior, horse knight who kills McCoy, and a number of other bizarre events that simply do not make sense until the very end. Despite all the danger, you can not take everything very seriously - it's just too funny and the whole episode seems very surreal. So, on a purely unsightly level, it's great things.
