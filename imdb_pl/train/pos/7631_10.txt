Chameleon performance by Kurt Russell combined with the pristine film of John Carpenter makes this undoubtedly one of the best bios with boob lamps. It also persists: the emotional basis is strong enough that it never ages; Carpenter kept the power and supreme power of the life of the only King of Rock and Roll for posterity. (For most of my life I was a fan of Elvis, but only when I saw this poignant moving movie, I looked BEYOND on the image of the man himself. It was quite a revelation.) ELVIS remains one of the ten best TV movies of all time.
