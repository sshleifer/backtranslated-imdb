The choice to make this SNL jump into the movie was much better thought out than the latest ones. The humor associated with the character is not an irritating humor, it is also sufficiently driven by the character to be drawn for an hour or two. <br /> <br /> Strange that sexual content seemed like it could have been avoided, but maybe it was because the restrictions of live television taught me not to expect it. I suppose I was thinking more about the risk of "Leisure Suit Larry" than the producers ... <br /> <br /> Definitely not a PG-13 movie that will probably hurt him since he reaches the heights of his more successful predecessors, but still better message and writing than its more gloomy. <br /> <br /> I liked it, but I doubt it will be a hit ... (which is sad, because Tim Meadows does not make heroes very much, it annoys me quite often the tendency of other SNL graduates)
