FORBIDDEN PLANET is one of the best examples of Hollywood SF films. Its impact has been felt for over ten years. However, some elements relating to how this widescreen entertainment was directed to an audience over 50 who has already passed away ceased to exist, and sometimes the slow stimulation of the film does not help. But the fascinating central idea of ​​the story, which includes the ancient, extinct civilization of Krell and "monsters from Id", has not lost its attractiveness and still makes this film an essential "must see". I'm mainly interested in the fact that the current DVD for this movie is terrible. The film never really looked as good as in home movies, and its elements require urgent renovation. I hope that this will happen soon and we will receive a special edition of this classic SF.
