Val Kilmer and Dylan McDermott are wonderful. I saw Kilmer on The Doors, but his interpretation of John Holmes is excellent. Nothing compared to Boogie Nights, which was a bit slow. Wonderland is a movie that is able to show you a terrible crime story from the perspective of a guy who indulges in his drug abuse and lazy about what's going on around. At the same time, the figure of John Holmes shows a very clever hustler who is able to go through the worst and the ugliest situations almost unscathed. The movie deserves to be watched more than once. Atmosphere of the seventies sensual and full of drugs is amazing.
