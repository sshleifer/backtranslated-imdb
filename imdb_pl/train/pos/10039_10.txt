Titanic is a classic. I was really surprised that this movie did not have a solid dozen, generally in the rankings of IMDb users. Maybe it's nice not to give credit to Titanic today, but when it was the first time, it was really something. When the film appeared, people came to theaters. When she came out on the video, my sister and I watched her twice a day for a month. It was safe to say that we were obsessed and for good reason. Some scenes of the disaster were difficult to forget, like a frozen child or a guy who committed suicide after killing someone in an unruly crowd. A lot of people died on this ship, and giving it to a movie with an immediate need and emotions is a difficult challenge that James Cameron approached. And let's not forget about the amazing romance of Jack and Rose. Whether their relationship was a figment of someone's imagination was beautiful. They barely knew each other, but they would have died for themselves. They trusted each other. They certainly give hell to Romeo and Juliet for their money. "I will never let go, Jack." Titanic is a great movie to the very core. It is a powerful story told by genius acting, excellent pictures, beautiful music and a team full of heavy and dedicated employees. It really throbs my mind when someone says he hates this movie.
