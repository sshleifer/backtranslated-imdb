I was amazed at the improvements of the animated film. If you're sitting close to the screen, you'll see details on the grass and surface structures. Details, colors and shading are at least an order of magnitude better than Toy Story. If they managed to take off the shading, I will never know. I hope PIXAR will provide a documentary about how the film was made so that I could learn how it all was achieved. Based on this video, I think that future animated films will be judged based on this video.
