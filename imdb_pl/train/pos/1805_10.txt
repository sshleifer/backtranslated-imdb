I just saw this movie, I saw it for the first time when I was 7 and I could just remember the end. So I watched it 10 minutes ago and (I can look like a child, because I'm 12 ha) I started to cry at the end, I forgot how sad it was. I think I was mostly sad because of Anne-Marie, because she said, "I love you, Charlie," and also, "I'll miss Charlie," just made me cry ha-ha. it must be one of my favorite movies of all time, it's just a movie that is worth watching. SEE THIS ha-ha, that's all I can say XD <br /> <br /> but I love this movie, it's a real classic. <br /> <br /> xx Maverick xx 10/10
