I saw this movie for the first time about 4 years ago and expected something funny, similar to CB4. I was shocked. I was on the floor laughing at the movie that it's so great. Better than CB4, characters, songs, story, everything. A top-class independent film that received "Two Thumbs UP" by Siskel and Egbert (and if two old white guys can understand the humor in this movie, you know it's good).
