I do not understand the low rating of 5.7 in this film. It is a delight for people who like strong suspense and dark atmosphere. The sound resembles the North in the Garden of Good and Evil, to the place (Savannah). Acting is strong and I was amazed at the verity of Kenneth Branagh's southern accent. Famke Jansen is great, Robert Duval is effective in a small part, and Embeth Davitz is BOMB. Great, full naked scene too. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite standard, but it is effectively made.
