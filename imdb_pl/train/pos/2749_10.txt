A good picture is worth all words. This film has the most poetic scene about people with Down syndrome. And I will not ruin it by telling you. You will want to see it yourself. <br /> <br /> Pasqual Duquenne is an amazing actor. I did not have to understand a single word he said to understand its meaning. <br /> <br /> The movie has its own magic. After seeing him, I understood better that we pay too much attention to achievements, and not to the people we love. Passion and simplicity are all we need.
