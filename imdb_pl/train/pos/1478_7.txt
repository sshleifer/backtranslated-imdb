I liked the movie, although I was able to tell who the mysterious devotee was. <br /> <br /> I also wonder if he was based on a true story because he talked about "real" people at the end of the movie. I think I will have to investigate and let you know. <br /> <br /> Does anyone remember how it will happen? I believe that they have moved to North Carolina, if I'm not mistaken. <br /> <br /> Of course, the states may have been changed to protect the innocent. <br /> <br /> One would think that this man could have figured out as easily as me. Was he stupid or what?
