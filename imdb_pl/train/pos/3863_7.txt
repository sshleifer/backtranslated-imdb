This is an interesting series that takes people from real life (Jesse James, John Wesley Hardin, etc.) ... and dramatizes part of their real story with a continuous character from the series taking part in this story. Detective of the "Matt Clark" railway - takes part in the tracking of known outlaws from the Old West in stories that are at least partly based on real relationships. In this sense, it is almost a series of anthologies and, as someone else has pointed out, this strange structure causes some time conflicts with real events, but it is a fun series with lots of action to please the west-hungry audience from the 1950s is still holding up quite well 55 years later. Clark plays the mighty figure in his western gear when he goes against the worst of history. And his girlfriend-helper Frankie is a pretty good dish. If you're a western fan, be sure to check if you have a chance.
