I do not remember when I first heard about this film, but I rented it some six years ago and still remains one of my favorite comedies. I admit that you will most likely despise this movie if you do not know anything about rap music. But if you're a rap fan, even an ordinary one, you'll love internal jokes and references. One of the best lines in the movie is the difference between a b **** a a h **; I still use this line and I have a lot of laughs with it. One of the best performances comes from Larry Scott, who played Lamar's nerd in "The Revenge of the Nerds." It is a pity that this film will probably never be released on DVD.
