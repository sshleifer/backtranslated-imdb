"Sweets are never so sweet without sour". This quote was in my opinion the theme of the film. Tom Cruise plays a young man who has received everything in his life. He takes things for granted and appears full-time in this great film with a great twist of action. This movie will make you involved in the story and you will not be able to interrupt it to take a break for the bathroom. <br /> <br /> It's a movie that really makes you go back and look at your life and how you experience it. You really can not appreciate better things in life (sweetness) like love until you experience bad (sour). The theme really makes you "open your eyes." <br /> <br /> The only complaint is that the film is very curled in points and difficult to understand. I think the end is perfect. I advise you to look at it and see for yourself.
