Rented and watched this short (<90 minutes) work. This is by far the best therapy that Modesty received on the film - and its creator, Peter O'Donnell, agrees to participate as a "creative consultant." The figure and we who love her, we treat with respect. Spiegel's direction is the best he has done so far, and the cast was very well made. Alexandra Staden is almost physically perfect as the equivalent of the original illustrations of Modesty Jim Holdaway. A great find of whoever threw it! Raymond Cruz as a young Rafael Garcia was also perfect. I hope Tarantino and what. he will do more in the series - I am particularly interested in whom they will choose for the incomparable Willie Garvin!
