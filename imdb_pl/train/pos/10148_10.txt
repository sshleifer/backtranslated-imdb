I would give the film a few stars, simply because it was a "Lifetime" presentation, filmed in a place presented in history - here in New York. Most of this channel, regardless of whether it is "set", in the villages of Iowa, Oregon, Virginia, LA, etc., is shot in Vancouver, Ottawa, Toronto or in another Canadian region. <br /> <br /> But if there has ever been one deserving top score - 10 * on this site, this is the movie. Certainly not for originality, because this story has been done many times, in many variations, with a few very similar to this particular one. It was also done quite often on the big screen, with mega, past and present stars, from Cary Grant, James Garner, Harrison Ford, Tom Hanks and others - and Deborah Kerr, Doris Day, Meg Ryan and many more. I can come up with at least 10-12 more, just as outstanding, past and present, from my head, who could be added now, and there are probably many others that could be recalled. <br /> <br /> Do not drone on, but my goal is, in my opinion, this is definitely one of the best genres I've seen. I caught him accidentally on Wednesday Friday, when I had a TV just because I was taking a few hours after a particularly hectic week. I would never come across this film in 8 years since it was made. And although the two leads did enough to be the best known, they were completely unknown to me. The only actors I knew were Phyllis Newman (Anna's mother), whom I saw in some things from her younger days, and Michael Rispoli (Henry, Charlie's best friend) who was outstanding as "Gramma", a serious juice loan, hard, street guy from "Rounders". <br /> <br /> Accidental encounter and connection between both best friends leads to the fact that affair with sub-stories, with the correlation of their being like Anna and Charlie, only reveals itself later, there is often an idea for a story within genre, but it does not make a difference for pleasure here (it actually strengthens it). <br /> <br /> By checking other comments, I agree completely with those that are the most positive. The basic word describing this film is ENGAGING, in caps. This adjective describes the performers; form; chemistry between all characters, regardless of their combination, as well as all supporting and even minor roles. <br /> <br /> I love movies with "harder edge" "Rounders"; escapist fee Schwarzenegger / Stallone; Goodfellows even classics such as Casablanca, Gone with the Wind, Citizen Kane. But for pure, uncomplicated pleasure this one was exceptional. With a negligible fraction of budgets, it was equal to the results achieved by "You Got Got Mail" and "Sleepless in Seattle". And Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan could not do better than Natasha Henstridge and Michael Vartan here; co-workers and support staff were also the counterparts of these mega-movies.
