The powerful, powerful gangster supreme Frankie Diomede (always a great Lee Van Cleef in excellent shape) was arrested and sent to jail so that he could unmask the treacherous sans detection partner. Fawning goofball, a small hood and a wise seeker Tony Breda (a sympathetic portrait of Tony Lo Bianco) is also eliminated. Frank and Tony create an extraordinary friendship behind bars. Tony helps Frank to break out of the pond and helps him in his quest for revenge on a rival group of gangsters led by ruthless Louis Annunziata (smoothly played by Jean Rochefort). Director Michele Lupo, working with the absorbing scenario of Sergio Donati and Luciano Vincenzoni, talks about a neat story at a steady pace, supports a rough but sometimes light tone throughout the text, and plays a set of action thrilling with a heartbreaking brio (rough, unbearable brawl in prison and a prolonged chase after the car mondo destructo, as a definite exciting attraction). Van Cleef and Lo Bianco present a nice, loose and engaging chemistry on the screen; the relationship between their characters is alternately amusing and moving. Unbelievable, Edwige Fenech does not have much to say, like the furious girl Tony Orchidea, but at least reveals his incredibly gorgeous and sensual body in a very praised free scene with a bare shower. The sagacious, pulsing, syncopated funky-jazz note Riz Ortolani will surely go to the place where you can play a soul. The excellent photos of Joe D'Amato and Aldo Tonti are also impressive. Really nice and funny little winner.
