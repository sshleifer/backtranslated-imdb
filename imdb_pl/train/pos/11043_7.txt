Malefique to a large extent has the viewer from the beginning to the end with its harsh atmosphere. Almost the entire movie is set in a prison cell revolving around 4 figures, from which the transvestite Marcus and his little retarded boy are the strangest. Soon the prisoners find the diary of the previous prisoner behind a brick that deals with his obsession with occult and black magic, leading to his escape from the cell. From now on everything is about discovering the secrets of the book and its spells to escape from prison. This leads to accidents on the way from cell to unknown light. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I think the story is rather weak and the last change is nice, but for me the ends are quite loosely connected. In any case, I was delighted until the last moment, because the atmosphere of the film is unique with minimal setting and casting. The killings are harsh and weird ... you do not have to cool your spine, and occult subjects are also very well made and remind me of hellish themes in Hellraiser. Malefique has a claustrophobic and cold, dirty feeling with a greenish shade. Sometimes you wonder if the real or occult world presented here is stranger ... when a delayed boy loses his fingers and is asleep to fall asleep by sucking Marcus's breasts, it seems normal, so how strange can the glowing gates of freedom be? Thanks to the budget, the film creates a unique atmosphere and cools the viewer in a completely different way than most shocking genres. I would just like this story to lead to a more cohesive finale. Several elements, such as a guest with a camera, the obsession of other prisoners with books and a doll with toys indicating the end, do not fit the story. In any case, I will have my eyes open to other films from director Valette, though I can not wait to make a Hollywood remake of "One missed call" that was already exhausted and useless in the Miike version.
