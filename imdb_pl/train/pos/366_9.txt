This movie is so great that it's hard to find words to describe it. This is the only time I can not decide what was better, a book or a movie. <br /> <br /> Whoopi Goldberg is amazing, and Oprah Winfrey, such a good actress, can be fun, happy and unhappy at the same time. All in all, the film was well directed by Steven Speilberg and should not be avoided. 9/10
