After playing the nymphomaniac at WRITTEN ON THE WIND, Dorothy Malone finally said goodbye to the roles of her sweet sister / wife and demonstrated the ability to play mantras with the best. She and Gloria Grahame played the same type of tramps - and for her efforts in a very manipulative role, Malone won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. <br /> <br /> The film in which he is located is not fully in line with the Oscar standards, but it is a strong enough melodrama at hand of the talented Douglas Sirk. The explosive scene opens with a almost noisy look and sets the tone for the rest of the amazing fireworks in history, in which the main characters are ROCK HUDSON, LAUREN BACALL, ROBERT STACK and DOROTHY MALONE. Home quarrels between the inhabitants of a rich family with an oil background are the main goal of the drama, with the accent on strong support players, Stack and Malone. They both use the opportunity with both hands, and Stack should also be rewarded for his steadfast work as a weak, alcoholic brother driven into desperation by his own wild motives. <br /> <br /> Nominal stars have less impressive work to do, but do it with their usual skills and belief - Hudson and Bacall. They play more likeable roles with silent authority and understanding. <br /> <br /> The use of color is particularly striking (as usual in the movie Sirk), and yet it does not exclude thinking about the film as a Technicolor noir film in the style of LEAVING HIS HEAVEN. <br /> <br /> It's worth watching with some interesting performances from the entire cast.
