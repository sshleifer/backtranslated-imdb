A very underrated film that tells the story of a young musician caught in an ever smaller spiral of domestic violence. <br /> <br /> It is sometimes hard to see him, while Morris Day is portrayed as a misogynist Prince as a knight on a steed (motorcycle) is still called to beat a woman twice in the scenario. The fact that he can do this and still appear as a defective but confirmed hero is the merit of writing. Prince is so free of the ego in this film that he not only presents himself as a narcissistic megalomaniac who beats women, but his most famous song is fictionalized as written by his father and Wendy & Lisa. What's more, two of his compositions - Computer Blue (though the weakest track of the album) and Darling Nikki - are shown as songs that kill the audience. Perhaps the only concession for the princely ego is the card, which lists (slightly shorter than Prince) Apollonia as 5'6. <br /> <br /> An almost complete amateur cast are mainly band members playing themselves (and reviewers who have spit actors on conditions that have never appeared in other films completely skipped the point) and are doing well in this direction. Morris Day wins most of his praises for his nice ham, though Jerome Benton must also be recognized for rejecting him well, especially for the stage that is fun. Day and Benton even went so far as the routine of Abbott and Costello is fun, which requires some effort. <br /> <br /> Finally there is Prince. Although I admit to bias, I think he is quite a good actor when it comes to presenting a low version of himself. Acting NOT in his profession, it was a movie created for entertainment, so anyone who indicates that the guy in the lead role is not Robert DeNiro and thinking that he is doing it is sad. I do not want this review to be a mocking attack by other people's comments, but even this movie has a low budget and is darkly lit. So how do you make a movie about domestic violence? With full headlights and CGI dinosaurs entering the frame? <br /> <br /> The movie works almost as an ideal picture of the neon era and skinny ties? until you remember that it was created in the world of curly perms and metallic synthesizers, and this is not some retro-recreation. Prince's best film with Oscar-winning music, he sees it in his zenith, and he is saddened by the knowledge that even if he made some great albums, he would never have won the high one again.
