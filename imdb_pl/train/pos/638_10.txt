For anyone who might think that this program is not for them, try it. Network TV has turned into programs that are clones of clones or are reality-based programs in which there are often unrealistic people. This program is a return to family television, where the emphasis is on learning life lessons, meeting real friends and family, and maybe even getting to know our national entertainment. Jeremy Sumpter is one of the most attractive young actors in today's show business and is perfectly manned as a young, somewhat naive new batboy for fictional New York Empires (great name!). Dean Cain, Christopher Lloyd, Mare Winningham and Kirsten Storms complete the main cast and they are all unique. This program deserves a chance to catch and see. Hopefully, it will last for several seasons and we can observe how Pete Young (Sumpter's character) learns and grows.
