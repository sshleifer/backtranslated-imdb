I liked the movie that reminded me of my marriage. It's very clean, you can see it with your family. Very nicely done. The songs are OK too. I think the director is great. The film shows how marriages develop over time. They have pairs at different stages of life and relationships in their lives. The film beautifully presents several stages in parallel in the same story. Some dialogs are quite good. The film very nicely reflects human emotions, not dramatizing. Perfect shows are not perfect, after all. It shows the dynamics of the arranged marriage very nicely when it is new. The film is very well written and directed.
