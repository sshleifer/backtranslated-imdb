Raggedy Ann & Andy is the first movie I've ever seen in cinemas. My dad took my sister and me, and the funny thing is that when we got home, dad asked us "what do you want to do now?" And we said we wanted to see Raggedy Ann and Andy again! lol, and my dad took us back to the theater to see him again - at least I remember that. I was five years old. <br /> <br /> This movie was pretty scary for a five-year-old. Scene with a huge ocean of sweets and a hypnotic camel scene ... I do not remember much of this movie, of course, the beginning was magical, and a few scenes - I would like to be able to find it and probably are looking for it now. <br /> <br /> I remember that I loved Raggedy Ann and Andy.
