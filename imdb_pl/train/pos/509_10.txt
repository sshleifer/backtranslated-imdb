"Broken Bow" takes us to the place where it all began. Set 150 years in our future and 100 years before Kirk, Spock and McCoy. This part of the series "Star Trek" is, in my opinion, the first series since "TOS", which restores feelings of amazement, danger and excitement "Going Where No Man Has Gone Before". Scott Bakula is perfectly manned as Jonathan Archer, the first captain of the first "Enterprise Star Ship". He and the entire cast really show real respect for Star Trek's legacy. John Billingsley is brilliant as a foreign Dr. Phlox, and Jolene Blalock is completely juicy like the tempting but logical volcanic scientific officer T'Pol. Broken Bow is, in my opinion, the best premiere episode of each of the Treks and I believe that Gene Roddenberry would certainly be proud.
