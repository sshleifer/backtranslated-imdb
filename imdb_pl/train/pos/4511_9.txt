I just picked up a DVD with this movie while on vacation in Norway, where it was released with English subtitles. <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully photographed and strongly played. The youngster playing the character of "Fritsa" the main character has a surprisingly open face, which with painful accuracy reflects the tragic events that take place around him. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie, we see that the father whom Frits loves so much has mental health problems and this is raised when the brutal director denies that he attacked the boy and suggests that he was his own father . <br /> <br /> A climactic scene in which Frits refuses to show respect to the director; just stand on the ground and repeating "Liar" when he is brutally attacked by classmates, it is a scene you probably will not forget about. <br /> <br /> The only weak point of the film is a rather banal "Flower Power" teacher who uses every trick of a "friendly teacher" in the book. Besides, I feel that it is a movie that you really like.
