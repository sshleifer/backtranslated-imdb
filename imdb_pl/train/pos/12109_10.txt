Yaitate !! Japan is a really cool program and I really like it! It has been shown in our country recently in Hero TV and ABS-CBN at 5:30. It's about Azuma Kazuma, who is trying to make his dream come true to make Japanese bread that will represent his country. He works at the Pantasia branch in southern Toyo, and also helps his friend (Tsukino Azusagawa) and other bakers (like Kawachi Kyousuke and Kanmuri Shigeru) in defeating St. Pierre and taking control of Pantasia. They fight with other talented bakers from many other countries and not only learn to make different types of bread, but also learn to cook other dishes. It's really funny and unique anime, because they also imitate characters from other anime (such as Naruto, Detective Conan and One Piece) and famous people from real life. This is one of Takashi Haschiguchi's best works and is really obligatory for people of all ages.
