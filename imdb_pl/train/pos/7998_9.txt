I loved this movie. I am a Mexican and I was least offended. In fact, I think this movie should be screened at the police headquarters in all of Mexico. It is a sad truth that our police system is as rotten as a 3-month corpse. It makes me angry when I read in the news how they kill murderers, hijackers and other airlocks, paying a ridiculous fine or living like kings in prison cells. We should have someone like Creasy, the character of Denzel Washington. The bodyguard became a vengeful guard. Abductions are a thriving industry here (at least in big cities). Actually, I want the real-life hijackers to have the same fate as the one on which Creasy did his good job. That would be so wonderful (I'm sorry, I'm very offended!). MAN ON FIRE is a captivating movie that can not be missed. Some may be difficult if you are not used to reading subtitles (Mexicans do this all the time while watching American movies), but the effort will be worth it. Some of the editions are a bit fuzzy ... they remind you of TRAFFIC, remember? (another genius view of how corrupt Mexico is). The film begins a bit slower, but in the second half the pace is gaining momentum. I swear you will cheer when you look at how Denzel Washington sends bad performers. His performance is nothing short of perfect. The ending (no spoilers, OK !!!) is a bit sad, but you'll love it. MAN ON FIRE is one of the best films of the year. "Must be the owner" of the DVD collection! 9 out of 10
