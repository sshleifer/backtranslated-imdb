"Johnny Dangerously" is a kind of comedy that has a laugh and "huh?". But I suggest you give him a chance. I think it looks very good. Few people give this film a chance. It works. Just think of it as a small parody of "Goodfellas". Michael Keaton is very funny in his role. And he does it well. Johnny Dangerously is a gangster who wants to go higher in life. He just goes from big bosses to a beautiful wife. And of course, like many mafia movies, someone wants to kill him. 90% of jokes are laughing. As I said, give him a chance. Take your favorite gangster movies and mix up comedy. You have "Johnny Dangerously". <br /> <br /> 7/10
