Talk about opening the breeze, "Infernal Tramp" has the coolest opening credits ever! Guided by the musical tones, which perhaps are somewhat inspired by the legendary theme "PiÄ…tek 13." (Tsh-Tsh-Tsh-Ha-Ha-Ha), the names of the main players appear on the screen divided into giant syllables. A promising intro of a completely dark survival thriller in the Mexican slasher / backwoods and it's getting colder with every passing minute. Two extremely competitive and testosterone-relieved paintball opponents fight each other in the final duel in a poor bar. According to a press article, there is a wild bear in the nearby forest who has already killed many hunters who tried to catch him. The challenge is that whoever kills a bear will be considered the best macho hero with the largest set of balls. However, after the arrival it quickly becomes obvious that they are not fighting a bear, but a stunned and completely maniacal war veteran with quite an arsenal of weapons in his hideout and numerous tricks of fighting in the sleeve. After a decade of tame and hasty American slashers, this Mexican effort from the early 90s looks and is very refreshing and lively. The formula is simplified, but effective, the main characters are reliable enough, and building in the direction of confrontation with a sadistic killer is quite uncertain. The maniac must have been a fan of Freddy Krueger and Michael Myers, because he also uses his own glove with sharp knives attached to her and a white mask to cover his face. The murders are pleasantly nasty and barbaric, for which I really counted from the aforementioned great opening sequences and wasted a lot of free blood. The surroundings of forestry, especially masked traps, are spectacularly spectacular. "Trampa Internal" is a Mexican slasher / survival hits, which are highly recommended to fans of the genre.
