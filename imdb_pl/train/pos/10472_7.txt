Anyone who loves Reostatics music will enjoy this film. I have a few minor complaints, mainly about the pace and cast of some actors (not Maury) who are not convincing in their roles, but I do not have time to write a detailed review. I just want to warn anyone who has seen this movie or is planning to watch this movie as a CBC TV show in Canada: The version that is CBC is like the WHALE MUSIC version of Reader's Digest --- do not watch this. It cuts whole scenes and storylines (if possible) from the movie. The CBC, which presents the majority of films intact, took half of the viscera with WHALE MUSIC. I do not know why. It's terrible what they did with the movie. Rent a movie or watch it in the theater, but DO NOT watch it on CBC.
