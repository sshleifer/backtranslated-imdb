I totally disagree with the other comments in this video. For example, a movie is based on a book and if the writer had a gay character in it, then how "Hollywood" could simply throw a token figure into the film. Besides, there were two gay heroes and I thought they were great. One was normal and the other was more feminine, but it was not on top. And Diane Keaton gave a great performance and if the second reviewer had the decency to watch the whole movie, they would see that her character developed in the film, interacting with other characters. For example, when she and Adam went to look at the car that Sarah crashed in the scrapyard, you could see her mother's side, and later in the movie you saw that she was also invincible. But I think if you're too worried about gay characters and characters that are flawed, this movie is bad. But if you're more open and I do not know if I have any idea about what's good, then you'll like this movie.
