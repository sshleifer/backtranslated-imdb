These kinds of documents are often very stubborn. This video seems to draw all the views and allows the viewer to decide what to do with the information provided. It is sad that the conditions in which these poor people have to work do a great job by showing the ugly side of the sweat stores. Mardi Gras: Made in China was a good way to show the world how something as fine as beads for celebrations can affect the lives of so many people in another country. <br /> <br /> I had to watch a movie for an English class, where we spent time talking about sweatshops and how some people try to eliminate them, and this movie helped to discuss the topic. It was a great, very instructive movie and I recommend that everyone see it, it opens their eyes a little.
