This is a very strange film by director / animator Richard Williams. Everyone who knows about William's creativity knows that he is a bit clumsy (if not ingenious), but he takes the cake. <br /> <br /> Contains two unfortunate ragdolls that must save the new French doll of the owner from the lustful pirate toy and are at the mercy of several bizarre characters along the way. The strength of this film is primarily its aesthetic quality; his strange character designs, his powerful animation and the contrast between sweet and frightening. Williams' great animation portrayed Raggedy Ann and Andy as real rag dolls, floppy disks, and complexion, not simple cartoon versions of dolls that made him more credible (at least in the visual sense). Animation shines on Camel-with-the-Wrinkled knees, whose body moves with two different personalities controlling each end, silent pursuit with Sir Leonard Looney and of course Greedy. <br /> <br /> The very animation Greed is probably the most wonderful psychedelic animation I've ever seen. This animation has something that makes your jaw drop - and every second is something new. The greedy living in what is considered the "Taffy Pit" is a powerful stain man who lives and mercilessly eats sweets. He sings a song that I can not stop but I feel that I am holding some sexual excitement and then trying to kill Raggeda Ann for her sugary heart. <br /> <br /> The only complaint I have about this movie is that there is too much song. It keeps suppressing the pace of the movie, because there are sixteen of them. There are about six good songs (which should be the only ones), including "I Look, And What Do I See?", "No Girl's Toy", "Blue" (though they did not have to force him to sing twice)), "I Never Get Enough "," Because I Love You "and maybe" I'm Home ". Others seem simply unnecessary and to be honest are not too amazing to listen to. <br /> <br /> It's a weird movie with weird shades, but if you're looking for it, you will not find it better.
