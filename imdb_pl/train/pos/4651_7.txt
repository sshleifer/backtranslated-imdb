I did not set very high expectations for this film, which caused me to be pleasantly surprised. History is sometimes a bit strange, but generally I think it has acceptable credibility. Action scenes are rather nice, and the accompanying music is used to evoke a bit of patriotic feelings common to American films. This may not be the best movie ever, but it is rare in Sweden and I hope to see more similar in the future.
