I would almost give him 10 out of 10. However, there are some confusing parts, as well as fragments that are unsuccessful, which hurt the flow / continuity of the movie. The plot is great and well composed; you will definitely want to see it calmly to fully understand it. The heroes are complicated, just like the plot, expect that you only get so much information to stop scratching your head, it is a movie in which everything is explained at the end. The animation is great, and the combination of femme fatal and film noir resulted in a great movie that does not resemble anything seen in the animation. It is a black and white film and its quiet darkness in a few scenes, so it's worth to watch it on a good T.V or plasma. The voices of the characters write this film in its English version, but it would be more convincing if there were French accents to emphasize that this is happening in Paris. One whole is worth buying on DVD or BlueRay, if you have it! And personally, if you liked this movie, you might like it; Waking Life & Ghost in a Shell 2 Innocence is just a personal suggestion.
