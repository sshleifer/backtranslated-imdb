Hej, guys, <br /> <br /> I've looked everywhere where I can find these two films and I can not find them anywhere in my area. (I'm Australian). Could you help me and tell me where I can buy it from? In General Home Ward Bound 1 and 2 are the best movies I've ever seen and are good for people of all ages. This was my favorite movie in which I was 5 years old and still is when I'm a teenager. It's a great movie for the whole family. My whole family loves this movie, with the exception of my younger sister, because I've seen him many times that he's fed up with it. I love this movie and can not wait to buy it again on DVD. <br /> <br /> Sally
