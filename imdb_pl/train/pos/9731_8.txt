Sidney Young (Pegg) moves from England to New York to work for the popular Sharpe magazine, hoping to live her dream lifestyle, but tries to make a lasting impression. <br /> <br /> On the basis of Toby Young's book on surviving in American business, this comedy drama received different opinions from criticism. Marked as inconsistently funny, but gracefully by the actors, how to lose friends, it seemed that the escape of fish from the mill from the pond makes the joy of another cultural comedy, but it is not. <br /> <br /> In 2008, the paintings are due to actors and a simple but sharp story. We start in the past and then in the present and try to see how Young stood out in one of the best magazines in America. <br /> <br /> Pegg (Hot Fuzz) is too nice for words. Regardless of whether you are striking a zombie with a cricket bat, or showing his helper the right character, the English actor brings charm and lightness to each scene. Here, when the scripts are good, but far from his own standards, he brings a lot of energy to the picture, and he is worth watching. His antics from "Babe 3" are unforgivable, simply breathtaking, like his lush dance, but he does it well. <br /> <br /> Bridges and Anderson are doing well with the stereotypical heads of magazines, in which Dunst fits nicely into a mixed up interest in love. Megan Fox, who stole Transformers, reminds everyone that he can act here with the ridiculous hyperbole of a stereotypical movie star. The fact that her character Sophie Myles appears in the image of Mother Teresa is as amusing as the antics of her character in the pool. To emphasize that there is a dog, and Pegg sums it up in a real British-style comedy with a big, small twist. <br /> <br /> Although the British film is an adaptation of American lifestyle for Young, who tries to fit in and we can see different approaches to telling stories. Young wants dirty law to contrast with American professionalism. The incorporation of contemporary stellar stars will soon make this film dated, but the concept of using movie stars gives this advantage. <br /> <br /> The first picture of Weide is not perfect. The consequences are condensed because the plot becomes too soapy with an uncomfortable, obvious twist of action and there are too many signs to be necessary. Physical comedy can also be exaggerated. By the way, people on DVD are some of the best you'll ever see, which last almost half an hour. <br /> <br /> This comedy drama has Simon Pegg on a shiny form and with the collective approach to telling stories and acute comedy, it's worth watching.
