I am surprised by the negative comments I have read and I can only assume that people who have made such comments were less than honest. This is the most moving and true portrait of Joseph Smith I have ever seen. It was good to the point that sometimes I forgot that I was watching a movie. It brought Joseph a hard life, good-natured optimism, a lasting faith in people and God, and a final dedication to life in a way that honestly left me dumbfounded and silent in awe. If anyone from ANY Christian religion can watch this movie without touching it in any positive way - I would have to say that it is a reflection of the individual, NOT the film. I give the film "10" and I encourage honest souls to watch it. LEAST MINIMUM is the extremely cordial portrait of a man who gave everything he had for what he believed in. In a world where values ​​and beliefs are ridiculed, this film is a lasting reminder of the kind of people we are supposed to be - regardless of of what religious beliefs we have. - Ann Pruitt-
