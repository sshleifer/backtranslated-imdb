An amazingly great movie. You are held in a mortal embrace when you let yourself be involved in history. A successful dentist, Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle), is torn in a life crisis, balancing his career with his family. He notices his ex-roommate from Charlie Fineman's college (Adam Sandler) and wants to touch the base. He states that Charlie, who lost his wife and family during the September 11 attack on America, is no longer in touch with reality ... choosing to engage his mind in his favorite past music and video games. Ex-roommates are lighting up their friendship and strengthening their former bond. Johnson has a friend, Angela Oakhurts (Liv Tyler), a psychiatrist who is trying to get Charlie out of his grief ... but Alan makes his friend come out of the deep darkness. Jada Pinkett Smith plays Johnson's wife. Writer and director Mike Binder is the advocate / protector of Charlie. Also in the cast: Saffron Burrows, Donald Sutherland, Adell Modell and Robert Klein. A great soundtrack with Bruce Springsteen, Graham Nash, Pear Jam and The Pretenders. <br /> <br /> NOTE: I have never been a Sandler fan; but I found him outstanding in this role. In some scenes, I thought loudly ... why he was never asked to play the singer and songwriter Bob Dylan in the biopic.
