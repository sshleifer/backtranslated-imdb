Rupert Friend gives a performance as Prince Albert, who raises "The Young Victoria" to unexpected levels. He is amazing. As we know, Queen Victoria fell into a dark, deep depression after the death of Prince Albert and I looked into the eyes of Rupa Przyjaciel I understood. The film does not lead us to death, but to an incident that could have cost him his life as well. Act of love. I believed it or I should say it. I believed that what he felt was real. Nothing or no one approaches the delicacy and depth of the Friend's characteristics. Emily Blunt is good, but for a moment I did not believe it was Victoria. No real sense of the period. Maybe it was not her fault, but her prince deserved the crown.
