Anton Newcombe creates a movie, and he is the main theme. Watching him beat a song, if not the whole album, quickly showed that he is a real talent. He thinks he is a god, but he is so great and interesting. DW are not as interesting compared to music or otherwise. "Hey, do you have a driving license?", Anton says to the cameraman, "Well, let him put this guitar on!" Great use of archival / home video materials. It's great to see rock doctors. Cool doctor about the creative process. If you like it, see Nirvana Live! Tonight! Sold Out! on DVD. Good experience Anton is this movie. 8 out of 10
