Needless to say, this movie will appeal to only a certain audience; namely, masons and like-minded people. <br /> <br /> With the above in mind, if you're one of those people mentioned, this movie is MUST. In fact, I think it should be compulsory for stores with heads to sell a copy to anyone who buys the first bong. What the Holy Grail of Monty Python is for maniacs and nerds is the film for fools. I saw this movie for the first time 10 years ago, and I still crash it every time I watch it. The jokes make fun of the monsters' lifestyle, much better than the counterfeits of the last days, like the Half-Baked attempt. <br /> <br /> There is no conspiracy, so to speak; the film is more a collection of different sketches; as film heroes, they wander around Los Angeles in their legendary haze. Despite this, the film has an excellent pace and does not drag at all. Many people cite "Up In Smoke" as the best C & C job, but I have to say that Next Movie is better. <br /> <br /> So if you are in the mood for an hour and half of belly laughter, light up, tune in and let your mind go away =) <br /> <br /> Oh, and TOMMY CHONG FREE!
