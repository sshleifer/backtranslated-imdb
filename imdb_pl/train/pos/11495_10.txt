We saw it in one of the local art cinemas in the Montrose district of Houston, Texas. It was a complete surprise compared to the one in the theater newsletter, but both of us were delighted with the artistry. It was beautifully made and (apparently) photographed in a schloss (German castle name) somewhere near Munich. This is a very clear exploration of the sexual relationships of a group of twenty-twenty men and women isolated from everyday limitations. It's fantastic on more levels than I remember. After the film, we returned home, talked and talked until four o'clock the next day. <br /> <br /> The version we saw was in English (mainly), so from the first reviewer there must be at least two films in (probably the original) German version. I was looking for and looking for a video tape version, but never invented anything. I would love to have a VHS or DVD version. It examines relationships at a basic level and is also a great tutorial on how to relate to your partner. If anyone knows the author / director, convince him to re-release this album, preferably on DVD. I can not even imagine being tired of seeing the honest performance of the actors who are now probably over forty years old. Please, bring him back.
