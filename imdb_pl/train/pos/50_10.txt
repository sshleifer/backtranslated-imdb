My children just stopped in this movie one night, and when it started to play, it really aroused my interest. I had to go to the bowling league, so I told them to record it for me on DVR so that I could watch the rest later. I just finished watching, and the front of my shirt has to be soaked after weeping buckets. It was a great movie, though I almost felt the pain and anguish the girls had experienced. And I would never have guessed for a million years why Alissa went from this beautiful girl to the antisocial gotha. It was probably WHY my shirt was soaked because I experienced the same pain that Alissia felt. I would not look for the movie, but I'm sure I saw it. Very moving, very moving. Great for those who love a good drama or tear jerk.
