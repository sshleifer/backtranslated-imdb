This show from the 1970s is the best television program ever. There is the Andy Griffen Show, Saturday Night Live and The Simpsons in my book. This performance from the 1970s lasted for 8 seasons, all of which focused around a group of teenagers / young adults dealing with relationships, separation from parents and their overall future. <br /> <br /> The two main characters, Eric and Donna, are two teenagers living side by side. They live side by side for most of their lives and begin to feel more and more feelings at the beginning of the first season. A large part of the series revolves around how their relationship works. <br /> <br /> Two other characters, Red and Kitty, are Eric's parents. Red was in the service, so he really pushes Eric. Kitty is just the opposite. Although he drinks a lot, he treats Eric and his friends with great care. Bob, their neighbor, is Donna's father, of course. Bob giggles with several different women throughout the story. Bob also annoys Red to the full extent. <br /> <br /> The other characters, Hyde, Kelso, Fez and Jackie, are Eric's friends. They also play an important role in the history of the series. <br /> <br /> Well, the first season is great. Then the characters begin to feel for each other. The first season is original, fun and pleasant. <br /> <br /> The second season is good, although it is not as good as the first one. This is the basic continuation of the First. Eric and Donna are together and everything works great. <br /> <br /> The third season is my favorite. He came back and captured the feeling and humor of the First Season. I also think that the character's chemistry has improved, making watching even more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> The fourth season is not so good. Eric and Donna Arne't together in this one, making the performance a bit less pleasant. It is still fun, although I did not like it as well as in previous seasons. <br /> <br /> The fifth season is the last season I liked. It's the older year of the gang, so it really helps in this story. The fifth season also had the best ending of all seasons. <br /> <br /> The sixth season is mostly good. It is extremely fun, although it does not reflect the feeling that took place in other seasons. The gang is out of high school, so I think it did not reach teenagers that took place in previous seasons. I did not like the last three or four episodes, because they had a lot of drama for them. <br /> <br /> The seventh season gives the same impression as in the fifth season, although do not do it to the end. I enjoyed the seventh season because I did all the others and the ending is great. <br /> <br /> Last season was sucked. Eric was not in what ruined him. Kelso was not there either, which did not help. I hated the Eight Season up to the last episode. I thought the last episode was really good and matching the series. <br /> <br /> So, if you like comedy, give it a 70's chance. They stopped making new episodes, but there are still a few on television. I also recommend buying Seasons 1-7. It depends on you if you want to buy season 8.
