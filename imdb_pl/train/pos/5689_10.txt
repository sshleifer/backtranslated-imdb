First of all, this is a review of a set of two discs that has been included in the "Wonderland" DVD store. <br /> <br /> Two movies attached to the "Wonderland" rental and the documentary by Johnny Wadd completely obliterated the myth created by "Boogie Nights". This myth is that characters involved in the trade of movies for adults are much more than slimy ones who do everything for money, basically denying that they are something other than disgusting selfish whores. This is amazingly similar to what the book "Wiseguy" and the movie "Goodfellas" did fairy tale "Godfather" and most of the rest of the gangster romanticism. <br /> <br /> What annoys me the most now watching these films and probably annoys everyone who has seen and liked "Boogie Nights" is how stupid and gullible people can be educated and sophisticated people. "Dirk Diggler" in "Boogie Nights" is undoubtedly John Holmes, which in contrast to "Dirk Diggler" did not have a salutary quality. Holmes was a sociopath criminal who abused anyone close to him, was completely absorbed in the pursuit of self-satisfaction and was undoubtedly a key participant in the brutal murders of Wonderland Avenue in Los Angeles in 1981. the lie that "Boogie Nights" was and strengthens the description of cruel and pathetic business Lindy Lovelace, known as the entertainment industry of adult movies. This should be required to watch, both on the DVD "Wonderland", for anyone who has had any positive opinions about the story in the movie "Boogie Nights."
