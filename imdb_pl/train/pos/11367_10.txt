Note: May contain spoilers ... <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie 3 times and liked it every time. Seeing it again, it always reminds me how good it is. The HBO television movie - very well done, like most of their films - would have won Oscars for its performances had it been released for general distribution instead of a television. <br /> <br /> As I'm sure everyone knows, reading other reviews here, this is the story of the serial killer Andrei Chikatilo. He murdered 56 people aged 8 in the former Soviet Union. (3 victims were buried and can not be found, so he was convicted only for 52 out of 53 murders.) The story focuses more on the forensic analyst, Victor Burakov, who was perfectly played by Stephen Rea. A man who becomes tortured and is obsessed with finding this killer despite the additional obstacles posed by party hacks, part of it is necessary to be sure. At the end of the film is a very moving scene that mentions how in America investigators are routinely removed from serial killers after 18 months, regardless of whether they want to or not, because of psychological tension and frustration. According to this act, Burakov worked for over 5 years before he left for the first time. He followed the case to the end, three years later. In this scene, his superior, General Fetisov, played by Donald Sutherland, tells him that he admires his dedication and apologizes that he did not know that he should give him a break beforehand. <br /> <br /> Rea is fine. It's over that he does not take over the excess, he does not chew the scenery or do anything that would break away from his image of a man who is hellishly inclined to find his killer. He is a man with passion, but does not show him in the same way as it is usually shown in detective films. From time to time, it triggers outbursts quietly, eliminating more than most could be in such circumstances. Rea does so much with his face, eyes, he does not have to worry. He just * is * - His character, so frustrated after such a long time, at some point brought to frustration, actually says he prefers to find 3 at a time instead of in a year. Of course, he means he does not want more people dying, he just wants clues to catch this man. Rea makes us feel this man. It makes us understand, but we see what it means to live with such horror and futility. <br /> <br /> The mutant, of course, was Czikatilo's childhood, which produces such "monsters". Chikatilo's character is very well made by Jeffrey DeMunna. In some way (though it may seem impossible) it evokes a bit of compassion for yourself. Maybe the worst of us went terribly wrong? Either way, his performance is very well done. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland as Colonel Fetisov (later promoted to general) also does a great job. He seems to be a cynical global official who does not seem more interested in helping in the investigation than anyone blocking Burakowa. But in the end he becomes more than just an assistant, he actively participates in helping Burakov. There is also a very nice phrase by Max Waw Syd, whom the psychiatrist introduced to help profile and find out what kind of deviant they are looking for. <br /> <br /> Although this movie is about a morbid, grotesque and violent story, it's really more about what it takes to catch the killer than the killer himself. Around a very well made movie with great performances and a great scenario. The script manages to do the best in this type of movie: give real events and put them in a dramatic way, which makes you feel like you've met people * for * facts. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10 stars
