This series has come so far. Initially, EVERYONE in the cast from Eric to Fez, they were all new actors and actresses, fresh faces and just looked what they had achieved. They got stuck in the show and it was a success. This is one of the best concerts in history and probably the funniest sitcom I've ever seen in my life. It will be sad to see, but if they end this concert, I hope that the series finale will end with one of the biggest bangs ever made in the season finale. I do not care if the whole season sucks because they save fuel for the last episode. Come down, take the last blow. The show deserves it, the fans deserve it, if they go, let everyone know that it will end, as for Friends, and let the finals be huge. I say Donna and Eric get married, I say Hyde and Kelso are fighting and making friends again. I say something is happening between Fez and Jackie, because Fez is trying so long, but of course it will not be good for him. ONLY CLOSE THE BIG TIME GUYS SERIES! <br /> <br /> This show from the 70s will always be the best in my eyes. Eric, Kelso, Donna, Jackie, Fez, Hyde, I'd like you to have friends. You're the best! <br /> <br /> 10/10 ...
