I just watched this version of "Samhain" and although I still like it, it has nothing to do with the "raw" version that I have. If you check the bulletin board, you'll see an apology from the director for this abridged version, 79 minutes. He says he had nothing to do with this shortened edition with an R grade, with a completely new twisted ending. Christian really does not have to distance so much because the basic elements of the gore are still rising, even if they are tightly cut. It's a damned shame because it has the potential to be one of the hottest and best movies that have been going on for years. She still has porn and inlaid porn stars, and some extreme gore can be seen at least partially. I am glad that I have this "rough cut" because for me it is a jewel for every library of gorehounds. Christian Viel definitely has the skills and vision of delivering goods, and I hope that his next project will be better produced. Idiots had almost classic in their hands and screwed it up for everyone. "Samhain" may be one of the most controversial and ineffective horrors in history, and too bad gorehounds have not noticed what the director intended. <br /> <br /> *********** ******************************* *** Just because you know what you missed, this is my review based on SAMHAIN's "working print". <br /> <br /> The film lasts just over 90 minutes and there are no chapters. There is absolutely no soundtrack, and some scenes have no sound in the dialog box because I think they have to be looped back later. However, most of the movie has sound with sound effects, and when the effect or scene is missing, a message appears as a hint to insert after the movie ends. It is exactly what it says, "Rough Cut", BUT the only uncut version of "Samhain" you will ever see. The reason, because gore is extremely graphic, much more than the NC-17 would allow. Yes, there are a few porn stars, but they're just there to kill, and add some sugar and spices. The story is quite standard, American tourists on vacation in Ireland and end up at home in the middle of the forest. A heavy area from folklore, including ancient druids and Samhain celebrations, or what we call Halloween. (upiorny) <br /> <br /> The film begins with a HUGE dose of blood, because the camping pair is attacked by one of the local inbred mutants. It's a great scene when a guy finds his girlfriend hanging on a cliff and she's crying for help. The only thing he sees is the head, arms and arms hanging in front of him, and when he pulls it out, it has been completely cut into two parts. That's what I would call EXTREME GORE with guts, blood and severed limbs. We're here on the territory of Herschell Gordon Lewis, but the effects look more realistic. I'm just going to skip this story because it's your standard stalk and kill the plot. <br /> <br /> The next scene of gore is something you can see, because the boy is taken to the cave location (Items TCM-2) and associated with the table from the first kill. This maniac then cuts off all limbs (except the camera, with the signal to insert the scene), then we see his torso on the grill, turning slowly over the fire, and the torso has a hard (if he can believe it). Yes, a very bad taste, disgusting, macabre, you will find the right word and it will probably also fit. <br /> <br /> Then Jenna Jameson, her beautiful body and everything, is cut from the neck to the crotch, all her insides are ripped off with graphic joy, and her blood flows into the pot. A delicious, real huh phrase? <br /> <br /> But the best scene is going on at home and I have to admit that it's one of the best gore scenes I've seen. This guy (does not matter who) gets caught in the back by a maniac and slit in the hole of the donkey. Then the maniac puts his hands in and pulls all the insides of the guys, intestines and whatever the hell out of him, straight from his asshole. This happens forever, because the guy screams and more and more interiors are pulled out lying on the bathroom floor. It is so extreme, so beyond that I found myself laughing to hell. Of course, you will NEVER see this scene on the right DVD, IMO, along with most other really extreme gore scenes. <br /> <br /> So what to think about all this. Well, first of all, although I doubt that this movie will ever be released in this completely unpolished presentation, it makes this "Rough Cut" a rare jewel for gorehounds. Yes, in the beginning it is a bit difficult, with no soundtrack, few scenes to insert and credits in which all names are missing. But it makes it so special and I would not exchange it for anything. Extreme blood, yes, extreme extreme blood. This makes "Haute Tension" look like a Disney movie.
