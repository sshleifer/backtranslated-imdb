For me, this movie was powerful. I do not want to be a spoiler, but I had a friend years ago; we were like brothers. This movie has brought back some vivid memories. <br /> <br /> For some reason I could not vote for this film, which would be 10. I was in the process of receiving such messages as: "No votes were cast. ... "And yet I saw in the statistics that were there. I will try again tomorrow (Monday). <br /> <br /> I omitted some minor defects. It was the relationship between the characters that caught me. Beautifully preserved and true situations. I was in several of them. <br /> <br /> A small jewel of the film. Like "Spring ahead" is another overlooked gem. I am very happy that such films are still being created; about relationships between people, well-written, sensitively developed with first-class action and direction. After all, this is not the point?
