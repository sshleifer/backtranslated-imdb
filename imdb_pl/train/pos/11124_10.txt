SOPRANOS (1999-2007) <br /> <br /> Number 1 - Television Show of All Time <br /> <br /> Everyone thought it would be a stupid thing that would not go beyond the pilot episode. Sopranowie have become a cultural phenomenon and widely recognized as one of the largest television programs of all time. <br /> <br /> James Gandolfini plays mysterious crime boss in New Jersey, Tony Soprano, accompanied by a star cast. Edie Falco is great as a disturbing, loving mother from a higher middle class; Tony Sirico is amazing as a superstitious, gray-haired consiglieri who is often very funny. <br /> <br /> While the show was often criticized for the negative stereotype of Italian Americans as mafiosi, and to some extent it is undeniable, I see so many positives from the series. Presentation of strong family values, friendship, love and compassion; Can it be present in a thick TV program about gangsters? Yes. In addition, other burning issues are discussed, such as terrorism, inequality and injustice, homosexuality, drugs, etc. This is not a shallow, boring show about hard guys and violence. He has much more. Many of the problems we see in the show are very real. <br /> <br /> Writing, which was very good, fills in the current problems successfully and they managed to incorporate them into the lives of the characters, which makes the whole thing more interesting. <br /> <br /> Credit must go to David Chase, who created an excellent TV treasure, and to James Gandolfini, for the imagination, the most complex and mysterious television character. <br /> <br /> Just unique. <br /> <br /> 10/10
