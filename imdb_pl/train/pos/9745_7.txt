As someone else commented, this is a good movie. It has a wonderful scenery and wonderful voice of Luciano! I've seen this movie many times and just saw it this afternoon. I forgot how much I miss Pavarotti Nessun Dorma and have to release a CD! It's a great movie to just spend the afternoon in play and reflection. Eddie Albert is great as an agent and a little over the top, but everyone does it anyway. The Italian village is beautiful, but nothing exceeds the balloon to get a perfect view. If you need Olivier's acting, this movie is not for you. If you just want fantasy and great music, watch this movie. Just enjoy!
