"My Left Foot" is a quite impressive film telling the story of Christy Brown, an artist who was mutilated by cerebral palsy and learned to paint with his left foot, the only limb in his body over which he had control. Daniel Day-Lewis won his first Oscar in the Best Actor category for this film, which I'm not absolutely sure he deserves, but he is still noteworthy. Day-Lewis gives Brownie a realistic and sometimes almost humorous accent. Brenda Fricker, as a devoted mother of Brown, also won the Oscar for a credible and moving role. My problem with this movie is that sometimes it is too real. When Brown is in despair and needs to help someone and do it all with his left foot, the movie can be difficult to watch. This often gives a depressing feeling that can turn off some viewers for a while. However, if you look further, you will see a sense of hope and inspiration for those who have difficulties and other difficulties to overcome. Those of us who are not crippled and still consider themselves to have problems, are inspired by this film, because if in a slightly worse condition than we can overcome their difficulties, we can certainly do the same. Well made, sometimes pleasant, but difficult to watch. It may not be for everyone, but it is not bad at all. <br /> <br /> *** with ****
