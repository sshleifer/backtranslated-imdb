I really enjoyed watching this movie. like most people who watched him. I was not sure I got it. Whoopi Goldberg is a very funny comedian and has made many funny movies; i.e. sister act. <br /> <br /> however, it was not really a comedy. it's a drama with comedic moments. so if you're looking for laughter, look no further. <br /> <br /> this film is about a black family that moves from a nice neighborhood in the city to a higher middle class. I would say more, but I think it would ruin the movie. this film does not only deal with racial relations between white and black, but also with the black community. I think it is worth having a chance. if you're not interested in another movie about racial relationships, this movie is not for you
