Red Rock West is one of those rare films that makes you guess what will happen next. Nicolas Cage is confused with a contract killer when he walks into a small town trying to find a job. Dennis Hopper is a bad guy and nobody plays them better. Look at the short performance of country music star Dwight Yoakam. This is a serious drama most of the time, but there are also lighter moments. What counts is that you will enjoy this low budget, but high quality effort!
