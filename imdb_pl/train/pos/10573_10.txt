An excellent example of Busby Berkeley's spectacular musicals made in the early 1930s. Viewers must have been very surprised to see James Cagney in this type of vehicle. Quite a contrast with his "public enemy" 2 years earlier. Cagney adds sparks and interest to a rather routine, tired, formulated plot and story. The main attraction of the film are three extensive production numbers. First, with the conservative number of "Honeymoon Hotel" followed by the spectacularly blinding sequence "By A Waterfall" and then closing the sequence "Shanghai Lil", Cagney only participates in the last issue by kicking it at the top of the bar with a counter from Ruby Keeler. The number "Shanghai Lil" with Cagney is excellent, but a bit comedic and anti-climatic after the more exciting and amazingly amazing choreography of "By A Waterfall". If I was a director, I would put a number of "Shanghai Lil" in the middle and close with "By A Waterfall", which blows the remaining 2 digits out of the water, so to speak and in my opinion the best of the 3 numbers. Three production numbers are icing on the cake, and the performance of James Cagney is the decoration of the cake. Excellent musical achievement, 4-star film, the best musical, worth watching, you will not be disappointed !!!!!!!!!
