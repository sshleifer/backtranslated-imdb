This episode is somewhat misleading. Some say that you have to start from the very beginning, but I have to say that I was a bit confused from the very beginning! <br /> <br /> Clark gets a blow to the head and wakes up on the Fairview Mental Institution floor and jokes about the belief that he is a superhero. Clark says the life he knew was in his head. Delusional. She also finds extraordinary things: Marta is Lionel's wife; Lex is tied to a wheelchair with cut limbs after an accident on the bridge; and Lana is devoted to Clark. But he finds one acquaintance; someone else who devoted himself to Clark: Chloe. He also discovers that the psychological patient also comes from the well-known world of Smallville. And the doctor is a fugitive from the Ghost Zone. <br /> <br /> This episode reminds me of an episode with Buffy called "Normal Again", in which Buffy has vivid dreams of mental asylum. The doctor tried to convince her that everything she knew was a figment of her imagination and that she was really crazy. Her parents were still married, they still lived in LA, her friends did not exist, Angel was never her boyfriend, and she did not have a sister named Dawn. Demons and vampires did not exist either. Both episodes are a bit sad, because the doctors not only tell the heroes that all this is a figment of her imagination, but tells us what it really is: fiction, and that brings us back to reality. It's nice to have a sense of reality once in a while, but we watch these programs to escape reality. It's nice again because characters have to overcome new challenges.
