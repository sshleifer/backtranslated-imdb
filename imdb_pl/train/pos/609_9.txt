A very pleasant, very ingenious and cinematic tale into one whole, Stardust tells the story of a young man living outside the world of fantasy, who goes inside to regain a little fallen star to find a living, young and beautiful star. The kingdom, which the king will soon die, told the king that he would open up competition for his few sons to see who could regain the ruby ​​to become a king, while the three witches want the star to be carved and used to preserve their youth. These three plot motifs intertwine in a complicated way throughout the picture, combining with a good acting game, dazzling special effects and solid sentiment and humor. Star dust is a fun movie and has some fun performances from stars like Claire Danes as a star (I could look at her for a long time) to Michelle Pfeiffer (I could look at her with full magical powers) playing horrible witch Robert Deniro playing the perfectly pirate Nancy-Boy. Charlie Cox as the lead Tristan is kind and credible. We get a very good job from a group of guys playing on sons who are supposed to be the king who are constantly and consistently trying to kill each other. Mark Strong, Jason Flemyng and Ruppert Everett play their roles well in both life and death (they also loved this story). Peter O'Toole plays the dying daddy killer and watches the funny man Ricky Gervais, who made me laugh more than anything in the whole movie in his short five minutes (nice feet). But the real power in the film is the novel by Neil Gaiman and the script created by his creative and productive mind. Star dust creates its own mythology and its own world and works.
