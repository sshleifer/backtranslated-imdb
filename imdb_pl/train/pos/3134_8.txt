It was a well-written story about creating a Batman sitcom and actually combines our heroes in a great task, as well as offers their history of television programs. Unlike the documentaries of the Brady and Partridge families, we will not only look at the past and present life of Adam and Burt, but also see them back in action. Filled with Kapow and catwomenami and Riddler (s), Batman returns in a well-told story, which not only gives us a satisfying shutdown of the Batman series, but fills the modern fan with all the Hollywood stories that are being told, "has been heard for 35 years. <br /> <br /> Kudos !!!
