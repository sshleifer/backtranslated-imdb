I was able to see this classic for the first time a few weeks ago. Created almost 30 years ago, I thought that horrifying moments would be rather tame. Boy, I was wrong. There are wonderful moments that have caused shivers in my spine. Even acting was great, Jamie Lee Curtis was fantastic, and Donald Pleasance was great. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it can be quite slow, but once it starts, you can not stop it. This makes all followers, for example Nightmare on Wiązów Street, Krzyk look very tame. I can not really say that this is the best Carpenter because I have not seen many of them, the only one I can remember is Starman (I think he did). Halloween is the culmination of the horror genre.
