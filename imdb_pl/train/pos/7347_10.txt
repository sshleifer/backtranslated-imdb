I am the owner of the forgotten masterpiece of Ralph Bakshis Fire & Ice on an old tape for renting OOP. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, it's better than any other Conan movie you'll ever see. Sure, it's bad, but who cares? He stood the test of time and the only way he began to look cheesy is a comparison to contemporary epic fantasies, such as LOTR: FOTR (although I love this film). <br /> <br /> The plot looks as follows: After the battle between Fire & Ice, the daughter of the king is kidnapped by subhuman beings Jarols (Ice), while the only survivor of the repressed village saves her. <br /> <br /> Yes, that does not sound like the original Betty nurse, but that's not the point. It's really worth reviving an interesting idea of ​​the world of two enemies: Fire & Ice. And it works. <br /> <br /> When it comes to action scenes: great. They are well supported, have great suspicions and have a lot of loud sounds. Just check the climate battle, now it's over! <br /> <br /> Acting and dialogue: competent. Really. They will not be nominated for an Oscar, but they are okay and do not get angry. <br /> <br /> The animation is quite good. Shot in 3D and rotoscoped (AND THINK) looks pretty good. Many environments look very detailed and well drawn, and although character designs are a bit 1-dimensional, they are fine. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a great, run down little gem and will make you laugh more than any super-heavy "entertainment". 10/10
