All I can say about the Necromaniac / Schizophreniac 2 series is ... if you're even remotely "PC" or do not have a serious sense of humor, you probably will not get it. As sick and disgusting as this movie is really a comedy, not a horror film. If you can appreciate someone who pushes the limits of good taste and political correctness to the most extreme boundaries imaginable, so much so that it becomes so out of control that it is comical, then you have to see it in order believe. This film is so uncontrollable that a large film studio could not touch it with a 10-meter pole (with a condom at the end). In my opinion, the best, most extreme works come from the underground. If you do not stick to the same old formula that people are accustomed to, then they reject it. <br /> <br /> I've seen stacks of horrible, boring Indy movies that were just a waste of perfectly good VHS or DVD-R tape. I also saw piles of stink bombs from great named studies that were a complete loss of millions of dollars. When the movie "NO BUDGET", like the two by Ron Atkins / John Giancaspro, come out and blow up all other "shocking" movies, you really have to look at the entire Indy movie scene. After watching this, you can really see how much freedom an Indy film maker can have when working alone. <br /> <br /> It's funny that even other people who saw this movie and "hated it" admit to the fact that they were laughing all the time. I do not think anyone would be bored watching any of these two. So if you do not take everything you've seen in the mainstream media, too seriously and you're able to laugh at a misanthropic, puppet gifted psychopath who finally burst, you MUST SEE THIS. You can simply be able to see him as an independent, cult classic. Both Schizophreniac / Schizophreniac 2 are favorites in my collection of over 1000 DVDs.
