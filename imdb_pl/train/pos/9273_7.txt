In Iran, the Islamic revolution has shaped all parts of life, including everyday things. But people are still living their lives, generally doing things you can expect, such as football matches to support the national team because they are on the run to qualify for the World Cup. With the exception of women who are not allowed to go to a football stadium to watch the game. <br /> <br /> Often a funny little movie follows a small group of women who were caught sneaking into the football stadium and a small group of bored soldiers assigned to watch them in the kept feather outside the stadium. The absurdity of the situation, the simple desire of these women to support the team (nothing subversive) and the small human touch of each of us life make up quite a good commentary on humanity versus ideology. <br /> <br /> Amateur acting, a good script and dialogue, a really nice movie. Bend It Like Beckham, kind - a warm heart and joy in everyday interests and pleasures of people.
