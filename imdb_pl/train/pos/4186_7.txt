I watched this movie yesterday and I have to say that this is the best $ 36,000 horror I've ever seen (Sorry Steckler). The movie is definitely worth checking out if you're a zombie fan. This film reeks of soul and atmosphere. Some zombie shots are the best shots ever made for a movie. VERY scary, looking dusty, corpse corpses slowly hung to their screaming victims. Brrrrrrr. <br /> <br /> Hot, flaccid Canadian women with sexy accents will keep you occupied before HORROR lifts the undead corpse's head. This movie is playing from beginning to end. I could not ask for more. My only complaint is that it was too short.
