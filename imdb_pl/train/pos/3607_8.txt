A few years ago, I switched on digital subscriber channels and thought I would go half an hour watching "Girlfight" while waiting for "Hart's War". With this title, I came to the conclusion that it is "Flyca B" using gangs of girls from the city. <br /> <br /> To my surprise, it was not about that. Instead, it is a well-written, well-written story about a young woman who almost accidentally falls into women's boxing. She is responsible for taking the younger brother to the training sessions and interest in observing the attacks. Because he does not really want to be a boxer (following only the wishes of his father), he convinces his trainer to take her in his place. <br /> <br /> The story evolves in an intelligent and reliable way when it undergoes various attempts in its mission. At the beginning, her brother's trainer does not want to take a boxer. After being reluctant to do this, there is the problem of setting matches for her. Then confrontation with the father when he learns what's going on. Yes, there is a growing interest in love, but it serves to strengthen the plot, arriving at a more interesting interpersonal interaction with its own consequences associated with the fight. <br /> <br /> In all, it's a great little movie about sleeping, which few have heard about. Some time later, when I saw the advertised and appreciated "Million Dollar Baby", I thought, "Wait a minute, it seems familiar." Needless to say, that I did not watch the "Harta War" that night.
