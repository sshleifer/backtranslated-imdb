and probably the closest to the Dickens story. Although I think young Ebenezer is difficult to watch (who was the idea for period hair, they could certainly do better!), Scott does an amazing job as Scrooge. His delivery of some lines from Dickens finally revived me. Edward Woodward is everything we expect and more Christmas gift spirit. I find G.C. Scrooge Scott is a more credible miser than the more current version of Patrick Stewart. The Christmas morning scene, when Scrooge realizes he has not "missed", is enough to convince someone that Scott knows how to act compared to excessive. It's phenomenal here. Almost the entire cast is amazing. Tiny Tim in this version of the Christmas carol is a bit difficult to look at, almost too sweet. Nevertheless, music and scenery make it a must to watch every holiday. Enjoy!
