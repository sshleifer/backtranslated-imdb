I want Céline and Jessie to go further in their relationship, I want to tell them that they were created for each other, that in many moments in the movie we want them to die for themselves. Their story is what we wanted and probably most of us never arrived. It's about love, but it's not about silly things like "notting hills" or that kind of movie. This is life and I believed in it, I believed it was falling ... It was so wise and touching. I just finished watching it a minute ago and I'm still there ... I want to go to Vienna. I want to see them as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> I have to say that now I became a misanthrope and I felt like love was just a false concept, but in this movie I realized that maybe somewhere, somehow and when, something could really happen. <br /> <br /> I'm French and I did not really know July Delpy despite Kieślowski "three colors: white" ... Now I have to see her other works, because she looks like an angel and has a perfect acting act. <br /> <br /> I saw "before sunset" (continuation in Paris) a few days before I saw "before sunrise" and it does not matter. Both are masterpieces. proof that you do not have to impress your eyes with technology to get clean feelings. I apologize for my English, which I try my best. <br /> <br /> Franck in France
