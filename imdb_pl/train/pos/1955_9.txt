It's just a movie that I love. Some very good British actors, as well as the only Sharon Stone. Catherine Tramell (Stone) masterfully manipulates a well-educated group of people, playing on their weaknesses, to gather experience to write a murderous book. Pretty well plays a female psychopath, using her big sex appeal for a convincing presentation of what can be considered one of the best Black widows. Tramell is used in dark places in society and is free to participate in sadomasochistic crazes on the city side "never visit after dark". From the very beginning, there is nothing in the dialog window itself except R. Stone can also be described as a kind of woman Hannibal Lecter, an emotionless femme fatal without a meal plan.
