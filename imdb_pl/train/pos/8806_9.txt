I decided to see this movie the day it opened in France as a personal way to reflect on what happened the year before; the collection works as intended: it provokes a whirlwind of thoughts and emotions, acts as an intellectual homage, never bends over cheap sentimentality or a reflexive reaction. <br /> <br /> there were many allegations that the film is anti-American: although I can not speak for everyone in this regard, I am one American who considered such statements completely false. people are making a lot of noise about the Egyptian segment, Chahine, because it says the prospects of Palestinian suicide bombers, claiming that civilians in democracy are "honest targets" because they choose governments that bombers want to attack, but it ignores much of the song: several perspectives discussed, no one it is not considered a truth, and critics - even if they saw the song - seem to forget about the passion and warm dialogue that takes place between the director and the spirit of American dialogue, and the director's intense sadness after hearing the tragedy. <br /> <br /> almost all films are beautiful, thoughtful and inspiring, in particular the brilliant work of Mahkmalbaf, Tanovica, Loach and Inarritu. Nair, as usual, effectively tells the true story of injustice committed against a Muslim family following anti-Islamic hysteria, which has swept - and continues to sweep - states. Gitai's work was a bit vulgar loud and simple in criticizing media hysteria in the face of terrorism, and Penn's work was too impressionistic and elliptical for my tastes, although I expected that I would like it. Borgnine is very good and courageous in this. SPOILER WARNING: one of the reviewers below misread the fall of the towers as a happy moment for the character; my reading is rather that the fall of towers is something, because light floods his room, inscribes him into a loss in his life, which he did not want to recognize. again, it is a kind of impressionistic piece, because we know that if the towers really blocked the light to the man's apartment, there would be nothing but smoke and ash, not the light flooding his window.
