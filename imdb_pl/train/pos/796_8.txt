Thomas Capano was not the head of Anne Marie, Tom Carper, the governor. This is the reason why the federalists got involved, called Clinton, and asked him to involve the federal in the case. I lived outside of Philadelphia then, so the case was on the first page every day. I also read Ann Rule's book and saw the "City Confidential" segment in A & E. Tom Capano was a megalomaniac (sp.), A uber controller and a monster. He claimed to love Ann Marie, but he only wanted someone to control. When she did not let him do it, he killed her, the final form of control. I think it is a waste of money that is still alive.
