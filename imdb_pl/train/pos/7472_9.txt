I really liked this movie. I have read some other comments and although I regret those who did not understand this, I agree with some of the critical remarks. Which in a strange way makes this movie even more enjoyable. I agree that they have a good cast to transform an intelligent movie for a wide audience, but it has many levels and is still great to watch. I also love movies, such as the ones that evoke so many debates, theories, possible endings and hidden subtext. Congratulations Mr.Crowe, definitely in my ten. <br /> <br /> P.S. I saw it when it first came out when I was backpacking in Mexico, it was late at night and I had to go back to the hotel and have a serious paranoia journey! Where does the dream end and it starts real?
