It's a fun thing to watch movies. Nowadays, when "internalized emotions" and "emotional detachment" are favored over simple sentimentality, it is difficult to remain true to your true feelings. <br /> <br /> Soon after finishing the duties of the jury at the 58th Berlinale, I managed to catch Kabei Yoji Yamady. <br /> <br /> After the screening, I watched people dreamy from the theater room, watery men, women and reviewers. Even the director of Berlinale, of course a blind movie viewer, admitted to being surprised and said he was crying three-quarters in this shamelessly sentimental experience. <br /> <br /> But what really surprised me is the reviews that came after. Despite the fact that the film was incomparably touched upon, many reviewers decided to be lukewarm and emotionally unemotional in their writing. Apparently, after weeping, they set up their "thinking hat", and consequently they missed what I thought was a genius for Kabei. <br /> <br /> Let me explain. <br /> <br /> The history of Kabei, settled in pre-war Japan, is centered around one of the writer's families and their fate in it, after being held in prison for what has been described as "ideological crimes" against the imperial will. Through a series of long emotional scenes, Yamada meets a man, his loyal wife and two daughters, as well as three side characters: the beautiful younger sister of a man, an inept ex-student, and the daughter of an uncle? ? everybody comes to help the family deal with their fate, in the absence of a man at home. <br /> <br /> The story moves in a slow but steady pace, and the heart competition appears exactly at times when everyone is able to predict. This of course makes it almost impossible for any of the audience to be too emotionally upset by any dramatic event. <br /> <br /> In other words, although you learn to love the family and its helpers and feel sorry for their unhappiness. The situation is so dormant in the certainty of the plot that you expect a special kind of ending. <br /> <br /> However, two hours of film (do not worry, Yamada provides the viewer with enough moments of gravity and lightness to get you), hits you with what I can only describe as a "sting". Everything you've assumed that this story was about an innocent man torn out of a faithful wife and daughters? now he suddenly points to one of the family's helpers. Someone you've taken for granted is now falling into an unexpected fate. <br /> <br /> Something interesting happened at the moment in the theater where I was. Everyone began to sob with little or no inhibition. /> <br /> "My word!" I muttered under my breath. It struck me then that "Kabei" was, in the final analysis, something more than a film about a family torn apart by an empire on the verge of war. It was in fact a devious examination of one common man: How little we cared about the secret feelings of people who are closest to us. <br /> <br /> Now, the film was most often criticized for being technically sound, but lacking in innovation. This is what happens when I think that reviewers assume the proverbial thinking cap. From Kabe, I believe that Yoji Yamada knew exactly what trick he was going to use to touch one unique aspect of humanity. A bad old trick that he used flawlessly in the Tora-san series, and later in Tasogare Sebei. <br /> <br /> After calming the audience with a kind of narrative comfort zone, he throws us into the sphere of emotions rarely studied in the cinema. <br /> <br /> For me, this is the most effective movie tool of all. One that avoids being detected but affects you deeply. And the proof of its effectiveness was a thousand wet pieces of Kleenex, thrown into the trash bin right in front of the cinema room with a thousand seats. <br /> <br /> If only some reviewers resisted being so intelligent that they forget what cinema really is. Human emotions. Clean and simple.
