I just saw this movie @ TIFF (Toronto International Film Festival). Hal Hartley fans will not be disappointed !! And if you are not familiar with the work of this director ... it does not matter. This film can certainly become the same. I have to go through the second screen ... it was amazing I have to see it again - and soon !! <br /> <br /> This movie is very funny. His dialogue is very intelligent, and Parker Posey's performance is outstanding because he performs in the title role of Fay Grim. Fay Grim is the latest film about the world and characters introduced in the movie Henry Fool (2000). Visually the most important stylistic feature is the usual use of a sloping (or Dutch) angle, which can often be seen in previous Hartley songs appearing in various shorts available at Possible Films: short works by Hal Hartley from the 1994-2004 collection and in The Girl from Monday ( 2005). <br /> <br /> I watched the film on September 11th. Textually, the adventure of Fay Grim in this story is filmed on the changed world after September 11, 2001. Without going into the main spoilers, I perceive this work and the world of the story as a brave political and original portrait of geo-politics, which is rare, if at all, in the foreground of fictional cinema after 911 (see Syrianna: note - Mark Cuban Exec. Prod in both of these films ... at least interesting). <br /> <br /> Finally, for those who are closely associated with the characters of Henry Fool, Simone, Fay and Henry, this movie is fun and self-conscious and autothematic. With this in mind, the character of Fay Grimm begins in the movie, right where Henry Fool ended, but towards the end of the film ... Fay's knowledge and experience have changed and developed during the narrative. What can be prepared for the future of Fay and Fool families ... ?? I can not wait for the third part of this story!
