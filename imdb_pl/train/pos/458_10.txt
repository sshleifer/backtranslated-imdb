My wife Kate and I loved the series and we can not wait for the next one (I hope there is a sequel!). I'd like to know what a catchy song is called and who wrote it, maybe because I'm "old and gray" and I'm still interested in life :-). If someone has full texts, send them. <br /> <br /> Of course, one of the reasons why my wife and I liked the series so much was that we are 75 and we are retired, but still very active intellectually. It is great to see a demonstration highlighting the contribution that elderly people with special skills and experience can bring to society. The aspect of people's interest, showing the interaction of heroes and young people around them, is an important part of the program. <br /> <br /> This series is very funny and very sophisticated, on par with some of our other favorites, "Spooks" and "Hustle".
