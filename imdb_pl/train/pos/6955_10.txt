My Super X-Girlfriend is a hellish ride on a roller coaster. The special effects were excellent, and the costumes that Uma Thurman wore were a hubba buba. Uma Thurman is an underestimated comedian, but she proved that everyone was wrong and nailed his role as a crazy girl. She was simply WONDERFUL !!! Luke Wilson was also good as an average Joe, but he was a brave man who worked with one of the greatest actresses of all time. The supporting cast was also excellent, especially Anna Faris, who was very good (much better than in the Scary Movie series). and Uma Thurman, this movie would not do so well. This movie is clearly 10/10 for cast (Uma Thurman), his director, screenplay and original story. This film is highly recommended.
