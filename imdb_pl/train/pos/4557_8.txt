I thought Hugh O'Conor was amazed as a young Christy Brown and he really deserved more recognition for his role. I could not believe how well he played the role. Of course, Daniel Day-Lewis was also a genius. My favorite scene is that the boys are playing football, and Christy uses her head to stop the goals and then kick the penalty! Amazing performances of two Christys (and others).
