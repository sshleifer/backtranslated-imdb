This program has a great story! It's very reliable! A man's wife dies, and he can not look after children, so he calls his brother-in-law, his best friend, and many others come later in the show. Such as Rebeecca Donaldson, a nice but strong dog Comet, Nikki and Alex, whom you can discover yourself (I do not want to spoil it) and force Kimmy Gibler! (DJ helper), but the kids are great too. It was Mary Kate and Ashley who took off for the first time! Or maybe you know Candace Cameron Bure from such programs as St.Elsewere Punky Brewster and it's such a raven! Jodie Sweetin plays Steph, a loving middle-aged child who feels left out. Really a very good concert!
