The story tells about Ankush (Abhay Deol) - who is a professional witness of marriage, in short acts as a witness for couples in the marriage registration office - and Megha (Soha Ali Khan) who escaped from the house in Nainital to marry her interest in the love of Dhiraj (Shayan Munshi). The story begins with Megha waiting in the marriage registration office to let Dhiraj come, but for some reason he does not show up. Ankush appears in the picture here, who approached Meghy with the intention of earning Rs. 200 for his work Witness and ends up helping her, providing her shelter. Ankush grows on his side, working in the bank as an agent ... Ankush falls in love with Megha and she also falls in love with him (or kind of love), both agree on marriage, and Dhiraj returns to the picture. Unexpected circumstances happen, I should actually say, expected circumstances with unexpected reactions, and then .... <br /> <br /> Actually, the story of the movie is a bit different than the films we see and I do not think it's accepted by, but if you're a movie fanatic like me and you like to watch something else, you'll love the movie. The film is simply an innocent love story developed very well by the heroes of Abhay Deol and Soha Ali Khan. The characters are so natural that you feel as if something was happening to the next guest. The background film's music also plays a very good role, it's just too good. The way Delhi is shown is very good and gives a fresh feeling. <br /> <br /> so let's stop and summarize. <br /> <br /> Story: A very popular story is very well worn and transformed into a wonderful experience. <br /> <br /> Music: Well, as it was in the case of Himesh Reshammiy, so I did not expect much, but I still liked several songs from the movie, including Qawwali. <br /> <br /> Acting: Abhay Deol was the most impressive, very natural and innocent actor, but he should not sing in the songs. Soha Ali Khan, she is a doll, a very cute doll that I must say. Again, very innocent and natural acting, and these two actors fit in perfectly with their characters. In addition to these two Shayan Munshi needs acting lessons and there may be several layers of fat to cover the bones. Other actors did their job well. <br /> <br /> Stars: I would also give 3.5 stars to 5. You will enjoy the movie, if you watch it in the theater, I recommend watching it in the theater, if you're a movie fan and take unusual stories. Otherwise, wait for the DVD to appear. The film certainly will not appeal to the masses, and the interest it can do is the advertisement from mouth to mouth.
