**** Includes Spoilery **** <br /> <br /> I have been a fan of horror films for many decades. Just when I think I've seen all the wonderful, another one comes up to surprise me. I've never seen this movie before. It was a feast, also off the beaten track ... not just the path to the swamp ferry. Here is the horror of the forties who dared to try something VERY different. This pretty girl is (fearless) intrepid for change and saves people, including the man he loves, from the monster! How does this happen in the case of a surprise? This girl was the complete opposite of most women in the films of that time, without shouting at their own shadow, without fainting in terror, without stumbling over a leaf as it runs. This girl was not afraid to live alone in an isolated hut away from the rest of the residents. Not only this, but the place was located on a misty swamp that apparently haunted. Heck, she even drowns on the swampy grass outside ... like the usual Ripley version of the forties. No snake, gator or ghastly strangler would dare interrupt this gal. Books about early feminist films should include this overlooked job. <br /> <br /> See if you are a fan, like me, of these wonderful atmospheric classic horrors B / W, which were created only in the 1930s. 40s. And remember to wear a cast-neck turtle neck for protection.
