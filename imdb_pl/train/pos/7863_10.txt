This film is an eye-opener for those who can only enjoy the exciting lifestyle of the stars. He tells you how people who would like to do good can not. Plus the scene of the bomb explosion is very real. <br /> <br /> What you read and what you learn is simply not happening !!! <br /> <br /> Can raise the BP level by 10% <br /> <br /> All actors played their part very well. <br /> <br /> Some scenes could / could have been avoided to enable teens. <br /> <br /> This movie is quite grown-up in nature. /> <br /> Not a movie that you can see with your family. <br /> <br /> Casting is great !!!
