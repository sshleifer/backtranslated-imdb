My Super Ex-Girlfriend is a funny movie no more. <br /> <br /> The story is simple and simple. Matt Saunders (Luke Wilson) meets Jenny (Uma Thurman) in the subway and joins her. At the beginning of their relationship, everything seems fine, but then Matt learns that he is G-Girl. At first Matt seems really cool, but it turns out that G-Girl is very jealous and needy. He decides to break up with her and connect with her friend Hannah (Anna Faris). It makes the G-Girl very angry and starts to take revenge on the ex-boyfriend. <br /> <br /> I liked the scene the most, in which the G-Girl takes revenge on Matt. It was also nice to see Anna Faris in a different role than her character from the Scary Movie saga. <br /> <br /> We give this film 7 out of 10 and I recommend it to anyone who likes a nice comedy.
