The dehumanizing effect of war is the subject of research in films; like the inhuman but potentially life-saving dehumanizing effect of military training. Joel Schumacher's "Tigerland" is consistent with the standard template, we see men treated as dirt, but emerging as soldiers, with some mutual respect for their commanders, and the court is judged if such an extreme process can be considered legitimate; the same is true of the merits of the war in which they are trained (usually, as here in Vietnam). But "Tigerland" has an interesting goal, focusing on a conceited dissident named Bozz (played exceptionally well by Colin Farrell) who understands that all power finally governs the agreement and lack of awareness among the powerless of their own complicity. Around this character, a taught, thrilling story was constructed, and the action never left America (while Stanley Kubrick's "Full Metal Jacket", to name just one other film of a similar type, lost focus after the action) transferred to Asia). Although it is not a movie of stunning originality, it is perfectly made and captivating all the time: the best movie of the director I have seen, and one of the best of this genre.
