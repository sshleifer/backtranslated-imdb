I thought this movie was quite good. Some parts were trivial, but this is understandable because it was created over 55 years ago. I thought that the best performance in the film was given by Michele Morgan, who played Millie convincingly. Jack Haley is also very good as Mike O'Brien. Although I'm not a big fan of Frank Sinatra, I think he was very good in this movie. If you want to be stupid, over the highest musical comedy, the Higher and Higher movie is for you. <br /> <br />
