I'm in front of the TV now, watching Casomai. It changes, evolves or better ... it changes. It starts with the wedding of two heroes, in which their love story is described. Then everything changes, the child is born, and the rest usually happens together. This is not a special movie because it talks about a normal pair, and normality is the center of the movie. He does not want to show us something special, there is nothing new, it's just a normal love story, a couple's story, and being normal, it's different from the rest. It is also a flashing movie, everything is short, each scene is only a few seconds long. It is a reportage, many things are known, because friends and parents talk about it, and their opinion is central, opinions create history and destroy it. It's a simple couple story, as I said, but it's not boring, it just shows a pair, it should be all known, that is, but I'm sure each of you will want to know what happened, so forget to watch the end!
