......... and you will get Chori Chori Chupke Chupke. Do not get me wrong, this movie is much less pronounced (or even not) than Pretty Woman, but it was a new topic for Bollywood. The topic was accepted, but he's far from Jism, Murder and Julie. In truth, the topic is presented in a very clean way. But the plot has a lot of stereotypes. The beginning of the film is presented in very "movies." There are very small holes in the story. The movie rises when Rani has a miscarriage when you feel that you are watching something other than a typical movie. Otherwise, the entire family sequence at the beginning was exaggerated. Acting could not be better. Salman Khan sometimes makes an impression, and sometimes it will disappoint you. Here he gave one of the best performances. In addition, his role is so well written that he applauds every time he solves the problem. Rani Mukherjee was right. In the film you feel her character the most, but it is dimmed by Preity Zinta. Preity Zinta is a perfect picture. Of the three, he gives everyone running for his money. It's surprising how she can be so convincing when she's innocent. And trust me, Madhubala is far from your neighbor's girlfriend. This role is one of the reasons why I rate it highly. The supporting staff is like the family you see in HAHK, where they have no meaning for the plot, but I think they are tolerable here. The songs are pretty nice. The title track is my favorite of them along with Dil Tera Mera Dil (Hearts). Mehndi Mehndi (Henna) and Dekhne Walon Ne (Look at the World's Sight) are two songs that perfectly match the movie. The Preity cabaret number, Diwani Diwani (Crazy), could have been shortened, while Punjabi No. 1 stumbled on boring, though well-danced. Otherwise, the movie is definitely worth a look.
