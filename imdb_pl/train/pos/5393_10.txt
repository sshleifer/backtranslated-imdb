I was probably one of the few Australians who did not watch tennis when the series was broadcast. I must say that William McInnes appeared for the first time, but he is one shitty actor! But when the series continued, he toned down his performance and loved him completely. He was such a rotten guy, but he made me laugh. I watched the program to see Hugo Speers (Heart and Bones, The Full Monty) and Tom Long (SeaChange, Two Hands). It was interesting that Speers played a nice, calm man, and even more interesting to watch Tom Longs's waving muscles! Sigh ... Seriously, Long's show was a total shock and really brilliant. He stole the show. Martin Sacks was also good at the small role, and the main actress was involved in the performance. I recommend this program if you like stories with a surprise and watching Tom Long walking without a shirt ...
