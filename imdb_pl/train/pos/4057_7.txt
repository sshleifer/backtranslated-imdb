Like many Americans, I first became acquainted with the work of Hayao Miyazaki when I saw "Spirited Away". I fell in love with the film and saw it many times. Now I am looking for every Miyazaki movie. One of his earlier works is Castle in the Sky. Although it is still pleasant, it is not as good as "Spirited Away" (although comparing this or any movie with its masterpiece from 2002 is perhaps unjust). <br /> <br /> A young boy named Pazu (James Van Der Beek) is working in a mine late at night when he sees a girl falling slowly from the sky. When she wakes up the next morning, she introduces herself to Sheeta (Anna Paquin). But Sheeta has a secret, and before he realizes, Pazu is drawn into an adventure that will lead him to danger with pirates, an army and a lost floating city. <br /> <br /> Hayao Miyazaki's film means that you can expect one thing: a sense of miracle and magic. Many filmmakers have tried, but no one can feel the magic and admiration of Miyazaki. Watching Miyazaki's movie is like experiencing a fantastic dream from childhood. <br /> <br /> Because the film is animated, film dubbing is not a major problem, because it is almost impossible to determine if the lip movements match the words. It also helps to ensure that the translated dialogue is well-written and expressed by talented actors. The voice game is varied. James Van Der Beek is doing the best. He brings irresistible enthusiasm and excitement to the role of Pazu, which is perfect for this character. Anna Paquin is almost as good as Sheeta. She is terrified by the events around her, but she knows what she must do. Mark Hamill is unrecognizable as evil Muska. He's dangerous and wants something from Sheet, and he'll do anything to get it. The other voices are bad. Cloris Leachman is horrible as Dola. Leachman may have won an Oscar for "The Last Picture Show", but he is annoying as a pirate leader. Leachman gives the hero a terrible squawk that is almost always monotonous. It's so bad that it almost ruins a movie! Jim Cummings is an effective voice actor, but he is generally confused. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend seeing "Castle in the Sky". I probably buy it myself. But even if it's not as good as Spirited Away, it's still pretty good.
