This performance will be successful because it appeals to all adults regardless of where they are. As a married man for 26 years, I feel sorry for the figures of Patrick Warburton: he loves his wife, but assumes that she knows it. I also like his monotonous delivery; it is never too excited or too low. Nice character team. It will be a nice addition to the Monday line-up. <br /> <br /> I do not know how David Spade will be in his role. It's best to enjoy small doses. It also seems to be a bit too old to continue trolling for women. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the pilot and I am looking forward to the development of the series.
