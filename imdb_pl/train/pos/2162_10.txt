I was so surprised when I saw this unappreciated movie ... I understand why some of you do not like this movie. Its pace is slow, characteristic of Japanese films. Nevertheless, if you're preoccupied with a movie like me, you'll find that it's not a problem. <br /> <br /> I have to say it's the best comedy I've ever seen. "Shall We Dansu?" Is often considered a masterpiece of Japanese comedies. This is very different from Hollywood, such as Austin Powers or Scary Movies, in which the gag is guaranteed every few minutes. It's rather light, a movie that makes you feel good. <br /> <br /> I love this movie because it makes me feel "real". The plot is simple but pleasant. I was very delighted to see that Sugiyama (the main role) discovered the meaning of living in a dance. Before I watched the movie, I was a bit depressed because of the hard school work. I felt lost. However, this movie made me think about the bright side of life. I believed that I was in the same boat Sugiyama; if he could be in his hobby, why could not I? It reminded me of "discovering my own future" and discovering happiness in my everyday life. <br /> <br /> It's important to remember that the actors are not professional dancers. While some of you may think that the dance scenes are not as perfect as you expect, I like it because it makes me feel that the characters are really "alive" learning to dance during the movie. <br /> <br /> First of all, this movie is inviting and cordial. As a comedy, it perfectly fulfills its task. He definitely deserves 10 stars. <br /> <br /> Aoki is funny :-D
