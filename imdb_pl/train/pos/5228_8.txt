This movie was fun for me. Fraud in other popular movies of those times were some of the funniest I've seen in this kind of movie. Try it. If you've seen movies that were fake in this movie and you got humor, you should enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> I (and others who watched this movie with me) felt the funniest part of the movie (it's not a spoiler, because I will NOT tell you what is actually happening) was a scene with a "brilliant thing" from the MIB. When they first discover the device and do not know what it is ... and then again in the movie ... you'll understand when you get there. <br /> <br /> My only complaint about the movie is that I've never been able to find it on DVD to be able to buy a copy.
