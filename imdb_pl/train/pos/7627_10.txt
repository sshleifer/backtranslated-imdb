I remember watching this movie some time ago and after watching 3000 miles to Graceland, everything came back. Why is not there a video or DVD version yet? It is a sacrilege that this majesty of making films has never been released while other trash was. In fact, this is the only movie by John Carpenter that has not been released. In fact, I have not seen him on TV since the day I watched him. Kurt Russell was the perfect choice for the role of Elvis. This is certainly the role in which he was born. The break of John the carpenter from horror brought this jewel that I would like the TV to play again. It is well played and well made when it comes to singing. The majority of Elvis' biggest hits are enthusiastically heard. I think it was also a movie that teamed up with Russell and Carpenter, thanks to which they made a lot of great movies (Escape from New York, The Thing, Big trouble in little china and Escape from LA Someone, release it before someone remakes or their own a version of my life, which, I think, would not only destroy the king, but also ruin the magic he has.
