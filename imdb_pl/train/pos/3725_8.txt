There are four great films depicting the war in Vietnam. There are (in a special order: Apocalypse Now, born on July 4, platoon and finally Tigerland.) All except Tiger focus on the real war and the people in it. Tigerland focuses on men in advanced training for the Vietnam War). The figure of God is one of the most important representations of a man questioning the war and its absurdity, which was done in many war films, but rarely in a boot camp. the driving force behind this film is to deal with his feelings and emotions. The character of God makes this movie so good. It is a pity that he did not get a larger edition. It belongs to the shelves of every movie fan next to the mentioned film titles.
