Yes, it is a very low budget. Thus, the game is not an award-winning material, and sometimes the action takes place at a slow pace, because filmmakers shoot longer sequences, not a million moments, which are then edited into a movie. This film makes up for it with an exceptional script that takes vampirism seriously, explains it and develops the entire story from it. In addition to the history of vampires, we get detailed genetic information, law enforcement and law, martial arts, philosophical considerations and good metal music. Kudos to Dylan O'Leary, director / screenwriter / main actor. It is beyond me how this man could fulfill all these roles and do them so well. I think that in order to appreciate this film, you must be well versed in various topics to see that the writer has done a lot of research and knows all these things. There is also great camera work, interesting camera angles and one underwater vampire attack - something I have not seen before, but who pay tribute to the underwater zombie attack in Zombi Fulci. The cast is good, as long as the sexy woman is really sexy. The main vampire also looks perfect for this role. The victim looks vulnerable. My only complaint is that a low-budget film with a horror should have more nudity. If you want to see the original vampire movie with a great story, this movie is for you. I'm looking forward to Mr. O'Leary's future projects.
