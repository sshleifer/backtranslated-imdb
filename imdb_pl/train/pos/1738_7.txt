It's a funny movie. Burt Reynolds is a NASCAR star who signs a sponsorship deal with Ned Beatty's Chicken Pit restaurants. The contract contains many humiliating clauses, such as forcing Burt to wear a suit with a chicken during the race! Jim Nabors is his (not entirely convincing) main mechanic. Loni Anderson (oh! Yeah!) He was assigned by Beatty to make Reynolds honest and strictly abide by the contract. It's a funny movie in which Burt proves he's not too proud. I like this!
