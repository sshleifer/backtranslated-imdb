At this point, it seems almost unnecessary to say that Jon Bon Jovi provides a strong, strong, smooth performance like Derek Bliss. His abilities as an actor were previously determined by his critical acclaim in other films (The Leading Man, No Looking Back). But in case someone keeps wondering, yes, Jon Bon Jovi can act. He can work well and expect from him. It's easy to separate Derek from a guy who pushes hits on VH-1. <br /> <br /> I usually did not watch the horror movie. I expect them to focus more on sensational gore than on dialogue and story. What really pleased me in this film is the fact that there really was a real plot. Gore is not about becoming the object of the film and there is no disturbingly realistic quality of films with higher technical budgets. So gore fans may be disappointed, but history fans will not. <br /> <br /> In contrast to an action movie, such as the U-571, in which dialogue takes over the back of the bombast, we have the chance to meet "good guys" and actually care about what will happen to them. A few scenes remain unexplained (just like Derek's hallucinations), but you get the impression that certain aspects were to form the basis for continuing. Unfortunately, due to the lack of interest from Hollywood in this film, the sequel will never happen. These few examples can be forgiven, knowing that vampires could have been a continuation of the series. <br /> <br /> Is this the best movie I've ever seen in my life? No. Is this a good way to entertain for about two hours? Yes. He will not leave a person who is afraid of horror with insomnia and will not leave the horror devil completely disappointed either. If you are somewhere between a lover of horror and a lover of horror movies, this movie is for you. He reaches a happy medium with effects and history balancing each other. <br /> <br />
