The main reason I wanted to see this movie was a great cast. Lots of my favorite actors in one movie is amazing without seeing him. But this movie surprised me. It was not what I expected. It's been some time since I saw it, but I remember that I could not stop laughing !!! And it was not just the cast that did it for me. The script was amazingly written. Every time you expected something to happen, it did not happen. There were so many twists and turns, but it suited the whole tone of the movie, not pretentiousness. The cinematography together with the set was also absolutely beautiful. I can not really say anything bad about this movie! Imagine that Andrew Davoli will have some more time on the screen!
