The Thief of Baghdad is one of ten of my favorite movies. It is exciting without gore, it is beautifully filmed, and the direction of art is impeccable. Casting could not be better. Rex Ingram told me to believe in genes. And the personification of evil is undoubtedly Conrad Veight as Jafar. He set the bar very high. <br /> <br /> .. I watch this movie at least twice a year ... and it never gets tired. This film is an adventure for all ages ... it is not too old to enjoy it. Bahgdad the thief touches my memories in a more innocent way ... I was ten years old when I first saw him and the United States was about to enter World War II. Conrad Vieght was such a great actor that a few years later he was able to continue this "evil being" in "Casablanca". And Korda joined forces, I think, with Justin and Dupree again in "The Four Feathers" .... a great movie!
