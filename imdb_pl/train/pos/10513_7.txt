If you have any idea about the production of Jane Austen, now he repeats the same in each of his novels: marriage, marriage and marriage! In my opinion, all the movies from her novels are a bit boring, but I like the characters of Austen, because they all have a certain personality and typical sayings that they like to repeat, just like in Emma. What makes Emma good is Gwyneth Paltrow, she's doing very well in the lead role. Also, the fact that each of the characters in the movie does not seem to be able to think about anything else, how to get a good partner and soon get married, makes the movie is fun.
