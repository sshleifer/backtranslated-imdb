Gung Ho is one of those movies that you want to watch over and over again. Michael Keaton is responsible for urging a Japanese car company to come to his city, thus creating jobs for Hadleyville residents. What happens next is one funny moment after another. These two cultures collide and it's up to Keaton to stick together. Look for great performances by Keaton, Gedde Watanabe, George Wendt, Mimi Rogers, John Turturro, Soh Yamamura and Sab Shimomo. Everyone is perfectly staffed. Do not be fooled by the low number of ratings. This is 7.5 in my book. It is worth noting that the name of the city of Hadleyville was also used at noon. Yes, it's a real Hadleyville, but in Oregon.
