This is an excellent, stand-up DVD! Eddie Izzard is the funniest person I've seen for years. His routine is fun and allows for a great conversation with others who have seen her. I highly recommend it. The part about Europe's history is a bit slow, but the ending jokes in French are pretty good, because you do not have to speak French to get it (although if it is, it's still fun). Also the parts about being a transvestite are quite good. The first scene (about San Francisco) is not great, but the first time is ridiculous. Skip these if you can. Almost not worth watching. However, it is a really fun, fun stand-up show that everyone should see. "I was dead then!"
