Director Vincenzo Natali's Cypher is a complex and ingenious thriller that, although it requires a certain suspension of faith and concentration, manages to be a completely entertaining experience. <br /> <br /> Morgan Sullivan (Jeremy Northam) - a domestic husband with an overbearing wife decides to add a bit of spice to his mundane existence, earning a job as an industrial spy in the high-tech company Digi Corp. His task is to travel to conferences throughout the country (under the assumed identity of Jacek Thursby) and secretly broadcast speeches given to his bosses, using a nice little electronic pen. <br /> <br /> In reality, however, the speeches are just a cover for far more wicked actions. Morgan and other conference participants are brainwashed. Drunk water, which they drink, introduces them into a temporary coma, during which he makes them forget about the past and permanently adopt a new identity. When they are completely convinced that they are someone else, they are recommended to apply for jobs from competing companies, where they are able to engage in corporate espionage without suspicion. <br /> <br /> But Digi Corp's plans are limited by the intervention of a shady rental agent Rita Foster (Lucy Liu) who opens Morgan's eyes to what's really going on. He gives Morgan an antidote to mind-altering drugs so he can resist brainwashing techniques. He also warns him that if Digi Corp suspects that he does not fully believe that he is Jack Thursby, he will be "eliminated". Morgan is playing and applying for a job in a competitive Sunways business. <br /> <br /> However, when he arrives at his new workplace, he gets a polygraph test and is immediately rumbled as a spy. Fortunately, Sunways executives perceive this as an ideal opportunity to transmit fake Digi Corp data, and Morgan becomes a double agent. <br /> <br /> From then on, things get more and more complicated; Action returns and poor old Morgan ends up being unable to trust anyone. In the exciting finale, everything finally becomes clear (but only if you are following the events very carefully). <br /> <br /> Natalia's director will probably manage the procedure and certainly has the great ability to produce a classic-looking film for a relatively low budget. He manages to get great performances from his talented cast; Jeremy Northam, in particular, is fantastic? His creation, initially a bit nervous Morgana is played to perfection. <br /> <br /> Cypher is another fascinating director's film, who willingly risks and eagerly awaits his upcoming projects, High Rise and Necropolis.
