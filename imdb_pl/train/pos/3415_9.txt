This movie was amazing. It's an inspirational piece of cinema. The characters are fully developed thanks to the truth in which the director, Lucy Walker, contributes to the film. I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for this special film that shows humanity in human condition. Lucy Wlaker presents the beauty of the landscape. This movie is a real example of human vs. nature, and sometimes human versus human. Internal confusion and triumph are enormous in its theme. The subject of how Tiebtan perceives blindness as a sign of demons is interesting. This film sheds light on a specific culture that has never been shown. Lucy Walker gave Erik Weihenmayer a voice when he was not normally heard. Thank you Lucy for being true to your vision as a filmmaker.
