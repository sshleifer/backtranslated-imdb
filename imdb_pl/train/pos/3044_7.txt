For anyone who may not know what a movie with one actor looks like, this is the best example. This plot is ridiculous and really does not make sense. It's full of dingy situations, distorted lines, melodrama, comedy ... You name it! <br /> <br /> But Amitabh Bachchan can do something convincing, and this film is by no means an exception. Everyone turns in decent performance - Shashi Kapoor, Waheeda Rehman, Ranjit, Om Prakash, Smita Patil ... But Megastar outshines everyone with his presence. Without it, this film would be the first one ... Opowieść jest o separacji / błędnej tożsamości / misunderstanding / love / hatred / loyalty / good versus bad - everything, really! Amitabh's is a great performance in every respect, in a different, stupid movie! Did I mention that it is ridiculously funny?
