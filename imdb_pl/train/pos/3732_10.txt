Producer Joel Schumacher, who also directed "Phone Booth", "02 and many other great films, showed in great detail how no one can be really trained to be a killing machine without destroying one's personalities and the real fears a person has to face when I go to FIGHT !! Colin Farrell (Roland Bozz), "Intermission", "03", gave one of his best performances and actually carried this whole picture on his back. Matthew Davis (Jim Paxton), "Blue Crush", "02", gave a great supporting role, and Shea Whigham (Pvt.Wilson), "All The Real Girls" 03, showed his real acting skills in the role he plays. There were two short scenes in which soldiers could find a hot romance for a short break in a local town and they had to pay for their love and sexual desires. One Vietnam army veteran instructor told the soldiers how to really torture the enemy using electrical wires in all the wrong places on the human body of a man. Pleasant and entertaining movie to watch.
