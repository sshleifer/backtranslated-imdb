I love Pit Satan !!! David Tennant is a great actor, just like Billie Piper !!! Who else loves Will Thorp to pieces ??? It's so sweet, right? I hated the pieces the devil possessed and where he was told to "go to hell" as Rose so openly described it. Remember, he was quite funny when he said, "Rose, do us a favor, okay? Shut up!". Mr. Jefferson was so brave, right? Dying to save others. I was really sorry about Toby (Will Thorp) when he left the property for the second time because he was so scared. I was like, "Oh my God, if I was Rose, I would be so scared about him." And when she hugged him, I was like "grrrrrr, he is mine! but I thought it was really sweet. And the doctor ... well, I thought he would say, "Go tell Rose that I love her," but he did not. Well.
