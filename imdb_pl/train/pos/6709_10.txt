What I love about this program is that it follows the life of modern witches and is a great experience of their everyday love, humor and adventure. The magical literature is so diverse, presenting the ideas of classical, medieval and contemporary magic, such as Harry Potter and Sabrina. With Sabrina, a teenage witch, this show is so funny and unique because it allows us to experience many modern wizards, worth seven seasons! This performance has so many great qualities and the joy that makes Sabrina live her everyday life in a deadly and "different" kingdom. I recommend it to every family because the TV series is clean, funny and adventurous. Classic!
