I love this movie since its debut in 1981! I lost track of how many times I saw him! I am never disappointed with laughing or cheering if I feel bad. The three tracks are fantastic, the script is priceless, and besides, how not to listen to the theme song nostalgically? I think I quote this film without realizing it. Basically, I know the whole script, so when you watch it for the first time, I have to refrain from saying something about how fun it is in the next line. I can not even narrow it down, although the character of Sir John probably has the most unforgettable. The famous "Alert Media", when Arthur announces his intention to bathe, is still priceless, but the list is really infinite. The scene at the home of Father Arthur, who will soon be a fianc√©, is a cry, especially his interaction with the elk. Do yourself a favor and see this movie!
