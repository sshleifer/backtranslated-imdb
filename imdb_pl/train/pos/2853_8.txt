In the end, I saw this movie today after borrowing it in Blockbuster (VHS). I must agree that it is very original. Yes, maybe the characters have not been fully realized, but this is not one of those movies. Rather, we are treated by the director's eye, his vision of what this story is about. And it does not end. And to be honest, I did not want that. I believe that Sabu had to influence the director of "Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels" and "Run, Lola, Run". But I absolutely loved the way the three of them lead. SEE a beautiful woman on the street to temporarily disperse them. I really have to see the director's other work, because this movie really intrigued me. If you want insight, culture, solidity and pleasure, go somewhere else. If you want to laugh, move the camera and murderous gaiety, look here.
