A few years ago, when I first saw 'Gray Gardens', I remember laughing and a funny camp. Years later I am still laughing when I watch him, but after many watching, I saw beauty in a strange, twisted relationship between the inseparable "Big" Edith Bouvier Beale and her daughter "Little" Edith Bouvier Beale. br /> <br /> A mother and daughter living together in a crumbling East Hampton residence with 28 rooms add a whole new meaning to the term "Shabby Chic". With countless cats, raccoons and abbots as roommates, Auntie and niece Jackie O. allowed the filmmakers Albert and David Maysles to enter their residence to film their daily lives. The result is a fun, beautiful, sad and moving relationship about true love and the ruling of anarchy. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Big and Little Edie is a testament to the inseparable bonds of love. And their life is an example of pursuit, determination and free will. This movie has more to command than I can express in words. It's a rare experience that you have to see for yourself. <br /> <br />
