Clutter of genres, but inspired mainly by Stephan Chow's mash-ups. There is a magical kung-fu, college romance, sport, gangster action and some tearful top-down melodrama. The production is excellent and the stimulation is fast, so it is easy to avoid many of the disadvantages of this film. <br /> <br /> The child is abandoned next to the basketball court. The homeless man brings him to the Shaolin monastery, which is located in the middle of the city, along with a special kung fu textbook, which somehow the homeless man can not read. The old monk teaches the boy, but expires when he tries to master a special technique in the textbook. The school is taken over by a false master of kung fu, assisted by four crazy monks. The new champion is mad at a 20-year-old boy who does not pretend to be hurt by the master's weak blows and throws him out for the night. The boy is thrown into the basket from an incredible distance by a man who brings him to a gangster club to play darts. This leads to a great fight, the expulsion of the boy from the monastery and the decision of the man to transform the boy into a basketball sensation in college. <br /> <br /> This happens in the first 20 minutes, and most happen the first 10 minutes. In addition to the extremely short story, the first problem is how little we know the main character until the entry into the movie. The man who uses the boy is more clearly defined before the first third ends. The plot does not follow the new route, except for the crazy climax of the film. I'm sure you can easily imagine how crazy monks will appear at the end. Effects, photography and stunt work are top-notch and they make up for the inspired story. <br /> <br /> Stephen Chow has much better fiction and comedy skills, and this movie will live in his shadow, but that's not a good reason to ignore him. It's quite fun, even with a dispersed ending. Recommended.
