From time to time there is a movie that no one has ever heard of, and was filmed in a very short time with very little money and resources, but everyone is crazy and turns out to be surprisingly great. It also happened in the 1950s with a few small films that few people heard about. There are really some amazing, surprising little jewels from the 50's that are worth digging out. "Panic in the Streets" is another such film that comes to mind. Both are films that are not like the genre cinema of their time and are also created with limited resources. <br /> <br /> I was really surprised how much I liked this movie. It was really a movie that was getting better as it progressed. Like all "old" movies, it tends to slow, but once you get into the story and its characters are really cool in this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie has a really great story, it's about spying, although the movie does not start like that. It starts as a typical crime thriller with a bit of noir movie. But "Pickup on South Street" is simply not a movie by numbers, so it soon begins to take its own direction. This guarantees that the film remains surprising, but above all very refreshing to watch. <br /> <br /> I really liked characters from this movie too. None of them is a really good guy, and they all have their own weaknesses and weaknesses. Really humane. Particularly distinguished by the great performance of Thelma Ritter, who even received a well-deserved Oscar nomination. It really has to be one of the greatest female roles I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Even despite the relatively obvious low budget, it's just one big, original, special small movie that deserves more! <br /> <br /> 10/10
