Many reviews explain in detail the story and characters of "Opening", so I will not do it. I just want to add my comment that I believe the film is a wonderful affirmation of life. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, Myrtle Gordon remembers how easy it was when she was 17 when she had youth and energy and felt that she knew the truth. Experience has made her emotionally fragile, wondering what her life is for, and even whether she can still live. A tragic accident triggers a personal crisis that almost overwhelms it. <br /> <br /> Almost - but not entirely. At the eleventh hour he rediscovers the power of his art and confirms himself ("I'm going to bury this son of a bitch," he says of another actor Maurice when he goes on stage). It seems almost sadistic when the director of Myrtle prevents people from helping her when hopeless drunks come for her first performance. He knows, however, that he must have the courage to do it alone if he has to do it at all. <br /> <br /> Some critics wonder if this triumph is just a temporary break on the Myrtle path. I believe that it is really her "opening night" - it opens like a flower for new possibilities of life and activities, sees the way forward. It is amazingly moving. <br /> <br /> Gena Rowlands is great. The movie is great. Thank you, Mr. Cassavetes, wherever you are.
