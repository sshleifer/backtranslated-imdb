Watching this movie from the beginning to the end without a burst of laughter requires almost faith at some point, because you have to constantly say "it's old", "it's classic", "be nice", not because the movie is so bad, but because the best case is so good. This is one obsolete movie. It's also classic if it has been damaged. In fact, I'm not inclined to laugh at people, and when others do, I'm a bit annoyed. Making fun of The Informer in my way is a bit of a giggle for an idiot-scholar who dribbles orange juice on the tablecloth. Yes, he is talking to himself, he is an idiot, and yet when he is at the top of his game, he is also a real scholar. The same applies to The Informer, who is really very scary, and yet can boast of great photography, great actor, great score and a good, decent, straight story. In the end, what I will not reveal, politics, religion and psychology meet in the church, in such a way that the scene appears kitsch, and yet it is the same with life. Uneducated people of simple faith behave differently than us (supposedly genius) modern people, and the scene is not so unbelievable (I buy it, but I know the Irish) as embarrassing. However, people behave in this way, they say things like that. Not everyone is fashionable and may not even be desirable so that everyone is fashionable. Are people today much better than those from seventy or eighty years ago? How? I do not think so. We are just different. Now go watch the movie.
