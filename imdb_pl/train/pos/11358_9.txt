Poor quality of DVD video is the only reason I gave this movie 9 instead of 10. It could have been a lot better, this movie deserves it. <br /> <br /> This is really a movie that covers several topics at once. If you do not like serial killer movies, but you are fascinated by the amazing bureaucratic culture of the former Sovjet Union, this film is absolutely necessary. <br /> <br /> I can not compare it to "Silence of the Lambs" for several reasons. The way the serial killer is portrayed has been done much better in Citizen X. You see a few details of his private life because you are "traveling" with the killer, which gives you some idea of ​​the source of his constant anger sexual frustration. <br /> <br /> The only movie I've seen is as realistic as this "Henry - Portrait of a serial killer." If you've been fascinated with this movie, be sure to check out Citizen X.
