I went to this movie, thinking it would be a shitty movie. I left, surprised and very amused. Eva was good, but Lake Bell stole the show. She had an amazing comedy time. The jokes in this movie were surprisingly original and really fun with one or two flat jokes. The plot was enough to connect her, a woman (Eva) dies on her wedding day and returns to persecute a woman who leaves her future husband. well. <br /> <br /> 7/10 - In general, it is a valuable cinema watch if it does not appear on DVD when it appears.
