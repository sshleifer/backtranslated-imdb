Last season Roseanne was a crazy rollercoaster ride. This last episode does exactly what the previous comment says, telling us that if we could think that we knew characters we did not do. Roseanne goes back to the first season and tells us that this performance was her interpretation of her life. She says in the last episode that she has changed the events and people she deems appropriate. Scott was not really with Leon, but he existed. Mark and David married the opposite wives in real life, and Dan died when she saved him. When events occurred in her life, she changed them in her letter. We do not all want us to do it. Do not we all have a moment where we would just like to use an elastic band and change what we like. That's what she did with the whole episode. And to another comment I would say that I do not feel cheated, the family was real in my mind, it just changed the way events took place in their lives. End of A + show A + !!!!
