A wooden horse is a very clever film about a very clever and successful escape plan developed by British prisoners of war during World War II. It is wonderfully preserved with a sharp sense of humor, especially in the lines expressed by the acidic languages ​​of Leo Genn. Anthony Steele and David Tomlinson (later George Banks in Mary Poppins) are great as two heroes. The direction is tight and moves quickly. Highly recommended.
