This effort is based on the true story of Jim Morris, the science teacher / baseball coach, who is inspired by his players to try out the pros and fulfill his dream of playing at major universities. Dennis Quaid, who is no stranger to sports movies, plays Morris with enough conviction that this part will work and the producers do a credible job of recreating real-world events that led to the short period of Morris as a jug of relief for the unfortunate Tampa Bay Rays . The first half of the movie, dealing with a bunch of baseball players from high school (all of which look too old to be in high school), is less effective and probably a bit too long. In general, the film suffers from some stimulation problems and some additional threads that we could probably do without it. However, it is still quite a captivating movie with an inspiring theme that once again proves that baseball is a national entertainment for some reason. GRADE: B-
