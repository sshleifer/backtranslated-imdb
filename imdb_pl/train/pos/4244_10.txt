This movie has slipped through the breaks of film history. It is definitely much better than other New York movies from the same era, such as "The French Connection" or "The Taking of Pelham 1-2-3". In this film there is a realistic reality in which you successfully use humor to further develop the story. It engages from the beginning to the end and does not waste on age, as is the case with the two above examples. <br /> <br /> Ron Liebman performs in a bravura performance as "Batman" and it's a pity that his career was not taken off as a result of this project. <br /> <br /> Gordon Parks directs and, as he does after "Shaft", it initially seems like a strange choice. However, this is the other side of this earlier effort and approaches him with the same strength on his face. <br /> <br /> Sorry, this video has not been shared either on DVD or VHS in the United States. United Artists really has a jewel on their hands and it's a pity they do not do anything about it.
