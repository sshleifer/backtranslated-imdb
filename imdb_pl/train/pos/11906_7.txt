This documentary about the schlockmeister William Castle performs several cheap shots in the naive environment of the 1950s and 1960s, in which he did his most characteristic work - look at funny, stupid people with spiritual glasses - but he is also tender and lively, with a particularly clear commentary from John Waters, who was an absolute target group of such things at the time, and from Castle's daughter who adored her father, and is also quite perceptive in how he did his craft. (We'll never know what happened to other offspring of the Castle.) The films were not very good, he explains, but their marketing was brilliant, and he seems to be a sweet, hardworking family man. People like Diane Baker "Straight Jacket", who looks great, and Anne Helm, which she replaced at the urging of the stars Joan Crawford, are playing. Darryl Hickman bursts out in joy at the work from Castle over "The Tingler" and there is enough material to give us an idea of ​​Castle's talent level - not very high but very energetically. A pleasant look at the time when the audience was easier, and that makes you nostalgic for simpler movie days.
