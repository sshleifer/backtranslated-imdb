What's the best way to start a movie review like Der Todesking? Let me start by saying that I just came directly from watching this movie, and the images are still burned deep in my brain - and I do not think that they will move in the near future. <br /> <br /> You can probably say that if you're on this site, you have a good idea of ​​what kind of movie it is, even if you have not seen it. If not, let me warn you that this is not a moderate jewel that has been lost for a few years as "Near darkness", nor is it a low-budget, schlocky, "funny" movie B. What is low-budget art, presented in a simple but a moving way. The idea is simple - seven stories circulating around and ending with suicides intertwined with material from a decaying corpse. Sounds simple or even boring? This is not. Words can not really describe how powerful the movie is when you're halfway there; it virtually draws you in whether you want to go or not. <br /> <br /> I can wander here about the technical advantages and disadvantages of the direction; may indicate that the scenes are of course shot on super-8 cameras and are sometimes unstable. I could point out that some sound effects are not synchronized in such a way as to compete with any Fulci movie, but at the end of the day all this seems to be wrong. <br /> <br /> As far as the extreme movies show, I have seen the most difficult of them, and yet Der Todesking has moved me in a way that few succeeded, even though he was not particularly bloody and had few scenes that I would consider "free". In fact, the most disturbing scene I found was the last story. I will not ruin it, just saying that the emotional agony of the character almost drips from the screen and makes you feel sorry if you do not miss the end. <br /> <br /> Sure, this is not the best movie ever made, and in many places it seems crude and maybe a bit amateur, but despite the drawbacks Der Todesking is an experience that I recommend to anyone who likes ambitious cinema. If you're someone who likes comfortable watching or "nice" movies, or just wants something brutal and pointless, it's not what you're looking for. <br /> <br /> Regardless of whether you like it or not, it's the one you will not forget in a hurry.
