I have read countless posts that this game is so similar to Max Payne, when I played it for the first time, I thought it was a bit of a strange arcade game with the desire to deceive the Max Payne style (not just the time ball). When I played for a few hours, I realized how much fun I had! and how it differs from "Max Payne", so the time of the projectile is a bit similar, but I think it fits differently with the style of the game. This game is a non-stop action - a mix of shooting and fighting, as great fun as a big Payne fan I have to say that the DTR story is not close to the size of Max Payne, the graphics are a bit average, and some levels look the same, but if you want a little more of this "bullet time", you definitely should have this game.
