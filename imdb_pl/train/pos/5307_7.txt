"Pecker" is a young, unknown photographer from Baltimore who becomes a big star among the public, the media and the local art scene, and his photographs show the dirty reality of everyday life, just like dirty underwear or human droppings. This is a typical theme of John Waters' independent comedy Baltimore to show the strange side of the American lifestyle between the fashion of political correctness and conservative backlashes, exploring the backgrounds of the middle class society of his hometown. <br /> <br /> Edward Furlong from the famous "Terminator 2" plays Pecker, supported by Christina Ricchi, photographer Cindy Sherman, legendary longtime actress Patricia Hearst and Water Mink Stole. Although the pace of the plot sometimes becomes a big disadvantage and can not compete with the fast and furious jokes of the wonderful "Serial Mom" ​​Water, there is still some laughter and unforgettable scenes, such as a former junkie, who became a vegetarian, sniffing peas from a vegetable dish ... "Pecker" is a great comedy about artistic arrogance, mesmerizing media, sexual middle class anger and strange ways of becoming a pop star. Recommended!
