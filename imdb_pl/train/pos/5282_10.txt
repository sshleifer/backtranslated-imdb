I do not know ... Maybe because it is an impressive tribute to the Muslim religious action (hajj), but I just felt that the film is so underestimated. I just can not believe that until now the film has been voted by only 223 people, considering that the film was produced in 2004 and has won many awards since then. About the film ... it's one of those well-preserved sweets movies. Reda, a French teenager due to sit in Baccalauréat, is asked by his pious older father to take him to Mecca. from their home in France to Saudi Arabia during a religious pilgrimage once in a lifetime. The generation gap between father and son is based on fairly simple dates ("you can know how to read and write, but you do not know anything about life," son's nameless father ", but avoids some kind of bromidic generation gap). His father never speaks French, although Reda understands Arabic, but may seem to respond in French, though they meet many people: "A terrible old woman meets on the border with Bosnia on the way to Belgrade and the talkative Mustafa (Jacky Neressian) ) who helps them on the Turkish border, restrained and shy women wearing burqa on their way to Damascus "always focus on the unmatched father and son, the film does not have too much conversation that makes it pleasant to the eyes. views in every city they go to. The director even shows you the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia, even though the movie is not stacked nkowo dług. <br /> <br /> Generally I do not like movies that do not have enough dialogues and which draw the power from the subtleties of the camera, but this one was really great. Despite some details without an answer (such as the invisible French girl Reda), the film appeals to the senses.
