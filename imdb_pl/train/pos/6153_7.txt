Obvious similarities between the lovely fantasies of Walt Disney Bedknobs and Broomsticks and C.S. Lewis Chronicles of Narnia. There are more coincidences here than comparing Bedknobs and Broomsticks than with Mary Poppins, although many of the same creative talents went to two Disney movies. <br /> <br /> Like the "Chronicles of Narnia", they engage some English children leaving London during a raid and arrival in the country. And these children are dealing with the world of magic. But unlike C.S. Lewis the Rawlins, children have magic invading their world and help defeat people who are making a fuss about it here and now. There is no turning back to the realm of fantasy, such as Pevensie's children. <br /> <br /> There is no hard Walt Disney philosophy here, unless it's not a good thing to mix with witches, even students like Angela Lansbury, who is learning the magic of charlatan like David Tomlinson. Mrs. Lansbury has not become one of the most attractive performers for nothing. He carries his own brand of magic, which even the special effects boys on Disney could not get. And they won the Oscar for Magic Kingdom in this section for this movie. <br /> <br /> Two performers said goodbye to the films at Bedknobs and Broomsticks. Tessie O'Shea played her last role in this film, she honored many films in the UK with one of the most-loved performers in concert halls. And this great actor character Reginald Owen as a retired general who leads the Old Home Guard in the war and in the songs, he is bidding the film audiences around the world. <br /> <br /> The team of Robert B. Sherman and Richard M. Sherman, who wrote the music to Mary Poppins, wrote here a good and useful one. The Age of Not Believing was nominated for an Oscar, but lost to Theme from Shaft. Personally, I like David Tomlinson's tribute to the most colorful of London's streets, Portabello Road. <br /> <br /> Bedknobs and Broomsticks are a great fantasy film that still keeps going well after almost 40 years. Imagine what it would be like with computer-generated graphics.
