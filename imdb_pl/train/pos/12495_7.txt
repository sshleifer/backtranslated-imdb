What's Good About It: Some ingenious and really scary little effects that will get under the skin of even the most experienced horror fan. It is not based on well-worn soundtracks to its "ready" moments. Even if you've seen everything, there are a few things in this movie that will make your jaw drop. <br /> <br /> What could have been better: acting was sometimes flat and unconvincing. In some places he had the quality of "shot-on-video" (but he achieved mainly the atmosphere he was aiming for), and the camera's work is full of unnecessary close-ups of senseless actions. Although the effects are really scary, I think that some of them could go to the well several times. The ending seemed hasty and obscured something that could have been more influential. The viewer has to come up with a lot of things for himself, not as a challenge for filmmakers, but because they just did not notice. <br /> <br /> Still, a good little horror movie that can easily be done above average. It is worth to rent.
