In my opinion, The Dinner Party can be the largest cinema production of all time. It is produced in such a great way, and the actors perfectly represent their roles. The kitchen scene with Yvonne and Julia Ashton is great. Using butter and milk really makes the scene. In addition, the scene of the doctor's office is well made. The bonfire scene is full of pleasant actions, though the choice of actors on this stage is dubious. The performance of Asia Carrera on the scene of scrap yards is amazing, but who would expect something smaller from her. The final scene is somewhat used in adult movies, but it is still classical. I highly recommend this film to all fans of movies for adults and these ordinary viewers. Run to the video store and receive it today.
