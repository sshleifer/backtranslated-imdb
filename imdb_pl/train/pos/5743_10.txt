I loved this movie! It was all I could do to keep from tearing while watching, but it is really uplifting. I was struck by the performance of Ray Liotta, but first of all by the talent of Tom Hulce, who impersonates Ray's twin, who is mentally slow due to the tragic and terrible childhood event. But the character of Tom, though painful, has no mercy for himself and is full of hope and life. It's a great movie, do not miss it !!
