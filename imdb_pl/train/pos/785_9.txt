I'm Irish, I loved this movie. The guy was not only hot and funny, but also honest and honest. I loved the girl he also fell in love with, she was pretty. They were such a sweet couple. The ending was so sad. I love this movie! Although it is a little dirty, it resembles a British or Irish version of Prime. If you liked this movie, you should watch prime. The same story tells how a young guy bumps into older women, older women run into a young man. Many paths are crossed, eventually the best decision is made or the task is completed. I have nothing else to say, without ruining the whole movie, although I thought that a French guy is ugly, less appealing to me. Umm ... if you like Irish movies, I recommend "Circle of Friends", this movie is so good. A quick quote, maybe you will not get it if you do not look at it "well, that my dinner broke down." lol
