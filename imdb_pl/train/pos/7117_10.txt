This movie is a fantastic movie. Everything in my opinion was at the highest level from acting to directing. I know Mr. Garfield was blacklisted in the 1950s, but most of his other films are on video, not on DVD. In that case, why not this? A friend recorded it for TCM for me, but owning it on DVD would be great. In the case of special functions, they could say that the marine historian talks about the battle, and if the wife or son of Mr. Schmid is still alive, you can also interview them. In any case, it is a great movie and I highly recommend it. If it is ever released, I hope it will not be colored. Coloring, in my opinion, would ruin the whole effect of the film. The battle scene was quite realistic for 1945, the film would go. Mr. Garfield did a great job presenting Mr. Schmid. Some actors may have been tempted to overcome some of Mr. Schmid's disability, but I feel that he was right. I sincerely hope that one day they will come out with this movie on DVD as a tribute to the courage of Al Schmid and all other Marines who have sacrificed so much for us in the Second World War.
