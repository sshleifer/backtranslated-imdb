Joan Fontaine plays the role of a villain in a film from the Victorian era. She convinces a married woman who has a lover on her side and also sets herself up for a wealthy man, Miles Rushworth, whom Herbert Marshall plays. Mr. Marshall is pretty good as Miles. Miss Fontaine played her part to perfection - at the same time she was cunning, calculating, innocent, terrified and charming. She needs an actress with an unusual talent to distract her. Joan Fontaine looked great in the elegant costumes of Travis Banton. In the film is also Joan's mother, Lillian Fontaine as Lady Flora. I highly recommend this movie.
