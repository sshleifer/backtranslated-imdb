Being a person who usually does not like boxing movies, feeling that they focus only on boxing, not on the characters themselves, this movie really touched me. I loved being able to see the main character Diana (Michelle Rodriguez) going through so many things in such a short time, it was amazing for me. Michelle (Rodriguez) did such a great job playing Diana, especially since it was her first acting experience, she showed real emotions and she portrayed Diana wonderfully. All the actors had chemistry on screen and made the movie even more amazing. I highly recommend this movie even to those who usually do not watch boxing movies. 10/10
