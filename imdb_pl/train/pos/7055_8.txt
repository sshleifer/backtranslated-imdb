Although Cinderella is not the obvious choice for continuing, I love Jaqa and Gus, so I did not hesitate. The format of the mouse writing the book for Cinderella was inspired. I like writing stories and I hope that children will be encouraged by this. These three stories are cute and fun, although the songs were forgotten. Jaq and Gus were my favorite characters, but I liked watching Lucifer, Bruno, the Mouse Choir and all the rest. Pom Pom proved to be the perfect companion of Lucifer and I liked the Governess. Continuation done alternately. My rating 8/10.
