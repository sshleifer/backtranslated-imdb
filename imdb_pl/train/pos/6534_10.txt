I heard that this movie was good from many of my friends who saw it, and everyone said it was amazing, so I had very high expectations - and Nancy Drew exceeded those high expectations! He had fun parts, let me play with the action and all the guys trying to kill her, and Emma Roberts was amazing like Nancy Drew. The rest of the cast was also very good. I definitely recommend this movie !! <br /> <br /> Nancy: "I wonder why these guys tried to kill us ?!" Corky: "Yes, I was also thinking about it. Actually, it terrifies me! "<br /> <br /> Nancy:" I hate it when people try to kill me. It's so naughty! "<br /> <br /> ~ Nancy Drew
