At first, Cat's soup seems to be a very random animated movie. The best way to explain this is because it is quite sour. Although it is not completely accidental. The story is about Nyatta, a young male and his sister Nyaako. Nyaako is very sick and dies, but Nyatta sees that her soul is taken away by death and is able to regain her half. The story tells of their desire to restore Nyaako to life. <br /> <br /> Although many of the content in this movie seems completely random, it is not. Most of them are symbols of life, death and rebirth. You can also see references from other stories, such as Ja≈õ and Gretal. This strangely sweet short movie has an interesting story, filled with a deeper meaning than what you see on the surface of the screen.
