An unusual, disturbing movie about real life, senseless, brutal murder of a small town family, along with the consequences, and exploring the lives of assassins, Dick Hickok and Perry Smith. <br /> <br /> No matter how long it takes or how obsolete the movie may look, it still resonates with the incomprehension of criminal acts such as this one. <br /> <br /> It really follows many tragedies: the tragedy, brutality and senselessness of the murder of the Clutter family, a decent farming family in the small town of Holcomb, Kansas; and the wasted, brutal and sad life of Hickok and Smith. <br /> <br /> There is an interesting point in the film: that none of these two immature, frightened, petty criminals would ever think of going through something similar. But together they created a dangerous, murderous collective personality; one that met the needs and pathology of each of them. They push each other by "proving" something. That they were male enough to do this to do it; none of them wants to be perceived as too cowardly to complete their great "result"; the unfortunate and dangerous remains of the desert life that they led. They were two adult children who live in the criminal world without giving up courage; who must constantly prove masculinity and hardness. in this case, these needs led to the Clutter murder. <br /> <br /> The film contains a slightly sentimental look at the Clutter family, but the point is. They were respected, law-abiding, small-town people who did not deserve this terrifying fate. The film also gives us a sense of young life for Hickok and Smith. Perry Smith, whose early life was full of security and love, but watched with horror how alcohol took his family tragic path. Hickok, poor and very much left to his own devices, unable to see how he fits in, using his intelligence and charm to convince everyone with whom he had contact. <br /> <br /> Interesting, maybe first, look at the death penalty and what goals we hope to achieve. Is it nothing but the revenge of murder for the murder that shook the nation at a time when we did not have to face the predators among us, or putting these guys at the end of the rope really provides a childish and violent detective posing such people? Can you discourage men who are cheating by acting under the radar, believing that they cheat everyone they have contact with? To stop yourself, you must believe that it is possible that you will be caught. Can you scare off those men who believe they are too clever to be caught? who committed hundreds of minor crimes and fled with them? It was supposed to be "cinch", "without witnesses". <br /> <br /> When Hickok was caught, he can not charm him and convince the agents to the way in which he had store clerks. Smith, who believes he still deserves a fate that seemed to be the only one who really understood the seriousness of what they did, readily tells the story when he finds out that Hickok has cowardly collapsed. Hickok blinked first. Stupid chicken game between two immature, emotionally damaged, dangerous people. <br /> <br /> Fascinating psychological thriller, telling the story of a terrible crime in the history of this nation. Stunning portraits of Robert Blake and Scott Wilson. These roles have contributed to their careers.
