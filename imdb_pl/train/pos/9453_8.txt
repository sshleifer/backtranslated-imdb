Deliverance is a fascinating, sometimes haunting and sometimes disturbing tale by James Dickey, transformed into a brilliant film by John Boorman. It's about four businessmen, guided by masculinity and macho behavior, who spend a canoeing weekend high in the mountains. There they are faced with every darkest side of man and every worst form of human misery ... poverty, inconvenience, and even physical harassment! These four men intended to set off down the river for adventure and excitement, but their journey would soon turn into a odyssey by a brutal and lurking mountain, completely separated from all forms of civilization. All these elements make Deliverance one of the most nightmarish movies I've ever seen. Almost everything that happens to these people, you pray that you will never find yourself in a similar situation. Clean speaking cinema, Deliverance is also a very important film. The best film by John Boorman (right behind him Zardoz and Excalibur) was - and still is - a very influential film and contains several unforgettable scenes that have already been presented in countless other movies. Just think about the incredible musical score "Dueling banjos" and, of course, the unforgettable scene of homosexual rape "squealing like a pig". All actors provide (haha) excellent performances. Especially Jon Voight. You must see the movie !!
