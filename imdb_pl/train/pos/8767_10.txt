I saw this movie fortunately, just because I was going through a phase in which I had a new admiration for Bill Pullman and wanted to see all of his latest films and thank God that I did! This film stuck in my memory and remains one of my favorites! The story revolves around two girls who embark on a dramatic journey across a foreign country, where they learn the true meaning of freedom. <br /> <br /> Alice and Darlene tried to spend their holidays together before going to college, but their journey ended with a much more complicated story. The fight they go through when they are arrested in Thailand and become prisoners is very moving and intense. Acting is amazing, extraordinary images, the soundtrack is fantastic, so it's definitely powerful for the film and the sent message. Actually, I can not even find the right words to describe how this movie makes me feel every time I watch it. I know that some people did not appreciate as much as I did, judging the film, but I swear this must be seen !!! I promise that it will keep you!
