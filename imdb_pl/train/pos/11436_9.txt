This is the kind of image that John Lassiter would be doing today if it were not for progress in CGI. And just to say that he would also be forgotten if technology did not make things sexy and kewl since 1983. in the Pixar film, made only with medium constraints c. 1983. Innovative animation techniques combine with a great script and excellent voicing to create a film that speaks on many levels. You should talk about the same breath with _Diritited Away_ and _Toy Story_.
