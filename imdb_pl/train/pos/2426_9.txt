"Once in a lifetime" is a very good movie. However, this is not good for everyone because of the extensive use of vulgar language and violence in some situations. The film manages to present in an anecdotal, credible way "life" in the districts of New York, where drug problems are important. This image is in turn used as the decor of the most thoughtful and full of tension drama supported by powerful dialogues (although it was difficult for me to understand some of them, because English is not my mother tongue.) The video is OK. Sometimes there is a bit of overplay, but I think it fits quite well with the general orientation Fishburne gave the film, which gives you more reflection than just being good style, especially in time / action management. Characters, although not simple, are easy to report, and the actors do a great job by impersonating them. By the way, I really liked the soundtrack (B. Marsalis). If you are not too prudish, you should enjoy watching this movie once, twice, three times. I rated the film 9/10.
