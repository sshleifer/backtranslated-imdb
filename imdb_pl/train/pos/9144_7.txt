Ok, so it may not be an award-winning film "movie of the year" (except for a brilliant soundtrack, which I think won several awards), but it is a really great movie about "The Kid" (Prince / O) and events around him, living in Minneapolis, playing his music, great fashion, and the movie itself plays a cool story, it's worth watching again and again, especially if you like Prince / O (of course).
