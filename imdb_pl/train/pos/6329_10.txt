A cult movie for every real Russian intellectual. Everything is brilliant, especially acting: it can not be praised. The film, like the book, is full of symbols: my favorite is the brightest symbol of Razrukha (the colloquial Russian word "devastation", often means the chaos of lifestyle after the civil war in 1918-2020) - wide opened a dirty door in a brick wall squeaking in the snow the wind and pitch-black hole in the door behind her. <br /> <br /> Now the movie is released on DVD with fully restored image and 5.1 sound, there are well-translated English subtitles, though some of Sharikov's indecent words have been replaced by more gentle versions in the translation. I do not know if this DVD is available abroad, but if it turns out that it is available immediately, it is really worth watching. <br /> <br /> In summary, the fact: about 50% of Russians today, mainly teenagers, can be largely identified as Sharikovs. This is a post-Soviet effect: the Soviet people seemed completely unprepared for the information attack of Western civilization, television producers and filmmakers made the entertainment industry and mass media incredibly aggressive, soulless and thoughtless, inciting the darkest instincts of every Russian. Even among Internet users, every third person uses obscene language in forums and chat rooms, because it is extremely popular in colloquial speech.
