Bell, Book and Candle was one of the great phenomena of pop culture in the mid-twentieth century, very similar to the phenomena we see today (in the 70s - more than ten years later - there were still infinite references to this film). It made Novak a big star, put a nice article in Jack Lemon's biography, shed new light on Jimmy Stewart and gave Lancaster and Gingold new ways to explore their career (they both continued to play witches and other interesting old bats) in film and television). <br /> <br /> Along with the movie from the 1940s, "Married a Witch" (which helped to make the icon Veronica Lake), Bell, Book and Candle inspired a great fascination with film and television all things that began with Bewitched and continued by Practical Magic, Worst Witch and Harry Potter. <br /> <br /> I rarely notice that the movie is also quite an interesting alternative Xmas movie. The story takes place during Christmas, and despite the fact that it deals with superficial spells, in fact it contains a lot of Christmas spirit (giving, love, family, dedication, etc.). <br /> <br /> I will always watch this movie (I have seen it several times since the first watching in the early 90's), especially if it is screened around or just after the holiday season. It has style, content, great cast and great production values. And like Adam's ribs, he casually expresses ideas that were rather radical in his time, are radical even now (in both films the female figure is innocent and powerful), and therefore always seems to be ahead of time.
