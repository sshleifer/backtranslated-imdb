I must say that I thought I saw everything. I am an amazing expert on the film. This film did not shock me in any way. I am beyond this point. But he took me to some emotional places that I did not know I could go to. I had no idea that I would ever find the idea of ​​eroticism of bestiality. Never ever. Always. Always. But you're going. He did this. I have to give credit to the director. He did it. <br /> <br /> For the first 40 minutes this movie is COMPLETELY boring. We start with very clear recordings of two horses having sex. After five minutes, I began to wonder if buying this movie was not a mistake. Then an old guy in a wheelchair talks to some older guy about two people getting married. Then some nervous guy shaves. Then we see (for a short time) a hot rod that does it with a peddler (but it is very short). At that moment, I cursed the movie loudly, trying not to fall asleep. In fact, I fell asleep about a 40-minute sign and forced myself to finish it the next evening. <br /> <br /> In the end, we get good things when a girl (who knows who she is or who is someone in this movie) has a dream about the Victorian era, which was devastated by the beast in the forest. The scene has been going on for a long time and is really meat (heh-heh) of the whole transaction. It is beautifully filmed, great edited and supplies goods. They try to finish the story at the end and it makes sense, but it also does not make sense. Well. I definitely recommend this movie. The first 40 minutes made me want to film (and my TV), but in the last 50 minutes I completely used it.
