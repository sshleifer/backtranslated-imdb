Norman, is it you? it was (this is all the third hand, so take it with a grain of salt) adapted to the family of African-Americans from Jewish, when she made the transition from the stage to the screen. It was also one of those films originally made on video, so the prints from the theater could not be so great. Even so, Redd Foxx and others were pretty good. <br /> <br /> I wanted to tell you that the film is PERIODIC PERIOD: it reflected the attitude in the mid-1970s when he learned that you have a homosexual son or daughter in your family. Only for this reason is it quite interesting - if not a little "Hollywood." Do not believe me? Check lines for curtains etc. Very stereotypical. Not too deep. <br /> <br /> But ... the film really shines in several areas. There is a scene taking place when Redd Foxx tries to find his wife who runs away with her brother (!) On Ensenada in the baked Pinto. A phone call across the border is truly unforgettable. <br /> <br /> But ... the best scene in the movie is that Wayland Flowers and Madame did his gay routine, which he did in bars and nightclubs. To the best of my knowledge, this is the only case where the routine was filmed. And, as I was told, this is a slightly cleaned and much shorter version. Nevertheless, it is a historic Madame and should not be missed. People are still stealing lines from Wayland; the man was really talented. Enjoy the movie!
