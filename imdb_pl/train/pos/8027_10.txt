When I saw it for the first time, I was really impressed. The director made such a mysterious atmosphere, especially towards the end. Throughout history, viewers can expect Richard to really kill Thomas, or he'll do it first. But ... the main goal was not conflict, but ... LEADERSHIP! life. It's amazing. Every time I watch it, I'm happy! Of course, this is quite violent, like any action movie, but I think it is acceptable. Many thanks to Louis Liosa and Tom Berenger! Incredible movie! I advise everyone to see him. I'm sure people will not regret it and they will really have fun.
