My rating refers to the first 4 seasons of Stargate SG-1, which are wonderfully fresh, creative and engaging. When the cast went through the gate, you never knew what was on the other side! Starting from season 5, the series took on a different meaning - still good, but different. <br /> <br /> The series is about the adventures of a team of people (and one stranger) who regularly venture into a planetary transport device called "Stargate". The story of the series is based on the characters and events from the movie "Star Gate", in which the device was discovered during archaeological excavations in Egypt. <br /> <br /> The episodes are light (innocent and easy to watch) and very creative. Many innovative stories could easily be turned into great science-fiction movies. What happened next was always unpredictable. <br /> <br /> Characters on which performances rest are also well defined and well made. Their tone is serious, but the dialogue is filled with amazing wit and humor. They are simply fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Starting from season 5 the series began to evolve into a continuous story based on the fight against a single enemy (Goa'uld, and then Ori). Plots become more complex (more politically / strategically oriented) and interdependent. The heroes were as great as never before, but the show had a different character. <br /> <br /> Please mention the episodes that have commemorated the 100th and 200th episodes. They simply can not miss the shows. They show a creative and extremely humorous genius who conducted the series for 10 seasons. <br /> <br /> If you're a sci-fi fan, watch some episodes of the first 4 seasons and you will most likely be addicted. If you like to evolve a story between two opposite sides, you have 10 season shows you can expect.
