Surprisingly good. Acting was fun, the script was fun, the music was cheesy fun, the plot was amazingly fun. It was a nice movie to watch and rest. I consider the plot and quotes to be very creative. 7 out of 10. Actually, what it was would deserve 10 out of 10. You should not compare it with an arthouse movie or a bloody movie.
