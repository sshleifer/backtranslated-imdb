Yes, horror thriller for tap dance ........ with Shelley and Debbie! Deliciousness. It's crazy and fun and part of the 60's guignol cycle that leaked into the '70s. Released as a double feature film with the comedy of Burt Reynolds FUZZ, this crazy fear is so terrible that it is extremely entertaining. Just like the mix of DAY LINE, DIFFERENT and BABY JANE, I suggest that every future viewer comes up with the idea that it looks as if it is skewed and sitting with someone with whom you can shout and elbow. Actually get drunk, watching him ..... cheap champagne. Again, with many 30-year-old film ideas, they are also about illusions; the struggle of time for a better life more and more bitter and twisted by emotional madness falling into murder. But this one is just crazy. It also reminds me of many BLOODY MAMA the De Niro - Winters, which make this movie look great.
