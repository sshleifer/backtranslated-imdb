Christopher Lloyd is funny and really credible as "Al the head head". This movie is much better than the first one, but it has great special effects, which first did not have, as well as a much better story and writing. <br /> <br /> OK - written for children, but adults have as much fun as children. Tony Danza does a very realistic job in his role - but it is NOT a Taxi meeting. <br /> <br /> Danny Glover is really good and even seems to be very human in his emotions, and also shows a real talent for acting, a nice change. <br /> <br /> Watch at least once - it's worth grabbing.
