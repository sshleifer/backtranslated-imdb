With various Bogdanoviches and Gazzaras scattered all over the cast and crew, "Everyone Laughed" is a family matter. If you add the fact that B. Gazzara and Miss A. Hepburn had a short but passionate love affair in an earlier photo, it has the air of a nearly private movie created for the pleasure of the participants and the entertainment of the general public only as an auxiliary. If all this will bring satisfaction with your satisfaction, you will be happy to hear that Mr. Bogdanovich is sailing this particular danger well and delivers a sweet and rather innocent "I love NY" paean, which is also an altar where we can worship the ethereal beauty of the late Miss Hepburn. Do not be wrong, this is her picture. Mr. Gazzara admits that this is the most modest picture in all scenes. The story - the detective agency engages too personally in the affairs of its clients - is of minimal importance, the performance of two leads dominates in the film. Mr. Bogdanovich's triumph consists in the fact that his camera loves his actors, starting with "Targets". In each of his films is a glow that only special artists can persuade with inanimate optical equipment. from this love. Additional information about his work can be obtained from reading published collections of his essays on stars and directors, mainly "Who the hell is this?", Recently remaining in British bookstores. The soundtrack for the movie "They all laughed" ranges from a concert in New York Town Hall by Louis Armstrong from 1947 to Sinatra to Country in Latin, as eclectic as the city it portrays. The picture of Mr. B's "golden boy" would surely ruin, because this is the nature of the film industry, but it is equally certain that one day it will be restored, and when that day will come "everyone laughs" will be recognized as a good job.
