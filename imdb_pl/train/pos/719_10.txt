Although this movie is cheesy at its best, it is perfectly downloaded. This film undoubtedly should be considered a modern classic. Basically, there are two types of movies that I like - movies with depth (movies with chicken, if necessary - I blame my wife) and thoughtless comedies in which I can sit and relax. This movie is a great example of the latter. <br /> <br /> My friend turned me to this movie soon after its release. Considering me a bit shallow, he said to me, "You must see this movie. It's just your type of movie. " I started watching before the insult. I know they mentioned The Ramones a million times, but when you see them, I said, "Hey, this is The Ramones." My friend replied, "I do not know if they were a real band." I had a moment of glory. <br /> <br /> This movie, though now a bit outdated, is a must for Ramones fans - or anyone else.
