I bought this game on eBay, hearing that it is a similar game to Elite. The game is very similar and very addictive. When I played a few times, I immediately came back on eBay and bought copies for all my children so that they could also join in the fun ... I played this game right away and the story makes me feel like if you are in a movie is brilliant. If you have a problem with the freedom of discovery due to the restrictive nature of the story in the single player game, simply configure the Freelancer server on your computer (easy to do and the software is included) and play at will. There are still a huge number of Freelancer servers on the Internet, so a multiplayer game is not a problem and it is not that dangerous because you often do not mean other players unless you want to. So download a copy of this game, learn it by playing a single player campaign, then configure your online presence and have fun. The depth of this game is stunning, with huge exploration systems and wrecks that you can find, as well as many other things to discover - hidden planets, wormholes, secret bases, the list is almost unlimited. Fantastic game, and especially that you can buy it for a few pounds on eBay. Get one with full written instructions, if you can (blue box, no red box Xplosiv), it loads better!
