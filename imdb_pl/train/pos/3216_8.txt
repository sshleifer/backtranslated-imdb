Stoicki and laconic Sergeant Todd (exquisite and credible performance of ever honest Kurt Russell) is abandoned on a remote, distant planet after he was declared obsolete by the ruthless and arrogant Colonel Mekum (proudly played on the slimy hilt of Jason Isaac), which Todd and his soldiers they replaced the new advanced race of genetically engineered engineers. Todd joins a peaceful community of self-sufficient outcasts and must defend this community when new soldiers come to field exercises. Director Paul W.S. Anderson, working on the intelligent and provocative screenplay of David Webb Peoples, presents a chilling vision of the bleak, cold and austere possible in the near future, while maintaining the agile tempo and hard, rough tone. What's more, Anderson copes well with the moving moments of humanity (Todd's fight to make contact with previously suppressed feelings, is truly moving) and subjects the moving scenes to roaring enthusiasm. Russell gives a strong and impressive almost pantomime portrait of Todd; It transmits a lot of emotions, not saying much, and instead performs most of its actions through body movements and facial expressions. Jason Scott Lee as a brutal rival Caine 607, Connie Nielson as compassionate Sandra, Sean Pertwee as kindly Mace, Jared and Taylor Thorne as dumb little boy Nathan, Gary Busey as a crappy experienced veteran Captain Church, Michael Chiklis as cheerful Johnny Pig and Brenda Wehle as reasonable mayor Hawkins. What's more, this film is a profound and meaningful statement about the spiritual cost of being a merciless soldier and the importance of intellectual power in relation to physical strength. David Tattersall's enhanced pictures, Joel McNeely's spirited orchestral score and first-class special effects further improve the overall quality of this superb hybrid science fiction / action.
