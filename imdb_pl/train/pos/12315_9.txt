I have added 21 comments to this list and there is almost no criticism. This is because this movie is a great entertainment and it has everything. <br /> <br /> It may be a little scary for younger children, but my 15-year-old son thought it was fantastic action, humor and even a beautiful result in every respect. <br /> <br /> I only buy DVDs when I know they will be watched regularly, and now that it is finally available in the UK, I will definitely add it to my collection.
