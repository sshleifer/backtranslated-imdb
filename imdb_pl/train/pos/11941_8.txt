They are not kidding journalists Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell with "His Girl Friday" or witty detective William Powell and sassy Lady Myrnie Loy of Thin Man, but Woody Allen and Scarlett Johansson are surprisingly charming as Scoop amateurs. Their screw subscription is more postmodern than after depression, Allen's letter filled with ironic self-injury and the usual old New York anxiety. Shades of old jokes are rare, like when he, as Sid, the magician Great Splendini, responds to his background: "I was born in Hebrew persuasion, but when I got old, I turned to narcissism." Johansson, just after Allen's Match Point as a bad girl, here is becoming a relatively good, sometimes ditsy journalist student caught in the secret murder for London: serial killer. The story is a transformation of his latest thriller from London, Match Point, up to the sins of a higher class and "American accident tragedy" / Place in the Sun ". In fact, Allen reworked Manhattan Murder Mystery and Purple Rose of Cairo to name a few other examples. I do not care if he works; I would like the new material to be at least equal to the originals, and unfortunately this is only a reflection of its younger size. <br /> <br /> Allen as a director and actor can not hide his love for the actress, as he could not do for Diane Keaton, and therefore takes the central comedy into the right place of Allen's canon, not great, but funny, sometimes brilliantly satirical: about a suspect high-class killer, Sid (Allen) jokes, "I'd be very surprised if he killed one person." This is Allen's vintage humor. Although there are hardly any clear literary allusions, like in most of his film, he sings Scoop with the music of Grieg, Tchaikovsky and Strauss to let us know that Woodman has not lost touch of the class.
