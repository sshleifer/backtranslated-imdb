This is a British comedy film "rip-roaring" and one that I could watch without interruption. Peter Ustinov has never performed in a bad role and this is no exception, especially with his dry joke, but a very clever plan. Karl Malden has always been my devotee since he played in "Streets of San Francisco." I believe, however, that Maggie Smith is the real star of the movie, but she seems so inept in everything she tries to do, but in fact it is so involved, especially towards the end, when she informs everyone that she has invested so much money that she discovered her laundry clothes. One thing concerns me, could anyone tell me why I can not buy it in DVD or VHS format in the UK, could anyone help me?
