Do we really do "nasty movies" again? In the form of a digital, wide screen with 8MM remake, it's a pretty good ride. Unfortunately, there is a bit too much history, and sometimes it becomes like a traveler when our heroine searches through the dingy places of Paris, Hamburg and Amsterdam. But I am quite charismatic for "depraved" scenes, including everything from hot wax, heavy whipping and rough sex to drowning, beheading and more. The scenes are immaculate and it is a pity that Bruno and his budget can not stretch, so that all introduced characteristic creatures become more than just caricatures.
