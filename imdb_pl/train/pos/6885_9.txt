It came by surprise. . . The influence and resolution of this film influenced my automatic way of reacting to people and situations. The most expressive was the stirring of anger of emotion. Just like the way a spoiled child will react to a lack of a path. . .a tantrum if you want. Thinking that I was hiding this anger from others was the most absurd farce of all. What did it cost me? Soooo a lot of love. . so many blessings. Now I am aware of how amazing my humiliation and constant gratitude for life is. . .to what is happening right now, without my wild expectations that life is a special way, the way I think life or people "should" be. This film has contributed to the freedom I feel now, connecting with others, without limits and expectations. . and connect with real love. . without fear of loss. . First of all, to love and accept what love first gives.
