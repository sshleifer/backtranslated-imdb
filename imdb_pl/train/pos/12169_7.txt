On the night of his stag party, Paul Coleman (Jason Lee) meets a great dancer Becky (Julia Stiles) at the bar, they drink a lot together, and the next morning he wakes up with her on the bed. His future mother-in-law calls him and informs him that his fianc√© Karen (Selma Blair) can come to his apartment, and he desperately asks Becky to leave quickly. He will soon learn that he has crabs, and then, preparing for a wedding reception, he realizes that Becky is Karen's cousin. This is the beginning of a very funny comedy with funny situations. The first attraction of this film is certainly the central trio of actresses and actresses. Julia Stiles and Selma Blair, who are great actresses and incredibly wonderful, and Jason Lee, who is incredibly funny, have good performances. I was laughing a lot about this story, but there are also scenes that are really fun. For example, when Paul finds Becky in his bed; when he finds her paint; his imagination in many situations; in the pharmacy, trying to buy and get clarifications on crab medicine; most of the scenes of his neighbor, minister; when Karen calls the department store; or when the police find a suspect to attack Paul. I could count many other scenes, but it is better that the reader rent or buy this movie and have a good time. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Louco Por Elas" ("Crazy For Them")
