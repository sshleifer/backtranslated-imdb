This is one of the first independent films I've ever seen. For such a low budget, it worked well; as insomnia, I can sympathize with the main character, although my sleep problems have never been so intense or so disturbing. <br /> <br /> Well-directed, well-preserved, with a theme that I have not seen in theaters, lighting, and set up perfectly for the film setting. Few nonsenses are noticeable, but they may be intended; you will see after watching the movie. The film is very personal and it's worth watching twice. No film is impeccable, but the Hollywood version could not make the story better. a total of 8/10.
