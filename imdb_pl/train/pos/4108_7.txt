Kurosawa, fresh in colors, loses his usual motives of truth and reality perception and decides to look depressing at the slums in Tokyo. Kurosawa extends to a style that I think was his antithesis, I mean, I feel that Kurosawa wanted to take a photo of Ozu. Poorly thought out, ill-conceived film is a rare scam in this wonderful work. While Ikiru, despite being mundane and depressing, is still interesting and well-mastered, and while Stray Dog depicted slums and social poverty in Japan without too much boredom and effort, desu ka has everything that one would expect from the content, without any redeeming features of earlier Kurosawa paintings. <br /> <br /> I warn you, this is not a film that Kurosawa should judge.
