The characters in this film are divided into two categories: wise and stupid. Pretty simple. <br /> <br /> Jiri Machacek (Standa) plays an unfortunate, stupid guy who is arrested for a crime he did not commit. When he tries to get a refund from his evil former boss, the situation gets out of control. <br /> <br /> Although Standa is really (but endearingly) stupid, his buddy Ondrej is an absolutely idiotic idiot who staggers everything and every time he manages to tell and do a bad thing. Without Ondrej Stand, he can have a chance of living with some modest success. In the case of Ondreja, life will never be boring, but certainly will not be without fear of headaches! <br /> <br /> Ivan Trojan plays Zdenka, the evil genius who turns into some illusionary tyrant Hitler. Zdenek and his supporters try to kill Stama to keep Zdenek's secrets safe. <br /> <br /> I am impressed by the high quality and imagination of Czech films. For a relatively small country, the Czech Republic has certainly produced more than its participation in great entertainment. The best Czech films I've seen are: 1) Peli ?? ky and 2) Tmavomodr√Ω Svet (Dark Blue World). If you see these two films, you've seen absolutely the best Czech cinema.
