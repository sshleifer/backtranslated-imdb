Of course, I would have to give this film 10 out of 10, because my uncle was the main screenwriter "Once upon a Crime." Rodolfo Sonego wrote screenplays for over 50 years while living in Italy. He was a great storyteller of history, and someone suggested that he write his stories in writing. That's what Rodolfo Sonego did. If you read his biography, you can see the number of films produced in Italy. Alberto Sordie was the main actor who played in his stories. My uncle visited Australia and my city, in 1968, to check the locations for "Girls in Australia" and created a great movie about a replacement bride after the Second World War. You can see his humor in all his movies. Recently, I found a copy of this movie on DVD. GREAT
