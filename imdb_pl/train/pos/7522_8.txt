"The Notorious Bettie Page" is about a woman who always wanted to be an actress, but instead became one of the most famous pin-ups in American history. Bettie Page played by Gretchen Mol was one of the first sex icons in America. The modeling type in which Bettie Page took part included the nudity and enslavement that led to an investigation in the US Senate in the 1950s. <br /> <br /> Coming from the movie, I was just thinking about how far we have reached the terms of pornography from the 1950s. You can now go online and find some of the most disturbing and shocking photos ever made that the footage questioned in "The Notorious Bettie Page" seems almost childish and innocent. Most recordings, including slavery, did not contain nudity when Bettie Page was involved today, we have sick images where we see women having sex with animals. I believe that maybe the envelope has been moved a bit too far from the 1950s, because looking at this movie in terms of today's pornography was very tastefully done. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I was impressed by the "Notorious Bettie Page" I think the film is very well made and interesting. The film is exactly what the trailer leads you to believe that it will be and is a very interesting look at one of the first female icons in America. Gretchen Mol looks exactly the same as Bettie Page and gives a very good performance. I also thought that since the film was made in black and white, the film seems realistic because it made the audience believe that they are watching a movie created in the late 1950s. <br /> <br /> My only complaint was the time there seemed to be several scenes that were cut out and seemed to be a bit shorter than they should have been. I checked it and it seems that 10 minutes have been cut from the movie since its original screening at the Toronto Film Festival. Also the ending was quite tame and I was expecting a little more from him, or perhaps a few paragraphs, to tell the audience more about Bettie Page's life where the movie ended. These are my only two complaints about the film except that the direction was solid, the acting was great, especially Gretchen, and the writing was good. <br /> <br /> Mary Harron, who directed American Psycho, one of my favorite films, director and screenwriter of The Notorious Bettie Page. I feel that Mary is a very talented director who knows how to create a scenery and create great characters-based movies, because like "Psycho", Bettie Page is a great study and character. Harron easily registers the 1940s and 1950s, as well as all characters. He is a very talented director who I hope will be present for many years. <br /> <br /> The bottom line: "The Notorious Bettie Page" is definitely worth seeing. This is a very interesting story that shows how far America, like the world, came in terms of pornography. The film also provides a great performance by Gretchen Mol, which literally nails the role of Bettie Page on the head. And complete it with a talented director who was able to capture the look of the previous era and have a good movie on his hands. Unfortunately, this movie will probably be in vain, because few people, apart from people who grew up at the time, will be interested in the movie, but I think it's worth checking out. <br /> <br /> The final evaluation of MovieManMenzela for "The Notorious Bettie Page" is 8/10. This is an interesting study of a character about one of the most famous pin-ups and sex icons in American history.
