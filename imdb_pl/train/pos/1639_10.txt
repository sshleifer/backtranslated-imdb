Fantastic actors, beautiful scenery, austere reality. I will not discuss all the comments of other reviewers because you will receive a photo! However, the movie is not intended for music lovers. Reality is killing pigs and other animals to survive. I also have a book about Elinore's farm, Randall Stewart. I read this a few years ago, I have to read it again because I just watched a recently released, remastered DVD movie. <br /> <br /> I tried to buy a movie for a few years, in the end I bought it from a video store that stopped working. But Yippee! The DVD is now for sale, I bought it on amazon.com. Not cheap, but it's worth it for me. This is a movie that I will watch until the end of my days!
