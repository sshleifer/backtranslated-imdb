This is one of my favorite films about martial arts from Hong Kong. This is one of the earliest films of John Woo and one of the few traditional martial arts films he directed. You can see his influence from Chang Cheh's work in this movie. The action is good, the fight choreography is led by Fong Hak On, who appears as one of the bad guys in the film. We have Wei Pei from "Five Venoms" and many faces known to fans of Golden Harvest and Shaw Brothers. The plot is interesting, there are a few decent twists and the creation of characters and their mutual relations are cleverly made. This movie only has the VHS release in the UK. Media Asia released the DVD region 3 and there are DVD versions available from the USA. The film is great to watch in the original language or in the English dubbed version. I highly recommend this movie.
