When I heard that Adrian Pasdar is pulling in this movie, my expectations that I will watch the whole movie were low. The only reasons I gave it a chance were great Julie Walters and a friend's recommendation. <br /> <br /> What I thought was a wide farce of "Mrs. Doubtfire" turned out to be a delicate and insightful comedy. Pasdar is completely credible and empathic as an ambitious business man who has to free the female part of his being by dressing up in different situations. It transmits these needs to the public in a completely reliable way. Julie Walters is wonderful, she is her habit, as a housewife who teaches him unconditional love.
