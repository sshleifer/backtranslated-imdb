What about all European comments (especially in England) here? I just have to say that when I saw this movie for the first time when I was 13, I thought it was great. Of course it's stupid. That's it. You must see the movie Dr. Strangelove and Men in Black to get the whole joke behind this movie, but come to the people, what did you expect? I can think of many movies that are much worse than these, and were expensive Hollwood movies with real actors in them. It's worth it, Men in White is a very stupid-funny film rehearsal. And with all the stupid games that England has made for the last half century, I am shocked by all the negative comments. Us stupid Americans like our stupid humor. P.S., see "Team America: World Police" to see real laughter that Europeans will particularly like.
