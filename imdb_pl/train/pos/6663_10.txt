This film concerns the Dysfunctinal family, but not only any dysfunctional family. It is about the family of the Father of our Nation (India), although the film focuses mainly on the indifferent relationship between Mahatma Gandhi and his eldest son Harilal Gandhi. It shows how Mahatma had to kill M.K. Gandhi, how he had to sacrifice family life to achieve our freedom. Whenever Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and his son tried to approach, Mahatma would fall among them. It's a beautifully made film. Akshaye Khanna proved that he is the best actor. He expressed emotions very naturally. Darshan Jariwala, who mainly plays in the lawyer Plays-Gurukanta Desai in Guru, introduced Gandhi wonderfully (as a real human being, unlike Ben Kingsley, who made him look like God) Shefali Shah, Monsoon Wedding, also did a really good job of showing as Kasturba Gandhi was torn between his father and his son. This film moves and its soundtrack "Raghupati Raghava" is sung in a very special way. I saw this movie only 3 hours ago (released in Dubai the day before - for 2), and when the film ended, "Pin Drop Silence" appeared and when leaving the theater, not one person pushed another (Can you imagine us, Indians, do not we push?) NOT ONE! It was Holy Silence ...
