This movie is horrible - in a way "so bad that it's good". <br /> <br /> The plot is reworked from many other such films, which I will not even describe. It's a picture of a sword / spell, if a kid is hoping that he will realize how important he is in this world, he has a "nomadic" adventurer, a bad helper / wizard, a princess, a hairy creature ... br /> <br /> The first time I caught this movie during a very cold winter. I do not know why I decided to continue watching it for an additional five minutes before turning on the channel, but when I caught the Gulfax site, I decided to stay and watch it until the end. <br /> <br /> Gulfax is a white, furry creature similar to Chewbacca, but not as useful or fun to watch. It looks like someone stuck a few white rugs and forced the actor to wear it. There are scenes in which the actor seems unable to move or almost falls over. Although he's not in the movie, a few scenes are worth it! Watch as he tries to talk with Bo Svenson, transferring Solo-Chewbacca's comparison to an even higher level! <br /> <br /> I actually bought this movie only because of this character and I still have it somewhere! <br /> <br /> Gulfax may look like a sh! t, but he made this movie !!! The only reason I never saw a sequel, and I did not even look for him was his absence! Perhaps in the case of the final movie, ending the trilogy, Gulfax will come back for a long-awaited return!
