Why is it so low? I really do not understand it ... Is it because of bad behavior? Bad dialogue? Who cares about these things in poor low-budget horror films? Seriously, acting and dialogue are not important in these movies. People who hate films only because of bad behavior and bad dialogue should not be able to judge poor low-budget movies. These films should not be taken seriously. Period. <br /> <br /> In any case, it's time to talk about the movie, right? Well, I loved it! I bought it because I expected a gorefest, but it's not gorefest, and gore is pretty bad (most of the time it's just animal entrails placed on the body of the actors and it's bad), but I did not really care about the fact that the movie is funny! The characters are hilarious, the acting is hilarious (bad acting is GOOD thing in poor low-budget horror movies), dialogue is funny (bad dialogue is GOOD thing in cheesy low-budget horror movies), zombie rapist with huge dick is hilarious, flying demonic child is fun and I I could go on and on, but I do not want to talk too much ... BUT I have to mention that there is a scene where a girl masturbates like a live doll! Oh, and a zombie rapist falls in love with a doll lol! <br /> <br /> Best lines in the movie: <br /> <br /> Detectives: * smelling the cocoa * Detective Sloane: What's up * * Do you do, manners? What the hell did you snort? What the hell is this? Detektyw Manners: That's nothing, it's ... Ehh ... Cold medicine ... <br /> <br /> Detectives: * injects heroin into the shoulder * Detective Sloane: What are you doing *, Manners? Are you * beep * crazy? Detektyw Manners: It's cold medicine. <br /> <br /> Detective Manners: * repeatedly kicks random guy in the face * Detective Sloane: What the hell is going on, manners? What are you doing? Detective Manners: The madman revolved around the demons, and then he started smashing his head against the rock! He just started hitting his head with a stone! I think it is on PCP or something! <br /> <br /> LOL!
