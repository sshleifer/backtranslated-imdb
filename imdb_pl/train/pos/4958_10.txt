Full disclosure: I am a cynic. I like my sad endings and my tissues dry up. I did not cry when Bambi's mother was shot dead. Will Smith's new movie "Happiness" looks like a desperate request for an Oscar. Basically, I was born without an artistic soul. <br /> <br /> So why the hell did I like "10 items or less?" Maybe that's the double espresso I dropped off before the show. Or (more likely) maybe even the most ardent cinema fans could use sweets from time to time. <br /> <br /> And it's cute. From the moment when "Him" meets "Scarlet" (an event far from "Nora Ephron" "meet beautifully"), an intimate journey is taken two strangers learning how to care for where their lives are going. (Phedon Papamichael's cinema works perfectly well.) The main argument about the movie is that it's too far-reaching. Is the film far-reaching? I do not know, you tell me. I have not met Adrian Brody yet on the market. (However, not because of the lack of sample). Do I like to consider adventures that can happen if this important event happens? Straight, I'm doing it. . .This is where most reviews of "10 Items or Less" do not meet expectations. . They do not take into account that even we cynics have fantasies. And damn it, sometimes it's worth paying for admission to survive, 82 minutes at a time.
