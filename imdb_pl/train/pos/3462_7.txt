It was the first TV episode of the Columbo series (although it was filmed after "Death Lends and Hand") and it was one of the most successful TV series in history. <br /> <br /> Jack Cassidy (who played the killer in the series three times) impresses with self-satisfaction, arrogance and self-confidence in the same way as Ken Franklin, half of the team dealing with writing secrets, who will create a complicated conspiracy to kill his partner, Jim Ferris (played by Martin Milner) who decides to end his trade union, leaving Franklin as an ordinary good publicist, not a prolific writer. <br /> <br /> The initial setup of the murder is fantastic, and Cassidy's performance facilitates the debatable recognition that he was the best Columbo murderer in the series. <br /> <br /> Peter Falk is wonderfully underestimated in his role as Columbo, and his inborn qualities and peculiarities that emphasize apparent slowness and distraction contrast very well with Cassidy. The hero's excellent complacency: one of their early scenes in which Ken Franklin devises a motive for killing Jim Ferris's non-existent exhibition of identifying assaults in the underworld, an example that is very good. Franklin suggests Columbo this potential motive, and Columbo (intentionally or unconsciously) can not cope, forcing Franklin to express disappointment in a clearly patronizing manner and comparing him unfavorably with the detective in the books, Mrs. Melville. <br /> <br /> Noteworthy is the early directorial contribution of 24-year-old Steven Spielberg. Despite some elementary inclusions of cameras tracking actors and actresses, he adds a few stylish and sophisticated touches to maintain the overall professionalism of the episode. One particularly sharp image is Jim Ferissa's dead body lying on the couch, almost dark in the foreground, when Ken Franklin raises him a glass in the background as he ends up answering the phone to desperate wife Ferris. I have no doubt that when working on a restrictive schedule of 10-14 days, Spieberg's efforts should not be underestimated. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the second murder event, caused by the blackmail system that Franklin's friend plans for (and ironically referred to as the "sloppy" Columbo in his climactic summary), brings the pair out of the whole. The breakthrough in the story is under threat, and the time between Falk and Cassidy is inexcusably diminishing at this point, perhaps to help screenwriters (Stephen Bocho) get out of a difficult bend because he can not personally develop the story without another murder. <br /> <br /> The climax is the most disappointing aspect of this episode. Initial banter and exchange of words between Falk and Cassidy is strongly and effectively performed, but only advertises the fact that this should happen more in the episode. The main complaint is the sealing pointer (if you can call it a clue): Cassidy's previous satisfaction and arrogance is surprisingly thrown out by a clue that really does not show much of his guilt; and when they mentioned it, it surrenders in a rather spectacular and unusual way. <br /> <br /> In total, a bold opening to a series that inevitably advertises and foretells everything good at Columbo, and vice versa, the problems associated with such ingenuity, ie maintaining high standards, and especially creating a credible and appropriately intelligent completion.
