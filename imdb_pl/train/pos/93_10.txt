My first child was born in the year in which this program appeared, and then I played an album for boys every Christmas. When the CD came out, I bought about ten copies and I still pass them on to friends and relatives when they start a family ... it always becomes their favorite Christmas album. I recently found several DVDs (probably on DVD-R with video tapes) for sale on eBay. The one I bought was a great copy and it was great to see him again after over 25 years. The program includes songs that were not on the album, and some of the songs on the album were studio versions of the same songs in the series. But both CD and DVD will remain in our library as the best Christmas entertainment ever.
