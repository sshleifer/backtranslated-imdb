I really liked "The revolution will not be TV." This gave me once again a positive impression about the strength of people to decide how they want to be governed. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that in Venezuela, twenty percent of rich citizens have made all decisions for eighty percent of the poor for decades, if not centuries. However, when their attempt failed; after the provisional government disbanded the Supreme Court, the Constitution, the Ombudsman and the Election Council and all civil rights, no one took the conspirators for the barn and shot them. They did not even go to prison. The main conspirators live in Florida, continuing. The protection they had was a "Bolivarian Constitution" enacted by the vast majority of the Venezuelan people. It's not just history that bites. Democracy can give you hell if you free yourself. And in Venezuela, it's loose.
