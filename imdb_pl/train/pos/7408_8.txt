I had the honor to see this film at the International Film Festival in Rotterdam. <br /> <br /> "Xizhao" or "Shower" is a movie about low prices in the amount of 200,000 dollars about his father and his 2 sons. My father has a traditional bathhouse somewhere in a traditional Chinese village, where locals, mostly aging men, come to rest and bathe. Sons father has "delayed" son who lives with him and his son, who lives in a big modern city, and who comes to visit him. For this son, the traditional village, bathhouse and his "delayed" brother seem strange and irritating, but it changes with the movie. <br /> <br /> Though the story may sound cheesy or trite, it is not. With really great performances, especially with my father and "late" son (sorry, I do not know their names) and great story, the film was both moving and funny. <br /> <br /> If you have a chance to see the movie. It's a great alternative to mainstream Hollywood cinema. <br /> <br />
