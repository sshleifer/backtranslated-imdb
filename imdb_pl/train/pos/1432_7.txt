I really could not wait to see this movie because it was advertised as a compulsory movie for people who love films about nature. The film shows various climates and animals associated with them, starting from the North Pole and going south as the film progresses. The material from this film is often breathtaking, and I have often wondered how on Earth they could take some pictures underwater or in the sky. However, a beautiful, big part of the material that I've seen in the series Planet Earth, narrated by David Attenborough. I think that the Attenborough tale about planet Earth is much better than the narrative about Earth. "Earth" is an easier movie. It overlooks many scientific details that Attenborough covers in the "Planet Earth" series. For example, Earth will say that the tropical sea is an ideal kindergarten for a young humpback whale, because there are few predators. Planet Earth tells you that the tropical sea is a good kindergarten, because the water has a low oxygen content and does not contain enough nutrients to keep very large animals, such as large sharks etc. For me it is an important difference. This, together with the decidedly better Attanborough voice, makes Planet Earth a much better document than Earth. Still, I think Earth is worth watching for beautiful footage, and the fact that it is easier to understand makes it also interesting for children.
