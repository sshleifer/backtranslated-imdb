This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. He has a very good effect of Hanks, Newman and everyone else. Definitely the best performance of Jude Law. The photos are excellent, the editing is equally good and contains a great original score that really fits the mood of the film. The production design is also a factor that makes this film unique. For me, a lot is needed to defeat the Godfather, but fantastic pictures displayed win this competition. Definitely nominated for the Best Picture in my book.
