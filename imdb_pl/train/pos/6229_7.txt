One of several musicals about seafarers on vacation, is a regular sailor meeting a girl, complications appear, orderly plot. It takes place without problems, but it also drags into places. Dialogue is not as smart as "Top Hat", and Randolph Scott seems out of place. <br /> <br /> There are compensations. He has several of Irving Berlin's best songs, including 'Let Yourself Go', 'I put all my eggs in one basket' and 'Let's Face the Music and Dance'. Fred and Ginger, who are dancing, take every movie to the heavenly heights and do not disappoint here. In the same film, they make dance dance, boring comic dance and whirling dance full of grace! Great versatility and artistry. <br /> <br /> He also has Harriet Hilliard, who is rather good at his role. She had a diverse career, becoming more familiar Harriet Nelson with Ozz. Here, it moves without sentiment. Her two songs are simply and effectively delivered. It contrasts well with Ginger, but you can believe they are sisters in the movie. <br /> <br /> A bigger tightening made the film even better. Quite well.
