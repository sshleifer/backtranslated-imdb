I think the idea of ​​the plot is ideal for examining primarily the emotional experiences of the people involved, and secondly, as someone else wrote in the commentary, the implications of this kind of relationship (incest and lesbianism) in Romanian society. <br /> <br /> so ... to start with the second aspect ... so that it was short, it was not visible at all ... <br /> <br /> as for the first .. as I said, he had much more potential ... I think that such relationships carry much more tension ... much more voltage ... and the potential voltage did not survive ... <br /> <br /> I think that the soundtrack could be something more than with a few songs on the background and motif (which was nice, but not enough and not always at the right moments) ... yes ... I could feel the lack of a better soundtrack ... <br /> <br /> actors ... I think they were somewhere from 7 to 8/10 ... little sensuality at key moments ... <br /> <br /> a total of 7/10 .... mainly for a story
