I bought the DVD version to compare it with the current version of the BBC in 2005 (which is brilliant). Year 1985 was adapted by Arthur Hopcrafta, who adapted Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy TV, and died in this year (2005). I remember the great acting, especially from Rigga Elliott, and moving music. (Music from the 2005 version. It is much more understated, but very meaningful.) To collect other commentators on several points: Richard Carstone Claire's boyfriend Adi, not Esther. Esther had no uncle. Charlie Drake never played in any version Krook, nor played Toby Esterhase in TTSS! In the 2005 version Krook game comedian Johnny Vegas. Toby played Bernard Hepton. <br /> <br /> Both versions are honorable and admirable adaptations of great novels of Dickens. Now read the book! It is not perfect, and sentimentality can make you wince occasionally, but defy you not to cry - and laugh!
