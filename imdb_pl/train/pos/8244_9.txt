I loved it! What you do not like - you have your suburbs, you have your zombies, you have family problems, you have your social dilemmas, you got one great style Retro-1950 Flesh Food in the class Held At Bay An Uneasy Worried About whether they are another crust from the upper meal. You can not ask for more. <br /> <br /> The cast is great. Carrie Ann Moss is absolute perfection as a social climbing hostess. It is both thoughtless and criminal underground. Every man's dream. K'sun is really great as a son who tries to be as normal as possible in this nightmarish existence and somehow manages to do it. It is a real presence on the screen. Very photogenic and natural. Without naming them all, the rest of the cast is great. Henry Czerny plays a suspicious policeman with sharp instincts and a bit of a shrill, as if it were his everyday personality. Billy Connolly is delightful like Fido. A great actor: I would like him to play the title role in "Braveheart" directed by Gibson. I have the impression that his William Wallace would be closer to the real character. His Fido is included, but available. A nice touch. <br /> <br /> In short, a wonderful and wonderful satirical prodding of morals, values, social perceptions, feelings, growth, coping in uncertain times and equalizing adjustments to impossible conditions. A real reality show.
