Whoever says a pokemon is stupid can die. This movie is superlative. And even a tear when Celebei died. I DO NOT PAY MUCH! This movie is a moving animated thriller. <br /> <br /> In this fourth installment of the pokemon Ash and friends must stop the evil moron from making Celebei the best evil weapon with his dark sphere. During this time Sam and Celebei travel in time and are constantly hunted by game hunters. I like the double battle part and Sam has a pokeball of apricot (if you played gold, silver or crystal, you know what it is.) <br /> <br /> I also liked having miramax instead of Warner Brothers. Placing a mini movie at the end was a great idea. Pokemon in this movie comes alive more than ever.
