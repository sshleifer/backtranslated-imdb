This movie is just fun. thoughtless but funny. to fully enjoy this movie, you can not have a clue how this movie goes and just enjoy all the jokes and puns related to the movie. I still think that this piece is funny when he says "I want a beer ........ a cock." Funny things. but what makes a movie decent is that it does not try to create a movie, too many comedies try to have serious aspects that you simply do not believe in. But this is different and just focuses on being funny. But I must admit that Yasmin bleeth is horrible in the film and adds nothing but the three main guys, coops, remers and squeaks, it's very funny to watch and make the movie great for watching
