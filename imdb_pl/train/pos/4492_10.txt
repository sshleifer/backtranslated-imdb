but I want to say that I can not agree more with Moira. <br /> <br /> What a great movie. <br /> <br /> I was thinking about this morning, wanting to give advice to some stupid turf who lost money on his debit card by fraud and wanted to say "Keep your money in your pocket" and realized that I was talking like James Mason. <br /> <br /> Even if he did not say those words, I still think so! I never forgot "Do you wear?" In reconciliation with your son, Hywel Bennet: "Always have money in your pocket!" Good advice. <br /> <br /> Few children have fathers with such merciless but good intentions. Or any father at all. <br /> <br /> It would be good if we would restore "you", "your" and "yours" in our language to show that we care. Same as "tutoyer" in French or "du" in German. <br /> <br /> Appendix: I just realized that many of my comments were about James Mason in "The Family Way!" <br /> <br /> I think it's because I mixed Susan George with Hayley Mills. Well, easy mistake. <br /> <br /> I stand by the comments tho '. <br /> <br /> A Spring and Port Wine are very similar to The Family Way. <br /> <br /> When in those days you took the girl for photos, you really had something to say and talk to later, something that affected your knowledge of the world and your personal development. <br /> <br /> Theatrical experiences are almost real, and they are important to help young people grow up. <br /> <br /> It does not happen now, I think that teenagers can just go to the photos like us.
