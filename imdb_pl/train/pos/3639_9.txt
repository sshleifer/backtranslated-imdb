This film concerns me with my family. Jimmy Morris lived his dream not only for himself, but also for his family. I can not tell you how I would be able to tell my little girl that Daddy is going to Kansas City to take Priest Holmes and the Kansas City bosses. She would think it was the coolest thing, like Morris's son. Dreams come true with family. I think that only a father who is closely related to his family can really appreciate what Jimmy Morris did.
