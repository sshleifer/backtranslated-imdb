This is the second part of "The Animatrix", a collection of animated short films that tell us a little more about the world "Matrix". <br /> <br /> In this part, we'll find out how people and machines may not work and live together. This is a small history lesson in the world of "Matrix". Not as good as the first part ("The Final Flight of the Osiris"), but still quite funny.
