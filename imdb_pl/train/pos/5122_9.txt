# 3 in the trilogy of young John Travolta about hits. He dances to disco, rock'n'roll and the country. He goes to Houston to find a job and love. Gilley's is a hot spot and it is the time of a mechanical bull. In order not to lose consciousness, I rode a bull in a club in Nashville. I recently saw this almost forgotten movie on TV and I remembered how good it was and how good it was in 1980. This year I wore a black cowboy hat, like Travolta. Debra Winger was in great shape. It looks stunning at the red top. There is a lot of charisma. Bud and Sissy seem like the perfect pair, even if they are garbage from trailers. They only split because they feel so good back to themselves. Urban Cowboy has an amazing soundtrack. We will hear Lyin 'Eyes by The Eagles and Lookin' For Love by Johnny Lee.
