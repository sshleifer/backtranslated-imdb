MacArthur is a great movie with a great story about a great man, General Douglas MacArthur. This is, of course, the story of one of the great American military figures and a figure that has become known to me from the earliest moments of my memory. Although there is a continuity problem (there may be others), eg MacArthur's Speech presented in the film as his speech in 1962. The American military academy regarding the acceptance of the Thayer Prize did not include the word "old soldiers never die; (This was in his address to Congress after the resignation of President Truman) in 1951. For alleged insubordination (the two have not seen eye contact!) Gregory Peck is im-Peck-able as a general who promised he would return to Philippines in II World War. The film moves quickly and easily with the general, his family and staff from the beginning of the Second World War to the end of his professional career. This film would be much more important for a person familiar with World War II and the Korean War. Nevertheless, Peck's presentation of this great man who fought the double evil of fascism and communism and who hated the war, as only a soldier can do it, is indeed unforgettable. "There is no substitute for victory in the war."
