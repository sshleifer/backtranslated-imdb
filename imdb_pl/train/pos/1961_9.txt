I just came back from the first Basic Instinct 2 show. I went in, thinking that it would be bad on the basis of preview critics and I was pleasantly surprised! If you liked the original basic instinct, I think you will enjoy # 2 the same, if not more. A great story that always puzzles you and thinks. The music is excellent, it restores the original motif. Do not expect the Academy material, see it to enjoy and have fun. Films are used for this - escapism. I can not think of a better way to escape than escape from Sharon Stone, which is as sexy as it once was. I wonder if we will see him again this weekend. Go see him!
