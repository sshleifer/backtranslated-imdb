Oh my God ... Give me a moment to breathe. This movie will take you on an amazing ride and will not let you go until the last blow to your face. This is a movie for Stormriders fans and the like. Legend of Zu was beautifully created, although I did not like a few things, they used a lot of stands. I wanted to see a real fighting person, but, well ... a few small professions, and I did not really like it until I looked at it again, when you understand it, it's completely kicking A **! I encourage anyone who would like to see a real Asian movie to see this movie. I give this film one of my highest ratings. Go and see it when it comes out in America !!!
