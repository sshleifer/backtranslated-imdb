Maybe it was not as good as the whole, but the second episode, which I said first, was so memorable that I remember him today. I became a fan of Dick Francis. I recommend it if you are interested in horse racing and secrets. <br /> <br /> Chino Barnes's cockney slogan is much more entertaining for those of us who have never been close to listening to the London Bow Bells, but the leaders are attractive and the concerts were interesting. <br /> <br /> Sid Halley was one of the most interesting characters of Francis, and the performance actually minimizes some of the difficulties with his hand. Interestingly, the electronic systems used in stories are apparently less functional for the user than the kind invented after the Second World War.
