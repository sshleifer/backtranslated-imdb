Most horror movies are really awful movies. They become the same ol'-the same ol. The same huge package every minute with a bit of thrill (usually "splatter") and now can pack every second with bright special effects. One of the goals of a really good horror is to suspend the audience's disbelief. For example, I saw both of Mumia's newest films and almost stunned watching funny special effects in every second. Producing these films probably costs one million dollars per second, and my sense of disbelief has never been suspended, the roots have grown. <br /> <br /> The subtlety can be more frightening. Less means more. <br /> <br /> For the first time I saw "The Woman in Black" on the A & E channel. After reviewing the usual 987 channels of very bad television, I stopped watching it. This film has almost the impression of producing the "Masterpiece Theater". For me it was okay, I always preferred British television and films anyway. <br /> <br /> Most viewers will find this too slow. But slow stimulation helps to ensure the credibility of history. Special effects are few, which makes the viewer aware that this film is embedded in the real world, which makes us a little more anxious. Make-up and costume for the spirit are simple and reliable. Hollywood would make her look like a demon from hell with glowing fangs of her eyes etc. Hollywood would exaggerate and turn this idea into mediocrity. <br /> <br /> The woman has only five performances in the film. Most of them are where it appears in the distance, and even this creates good fear. If it appeared too often, it could lower the set mood. However, this movie is so well made that for the majority of the movie we are convinced that it is there all the time, but it is not visible. The scene in which he "visits" Arthur Kidd late at night and we see her a little too close, is a masterpiece in horror. <br /> <br /> This is simply an extraordinary movie that should be considered one of the best horror movies ever made. I have a copy of "The Haunting", "The Changling" and much more. I have not seen anything on top of "The Woman in Black" yet I am still looking. This film is so well made that it gives even the most hardened skeptic (like me) the moment when I almost thought about the non-existence of ghosts. I am joking people that sometimes I get short fears that may appear in the middle of the road or that I will see her staring at my window, etc. Maybe she could be in the crowd in the mall staring at her with a look of hatred. That is how a really great horror should look like. Just like LaFanu's novel, "Woman in Black" very slowly pulls you in and wraps around your neck, and before you realize it, squeezes your life out of you, and then it's too late. <br /> <br /> The next thing you need to criticize is that it was done on a small screen ... and it's a pity that there is no print in it. I just paid over $ 40 for the second copy of this movie. This is the main prize in my collection. Now I'm trying to find an even better horror, which not only gives you chills, but also qualifies the sound drama.
