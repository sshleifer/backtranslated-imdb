Guys and Dolls is a unique character-based game. Sky Masterson <br /> <br /> (Marlon Brando) is a high-class gambler who bets with Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) for a thousand dollars. Nathan needs money, so he can <br /> <br /> run his usual crap game and make a fortune. The assumption was that Sky would not be able to take any girl to Havana, and Cuba and the "doll" he chose were Sarah <br /> <br /> Brown (Jean Simmons), who led the missionary. Sky finally bribes <br /> <br /> Sarah is enough to go to Havana with him. After all, they fall in love with each other, but later accuse him of something he did not share. Nathan ran a missionary game on the mission night. 14-year-old fianc√©e Nathan, Adelaide (Vivian Blaine), disapproves of Nathan's gambling and tries to stop him. However, when the film ends, everything ends with a double <br /> <br /> wedding. <br /> <br /> The songs in this movie are simply great, no matter who sings. Marlon <br /> <br /> Brando has no singing at all and the truth is that they could have called him, but it did not really matter. He made a great acting job (of course seeing that it was Brando) and played his character very well. I saw a few movies with Jean Simmons and I thought that this movie was her weakest film, she could not sing too <br /> <br />. However, the song consists of Frank Sinatra, Vivien Blaine and Stubby Kaye. Vivien Blaine and Stubby Kaye were also in the original <br /> <br /> broadway production of Guys and Dolls. Vivien Blaine had a great voice and was a perfect Adelaide. If you like music, and even if you do not, I advise you to watch it.
