A few times I had tears in my eyes while watching the movie there are several. And there is only one time when I really cried and it was when I saw this movie. This movie has a few kliches, but I do not really care. I'm crying when I write this, and it's been a long time since I saw it. It is perfectly preserved and all production values ​​are good, but what really counts is simple and great news. We all know this in our hearts, but it is not always easy to remember that the only thing that really matters in life is LOVE in all its forms. Only when we love, we really live. I know how it sounds sentimental and I promise that I'm usually not like that. I am quite a cynic. This movie evoked stronger feelings of sadness and happiness in me than other films and probably it will always be the first movie I recommend to others.
