Everyone has bills to pay, including Christopher Walken's bills. <br /> <br /> In Vietnam, a group of soldiers discover that the war is over and they return home when they notice a group of prisoners, including Christopher Walken. After a crazy fight for Madness Max 3 (!) And a short massacre later. Walken and some Colombian guy split the dollar by promising something or something else. <br /> <br /> A break to the present (1991), and a Colombian guy leads the revolution against El Presidente. At the beginning it is successful, but after El Presidente threatens to crush people with a tank, he is forced to give up and is shot live on TV. It is shown in full detail in detail as a message on American television that leads Walken to collect the old squad (although in fact he was not part of this squad) to attack Colombia and shoot down thousands of people. <br /> <br /> McBain is a monumentally stupid movie, but still it is also a good laugh and full of action. This is one of those movies where logic has a wide field of view - how else could Walken shoot a fighter pilot in the head from another plane without suffering from decompression or even breaking the window? Besides, it looks like these guys can shoot dozens of drug dealers in New York without bothering the police. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of madness here with b movies that can be chewed here, from the devilish acting of Michael Ironside in Vietnam, the heroic, but completely pointless death of one of the heroes, on the side of the confrontation between Walken and El Presidente and let us not forget the passionate speech of the sister of the rebel leader, seen on television in America (almost a brown tear to my lower eye, that's a bit). <br /> <br /> It's there for quid. Buy it if you have a sense of humor. See how many times you can also see the photo team.
