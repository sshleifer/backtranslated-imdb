I must say that as a BSG fan I was not quite sure what I think about this program. I saw it today on a big screen in the Arclight cinema (as part of the Paley Center shows), and the cast and filmmakers said after classes. Ron Moore said that "they wanted to take a break from Battlestar and do something different, and that they would lose some fans, but hopefully they will get others." <br /> <br /> Even without a conversation, I am now a fan of the new series. But here's what I thought about the movie. <br /> <br /> I loved it, it was really very good, I think I'm a real science fiction (or "syfy") - do I really have to write it? "geek, because I completely watch it as a series, has a strong and rich history and I am interested. <br /> <br /> It starts with a small group of teens drawing up something that was the weakest part for me and a bit confusing. The actor playing "Ben" should give us more insight into his intense beliefs. The actress playing "Zoe" seemed a bit posy, but she played with a teenager (and I'm sure I will not be the only one who thought that "Zoe" was at first a ciloon, the danger of being a BSG maniac). If they hope that it will be a new Bamber / Helfer / Park, Surprisi ngly may want to think about it, it is the adults who have drawn the attention of the audience. <br /> <br /> Eric Stoltz plays the star as Daniel Greystone, a man so haunted by the family tragedy that he jumps at the first chance of leaving his sadness and does not let go. He does a blood-curdling job of transmitting the cunning knowledge of his character to the inner world of computers and people, especially in the scene where he turns the web for a young teenage friend of his daughters, imprisoning her, then slowing down and releasing. No sign of the "serial killer" who played for Gray's Anatomy, really impressive acting. <br /> <br /> Equally powerful, though not in him, is Paula Malcomson as his wife Amanda Greystone. She is equally intelligent, well-written and beautifully played as part of Stoltz, and I totally believed that they are a couple and a couple who were together forever and have a strong relationship, something rarely seen in these days. I am looking forward to what will happen to this family and I hope that they will give her the same amount as Roslin in BSG - she is strong and wise, and when she whistles on her child, you are angry, it's really great. Not to mention her eyes, which may have magical powers, are so intense. The scene in which he deals with a government agent - a very short scene, but beautifully played - really gives an idea of ​​its power. <br /> <br /> The second part of the program, which did not work for me 100%, is the scene with Esai Morals and his mafia clan. In general, he does a good job, but I did not believe in the power of this mob or threaten them with threats. I regretted that the whole story is no more mysterious and difficult to understand; the way it's presented is almost a tribute to Godfather, they kind of hit you in the head. But considering the time, I see it unfold in an interesting "upstairs / down" type with poor minorities (Morales et al.) Compared to the rich people who rule the planet (Stolz et al.). And to be honest, I liked it when he talked to his son about the origin of their name - it was a very well-played scene. <br /> <br /> Note for fans of BSG, the boy playing "Willy Adam" really does not look like Olmos, but is just a child. Regardless of whether it will appear more than in this film, who knows? I certainly could not say. But that did not bother me because it was not as interesting as everything else around him. <br /> <br /> Polly Walker plays "Sister Clarice" and she is cold and strange in every scene she is in. I'm not sure where it will go or who it will go to, but I was impressed by its acting. In this film she was a bit on the side, but of course it was created to later play a very important role. She was not similar to her character in Rome, something I always make an impression on actors. <br /> <br /> One nice surprise - the music is actually better and less obvious than BSG, even though it's the same guy that Bear McCreary does. It has a haunting and unusual approach that surprised me, I would buy this result if I had a chance. <br /> <br /> As for the "panel discussion" after the concert, it was led by Seth Green. Ron Moore was very smart and articulate, David Eick was smart (like his video diaries), Esai Morales told a long story about how he was cast, and Eric Stoltz was very funny and really did not answer questions (but I always had something for him, Paula Malcomson was tough (she took Seth Green for the misconception that she was 24) and the girls who played at Zooey and Lacey were loved, Grace Park and Tricia Helfer were there too, answering questions about it, how they made scenes with each other at BSG. Overall, a very interesting and wonderful evening. <br /> <br /> I give the show 9 out of 10 and I am looking forward to everything developing. <br /> <br /> NOTE: I I just watched it a second time and I really hope that they will discover what HOLOBAND was originally created in. I have no idea what it may be, but it fascinates me.
