as a sequel, this is not a bad movie. I really liked it better than the first one. It turned out that it was more fun. It seemed that a documentary style was shot. The budget, however, increased on me and made the film look more authentic. This movie has more dry liners than the original, which is a good thing, in my opinion. with some of the scenes and characters it becomes almost a parody in itself, which can be a point. this film at least has some tension, which he did not have first, in my opinion. music from the original, which is great. the acting was quite decent for the most part, although, as I said, some of them seemed to be better. a few minutes that seem really slow and just do not seem to flow, just like the rest of the movie. However, I think it was a nice continuation. The rating "Return to the cabin by the lake" is 7/10 *
