Plague replaces femme fatale in this very tense noir filmed in New Orleans by director Elia Kazan. Kazan as always gets great performances from his actors, but also shows a visual talent for claustrophobic tension with a combination of tight compositions and stunning scenes with a single shot. <br /> <br /> A man illegally entering the country is killed after a card game. It turns out that it has the form of bubonic plague, so it is crucial not only to arrest the killers, but also to instill all those who have had contact. City and health officials implement a plan of secrecy instead of warning the community for fear that the perpetrators will flee the city and spread the disease. The detective and the epidemiologist against the clock create a restless alliance when they comb through the wharf, using different research styles. <br /> <br /> Streets arouse a huge ethical question about the citizens' right to know, because the doctor claims that media loss of consciousness may pose a greater risk to the community. Regardless of the result, you can still be the second guessing the main character of the movie. <br /> <br /> Richard Widmark as Dr. Clint Reed and Paul Douglas as Detective Warren show short moods and reluctant respect for themselves in the search for killers. Barbera Bel Geddis as Reeda's wife has some good moments with Widmark in some home scenes that bring the right touch (a quiet, more comic) relief from tensions of desperate exploration amidst the bleak surroundings of the New Orleans wharf impressively underlined by the operator Joe McDonald. Zero Mostel as a small criminal is slimy and reprehensible, but sometimes nice. Walter Jack Palance as the skeletal Blackie (Black Death?) It is simply excellent. With passionate intensity Palance dominates in every scene, in which he plays not only with a great threat, but also with disturbing charm. In addition, he presents a powerful athlete who allows for more continuous continuity, especially in the powerful final allegorical moments of the film. <br /> <br /> Panic on the streets is probably the best Kazan movie outside Brando. Tense, tense, uncertain and assembled. The ambient setting gives a sense of heightened reality, which allows Kazan to be flexible in displaying his visual style beyond the film scene, and thanks to panic he manages to achieve success.
