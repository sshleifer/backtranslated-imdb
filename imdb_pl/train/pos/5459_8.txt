BABY FACE is a fast, wise crash, knowing the smirk of a movie that <br /> <br /> lasts only an hour and 15 minutes, but oh, what a clever 75 minutes are <br /> <br />! The fact that a story that covers so much land can be said in such a short time <br /> <br /> makes most of today's filmmakers feel ashamed. Screenwriters <br /> <br /> today should study the economy of BABY FACE and cut off the pompousness that <br /> <br /> overwhelms so many of their films. <br /> <br /> History is not nonsense. The amoral woman first reaches wealth, <br /> <br />, and then over the bodies of men who fall in love with her madly. <br /> <br /> Sure, the production code helped redemption, happy ending, <br /> <br /> but it's not hard to see where the writers wanted to go <br /> <br />, so enjoy what is there and use your imagination to the end. Stanwyck is wonderful, like George Brent and Douglass Dumbvrille as an unlucky competitor. This is not a great movie, but it is certainly pleasant. If you have never seen BABY FACE catch <br /> <br />, it will be shown on the cable <br /> <br /> or rent a tape. It is worth the effort ..
