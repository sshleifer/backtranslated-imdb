10 ELEMENTS OR LESSES have been done within two weeks on the modest budget of the writer / director Brad Silberling, just a small movie shot at Carson, CA, which seems to have been improvised ... in the best sense of the word. Silberling was fortunate to combine the veteran actor Morgan Freeman, between his great projects, with the Spanish actress Paz Vega, and the result is a dialogue between two people from different perspectives who manage to improve the life of the other. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman plays alone - yet another part of the comedy is such that he is portrayed as an actor who has been out of work for four years, looking for a place for a "filler film" to return to the flow of things. His "role" is the role of the market manager, and he is thrown on the dingy market in Carson, where he encounters, among other things, one Scarlet Girl, an argument with 10 Items or Less. Scarlet is not only tired of her static work, but is also generally angry at her filandier husband (Bobby Cannavale), currently sleeping with a lazy associate of Scarlet (Anne Dudek) and her lack of ability to do a decent job elsewhere. Two couples after a few common problems and set out on a "journey", as a result of which each of the heroes grows out of the presence and life stories of others. <br /> <br /> It's a simple story, it's just been said, but it works very well because of the sensitive connection between Freeman and Paz. This is one of those small films about interpersonal relationships in which the message is susceptible to changes and exchanges. It is worth to watch it, and this is a DVD that has touching, instructive and comic - it's a pleasure to watch. Grady Harp
