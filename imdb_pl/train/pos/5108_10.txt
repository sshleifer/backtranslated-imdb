This is my favorite movie from all the time. When I was lonely, it was my movie on Friday night with a pizza and a bottle of wine. I saw this movie for the first time with my aunt Brend and sister Chasity. I was in the second grade. I fell in love with Travolta, and Sissy was my best friend. I have read many comments about why Bud left Sissy and how Sissy must "learn to act" in a marriage. But let's go back and look at it for a moment: SPOILER - My interpretation of the movie now, not when I was eight years old, is that the relationship between Bud and Sissy turns into the worst because it makes him stupid at Bull Gilley. They fight in a huge fight. Bud is trying to envy Sissy asking Pam for dancing. Sissy thinks the two wrongs will do well, and Wes will ask her if she "needs help". Everyone is sitting on the dance floor, acting like fools when Bud asks Pam: "When are you going to take me home and rape me?" Pam replies, "When you're ready, Cowboy." Bud then goes home from Pam to her apartment in downtown Houston. Which daddy bought her for his oil money and "everything that implies." Bud is the one who reveals Sissy. Sissy is waiting for Bud when he returns home the next day. Sissy is ONE who leaves Bud. Bud then has to prove to Sissy that he is a real cowboy and recover her. <br /> <br /> In any case, this is my interpretation. Everyone has them I'm sure of! I love this movie. <br /> <br /> And believe it or not, but I have a real cowboy! I love him too! :)
