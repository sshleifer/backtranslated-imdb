Artimisia was late at night. At first I did not think I would like it, but seeing that I did not want to go to sleep and there was nothing else, I was still watching and I was intrigued by the young Artimisia, a pure and passionate virgin. Her affair with the older Tassi envied recognizable feelings. Although the film is based on a very romantic level, not on reality, I loved it much more than ordinary biographies or costumes. Great game, great photos, great music and lyrics. I loved it and I want more! :-)
