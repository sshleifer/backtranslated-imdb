"A Girl's Folly" is a kind of semi-comedic, half-documentary look at the film business from mid-1910. We get a look at life in the early film studio, where we experience assembly of the set, going through the stage, handling adoring film fanatics, and even lunch in the canteen. We are also privy to little-known film facts - for example, do you know that "Often film actors do not know the plot of the image in which they work"? <br /> <br /> The plot of the movie is in fact the discovery of the movie star Kenneth Driscoll and the romance of the beginning young star, which he discovers when filming on the spot in the country. I believe that the 30-minute version I watched was shortened, included on the same tape from "The Cheat" by Cecil B. De Mille. This is a very reliable movie - an easy watch with lots of accessories. As a bonus, it contains some of the best illustrated subtitles I've ever seen accompanying a silent movie.
