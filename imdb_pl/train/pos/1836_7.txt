It's time to hit! <br /> <br /> Waqt Dir- Vipul Amrutlal Shah Cast- Amitabh Bachchan, Akshay Kumar, Priyanka Chopra, Shefali Shah, Rajpal Yadav and Boman Irani. Written by: Aatish Kapadia Rating- *** <br /> <br /> Eureka! We have it! Yes, ladies and gentlemen? In "Waqt" Vipula Shaha we probably found the first hit this year. Filled with all the necessary ingredients of the commercial Bollywood tariff, "Waqt" has everything you need to get the video clicked by the Indian audience. It's a kind of movie that makes the distributor feel happy and contemplate his next phoren visit! In this "saga of Indian emotions" we have a happy family (is not it always?) Of three. Ishwar (Amitabh Bachchan), a postman who became a millionaire (do not ask how! ... there is something in selling toys while delivering letters and so on? Seriously - who the hell!), Married of Sumi (Shefali Shah) is a father loving Aditya (Akshay Kumar). Ishwar must make a serious decision about his son's careless attitude to life duties. However, his love for Aditya causes his delay with a serious problem. However, in the face of the situation that will test his race against time, Ishwar has no choice but to throw Aditya out of the house, hoping that the new situation can make him more conscientious in his life. But this alleged solution itself becomes a problem because the gap between the loving father-son grows and the fences continue to grow. <br /> <br /> You do not have to be a rocket scientist to realize that such a story gives you lots of possibilities about both comedy and drama. So, before the break you have an initially funny, later annoying comedy song Boman Irani and Rajpal Yadav; and after a break there are moments for handkerchiefs between Aby and Akki! The writer Aatish Kapadia (he also wrote the original Gujarati art "Aavjo Vhala Fari Malishu", on which the film rests) copes well with maintaining narrative fluency. Dialogues sometimes become inconsistent. It does not help that the songs look like acne on a teenage face and they break the procedure. Of course, a few numbers could be liquidated. On the director's front, Vipul shows that he has a natural talent for telling stories. "Waqt", just like his earlier debut album "Aankhen", make you interested until the last drum. Personally, I think that the swing of emotions was a bit nervous for me. But given the audience's reactions, it worked at your fingertips. <br /> <br /> Finally, "Waqt" relies on his performances, which are one point in the overall rating! Amitabh Bachchan is always reliable. His energy is visible, as is his age! Shefali measures subtle nuances and fits the superstar at every turn. Boman and Rajpal bring home with their histrionics. Priyanka has little to do than to fulfill the superficial role of the heroine. But when everything comes down, "Waqt" is Akshay's vehicle. I've always maintained that Akki is as good as his role. Put him in "Mujhse Shaadi Karogi" and he is fantastic, but in "Bewafaa" he is pitifully angry. Here, Akki is probably the best. Regardless of whether it is his comical timing or emotional renderings, it is almost perfect. There is also an action scene for his fans! Ironically, his previous best work was in "Aankhen" - with the same director and Big B at his side! <br /> <br /> "Waqt" is by no means an unforgettable movie. This is not one of the better movies in our industry. But this is one for the masses. And at a time when industry is desperately waiting for a universal hit, "Waqt" can simply settle this matter! <br /> <br /> - Abhishek Bandekar <br /> <br /> Trivia - this is the second akshay movie after Bewafa, in which he appears on stage during the culmination! <br /> <br /> Rating- *** <br /> <br /> * Poor ** Average *** Good *** * Very good ***** Excellent <br /> <br /> April 22, 2005
