Ho, ho, dead maniac! This thrilling adaptation of the amazing EC Comics horror story by force is undoubtedly one of the best episodes of the cable television series. Director Robert ("Back to the Future") Zemeckis fully uses Fred's witty script ("Night of the Creeps", "The Monster Squad") by Dekker, which focuses on the ruthless two housewife (well-known by Mary Ellen Trainor, who she married Zemeckis when she played in this episode), which kills her jerked husband (nice meeting of Marshall Bella) on Christmas Eve, banging his head with fire. Complications arise when a mad, murderous madman dressed as a happy Kris Kringle escapes from a nearby asylum and decides to pay Trainor a decidedly unfriendly visit. The frightening, thrilling film by Alan Silvestri and the typically polished pictures of Dean Cundey further reinforce gruesome fun. And Larry Drake (sweet, gentle giant Benny in "L.A. Law"!) With his frightening hiccups, a crazed twinkle in bright green eyes and a defiant, really wicked smile, makes him a sensational, bloody Saint Nick.
