Terry Gilliam gives a stunning movie that I enjoyed a lot. Bruce Willis, Madeline Stowe, Brad Pitt, and even the small look of Christopher Plummer makes the movie absolutely brilliant! This is the only Terry Gilliam movie I've seen, and Twelve Monkeys is definitely in my top ten. I think it is one of the four best films by Bruce Willis; and preferably Brad Pitt. Brad Pitt provides excellent performance. Probably one of the top ten performances I've ever seen. He played his role (Geoffrey) very convincingly. The role of Bruce Willis (James Cole) was also quite convincing. Both Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt behaved exceptionally well. With a brilliant history to support great performances; and to confirm this, excellent director Terry Gilliam.
