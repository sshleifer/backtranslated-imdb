The set design and actors make this TV movie the best performance of the classic Dickens story for me. George C. Scott is very credible, like the rest of the cast. His Scrooge emanates horror until the very end of the film. Then his character changes into a person who really converts. The English town from the 19th century selected for this setting creates an atmosphere that suits Dickens and increases the credibility of the film. It's a movie that I watch every Christmas together with real Grinch and It's A Wonderful Life.
