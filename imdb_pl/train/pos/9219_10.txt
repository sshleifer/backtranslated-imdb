The movie itself made me want to go and call someone to enjoy it. It was very funny. Angelena Jolie was great as Juliet. The parents are hilarious. They are both caterers and enemies. Children play in the part of Romeo and Juliet in church art. They fall in love and their parents try to separate them. after the party and do it. Surprisingly, they still want to get married at the end of the movie. If you do not like stereotypes, and the defilement of classic literature is not seen. If you do not mind, you will have the opportunity to watch this movie.
