Slightly reminiscent of the great forties of the 1940s, such as "The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre" (1948), "Red Rock West" is a tale of conscience, greed and betrayal. Michael (Nicolas Cage) is a young and honest young man from Texas who goes west in search of work and money. He finds both, but not in the way he expected. <br /> <br /> The screenplay of the film contains lots of surprises and twists. Excellent photos, clever editing of films and moody western music add tension and tension. Expansiveness of the great sky provides a wonderful environment. And acting ranges from good to excellent, with great performances by Dennis Hopper and J.T. Walsh. The specially recorded country / western song of Dwight Yoakama provides the film with a strong finale. <br /> <br /> Properly labeled as neo-noir "Red Rock West", it also seems to me something else. The plot is full of amazing coincidences and unbelievable moments, so much so that others may consider the script to be faulty. I usually agree. In this case, however, combined with the atmospheric atmosphere and the fact that the small town of Red Rock seems almost empty of normal everyday life, coincidence and the unlikely time suggest a story that, beyond "noirish" is ... surreal. It's almost as if fate deliberately intervened with unlikely events to force Michael to deal with himself. From this point of view, coincidences are not disadvantages of the script at all. They are indispensable points in a nightmarish story of a young man who has to face his own demons ... dressed up as other characters. <br /> <br /> All we need is Rod Serling in the postscript, explaining his always-pronounced voice that ... a young man, looking for himself, stops in a small, almost deserted city a thousand miles from nowhere. This is his last break on the journey to ... twilight zone.
