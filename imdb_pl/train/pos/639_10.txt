It's a good family show with a great cast of actors. It's a nice break from the late show reality show. There is nothing similar on television, unless Joan of Arcadia is similar, because she also has a heroine of teenagers. In any case, the Clubhouse is worth seeing, because Jeremy Sumpter gives the main character (Pete Young) a kind of sympathy and naivety, which is attractive, not being too sweet and cuddly. Dean Cain, Christopher Lloyd, Mare Winningham and Kirsten Storms complete the other main cast members, and each of them is wonderful in his role. I really like Kirsten Storms as sister of Pete Betsy; he is quite a pill, but he still cares for his mother and brother, although he hates showing it. It may take a few episodes to really find his legs, but the Clubhouse is certainly one of the best concerts that will appear over a long period of time, so check people - you'll be glad you did!
