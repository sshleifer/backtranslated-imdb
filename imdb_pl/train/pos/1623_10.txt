It's a cartoon that should win instead of Country Cousin. Well done visually and much more fun and unforgettable. It's worth watching only for the music itself! Although there are certain elements that will undoubtedly destroy the sensitivity of some of these days, the comic must have some perspective. He's over sixty years old and he's just a cartoon. I am disabled, and if I were as sensitive as people who look at things like this cartoon and offended, I would have long curled up in a fetal position and disappeared. Sometimes you have to brighten up, put your head down and float! Caricatures of stars in cartoons were common in the 1930s and 1940s and were almost never flattering. Bing Crosby supposedly hated it when it was used more than once. *SIGH*
