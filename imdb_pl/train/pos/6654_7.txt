The film took a new point of view on Gandhi's life, which is pleasant and shows how much he was a man. His relationship with Harilal is something that Gandhi experienced and mentioned it several times as his failure as a father in his autobiography. <br /> <br /> My big problem is that I thought Gandhi was surprisingly non-charismatic in the movie. The person who played Gandhi could do better. Some of Gandhi's statements seemed too pleased and it seemed that he was deliberately portrayed in a negative light in some parts of the film. <br /> <br /> The movie is not really versatile, but it focuses only on the relationship between father and son. The rest is blurred and used only to show the time frame and general movie settings. <br /> <br /> Generally a nice movie, if you remember that this is not a complete picture.
