Solidny B.. <br /> <br /> I like Jake Weber. Its underestimated delivery is refreshing in times of above-average performance. I liked the relationship between father and son. I liked the dynamics of the family. Wendigo looks stupid, but it is a representation of a child's toy and a dead deer. This connection, look? This is a psychological story, not Freddy, who is making immediate gratuities. Watch and reflect on your inner child and what the movie can tell you and everything will be fine. <br /> <br /> Nice job.
