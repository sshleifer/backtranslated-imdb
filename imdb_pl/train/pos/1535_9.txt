Fortunately, as a student I was able to watch "Diagnosis Murder" for many years. It's mainly about a doctor who solves murders with the help of a LAPD son, a young doctor and a pathologist. DM provided 8 seasons of exceptional entertainment. What made it different from many other police shows and which was worth watching many times was his cast and the quality of writing. The main cast gave good performances, and Dick Van Dyke's roots shone with magic, dance and humor. The best aspects of DM are fast pace, witty scripts and of course the eavesdropping result. Unfortunately, this was unjustly compared to "Murder, She Wrote". DM is much better because it has more puzzles and differences to solve. Now there is no TV an inferior place. Gone are the days of well-being, demonstrations of family friendly policemen. Now they are only depressing.
