Given the time of the premiere, the story that appears in the thriller "Panic on the streets" from 1950 was not a surprise. The remains of a mysterious illegal immigrant are found and transferred as no one, until further examination from a public health inspector who claims that the corpse carries a strain of bubonic plague. However, with the current drama in today's world, it's strange to help this film become credible to today's viewers. The staff and team are impeccable. Richard Widmark in his first role after the groundbreaking performance in "Night and the City", Jack Palance in his frosty film debut, in which he also appeared in the film, is Paul Douglas and young (and rather charming) Barbara Bel Geddes. The whole mass of unclassified, unprofessional actors (typical of director Kazan) fills in the remaining slots. Elia Kazan directs, Joe MacDonald films (later he worked with Richard Widmark again in the much better "Pickup on South Street" in 1953), and the great Alfred Newman gains him. Almost everyone involved here has done a better job, but "Panic in the Streets" is quite a satisfying watch. Especially for the enthusiasts of the noir movie.
