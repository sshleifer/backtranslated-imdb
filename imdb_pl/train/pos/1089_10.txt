This movie was made in 1948, but still sounds like real today. Very funny. It starts with a family who wants to buy a small place in the country and "builds up" from there. Anyone who has ever built a house will find this film very engaging. Great cast. Cary Grant and Myrna Lloyd are delighted with this film. It's a classic black and white film that reflects the great style of the '40s ... clothing, architecture and family life. Many references relate to the cost of things, and these comparisons with today's costs are quite amazing. I can not imagine that someone would not enjoy this movie completely. I am surprised by the number of middle-aged people who have never heard of it. A real classic.
