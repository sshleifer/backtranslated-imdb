I really enjoyed the first two seasons. because many good characters disappeared later. like most programs at the beginning is a bit slow, and later in the later seasons getting better, but this is an absolute reversal. Jenny from the first season and Valarie from the second season were Sabrina's friends, I really did not care for others, Jenny and Valarie were her coolest friends. I think for some reason the producers wanted us to dislike her college friends for some reason. They were so cruel to Sabrina. but my favorite episode from the first season is Cat Showdown, and my favorite episode from season 2 is the witch, it's the funniest episode. I also thought it was funny that Libby was popular, but she was always jealous of Sabrina and she never had a real boyfriend, but she always wanted to be with Harvey. I just wanted them to do something better. I liked it the first two seasons, during the first speeches Sabrina said a few words while wearing the costume, as in the pilot episode in which she is dressed as a witch, I liked how she said "this is not me" and later she she was constantly trying to change into something else that I think, but this is a really nice program. it's a bit like an andy griffith in a sense, because it's good at first, but when it's changed, and barney fife is left, it's okay. but I still like to watch it, but the only reason I watch the later seasons is sabrina. I mean the opening sequence: the initial titles of the seasons 1-3 show Sabrina in front of the mirror with a few different costumes and costumes, because the names of the cast members quickly flash at the bottom of the screen. At the end, Sabrina will say something like a pun related to the costume he is wearing and then he will disappear. the opening sequence of the fourth season includes the characters in the bubbles. the first points of the 5-7 season show Sabrina in various places in Boston
