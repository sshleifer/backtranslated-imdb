As a collector of movie souvenirs, I had to buy a movie poster for this movie, which now, when I finally saw it, must be the best in it. There is nothing more attractive to hang on the wall than a picture of a 27x41 inch melting man. However, there is nothing more terrible to place in a video recorder than an hour and a half of the image of a melting man. At first, I thought this movie was pure trash, but then I realized that it had some features that made me laugh. Dr. Ted Nelson's character must be the most kind person ever brought to the big screen. His dialogue is so trivial that it's unbelievable! ("It's unbelievable! It seems like it's getting stronger when it's melting!) <br /> <br /> And could anyone tell me how the hell they know exactly how much time Steve left before it completely melted and exactly what plans to "help" him? If this movie was to scare the audience, I think it did not hit him.
