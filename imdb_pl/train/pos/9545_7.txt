I do not know whether to recommend this movie to "Tetsuo" fans or not. Why "Tetsuo"? Because you can easily mark some things in this movie as a very obvious "Tetsuo" rip - off. The concept is similar, the editing is equally crazy and fast - which is good, because apart from the fact that the film is more dynamic, it overrides some of the disadvantages caused by low budget and other factors. <br /> <br /> There is a lot more gore, less eroticism, and in the case of "Meatball Machine", transforming a man into a creature that is partly a machine (sounds familiar?) called "Necroborg" (very original) is caused by slimy small aliens. <br /> These slimy little scales from space actually use human beings as vessels for their gladiator games that play with each other. They infect the body, somehow manage to put in a crazy amount of mechanical parts, pulling them out of nowhere and turning them into a killing machine that attacks other Nekroborgi. Their goal is to defeat another alien who is in another Necroborg, tear him from the corpse and eat him. <br /> <br /> All in all, the plot sounds a bit stupid and I did not expect much, but in the end I really liked this movie. <br /> <br /> As I said, it's a low budget, but it's still pretty decent. Do not expect too much from the actors, most are not very good, but you can tolerate them. I liked the atmosphere and gore, the bizarre situations and the way the movie is directed and edited. Although the story is not very original, it has a certain charm - at least for me. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10.
