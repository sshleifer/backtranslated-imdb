well done, giving the perspective of the other side, the fraulein doctor records both the cost and the futility of the war. an excellent game, especially when the German command refuses, on behalf of chivalry, to present the medal of the kaiser commanded by the struck. the carnage scenes are probably too intense for the bad minds of the US, who probably would have preferred stupid statements and meaningless abstractions like 14 points or a league of nations. real Americans can appreciate the story and action. for the whole action and the intrigue of the fraulein, the doctor compares the favo (u) with the Jacob's Ladder.
