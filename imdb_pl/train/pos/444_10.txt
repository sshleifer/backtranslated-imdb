This is a movie that England can do in a dream, and that means a compliment. Due to the success of British comedies about the customs of the late or early twentieth century, especially adaptations of the novel EM Forster, this very Merchant-Ivory as production was adopted in the light it brought after its release in 1992. It was a special year for actress Miranda Richardson, who appeared as wife of Jeremy Irons, who discovers that her husband has an affair in the worst possible way in DAMAGE, and as an IRA terrorist who finally makes a wig and gets a nasty promotion in THE CRYING GAME. Here she plays a peaceful, cheerful woman at Rose Arbuthnot, who with Josie Lawrence, who plays Lottie Wilkins, embarks on a journey filled with discovering herself. They will be joined by an unlikely couple of ladies: one by Caroline Dester, played by the mysterious Polly Walker, who resembles the very vampire Louise Brooks (and not just the hair she wears), and Mrs Fisher (Joan Plowright). The fours will eventually join up, becoming deep friends just because the story is so full of spring and overwhelming, dreamy sweetness that it almost precedes it, but that's fine; it's a movie he wants to be. Alfred Molina and Jim Broadbent (then relatively new to the American audience) fill the cast as the husbands of the two main characters, and Mike Newell makes the film alive with almost magical elements, full of calm moments and I wonder.
