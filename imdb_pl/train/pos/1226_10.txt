They filmed this movie on a long island where I grew up. My brother and his girlfriend were accessories in this movie. Apparently there is a party scene where everyone drinks beer (which, as I was told, was colored water, tasted disgusting, and it was very difficult to swallow it all the time, especially in the funnel stages). However, none of us have ever heard about the fact that the film is published in any form. He never appeared in cinemas (of course) and, as far as I know, he was never released on video, and certainly not released on DVD. It seems, however, that some people have seen it, though probably not much. So there must be something. I would absolutely like to buy it for my brother, but there is no way to find it. Does anyone know anything about when / where / how can I buy this movie? And what would the format be like?
