I saw this movie 12 years ago on TNT. It was Susanah York's birthday and they were showing this movie as a double film with Tom Jones (1963). I have not seen this movie on TV since then. I became interested in this movie because one of the stars is very funny and talented Jim Dale, as Lusty the sailor. I believe that Dale is now making a narrative about Harry Potter books about Casette, but it's quite funny. It's a fast comedy. It is not on VHS or DVD. Columbia Pictures should review your movie collection and consider restoring and releasing this movie to DVD. Christopher Plummer is as entertaining as Lord Fopington, Ian Bannen is also very funny as Ramble the sailor. It's a dirty comedy, a kind of film that you can not see anymore, with great production values. *** 1/2 stars with ****
