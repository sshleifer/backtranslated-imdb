There is no director I like more than Mamoru Oshii. But unfortunately, although he directed several films that have gained great international attention, there are still some of his films that slipped through the slots. Tachiguishi is one of them, and although I love him for bits, it's not hard to understand why distributors in the West are a bit reluctant to spend it. <br /> <br /> Between his large and serious films Oshii is known for performing smaller and more strange projects. Although Tachiguishi definitely falls into this category, Oshii really got ahead of it by creating something that is very difficult to classify, even as a bizarre Japanese movie. Go to the figure. <br /> <br /> At the base is a document that is not completely different than Otaku no Video. But instead of being a fool of an existing subculture, Oshii invent her own and delves into the life of culinary heroes, collecting food for free and maintaining the Japanese culinary level. Oshia's approach to the subject is closely related to Dai-Nipponjin, because the object is treated with a deadly sense of gravity, while the images on the screen look as funny as possible. Mortal humor brought to extremes. <br /> <br /> But that's not all, instead of just shooting his mock-up, Oshii decided to do it with a new, baptized super-vemem in visual technique. A strange mix of live action, photography, digital animation and dolls on a stick. He performed and played (or posed, if you like) by the largest Japanese animation producers, because the project was to be as low as possible. <br /> <br /> And if you think it almost covers it, know that the movie is very heavy, which makes it a good companion for Innocence. The influence of griffins is analyzed from various cultural, political and even philosophical points of view, shot to the public through a continuous stream of monologues and dialogues. And to make it worse, the whole movie is completely embedded in real Japanese history and customs, which makes it even harder for a foreigner to get a good grip on the material. Needless to say, repeated viewing is recommended to do the best in the movie. <br /> <br /> Having said that, at the concept level, the film is easy to follow and quite funny. Various gryphons are introduced, as are the most influential historical figures of post-war Japan. The movie plays as if you were expecting a serious documentary about any other important character, but somehow big and primitively animated cut-out photos of which the characters are made do not make it so serious. The range of the characters introduced is sophisticated, Shinji Higuchi takes the cake as a cow creature wearing a nose ring while accepting fast-food chains with a bull / human gang. <br /> <br /> Oshii regular Kenji Kawai provides, in addition to a rather comical performance, from moody and dark to bizarre, strange and comic. Much joy can be derived from exaggerated sounds and effects, complementing the animation and completely contradicting the tone of the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> Visually, the film is very moody, although one must say that the animation is quite rare and effective, it remains subdued to occasionally erupt in hyperactivity. Which is not bad at all, seeing how Tachiguishi is so heavy in dialogue. Still, the film is still a visual masterpiece, because each frame looks absolutely lush and is adapted to match and improve the overall atmosphere of the film. <br /> <br /> Watch out, however, because Tachiguishi requires a lot from the viewer. If you do not speak Japanese, there is a lot to read and there are many cultural references that require some attention. In addition, the monologues in the area of ​​the film are rather lengthening and can be difficult to follow. The film still lacks English subtitles and although my French was largely enough to get what it was about, I'm sure I missed the many more beautiful points of the movie. <br /> <br /> Tachiguishi is not an easy movie you can get into, but halfway there is a full steam and from that moment does not let go. I still hope to see it again in English or Dutch. Dub would really be the best for such a movie (just like Container), although probably the dub anime is a bit too much to ask for. <br /> <br /> Of all this I can only congratulate Oshia for the next great movie. It's rare to find a movie that combines and mixes so many styles and influences to create something so special and still working. The film is elegant, looks and sounds great and is filled to the brim with creativity. This is extremely fun, even if you can not catch all the details when you first watch. But make sure you at least get it with decent subwoofers, because the automatic English translation that appears there is completely worthless and whether the film is not fair at all. I'm not surprised that the French got their release, while the rest of Europe (and the rest of the Western world) are still waiting for the film. But for those who like Oshii, appreciate dry and mortal humor and desire creative ghosts, this is a film that can not be missed, although it might as well not be suitable. 4.5 * / 5.0 *
