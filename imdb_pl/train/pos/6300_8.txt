I loved this movie. I thought it would be easy to watch and forget. I missed this after watching it to buy a DVD, it can not be easily forgotten! <br /> <br /> The script is brilliant and the casting can not be more perfect. Each character has a moment, and I laughed throughout this movie, the comedy time was in place. <br /> <br />
