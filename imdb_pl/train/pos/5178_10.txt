Before Tuscan Sky, I saw the delicate performance of Diane Lane in this other film. Campers are invited to the camp of their youth and experience it as adults. Each of those who come back seems to be looking for something they have lost, which makes it so realistic. You may have had to be a camper to really get it, but in the words of one character noticing that all her clothes were wet, "it's so camp!" From practical jokes and fights for boys, to a terrifying lady with lunch and a morning bell .. This is an amplifier. At one time, exciting activities now seem mundane. A great cast of the band makes the best of two-dimensional roles and makes them credible. Bill Paxton, Diane, Elizabeth, Mrs. Brad Paisley (probably when he first came up with her !!) Beautiful scenery, bright colors, comic music (including Hello Muddah variations) and comic acting by the famous director Sam Raimi make a film that you can draw over and over again, like looking for an old friend.
