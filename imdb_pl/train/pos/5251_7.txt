Well, Wayne's World has long since passed, and the years since then have been difficult to remove. from such cinematic gossip as "It's Pat" to the last 80-minute yawning of "A Night at the Roxbury" many have undoubtedly lost faith that any other skit will ever go to the silver screen. Well, do not be scared because Tim Meadows has an advantage. a well-written story keeps the audience's interest to the very end, and although it remains true to Leon Phelps, introduced in a five-minute sketch, the plot allows you to develop the character. humor (consisting mainly of sexual jokes) is fresh and interesting and made me laugh harder than in any film in the latest memory. it's a great time if you do not feel like taking yourself too seriously. Tiffany-Amber Thiessen from the fame of "Saved by the Bell" appears in the movie and looks amazing. Finally, Billy Dee Williams, experiencing his 45 days of Colt, gives the film a touch of class. and for those who are mindless movie quotes like me, this movie will be exceptionally quoted: "oh, this is a lady!"
