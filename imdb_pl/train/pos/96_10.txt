I was browsing a few old VHS tapes and came across the television program John Denver and The Muppets A Christmas Together. It made me go to the computer and see if I can find the DVD version of this program to buy. I was disappointed that I can not find it on DVD yet. The show was broadcast in 1979 and was a great show. I have a CD and a CD, but I would like to buy a DVD version of this program. The tape is old and the picture quality is quite good, but fading, the sound is not as good as a CD. There are also some other songs that have not been included on the CD. As a fan of John Denver and the Muppets, the DVD of this series would really be a good seller. If you do not have a CD, this is a great collection of Chritmas songs from this program. The album is also good if you can find it and you still have a CD player that you can play it on.
