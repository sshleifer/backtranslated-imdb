There is no doubt that Halloween is definitely one of the best films, not only in its genre, but also outside. I love movies like a terrifying atmosphere like this one that can happen here. if you've ever been in this situation, what would you do. It's a movie that I really enjoy watching, especially around Halloween. John Carpenter is a very professional director, which I love in many other films, but there is no doubt that his most famous movie is Halloween.Oh and if your thinking about seeing the remake of Rob Zombie is not. This is pure nonsense, and a real Halloween fan would like to improve the version of John Carpenter from 1978. in each film and is very well known. So just in case, see this masterpiece that you really like.
