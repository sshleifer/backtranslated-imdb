Bela Lugosi appeared in several of these low-budget aggregates for Monogram Studios in the 1940s, and The Corpse Vanishes is one of the better ones. <br /> <br /> Bela plays a mad scientist who kidnaps young brides and kills them, then pulls out the liquid from their bodies so that he can keep his young aging wife. After the reporter and the doctor are staying in his house for the night and discovering that he is responsible for the bride's death, they report the murders to the police the following morning, and the mad scientist is shot and soon falls. <br /> <br /> In this movie you have almost everything: the scientist's assistants consist of an old witch, a hunchback and a dwarf (her sons), a thunderstorm and terrible passages in Bel's house. Bela and his wife found out that they sleep better in coffins than in film. <br /> <br /> Corpse Vanishes is worth watching, especially for Bela Lugosi fans. Great fun. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
