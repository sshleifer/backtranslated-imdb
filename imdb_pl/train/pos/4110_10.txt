This and "Hidden Fortress" are the most expensive for me. We do not give away 10 sweets, but it certainly deserves it, if at all. Although it is quite long (like all Kurosawa), he agreed with the problem that draws me into most of his films; the plot is often too loose and slowly evolving, contains scenes that are unnecessary or just too long without any real purpose of the story or character description. Dodesukaden gave me the same experience as "Hidden Fortress"; despite its length, there was not a single minute that I would cut out. <br /> <br /> It is also a very unusual Kurosawa movie in a sense, there is no story, but many small independent stories that are based more on the character's description than the plot, in contrast to other Kurosawa movies that I have seen so far . It is also based on a dialogue that he uses brilliantly (especially in the story between a father and son planning a "new home"). <br /> <br /> However, what makes it a masterpiece is that the subject is as tragic as it is possible, it can be described so humanely and pleasantly, without pointing fingers at anyone in any moment. From the beginning to the end, it provides the whole emotional scale from laughter to tears in perfect balance.
