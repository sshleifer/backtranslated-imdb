Return to Cabin by the Lake is probably one of the few sequences that can meet the original. He had black humor, good suspension, pretty girls and of course a psycho killer. What's missing? I do not think anything. Except that we were left with a small amount of Gore and nakedness, because it was created for television. Besides being one of the best Sequels, he is one of the best thrillers that you can watch as a family. Recommended for everyone.
