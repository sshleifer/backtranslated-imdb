Many people hated this movie, but blame it for two facts - 1 - They want it to be too similar to the first few American Pie films. and 2 - they try to take it too seriously. <br /> <br /> The one I found was the best of all six and I absolutely love Dwight. The plot is predictable, I will say it, but what is this comedy for teenagers? Road Trip, Dirty Deeds etc., All are incredibly predictable, but still damn funny! I say it's worth watching, I love it, I think it's fun. Just do not watch it, comparing it to the first, because it's nothing like it. <br /> <br /> After watching the Naked Mile and this, it became obvious that all American Pie films were about and only about The Stiflers. Which FINE is for me. <br /> <br /> See. Enjoy. Love. xD
