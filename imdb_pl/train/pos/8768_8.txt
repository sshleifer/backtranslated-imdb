I saw this movie in a shop in a cheap section. Actually, I remembered how many years ago I saw ads and trailer. I thought, "What a hey" and I bought it, mainly because the plot sounded interesting, and Claire Danes was always someone of talent in my eyes (it was also before I became a big fan of Kate Beckinsale). <br /> <br /> And so it's about two girls who escape their vacation in Bangkok, are arrested for drugs (which are innocent), and then sent to prison in Thailand. The film shows what will happen to them and sometimes questions their innocence. <br /> <br /> Both Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale give great performances, and the plot of this film is unconventional and raises nice questions for moral discussion. <br /> <br /> I think it is a solid good movie, but some improvements could have been made. It could have been longer ... it would help to strengthen these figures, and a better insight into Thailand's justice policy would help. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, besides, it's a good movie with some great performances. <br /> <br /> PS For all pop-culture junkies are looking for Paul Walker's two-minute role. I did not even notice it when I saw the movie for the first time.
