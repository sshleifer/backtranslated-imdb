For anyone who likes the series, this movie will be something to watch. However, it also leaves more. I loved the way every character (detective) appeared. Least the end of who is the fourth chair, because they leave a reason for the next movie. I guess, of course, without Bay. Just like the series was a very well connected series of scenes. This is the series on which I would like to live. Thanks to the cast for a great TV.
