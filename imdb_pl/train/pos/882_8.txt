I chose it from the whim of the library and was very pleasantly surprised. Many tight, expressionist works with cameras, equally tight scenario and two great actors who combine into one very good movie. Not for a reptilian multiplex brain, but a true cinema lover. If Hollywood ever puts his dirty hands on her, I'm sure it will ruin it. The whole choice to choose from. Other posters here have a lot of praise, so I do not have to bother about copying them; just use their advice and mine, and do not miss this gem. Name what you like; I call it two hours of entertainment well spent. Read my lips: do not miss it.
