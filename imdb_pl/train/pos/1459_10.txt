Wow! Wow! Wow! I have never seen a globalizing document about globalization until I saw MARDI GRAS: MADE IN CHINA. This film has a zero narrative and combines footage with sensitive interviews with four teenage workers in China who live in a factory. They play with toys, jump and dance. However, most of their days and nights consist of work, work and work - but the footage of their work is instructive and mesmerizing to watch. The factory owner in China is incredibly open, so much that it hits the effects of globalization while "punishing" workers. Following the Mardi Gras beads from China for the carnival, the film shows how local is combined with global humor and interesting, attractive film material from both cultures. One of the most interesting parts of this film is the intercultural introduction of factory workers and Mardi Gras revelers to each other through photos. Here the film is full circle and shows how images can be a point of communication and transformation. The film is never preached, it is guided by guilt and it allows the present viewpoints to be present. Finally, we - viewers - submit our own conclusions about the complexity of film and globalization.
