I really liked this movie! Even though it was not one of those books, it's still the classic Nancy Drew style. I have seen many of the commercials of this film, and since I was really interested in Nancy Drew's books, I had really high expectations for this film and definitely met these expectations. Almost all the characters were exactly as I imagined them, reading books. I'm really happy that I saw this movie. All actors and actresses behaved as if they behaved like in a series of books. Ever since I saw this movie that I wanted to read, every book by Nancy Drew is there. All the actors and actresses really fell into their characters and it definitely showed when the movie was broadcast on the big screen. It definitely seemed that all the actors and actresses were really in the positions in which they were characters. I definitely give this film 10 out of 10.
