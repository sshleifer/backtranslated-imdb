"Invisible mouse" is a delightful and different cartoon of Tom and Jerry. It contains the usual chases and battles of cats / mice, but this time in a different way. Jerry accidentally falls into a bottle of invisible ink and is therefore very happy because he realizes that he can prepare many "surprises" for Tom, scare him, torment him and confuse him. <br /> <br /> As much as it is strange, it is also very nice and fun to see what we do not see: Jerry invisible. It's funny to see something hovering in the air, not seeing who's doing it (we know who, right?) - it's like these things have their own lives, and even almost ghosts. Equally funny is that Jerry is eating some candy and fruit while he is invisible. I really like the instrumental music that plays when it's not visible. <br /> <br /> Some of the best jokes in this glance are when Tom sees Jerry's shadow and hits him, and even when Tom tries to hit him with a pan and Jerry writes "Missed me." I also like when Jerry drinks Tom's chocolate milk, it becomes visible again and with a happy look in the face. <br /> <br /> In general, this short has the basic ingredients needed for a classic cartoon: humor, entertainment, fun and some cool compositions.
