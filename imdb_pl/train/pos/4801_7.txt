I watched it with my whole family as a 9-year-old in 1964 on our black and white television. I remember my father noticing that "it could have happened - Adam and Eve". I perfectly remember the scene in which Adam finds Eve, her eyes were blackened. I asked my father why her eyes were blackened and he said because she was tired and hungry. Not seeing this episode for 45 years, I still remember it live - TV broadcasts back and forth with the home planet, scenes with bombs shaking in the headquarters, with the final stage of the two going away, Adam carrying his package and Eve following. Maybe it was not a theatrical work of art, but it certainly impressed me all these years.
