This is very true of the original manga of the same name, also known as Tramps Like Us in the US, but you can still enjoy it, even if you have not read the manga. It's a different kind of tail, showing a strong and independent woman who hurts like everyone else. However, due to her external strength, she is afraid that she will show her inner feelings and therefore let those who surround her hurt her with dumb comments. The only one who really invented it and with which it can be freely is her new pet ... man ... Momo. If you want something other than the usual boring stuff with some wonderful actor / master of J-Dorama (Japanese drama), this is definitely a series to watch ... and read it!
