I saw this movie jewel in Cannes, where he was part of the directors two weeks. <br /> <br /> Welcome to Collinwood is nothing but magnificent. Great fun all the time, all members of a strong cast play their socks. Sometimes, a loud comedy about a petite scammer (Cosimo, played by Luis Guzman) laughs and gets caught trying to steal a car and is sent to jail. While in prison, he meets a "lifeguard" who tells him about the "best bell"? what about you and me ?? it's a sure fire to get a quick, rich plan. It turns out that there is a way from an abandoned building to a jewelry store in the city? that could make millions. Sounds simple? ?? on the way, throw yourself into various crazy characters and incidents and you have ingredients for one crazy ride !! ?? the word goes from one lost life to the next, and soon a team of them gathers to try to earn on Cosimos the "bellini" run by the unsuccessful boxer Pero (wonderfully played by Sam Rockwell? Certainly a star in preparation) and reluctant to cheat Riley (William H. Macy), who is forced to take his child with him when his wife was closed for fraud !!. <br /> <br /> Based on the Italian film I Soliti ignoti (Big Deal on Madonna street), which inspired a similar movie to "Collinwood"? `Palookaville '. It causes that he meets with this last effort and although it is written and directed by the Russo brothers, he certainly has the shades of Coen Brothers. Produced by Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney, who has a small but fun part as a crippled safe breaker.
