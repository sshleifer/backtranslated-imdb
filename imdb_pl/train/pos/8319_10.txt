I was 5 years old when I saw this musical movie on vacation with my family in St. Thomas in 1977 and I fell in love with him right away. 27 years later, it is still an original inspiration to achieve my goals, which I have achieved since then! <br /> <br /> This tragic story of the hard-core behind the scenes of the entertainment industry during the "Sparkle" of the late 1950s successfully presents the struggle of three young sisters looking for their place in the sun. This story can simply become the biographical history of many young aspiring artists about what can materialize when things seem to be going too fast and patterns to follow are not available to help. <br /> <br /> Phenomenal music written and composed by Aretha Franklin and Curtis Mayfield, the soundtrack carries a story with every song. From surrendering to situations that almost leave no choice for strong, long-term decision-making, until the ultimate dedication to move forward, all three young girls, Sparkle, Sister and Delores, represent different paths that you can take when you set off to achieve your ideal opportunity as your contribution to society. <br /> <br /> This movie could be a source of ideas for creating "Dreamgirls" on Broadway and "Glitter" Mariah Carey 25 years later. As an original member of the audience in both productions, I saw a lot of similarities in both stories to "Sparkle", as well as in "Saturday Night Fever", "Fame", "Flashdance" and off-Broadway hit "Mama, I want to sing.
