Ghost Train is a treat for those who value the typical humor of the 40s. It includes the Second World War in the story, but not as much as I originally thought, and the characters are a unique mix that plays their roles quite well. Askey, playing the role of Tommy Gander, is what illuminates the story for parts that could be presented as boring or "dragging". <br /> <br /> The story of the haunted station is in fact terrible even for the present day standards. It's unique, and the way the characters communicate with each other is fantastic to revive the mystery of The Ghost Train. Gander is basically a nuisance for all the other members, while the rest are doing well. He is always the center of attention and can be called "annoying", but it is by those who do not appreciate the humor of 1940. His humor is innocent and childish, which makes him enjoy watching. <br /> <br /> If it was not for Askey / Gander, this movie would be shorter in action, pleasure, and the result would not be so effective in my opinion.
