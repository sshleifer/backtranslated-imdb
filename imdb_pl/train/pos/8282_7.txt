** MOÅ»LIWE SPOILERY ** <br /> <br /> The biggest part of the movie, which does not work, is Wendigo, and when your title title fails, your movie is usually not far behind. The interpretation of the Wendigo characters by the filmmakers is interesting and can be dangerous when it is shot correctly - when the escaping killer sees Wendigo in his rearview mirror, for example - and the tree form was really very good. However, as a monster, it never comes alive. We do not have much explanation for his behavior, and what we see from this does not match either the story told in the film itself or the knowledge of Wendigo I have ever read. <br /> <br /> I think one of the main reasons why the monster fails is that there is not enough to do in the film. When you bring this movie to the bones, you have a thriller with a little supernatural element instead of a monster movie. <br /> <br /> Photos are good, though a bit cheesy; filmmakers use the scenery, lighting and time of day to reflect the atmosphere and mood. Otis appears to be really dangerous and unpredictable, making him a real monster in the movie. It would be more effective to explain his behavior because he is possessed by the hungry spirit of Wendigo, who would also be a more accurate representation of the true legend. <br /> <br /> I have heard anecdotal reports (from the discussion group) that the reason why Wendigo does not do much is that after building the monster's costume he was so heavy and uncomfortable (to imitate the position standing on the hooves, the contractor had to to walk on toes) that running, walking or doing other activities was almost impossible. Hence many flashes of a creature standing still and obvious accelerated recordings flowing from it. I emphasize that these reports are unconfirmed.
