Imagine that you are so hampered by bureaucracy that one man spends 8 years of his life and breaks down mentally, trying to solve the matter of mass murder practically alone! The technique of murder is clear, but the government, who does not want to admit to the truth, let the monster destroy dozens of human beings. When I think that my work is stressful, I only remember the true story of this wonderful movement. Devotion to the duty of the main character was masterfully presented by Rea. The comical (and sometimes tragic) relationship between Rea and Sutherland made it one of my favorite films from the last 5 years. Catching one of the worst mass murderers in history made me find myself on the edge of my place. Although it was not as well advertised and spoken as "Silence of the Lamb's", the plot was just as tense. Rent or buy this movie today!
