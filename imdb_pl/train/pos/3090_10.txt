I am so upset that ABC resigns from another program that has a chance to become a real winner. This program is so good that the writing and the story were great, the original idea for the show instead of the next boring reality show. The cast was spectacular! Characters and actors were not only on the spot, but a very talented set of actors. Concept and idea is really a new and cool idea for a television program, many of us share this idea of ​​"connections". I really love the characters of Steven, Laura, Whitney and Damien. But to be honest, there is not one person associated with this show that I did not like, even those that were only for a few episodes (for example, Sheri Appleby). Acting and characters are so easy to like and so talented !! I would like the ABC to give this program more chance and not stop the show in the middle, it was also not advertised enough. Really unjust !! everyone !!. This program was very promising. First of all, let ABC know how I feel and send emails to keep this program alive. Join me, I know we can do it. It worked for Jerico. (By the way, where is episode 13? I want this last concert!). Support this program and send e-mails to ABC, we can do it !!! This program is worth it !!!
