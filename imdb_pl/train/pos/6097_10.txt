I do not understand how you can say that Freddy's nightmares are poor and rip-offs. Of course, you do not know a good TV when you see it. Episodes are full of drama and blood. Freddy is creative in the way he kills people. I love Freddy's Nightmares and I hope to get all 44 episodes on DVD. The best episodes are: Saturday Night Special, School Daze and Love Stinks. If you think that this series sucked, you have the right to make your opinion, but remember that it is only your opinion and it does not mean anything. Freddy's Nightmares will always be one of the best series in history and you will soon accept this fact. If you do not like it, do not watch it, but do not deny its brilliance.
