I was invited last night to watch the Cracker Bag before the preview of Disney's Holes. I do not know who decided to show it, but I'm very happy that they did it. Cracker Bag is an absolute gem, a snapshot from Australia in the early 80s seen by the child's eye. The "conversations" between Eddie and her brother were fun and, as with the rest of the movie, so faithful to life. Each shot brought a great sense of nostalgia, because it reminded me of my own childhood (the same age in which the director probably helps a little), and the sound multiplied that feeling. I only hope that one day I will see the Cracker Bag.
