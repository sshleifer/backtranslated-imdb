The movie may be a bit too far, but if you love this program, then you expect it. This is not a bad movie; This is really good. If you do not like the show, do not watch the movie. It starts a bit slowly, but then it rises and turns out to be quite funny. At the end, there are even a few "heart-rending" scenes. After all the characters have passed, these scenes will get to you. Jerry also throws in his opinion why his performance arouses people and justifies his performance. It has a pretty good point. We really care about the private details of the life of the stars, so why is it that these people are telling their private lives also on national television. If they were celebrities, we would not mind, we would eat. Do not we like his guest doing it just because they are poor white garbage and remind us that in this world there is really poverty, and not just the rich movie stars living in the world "Leave it beaver"?
