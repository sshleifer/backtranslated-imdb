What a good movie! Made Men is a great action movie with lots of twists and turns. James Belushi is very good as an ex-hood who stole 12 million from a boss who has to face gangsters, highlanders, his wife and a local sheriff (Timothy Dalton). You will not be disappointed, jump on the deck and enjoy the ride. 8 out of 10
