I can easily admit (as a geek from IMDb) that "Phantom Lady" will never fall into my noir movie top twenty. It may not even sneak into the fifty. But instead of discrediting the film for not being as good as many other classics of the noir film genre, it should be noted that "Phantom Lady" has enough strong and enduring images to be worth watching. From the viewer, all you need is the ability to go beyond the terribly slow beginning. <br /> <br /> The movie does not cook until "Kansas" (Ella Raines) begins to try to prove the individual innocence of her boss, Scott Anderson (Alan Curtis), who was convicted of murder. "Kansas" is Anderson's secretary by day and an amateur detective at night. As a novice he is doing well, working at night on the streets of New York. Gradually, he begins to lay pieces of the murder mystery. To be honest, the film belongs to Raines and only thanks to her presence the film works at all. Somehow, he is able to breathe life into a film about a condemned man who is not the least interesting. I am not sure if this broken dynamics of a colorless leading person becomes the fault of an actor or director, but it is clearly a place where something is terribly wrong with the movie. <br /> <br /> I wonder how Raines, as a beginner detective, things really speed up to other hidden equipment when Kansas pays late into the night to an itinerant drummer (Elisha Cook, Jr.) in search of information that will help her condemned boss. She and the drummer paint the city with a new type of red during a visit to jazz clubs "all night". An attempt to describe this scene will either turn out to be unfair on stage or even worse, it can destroy the whole scene. You will know this scene when the last plate failure is over. If you're lucky enough to have this movie on DVD, you'll probably turn this scene over and over again. Like Raines, this scene makes this film noteworthy. It's mainly because of this scene that I am evaluating "Phantom Lady" 7 instead of 6. <br /> <br /> Most of the time this movie is cool and bland, with some great scenes and one amazing scene. This "drum / sex scene" separates this movie from others of the same genre. <br /> <br /> And just like in the movie it is said that "you will never make a mistake with Vanilla", I would like to add that "going with Vanilla" is a safe choice when you can not decide on a tastier feast. <br /> <br /> 7/10.
