The name Hayao Miyazaki has become apparent thanks to Spitied Away, however, the director's first efforts are often overlooked. Who remembers that Spielberg directed Duel or George Lucas directed by THX 1138? I remember seeing fragments of this film - almost certainly the last 45 minutes in the late 1980s, and what stuck in me is the visual richness of design and animation. So when I found a copy in a well-known shop for Â£ 9, I could not resist, but I bought. The strange thing is that the last 45 minutes of the movie do not agree with my memory (memory is fun in this way). <br /> <br /> Watching this movie with all the knowledge gained about the portfolio of artists is just like the works of Jean 'Moebius' Giraud. I can only have influence here. <br /> <br /> When Pazu catches a falling girl (Sheeta), his adventure really begins - the search for Laputa - a reference to the overlooked part of Gulliver's Travel by Jonathan Swift. With healthy references to Jules Verne, this is a basic good film versus a bad pursuit with the last part in which heroes reach Laputa. <br /> <br /> This is the part that is the strongest in my memory - the "pastoral" ecological aspect of Laputa has returned to nature - a multitude of robots covered with moss under a giant tree. This is, in my opinion, the most important point of the film - views of the Laputa area, in contrast to the mechanized underground. <br /> <br /> Although this is a dichotomy of the film - showing that even technology can not overcome nature - the irony of the last robot dealing with the garden and animals. The ending of the Silent Running movie is almost identical. <br /> <br /> It is incredibly stylish, I would not say "slippery" - very beautiful and organic and a huge amount of details in buildings, airships and the appearance and appearance of almost everything. <br /> <br /> Myazaki is a real master of this kind of Japanese anime. Buy this movie and price it.
