Being an otaku since Robotech, I can still say that Gunbuster is one of my favorite animes of all time. Considering when it was made, the animation is of the highest quality. There are no loops and sequences in which quality falls. Although the last episode is black and white, it does not diminish the pleasure of watching a movie. Although this has been described as "sappy", it is important to remember that females do not respond in the same way as men. Since the main character is a woman, it should be obvious that she does not necessarily have to use the macho-man tactic to gain the respect of her peers. By the way, seiryuu for Noriko also plays Akane in Ranma 1/2. Noriko is so three-dimensional that she can get a cartoon; her personality captures the essence of a thrilling girl who at first seems to be completely helpless, but ultimately succeeds thanks to the strength of her will. The only complaint I have is that the moss looked a bit like a bear. Even Gunbuster uses quite doubtful "Homing Laser" and "Buster Shield" (which is nothing more than a machine wrapping a huge velvet coat around himself in a real Dracula style). I doubt this scene was fun, but it crashed me. In total, I would score Gunbuster for the first 20 anime of all time.
