This is certainly an update of the original, with the difference that "the party on the left is now a party on the right." Like the original, this film touches upon the federal government, which transcends the limits of personal freedom. This is a warning about how weak our political freedoms are in the era of overly zealous and overly powerful federal government. Kowalski serves as a metaphor for Waco and Ruby Ridge, where the US government, in cooperation with the mainstream media, has cast such words as "white supremacy" and "right-wing extremists, as well as bogus drug accusations to shorten the most fundamental of its rights citizens, with eager acceptance of the general public. This message is so non-PC, I'm stunned that this movie can be made - at least not without bringing the federal government through the IRS to creators such as they did Juanita Broderick, Katherine Prudhomme, Western Journalism Center and countless others who dared say: "Live Free or Die" is a motto in the hat of Jason Priestly, who is great at presenting "voice", which sums up the dangerous (to some) message of this film. <br /> <br />
