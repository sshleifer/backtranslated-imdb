In Brooklyn, a hundred years ago the rivalry of Chuck Connors and Steve Brodi and their competing volunteer fire brigades leads to the famous Brodi facility that he can jump off the Brooklyn Bridge. This is a story that will be known to many people through the parody of Bugs Bunny, "Bowery Bugs" from 1949. <br /> <br /> This generally very pleasant film would probably be more accessible if it were not a notorious and disturbing scene in which some Chinese residents take part - a time capsule of antediluvian racial attitudes, which in my opinion gives the film a great historical interest.
