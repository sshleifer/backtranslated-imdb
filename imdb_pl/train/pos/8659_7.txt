In a sense, this movie reminded me of "Jumping Jack Flash". Do you remember Whoopi Goldberg on the shredding machine? Whoopi has thrown out sedatives? Whoopi as Blind Lemon and imitation of Mick Jagger? For sure the wonderful moments captured in the film, but the movie still sucks, right? That's what I think about "Rich In Love." The man hears his wife singing for the first time. Teens after coital talk about the nature of love. Albert Finney eats ice cream from a bucket, and on another stage he has a wonderful moment to wake up about his absent wife. Alfre Woodard adds another colorful character to his acting wardrobe. But here is just a whisper of the plot and you can not wait to move. Only when the ex-Go-Gos' Charlotte Caffey's The Graces improves the great pop song, the photo wakes up ... and it's over! <br /> <br /> This photo is the equivalent of a lazy summer day in the deep south of America.
