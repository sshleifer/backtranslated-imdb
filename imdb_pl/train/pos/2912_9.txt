Nowadays, we're throwing the term "superstar" too lightly, but here's one guy who really deserves it. <br /> <br /> I was stuck to this whole series. The choice of the song was perfect - it contained only songs that I wanted to hear and cut out with documentary material during weaker new songs. I loved that the band was only five guys on stage in a very minimalist environment. (With songs of this strength, you do not need a circus to have fun). <br /> <br /> The crowd shots were amazing too. How many performers can influence the original Beatles fans (currently aged 50 and over), encourage young children to jump on the first lines of "Can not Buy Me Love" and influence everyone in between? <br /> <br /> While watching, I realized that after the tragic death of John Lennon, Paul McCartney immediately became a reflection. Paul not only lost John and George (no matter what their final relationship was, but it's hard to lose someone you've changed the world with), but he also lost his wife Linda and never seemed to admit that Lennon's murder was accepted . I agree that Lennon's murder was horrible, but only now did I realize that Paul had been somewhat forgotten. I was very happy that he found love again in Heather. <br /> <br /> As for those who complain about the audio / video quality, I did not have any complaints; both were crystal clear on my set. I think the same people will complain about the quality of the DVD when the next format appears; they will never be satisfied. <br /> <br /> I only regret that I did not buy a ticket for this concert when I had the opportunity. Thanks to this movie I was able to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> When people remember John Lennon, they will first remember his murder and then his music. Now I have a new appreciation for Paul McCartney, because if nothing else, he will be remembered for his music first. And let's hope another madman will not change it because McCartney's catalog is pretty good.
