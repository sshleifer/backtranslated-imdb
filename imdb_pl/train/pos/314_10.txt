This performance is a great story. It has everything from slavery, the way of treatment, religion, the way in which Jews were hidden, the Inquisition, faith in Orisha, African gods, the way women are treated, including their daughters. Even to homosexuality. The way in which characters are entwined and that Violante, this character makes me sad. She is so desperate to be loved that she destroys everyone around her. I'm glad that they decided to re-release it t.v. again. Although I would like to see the version without editing. Xica has become my Heroin. I look at the way he uses his power to help everyone who is looking for it. I love all characters and have found that they can relate to many people now in this century. I can not wait for my Xiki every night. It would be great to dub them in English so that the Americans would love her too.
