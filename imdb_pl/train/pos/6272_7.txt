<br /> <br /> I used to see No Man's Land (1987) - the IMDB link http://us.imdb.com/Title?0093638 - and I found it OK. The movie is about a guy who only steals Porsche. Gone in Sixty Seconds comes 13 years later and adds nothing. In fact, it has many worthless scenes. And the ending is very, very bad. <br /> <br /> Sphinx has a magnetic screen that should be better used ...
