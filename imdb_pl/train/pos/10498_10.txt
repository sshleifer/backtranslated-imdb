It's a bit easy. That's all. <br /> <br /> The graphics are clean and realistic, except for the fact that some fences are 2d, but that is forgivable. The rest of the graphics is cleaner than GoldenEye and many other N64 games. The sounds are great. Everything from talking to SFX is pleasant and realistic. <br /> <br /> The angle of the camera is sometimes frustrating, but it's the same for every platform game like Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64. <br /> <br /> I got this game as a Christmas present in 1997 and Since then, I have conscientiously received 120 stars over 10 times.
