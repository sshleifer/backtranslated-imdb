A surprise nominated for this year's Best Animated Feature race at the Oscars. This is an Irish movie by heart, but it was produced jointly by Belgium and Brazil, and I'm guessing that the animators work in all three countries. The product is one of the most beautiful and unique films in the latest memory. The design of the character is a little like the French animated film Persepolis from a few years ago, with very simple characters with thick, black contours. This film is not black and white. Oh no. What makes this movie great is the use of color, just some of the most outrageous and surprising colors I've ever seen. The overall design of images is also more geometric, with figures that are basically rectangles or ovals. Most of the movie can be spent playing to find a circle - the main aspect of the visual design is the circle in the middle of the image. All these geometric patterns have a purpose - the story is about a young boy who learns to be an artist working on illuminated manuscripts (Book of Kells is a truly lit Bible, the art of the film is based on the drawings contained in it)). The story of the film is not particularly deep, but it is a pretty good fantasy story. Brendan is a young boy in Kells, a city surrounded by huge walls, built by his uncle to stop the Vikings. The novice at Kells, Brother Aiden, inspires Brendan to take part in the illustrations. He also inspires him to do things such as leaving Kells and visiting the nearby forest where the nymph lives. Bruno Coulais provides a fantastic result, almost as good as the one he did for Coraline, which I think is the best this year.
