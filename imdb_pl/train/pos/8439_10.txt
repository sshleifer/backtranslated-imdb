For all junkies from the homicide department, this movie was great! Every hero who has ever been at the exhibition has appeared in the film. It helped to solve some (but not all) problems in the series. Unfortunately, if you did not actually watch the series, most of the fun would be lost, because the film contained heavy references to any time of the show. It would probably be appropriate as the series finale, not as a separate movie, but we must take what we can get. I hope they will make more films and continue to appear in law and order killings.
