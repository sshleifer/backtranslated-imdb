"Everything depends on you, Ed?" "Now you can play the game." On the day my father left my mother, he took me to this movie with his new girlfriend, on the opening day of the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood. I was only fourteen years old. I was not even sure what I was seeing, but I will never forget it, especially the scene with Ned Beatty. <br /> <br /> By watching this today, thirty-six years later, he's still giving me a quiver. <br /> <br /> My father was a big fan of Burt Reynolds, hence the reason why he should stand in the queue for almost an hour to watch what was supposed to be an "action movie". Before that I saw two films in Dome: "Grand Prix" and "The Song of Norway". It was not exactly Mario Andretti or The Brady Bunch. After leaving the theater I was shocked. <br /> <br /> But even at such a young age I appreciated the artistry ... and after seeing it again today, I am surprised that I was still standing after I was witness to this very disturbing, but extremely well made film. <br /> <br /> Just to say that it was a traumatic experience for a fourteen-year-old who has not yet kissed his first girlfriend. I do not blame my father for taking me, but it was a bit of a witness for the child. <br /> <br /> As an adult, I still think it's quite disturbing, but I'm still impressed by the quality of the movie. <br /> <br /> Burt Reynolds is an absolute miracle, just like all the rules ... from Billy Redden as an inbred guitarist to Ronny Cox as a terrified insurance salesman ... they all do an admirable job. The sound quality is second to none, from singing birds to ticking clocks. Photography, cinematography ... all technical aspects of this extraordinary film are paramount. <br /> <br /> The moral questions raised, from murdering sexual assailants to wrestling with killing man, remain as thoroughly today as when the groundbreaking film was released. And the classic sequences of attempts to survive in the desert after struggling with such unexpected brutality change their lives. These four men, city men, suddenly confronted with a situation they never imagined, raise the bar from action to horror. <br /> <br /> This is a classic. The expression "you have a nice mouth" has been quoted indefinitely, starting with Saturday Night Live, and ending with comments on water cooling at work. This film is undoubtedly a huge part of our social pop culture ... just like "Make my day" or "I'll be back" ever. <br /> <br /> So what would you do if your friends were sexually attacked by the mountain people far from your life in the city, a cozy bed, wife and children? And if you applied the measures that Burt Reynolds did (and I would do the same), would you bury the body under the lake that was soon to be, or stand trial and use your chances? The most important thing is: delivery delivers. You can take it to the bank. If this movie does not get under your skin, you're not human. <br /> <br /> Even if you have already seen it, borrow it again and ask yourself the above question. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the movie remains the same: Ed does not want to kill the deer ... then he changes. Life and its unpredictable circumstances can change a person. And I suppose that this movie is about Jon Voight, in particular, like Ed, it gives the best performance here. And he remains one of the most talented actors in Hollywood history, from the Midnight Cowboy to his highly underestimated performance by Franklin D. Roosevelt at Pearl Harbor, his acting raises the film to another level. Climbing the rocks at dusk, terrified and determined to fix it, should be considered a believer. I guarantee that your heart rate will increase to a new level. <br /> <br /> Fast, tense, tense and tightly drawn like a banjo string, it is a game of morality that asks questions that remain to this day. Times change, but our choices do not have people. <br /> <br /> Ten out of ten stars.
