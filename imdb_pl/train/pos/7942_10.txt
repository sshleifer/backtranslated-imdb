Giallo fans, look for this rare movie. It is well-written and full of all sorts of low-life ones that fill these films. I do not want to reveal anything, so I will not say anything about the plot. The whole movie creates a very strange atmosphere and you do not know what to expect or suspect. Recommended! The only place I've seen to get this film in English comes from European Trash Cinema for 15 USD.
