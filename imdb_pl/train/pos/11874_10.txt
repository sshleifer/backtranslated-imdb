The best role of Al Pacino. Game of Tony Montana. A small hood from Cuba turned into a rich and powerful ruler of the crime in Miami. He does it with the only two things he has in this world, his balls and the word, and he does not break. em for anyone. He starts working for a big Cuban dealer, Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia) and quickly joins the organization level with his longtime friend Manny (Steven Bauer). He soon has an eye on the sexy wife of the boss Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer). After Frank sees the threat from Tony in his position, he tries to kill Tony, but without success. Tony is upset and nothing will stop him. the movie has a great cast among them is F. Murray Abraham as a lively gangster, and another known face is Harris Yulin as a crooked policeman trying to shake off Tony, marry Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Tony's younger sister. Credits for Oliver Stone's extravagant scenario. This film is one of the brightest points of Brian DePalma in his career of long ups and downs. You can see that this guy is very talented. The film has a great look. Also pay attention to two unforgettable scenes: the one in the elegant restaurant ("Say Goodnight to the Bad"). the second is the last shootout in which Tony shows that he still knows how to kick his ass and kills about 20 assassins who have invaded his home. it's certainly one of the most impressive endings of the movie I've ever seen. For Al Pacino fans and crime movies, you must see. For the rest of you, it is highly recommended. 10/10
