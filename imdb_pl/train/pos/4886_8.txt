The Last of the Blond Bombshells is a funny piece of fluff. Judy Dench plays Elizabeth, a newly widowed woman at ease. She spent most of her life on her obligatory wife and mother, but she was never really happy. <br /> <br /> Soon after her husband's funeral, Elizabeth regularly meets with a cane of children when she notices a street performer. It arouses memories when she was a member of the swing team of all girls in London during World War II. Soon we find out that the band was not exactly a girl, as the drummer was a man who dressed as a woman. Some Like It Hot. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth pulls out her saxophone (which she secretly exercised throughout her marriage) and joins forces with a street musician playing the guitar. Elizabeth is much more talented than the guitarist, and the money begins to flow. He does not take money because he is rich and does not need it. Her playing is exclusively an artistic fulfillment. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth is seen one day by Patrick (Ian Holm) who was a drummer in the band. It looks like Patrick was - and still is - the lady of the man, and Elizabeth - when she was only fifteen at the time - was the only member of the band who did not experience Patrick's "talents" other than drumming. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth is inspired by her granddaughter to re-gather the old group to play granddaughter's school dance. In this way, a lovely trip down the memory begins, combined with the aspects of a humorous movie from a car trip - all spiced up with really good swing and blues. <br /> <br /> I think I'm in an age when I really like older actresses doing their stuff, and this movie is a treasure, because it's not just Judi Dench but it's supported by no less than Olympia Dukakis, Leslie Caron and a host of experienced British actresses. The whole is complemented by Cleo Laine's unusual voice. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's fluff, but it's totally amazing and extremely funny down.
