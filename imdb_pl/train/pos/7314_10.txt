I saw this movie for the first time, I fell in love with it. The atmosphere was what caught my attention above all. I was expecting a gore fest, but instead I had to watch a very intelligent mess of the killer with his head on a chilling soundtrack (at the moment it's my bell: P). The fact that I could not predict when he would kill, and when he would disappear, was the main advantage of my book. Predictable horrors bore me. Now I know that the plot has some discrepancies, but if you're like me, you will not even notice them until the movie is over and you're not lying in bed, burying you that you just witnessed the masterpiece movement. Finally, as I mentioned, the soundtrack is timeless. This is one of my favorite theatrical performances, so I was happy to learn that Rob Zombie leaves him intact in his remake. Speaking of the remake, I read a very extensive article on the subject and now, when I know that Mr. Zombie honors John Carpenter, I place great hopes on his acceptance of this classic. This movie is great every time you feel like tingling in the spine, but it's the perfect addition, opener, final, name it for the All Hallow's Eve movie marathon. :)
