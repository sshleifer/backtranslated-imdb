This is very old, but it's part of the charm thanks to the movie from 1933. You can say the same for most movies before the code; they are simply different and usually in an interesting way. <br /> <br /> It was a short time, a great game by Spencer Tracy and the beautiful face and sweetness of Loretta Young, which made me watch and enjoy this stagy-but-intriguing movie. <br /> <br /> It would be difficult to find a prettier girl than "Trinna", played by 20-year-old Young, who was about to make his 50th movie! (She started acting as a small child, and it was the fact that in the old days they were making movies fast.) The camera, though mostly focused on the film, magnified Loretta's face and eyes many times, and I was mesmerized by her beauty. <br /> <br /> Crotchety man with a cynical look at life, Tracy "Bill" slowly transformed into a loving man thanks to Trinnie. Spencer introduced his lines here with such naturalness that you hardly knew you were playing. <br /> <br /> Although they have small roles, actors supporting Walter Connolly, Marjorie Rambeau, Arthur Hohl and Glenda Farrell leave lasting impressions long after watching this 75-minute movie. I was particularly fascinated with the role of Connolly as a minister / father in the camp. <br /> <br /> This story is a bit tricky, but - hey - these are movies. This story tells the story of two lonely victims of the Great Depression trying to survive in a Hooverville-type camp and becoming a very touching story.
