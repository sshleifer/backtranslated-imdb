My comment would have been added to the RELEASE DATE section, but I could not find a place for it. I was very surprised to see that this movie was released in the USA in February 1955. I saw him at the "first run" theater in Washington in March 1958. ? In my opinion, this movie is a very light entertainment, but it has several classic characters. John McIntyre performs a dizzying job as a corrupt judge / entrepreneur / thief. Walter Brennan performs essentially the same role as at Red River many years earlier. And, in my opinion, James Stewart gives as good a performance as ever. I've seen this movie at least half a dozen times and never stopped watching it. Photography and scenery are great and offer amazing entertainment in an hour and thirty-six minutes.
