With a minimum budget, 8 minutes of running and a huge imagination, Nacho Vigalondo achieved one of the most moving films I've ever seen. The subtlety of the script is really unusual because it does not give an end to the last moment. <br /> <br /> Do not let anyone tell you what the abbreviation is about, because you'll be able to enjoy it all the more. Nacho Vigalondo is the discovery of the year for his one-man show: directing, writing and playing in this amazing shortcut is the most extraordinary effort I've seen for years. Also pay attention to Marta Belenguer's performance, her reactions are amazing. <br /> <br /> Overall rating: 8/10
