Considered by almost all critics as the best of Tarzan's films, Johnny Weissmuller, I do not mind, although there are a few others that I thought were equally entertaining. One thing: it's the longest in the series I've seen after 105 minutes. I only saw six of them, but it was longer than I am used to and with the action finale it seemed to me that the whole thing was a little too long. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it is a good mix of action, tension and romance. Only stereo colors and sound are missing. Primitive special effects do not bother me because it's all they had in the 1930s. <br /> <br /> Some of this movie is best known for one thing: skin! "Jane" never wore anything as scanty as this movie, as the Hays code was established before the next Tarzan movie. Her outfit showed how the great character Maureen O'Sullivan possessed. However, naked underwater scenes were not her - by a long shot. The woman under water did not have a good character at all, whoever it was. <br /> <br /> There are lots of actions here. The finale was not too much. The ending, however, lasted 15 minutes and was so intense that there was too much to look at. <br /> <br /> Still, this movie offers everything - with the exception of "Boy" (their adopted son) - I would like to see you in Tarzan's movie, even O'Sullivan makes her Tarzan screaming a dozen times. With her pair of "lungs" it was not a problem.
