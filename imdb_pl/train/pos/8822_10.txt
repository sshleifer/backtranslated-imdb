A great movie, which in just eight minutes displays an unusual mix of the genre: mystery, thriller, musical. In short, we are allowed to tell about this story: a girl enters the European cafeteria, and then ... a soft transit from a nonsense to a narrative logic. In the blink of an eye, Vigalondo managed to enjoy the B / W thanks to the imagination and despite (thanks) the strictest budgets. <br /> <br /> Due to the unity of space-time, the film reaches the intensity of the short poem (almost haiku). Spain, the land of fast poetry in B / W (remember about early Bu√±uel?). <br /> <br /> You have to see to ensure our faith in young cinema outside of the States.
