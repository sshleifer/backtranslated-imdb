Oh dear, we do not like it when our superhero is interested in love, is the brain developing? story / comedy? Kirsten Dunst is a revelation - funny, sexy and real. I was laughing loudly at least five times and I am not ashamed to say that I had a tear in my eye several times. The cast, acting and script are great, I watch a lot of movies all over the board and I have not seen any film in this genre that would be equally successful. Those who disagree, tell me where I can find them! I'm sure the book is also good, but I think it must be judged on its own merits.
