From the opening scene on the crowded train where the ruthless pickpocket works (RICHARD WIDMARK) stealing from a woman's handbag (JEAN PETERS), PICKUP ON SOUTH STREET is constantly fascinating. Partly because the acting is uniformly strong from the entire cast, black and white photography is clear and adds clarity to the story and characters, and because the direction of Samuel Fuller puts him in the same league with the big ones like John (ASPHALT JUNGLE) Huston. In fact, it has the same urgency as the Huston movie about a robbery that fails - but the payoff is not so strong. <br /> <br /> JEAN PETERS is perfect as a tough girl whom Widmark describes as "a lot of clothing". It gives a lot of raw energy and sex appeal to its role of a not very light woman carrying a micro-film for her boyfriend (RICHARD KILEY) in the purse, as the FBI already knows. They are on the trail when it comes to theft. <br /> <br /> THELMA RITTER adds realism to the portrait of a woman named "Moe" who buys and sells everything to earn and ends paying for her life. Especially moves in the last scene with Kiley. <br /> <br /> This game guarantees that you will focus attention for an hour and twenty minutes. Good noir from Fox and known for appearances by Widmark, Peters and Ritter.
