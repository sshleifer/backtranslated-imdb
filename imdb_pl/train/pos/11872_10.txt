Many people like this movie and many others love it, but it seems to be all for the wrong reasons. Scarface should be liked and loved, but not in the way it was or is. <br /> <br /> Many people say that acting was exaggerated, but who better to do the superior character than Al Pacino. To say Pacino went up would be an understatement. And yet he does it so well that he brings the inner devil out of you so well. His character Tony Montana was not such a great guy at first, but his desire for power simply brings his disease of greed to another level; inhuman level. Sure, Pacino sometimes seems a bit caricatural and surreal, but I do not think it's a responsibility at all. The supporting staff performed their task well. Michelle Pfeiffer was not at its best, but it certainly matched the role she played. On the other hand, Steven Bauer was at its best, it's still Steven Bauer. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio was good and, like Michelle Pfeiffer, fits her role very well. Robert Loggia I always liked watching him when he was screaming. Apart from Pacino, they were not any outstanding or unforgettable performances. Everyone just seemed to fit their roles while they were there. They did not fit perfectly, but they were convincing enough. <br /> <br /> Brian De Palma did a very good job of directing this film. Every time an actor is able to become bigger than living his performance, you must give the author a loan, and I will definitely give De Palma this. Brian De Palma, though he is not respected, is my versatile director. He knows how to direct films according to their genres, but sometimes it does not work well. In this case, it is a gangster movie, but few are much better than that because of De Palma. <br /> <br /> Writing was great, it was just pure Oliver Stone. When I saw the subtitles at the end of the movie and saw that Oliver Stone wrote it, I was not the least surprised. This, however, is a testimony to him. I always considered him a great writer and for me he proved it once again with Scarface. Nobody knows how to write a surreal reality for a movie than Oliver Stone. <br /> <br /> Music was good, but not so great. Certainly not my favorite from Giorgio Moroder. The music was a little bit for 80s, but it did not bother me. The photos were good, not amazing, but really who cares about such a movie. <br /> <br /> It was probably one of the most influential movies in the last 25 years, but as mentioned earlier, it's for the wrong reasons. People should be aware that Tony Montana's character is not a hero, he is a monster. In any case, it does not inspire. He is greedy, bloodthirsty, uneducated and absorbed in himself. However, it is a role model for many people, because it is a rebel in some way, but most probably because it is a deceptive gangster. The Watcher would be like Mother Tereas next to Scarface. <br /> <br /> The good thing about this movie, however, is that it shows that Tony Montanas is not a real problem. If we or people of authority would like to close people like him, we could do it, but we do not. In a bizarre, twisted way is the necessity of our society. He is someone who can be blamed for everything and he did it better. Tony Montanas of this world are scapegoats for our society. That does not justify people like him. It is rather a reminder that we should not justify or allow ourselves to do bad things just because we measure or believe that we measure better compared to a gangster or drug dealer. I love this movie because it's more than just a movie about corruption, it's a movie that makes you wonder in a strange way.
