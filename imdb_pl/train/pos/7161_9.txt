I liked the movie very much. I loved two families crossing paths in history. The only question is whether Sam will be killed and then how is his family line going? Is the son of Madame Zeroni, and Zero is to be related, but there is no mention of other children? Hmmmmmmmmm. Have you never mentioned other children and wives before talking to a teacher and falling in love with him? Maybe she had a child before being kissed by Kate Bandit? Even with errors in the film. I just loved it. Acting was great. I'm not sure where the story was, and Sir Sir was Marion, and at the end is even more fun. The other "adviser" seemed concerned about the children, but of course not so much. Poor Guardian had to have a really smelly childhood to be so mean when he grows up.
