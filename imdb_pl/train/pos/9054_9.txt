"October Sky" is a film that will steal your heart, fill your mind with vivid pictures and raise the spirit. The tale of Homer Hickham and his dream of creating a rocket seems initially so simple, especially when the film takes place in a mining town, where the future is as clear as the lumps of coal in the mine. But Homer can not follow his father's footsteps. With the encouragement of Miss Riley, (a friendly teacher), members of the staff of her father and his friends, Homer tries to make his dream come true. <br /> <br /> However, as in every real story, there are many stops along the way. Director Joe Johnston leaves us in the coal mines, where we witness the chilling situation of miners leaning against a stone ceiling. With lighted helmets and a bent stance, they were more like alien insects than people in the dark. Hacking coughs of miners and blackened faces was a constant reminder of the dangers faced by miners in their work. Under the blue bowl of sky, rockets are placed on the pad and put into the stratosphere ... And nothing can match the stage when Homer sees Sputnik for the first time. <br /> <br /> What makes this film so engaging is the relationship between the characters. Homer's father is a classic, hardened man ... but he also has a gentle side. We see that he loves his son, despite many arguments. Miss Riley's love and support are also visible. Most importantly, the movie is uncomfortable. It does not bind everything in a nice bow. Tears on you, they lift you up. It maintains the atmosphere of reality that is important in such a film. <br /> <br /> This movie can be considered as a complete work. At first, I was disappointed that the film did not continue Homer's life. I did not want it to end. Then I realized that it was a good movie for a man. If he did his job, you will not want it to end. And "October Sky" just achieves this.
