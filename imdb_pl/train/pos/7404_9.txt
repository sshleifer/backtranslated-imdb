I just watched the Australian premiere of Shower [Xizhao] at the Sydney Film Festival. Notes from the program said that it is - Perfect Pleasure - happily made, moving, funny, dramatic and poignantly meaningful. I could not agree more. I only hope that the rest of the festival films will meet this standard of entertainment and I am looking forward to the next Chinese films planned to be shown in Sydney in the coming months.
