After all the nonsense that has caused Hollywood (and India), we finally get a movie that delivers horrific moments. There are a few stereotypical moments, but I'm not sure if it is possible to create a completely original movie at the moment. There are not many new ones ... just well done. <br /> <br /> Make sure and be careful, because "subtle" fears come quickly and often. This is not a movie to watch while eating a pizza. <br /> <br /> There is one very well written red herring in the film and, unfortunately, one very poorly cast role. Cheri Christian simply does not make effective Julie (wife / mother). First of all, it is completely unfriendly. I know, I know ... she survived a traumatic experience. But the viewer never meets her as "normal", and the relationship between her and her husband is rather uncomfortable (unintentionally). I think the director wanted us to have some sympathy for her, but I never did. <br /> <br /> Finally, the thumbs up for the ending, which is both disturbing and satisfying. It could easily be reduced by the sound effect at the beginning of the end credits, but the director wisely opposed it. <br /> <br /> It is not a masterpiece in any way, but it is a good, old-fashioned scary movie ... something that is rare nowadays.
