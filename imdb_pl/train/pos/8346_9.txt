Just today I watched I. Q. and I forgot how much I love this movie. It is wonderfully fun and leaves you feeling that everything is fine with the world. I love the allusions to Mozart at all stages since the opening with "Einstein" playing "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star" on the humming-sounding Eine Kleine Nachtmusik during the IQ Ed Walters IQ tests. I love the fact that a woman is portrayed as intelligent and encouraged to a career, especially the exceptional situation of the 1950s, the time in which this film is set. (I was a teacher myself, but I stayed at home to raise my children, so please do not think I'm a die-hard libber for women.) It's wonderful that a man who is "only a monkey" is finally seen as such. important and worthy as a fianc√©e Catherine, a clinical behavior researcher. The message for me is that we are not what we do, but who we are is defined by far more - without labels. There are so many small gags and single-guys that are almost useless if you do not watch and listen carefully. <br /> <br /> I found some things in the movie that are not on the goofs page. In the scene, when Ed Walters is supposed to speak at the symposium, there are three instruments (a protractor, a ruler, etc.) hanging on the right side of the chalk shelf. In the next photo from the camera is only 2. In the subtitles for our movie he shows the character of Tony Shaloub as Bob Watters, and not Bob Rosettiego, who presents himself in the film and is listed here on Imdb. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. In some estimates it may be a piece of fluff, but it has much more substance than many admit. Not only what is a great cast here. Follow and enjoy!
