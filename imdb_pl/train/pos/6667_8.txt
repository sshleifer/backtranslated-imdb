WELL. There are people who should not watch this movie. <br /> <br /> 1) Do not look if you do not like satire or black humor. 2) You do not like it if you feel offended by _guards_. 3) Do not look if you want a serious movie about a superhero. <br /> <br /> The rest of you, run, do not go to see _Mistery Men_. It's funny, it's weird, it's the wonderful message of every evil superhero known to man. Occasional jokes for the juniors' humor do not damage the brazen play of Jeanane Garafalo, Ben Stiller and Hank Azaria, as well as some fun smaller parts of Geoffrey Rush and Greg Kinnear. (It's good that Louise Lasser is starting to work too.) I laughed the whole way. Completely frivolous, a bit strange, but-good-.
