This is the only film by David Zucker, who is not surprised by anything first of its kind. The funniest movie, 98 from Night at the Roxbury, right behind me. But I did not think anything about Mary was fun, so it does not matter what he does. Do not listen to critics, especially Roger Ebert, he does not know solid entertainment, just look at his reviews. In any case, you will see that you will not be disappointed
