I remember seeing it as a child in Britain, hypnotized by the story and narrative of Laurence Olivier. At school, we will not talk about anything else. I imagine that the evaluations of the first show were enormous. It is simply the best, most versatile series of documents, even though they had to cut the story to the bone that they managed to capture so much. It is interesting that the battles for England and North Africa were crucial, but they are widely unrecognized by the Americans. The series presents a rivalry between Mountbatten and American generals, the suffering of German troops on the Eastern Front, the abuse of Japanese prisoners of war by US troops. The images of the Holocaust have made me, a non-Jewish European, feel forever guilty because of the treatment of the Jewish people. I do not know why this is not the number one in the IMDb rankings. Perhaps they show their prejudices against documentary films. Spoiler - we win.
