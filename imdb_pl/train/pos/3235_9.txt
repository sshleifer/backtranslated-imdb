Excellent movie, a realistic image of contemporary Finland, poignant and profound. One of the best films in the history of Finnish. Captures everyday life in a wonderful small town in central Finland, human desires and weaknesses, joys and sorrows. Sure, the early autumn sun creates a cool atmosphere for the study of conscious people in a caring society. Lampela is actually one of the most promising Finnish filmmakers. It shows that you can make engaging videos without the machine guns and bloodshed. His next film "Eila" is also worth a look, although the history of cleaning women fighting for their work is not as universal as the fate of the Joki.
