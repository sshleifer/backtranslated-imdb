I watched this movie every time I got it in the seventies, when it came out on the cable. This was my introduction to Harlem which has fascinated me (and Bill Clinton) since then. I was still very young and the film made a great impression on me. It was great to see a movie about adolescent young girls trying to decide who they want to be and making bad decisions, as well as good ones. I was bewildered by the beauty of Lonette McKee, the wonderful dresses that they finally made, and the joking dialogue. As someone raised by a single mother, I could really identify with these girls and their lives. It's funny, these characters seem more real to me than Beyonce Knowles!
