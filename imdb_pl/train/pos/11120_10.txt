Wow. I LOVED the whole series and I am shocked by the comments of people who thought it was a bad end. Perhaps it moved a little bit in seasons 4 and 5, remaining better than anything else on TV. But 6, and especially 6b, were beautiful permutations of topics developed in the more muscular first three seasons. <br /> <br /> 6B began with such a gloomy mood, and Janice always looked at the anxiety of the family - this lost line about knowing Tony's preference for sitting and watching. Anyone who has missed the implications of this until the end of the series does not know Tony. Melfi's discomfort in connection with psychiatric research and his references to the illusory sentiment of sociopaths for pets and animals goes back to the first episodes of the series, say, Tony's panic attack on ducks leaving his pool and resonates with Phil's "bye" line to his grandchildren before the grace of the last episode (not to get into the dark humor of Chase). <br /> <br /> I could continue and continue, but let me just add that I thought the final show - starting with Vanilla Fudge's initial sounds - would provide an ironic shadow ("You Keep Me Hangin 'On") to the final moments, in which Tony is coming back to complacency with his family in the air or crashing like SUV AJ or Phil's head were completely, totally PERFECT. The best TV in history. <br /> <br /> Pretty good at the dying medium pathologically providing the "fantasy jack-offs" that AJ mocks (and then quickly disappears). Zinc pork cake for Mr. Chase.
