It's a gem, a real piece of Americana for everything it means. If you are yourself programmed to resist the stories of "life-giving life", just stay away and leave the pleasure of others who still believe. What makes the icing on the cake really delicious is that it's based on the true story of rags to wealth, there's no need to choose details that have been changed to create a tight story. Chris Cooper is one of the greatest living actors, and the complex, self-disrupting good results of the main father he portrayed could only be successfully removed by someone with his skills and insight. Simple comments refusing to accept a father who is trying to establish a law, while sensing that he can be out of the way, reveal the limits of the commentator, not the writers or actors. It is not cynical or simple.
