... in our house. Like everyone who commented on this movie, my brothers (at the time 7 and 4 years old) and me (10) watched this movie over and over again. We all loved Star Wars, but we always came back to it because of great songs and adventures. We all loved the camel and sang with him during our songs. There are a few free moments (time spent with King Koo-Koo at his court) and we were generally bored with the Knight song ("The reason why the sound effect is because I love you"), but we loved this trip to save Babbette and the end and everyone was a little scared by the image of the king Koo-Koo floating there, dominating the horizon, laughing maniacally at the end. To this day I am singing "Bravo for me! Babbette of gay Paris! "Around my friends (I'm now 33), who look at me as if I lost my mind; However, when I sing, I am 10 years old and I remember the wonderful year of Star Wars.
