this film is such a moving, amazing work. I saw it in the theater when it came out, but I was only 13 years old and I really did not quite "understand" ... I saw it again when I was 20 (of course on video and now I have it) just blown away. Steven Spielberg has created a great movie that stays in it from beginning to end. I have also read the book, but there is something in the film that animates it. casting, acting, music, costumes, scenery, everything, just wonderful. you laugh, you cry, you cheer ... it brings out all possible emotions. this is one of his best works and should not be missed!
