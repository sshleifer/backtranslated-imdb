As someone born by a German mother and an English father (who spent five years in a POW camp), I come from a unique position. One of the necessity of dealing with various Nazis on one side of the family and the winners of World War II on the other. This miniseries can not delve into any part of Hitler's psyche and must give the viewer a general taste of the situation at the given time and, ideally, as would be possible in Hitler's mind. This series is doing quite well. Carlyle is very good, like O'Toole, but I would like to have more information about relationships with others in the party because Hitler did not do anything by himself. He had people around him who followed him to the letter often without a doubt, and certainly no question in his murderous career. What happened to Goebbels, Goring and Hess's mind? It would be helpful to see more of these relationships. However, I hope that it will make people examine the subject more. It can also make people understand why one can not let someone like Saddam Hussein continue to exercise power.
