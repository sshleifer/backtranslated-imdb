I saw this movie with a group of friends and although only two of us left the cinema thinking how cool it was, the others simply laughed and commented how silly it was. That's because it should not be taken so seriously, it's basically a movie that mocks horror movies and does a damn good job ... It looks like another movie comes out too, umm ... Scary Movie ?? Well, it's Australian and original !!! Jessica Napier has a spectacular performance, and Sarah Kants has a bright future in acting! I hope to see more of them. Molly Ringwald was a good move, and Kylie was an even better move. The Impossible Princess was the queen of the screen !! I recommend seeing this movie because you're guessing the connection to Raffa, Hilary and the movie that never ended 20 years ago.
