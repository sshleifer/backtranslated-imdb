"California" is one of my favorite movies and you can easily call it one of the best psychological thrillers of the 90s. The film has a very stylish surface, but behind it is a lot of disturbing and honest performances of murderous maniacs and terrifying violence that they do to others. One of the strongest aspects of the movie is his performances, Brad Pitt is amazingly great as a psycho-trailer called Early. Pitt flawlessly shows his frightening figure. Juliette Lewis is also playing her naive girl, her innocence is almost groundbreaking. "California" has a very simple thread that goes slowly and slowly for about an hour, but suddenly plunges into a shocking murder when Pitt releases his psychotic personality. There are many shocking scenes, and all this is related to the climactic moment of power that will haunt you for many days. "Califonia" is a film that should really be watched because it intensely looks at how terrible a man can be, not just his violence and gore.
