This is one of those unfortunate movies that have suffered an even more sad, unfortunate death at the box office. I saw this film at the local art cinema, in the form of a rebirth, shortly after it sank into the mainstream cinemas. He certainly deserves to come to him for the second time (or even the third time). Sandra B. crosses the boundaries, doing spoken words and taking into account some well-known songs from this song (her version of Hanka William's "I'm So Lonesome and Could Cry" could easily take you to tears). Perhaps one day the audience will be ready to treat the film a bit more seriously (but not without certain well-arranged laughter). The film moves at a fast pace (thanks to nice editing), thanks to which some viewers will not be bitter and boring. Perhaps the awakening is already in preparation.
