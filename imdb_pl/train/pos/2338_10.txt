Many of these other viewers complain that the plot has already been attempted. It may be so, but adding the narrator and the scenery of Dr.Suess makes this show must be viewed. With adult insinuations in the whole series and a bit of childhood in the set, the show is both reminiscent and invigorating. The investigation part of the series does not attract viewers. Twisted feature and love lines scattered throughout this seeming paradise are what makes the loyal spectators come back for more. It is a success that ABC should never let go. Bravo ABC. LOST was getting old, a way to revive the main time. The 9 episodes preceding writers have lost their importance.
