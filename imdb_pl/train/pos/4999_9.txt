I'm late for this performance - I think it was the third and final episode when we first saw it - and was delighted with the social commentary that was not on American television since "All in the Family." <br /> <br /> He was very surprised that CBS would even start it at all. <br /> <br /> Which is simply a statement that the last time CBS "had a set" - if you know what I mean - returned the day "Everything in the family." The most controversial decision they want to face today is how much makeup to do on Katie Couric. <br /> <br /> If you want a group of people really, very crazy - let them discover the truth about themselves. And if you want them to pull the strings, call and remove a work of art - let them discover this truth by listening to their own words spoken from their own mouths. <br /> <br /> Aardman's people have always been WAY before the curve. And this program is not different. Somehow it crept into the corporate / social / political / censor radio CBS to introduce it to the schedule (maybe "big brass" never really watched it, until it finally emitted?), But when a good "ol middle" heard merika and they saw themselves - well, I can set up a farm whose message or messenger will not last long. <br /> <br /> If only "missing episodes" can find a way to Usenet or bit- torrent ;-) <br /> <br /> Thank you BC Kelly Tallahassee Fla
