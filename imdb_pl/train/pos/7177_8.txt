I was so entertaining throughout this insightful documentary and I waited for a moment to go through pipes (my local video chain) and it was worth waiting. I like a good documentary / special song, but it was definitely honest, honest and nostalgic, if you prefer, look back at the life of teenagers. The child's imagination is fascinating and a great story begins there. Rent or buy it if you like a good, humorous and entertaining documentary. Mr. Stein and his company have definitely come a long way from producing video cameras from the neighborhood, such as bank locks and gay rings that make people gay from one look. Everyone seems to be successful in respectful fields and it was good to know that everyone is still a good friend. The DVD contains several additional teasers for other good documentaries and includes many of Darren's most famous productions, including Crazy News.
