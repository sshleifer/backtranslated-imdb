Sure, the story in this movie was "Hollywood" - but it is far from being the only part of history prescribed for the masses. Lafitte was on the side of the Americans because he considered himself a Frenchman and therefore he hated the British, not because of a sense of patriotism for the people who had recently taken over New Orleans; he broke the agreement and returned to smuggling, which resulted in his sailing to Galveston; he was a more petty criminal and scoundrel than a hero * or * swashbuckler. But who cares? This is one movie that is pure entertainment - and to face all of this, we all wanted Jean to go on a vigorous virgin, not the prince's prudent daughter. Brynner once again rises above the average magazine to give a fascinating performance.
