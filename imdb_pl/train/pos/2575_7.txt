I rented this movie from Netflix for two reasons - I was in the mood for what I thought would be a stupid sci-fi-asco from the 1950s and because it is the first full-length Superman movie. Needless to say, after about 15 minutes I was very involved and very pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> An experimental oil well penetrated about 6 miles deep into the earth and is closed by the sponsor. Lois and Clark appear to get a scoop, but they are disappointed that the deepest well ever made will no longer work. A day later, strange events in the well make the story more appropriate for Superman than Clark Kent. It looks like the radioactive Mole Men have come in from their six-mile home near the Earth's core. <br /> <br /> Supermen and the Mole Men is a simplified but well-made element of socialist realism. Released in 1951, with the participation of the main actor who served in the Second World War, the moral of this story seems to be that the Americans are equally capable of becoming fascists like any other. To bring this point home in a typical Superman way, Reeves even accuses the lynch mob of Mole Men for being "Nazis." does not exist. Six miles of drilling in the continental crust would not penetrate even the upper cloak, let alone the "empty center of the earth" - which in any case does not exist. Excitable - remember that this movie is based on a comic book with a golden age. <br /> <br /> The movie is a bit unevenly aimed. Although Molemen are interesting, somewhat scary and nicely presented, there are several scenes from Korman that spend too much time redundantly, showing us their weird behavior. The script is intelligent and economical. According to today's standards, the costumes are poor to fair, but for their own time the special effects of the film and the costumes were quite good. Cinematography is also generally very good, and acting is much better than one would expect. I was impressed by Reeves, Jeff Corey and Walter Reed.
