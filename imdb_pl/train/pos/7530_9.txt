So you talk about continuing the animation and it's just as good as this one, and for all the same reasons why there's a lot of action in it, the story is good, the voice over the actors is really good, like Kevin Conroy as a batman, Mark Hamil as Joker, etc. Black characters are really good, such as Joker, Two-face, Catwoman, Clayface, etc. So I'm sure you will not be disappointed with the new batman's adventures, because it's really good. So make sure you watch it on TV or rent or buy a collector's collection because it's really good. <br /> <br /> Overall result: ********* with ****** **** <br /> <br /> **** with *****
