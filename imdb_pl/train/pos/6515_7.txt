I almost did not rent it because of all the bad comments, but I did it anyway. I thought it was similar to the darkness that I liked. The only part I hated in the tooth radius were brothers with a red neck at a gas station. They were funny, and the dialogue made me laugh, but it was not a comedy. It ruined a little movie for me because it was unnecessary. The rest of the movie was the way a horror film or suspense movie should be. The makeup was good and I saw far worse films than this one. It was a simple story with credible acting. This is not the scariest or worst movie, but I did not watch it or want a refund. The DVDs were announcements of other movies that look good and check them out.
