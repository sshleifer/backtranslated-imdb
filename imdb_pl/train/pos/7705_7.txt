I've seen it 10 times so there must be something in what I like! <br /> <br /> 50-year-old science-fiction movies were very diverse: they were intelligent and / or provocative or cheap and entertaining cheese. The forbidden planet is a bit of both, but in this rarity for the genre, the color. <br /> <br /> She also had an advantage over the script - although Shakespeare could not recognize him, he was based on his timeless play, and thus guarantee a certain longevity, if it's okay. <br /> <br /> The story of a murderous man id artificially enlarged indefinitely by machines left dead to the race 200,000 years ago. Along the way, the plot is bristling with stereotypes from the 1950s and corn so pure that sometimes you wonder why you watch it, but you always do it. This love triangle ... yuk! Disney animation is still good, and the background of cartoons is straight from Galaxy magazine covers, etc. It looks good even after 50 years. Robbie driving a car through the desert in the distance is hoot! <br /> <br /> In total, with all the disadvantages, the best of its kind and we should be grateful that such immaculate print will survive.
