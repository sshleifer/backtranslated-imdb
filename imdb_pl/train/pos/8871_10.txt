It was a great movie that had many lying problems. He dealt with the problems of the bastard and class. But he also had a message that he knew himself and took responsibility for himself. This movie was very deep and gave you the message that you and only you can control your destiny. It also showed that knowing yourself and the convenience of who you are is the only way you'll ever fit into society. What others think about you is not important. I believe that this movie did a great job. I think the actors were able to wonderfully convey each character. I thought it was amazing how deeply this movie really was. At first glance, you will not see how deep the film is, but with a further look you can see the meaning of the film.
