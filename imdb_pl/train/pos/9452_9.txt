After watching Deliverance, movies like Pulp Fiction do not seem so extreme. Perhaps, according to today's standards of blood and bullets, it does not seem so nervous, but if you think it was 1972, and the movie has a really sinister core, it makes you think differently. <br /> <br /> When I started watching this movie, nothing really seemed unusual until I got to the scene of "Dueling Banjos". This scene shows the brutality and extreme of this film. When I watched Drew (Ronny Cox, Robocop) go head to head with a seemingly young boy, it really shows how sharp these films can be. When you think a kid has a small banjo, which he probably could have done manually, compared to a nice, expensive Drew guitar, you really know how the foursome is from their territory. <br /> <br /> As the story unfolds, it is very reliable and never crosses borders. But what really distinguishes the film, about four businessmen who get more than they expected on a canoe trip, is that director John Boorman (Excalibur) separates all characters from ordinary caricatures and stereotypes. So, when the film goes into horror and tension, I really wanted all four men and what would happen to them. <br /> <br /> Acting is perfectly perfect. With Jon Voight (North Cowboy, Enemy of the State) and Burt Reynolds (Boogie Nights, Striptease) leading a great cast. Jon Voight is probably the hardest thing in this movie, and his transformation from family to warrior is very credible. Unlike Reynolds, whose character is a warrior from the beginning, the Voight character changes during the movie. Ned Beatty (Life) is also extremely helpful in an extremely difficult role, let yourself be raped by hillbilly, while Ronny Cox proves to be credible. that the villains were as terrifying as others I have ever seen. Bill Mckinney and Herbert "Cowboy" Coward were excellent and extremely scary characters from Hillbilly. <br /> <br /> In general, the salvation was excellent and I suggest it to everyone, except for people with weak stomachs and children. 10/10 See this movie.
