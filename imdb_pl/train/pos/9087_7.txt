Saxophonist Ronnie Bowers (Dick Powell) wins a college contract and goes to Hollywood. He stays at the Hollywwod hotel (of course). At the same time, the great selfish star Mona Marshall (Lola Lane) is angry and refuses to take part in the premiere of his new photo. The panic studio employs looking like Virginia (Rosemary Lane) to play her, and Bowers took her to the premiere NOT telling him it was not Marshall. Of course, they fall in love. You can come up with the rest of the story yourself. <br /> <br /> The plot is old (nicely speaking), but Powell and Rosemary Lane make a very nice couple and have beautiful voices. The result is good (underlined by "Hooray for Hollywood"), and director Busby Berkeley presents his unique visuals in a really funny musical sequence (with Edgar Kennedy, who patented slow burn). Also, Glenda Farrell has some fun songs like sister Monas Jones. <br /> <br /> Despite this, the film is not very good. The rest of the furry mugs and most of the humor are simply not fun. Especially Lola Lane is just a bad attempt to play Mony in comedy. There is also racism - a stereotypical black maid is played for laughter, and at some point there is a really frightening racist "humor". Probably most of the time it keeps the TV. I realize that at that time it was accepted, but today it turns out to be rebellious. <br /> <br /> In total, such a movie with some serious problems, which helps a good cast and some great songs. I give him 7.
