This movie was in my collection for a while, but before my friend reminded me of it? until I decided that I should watch it. I did not know much about Close to Leo ?? only that it was supposed to be a great movie from the era and deals with a very serious topic? AIDS. <br /> <br /> Although a person who has help ?? is Leo ?? the script surrounds the way in which Marcel (the youngest brother of Leo) combines with the illness of his relative. At the beginning, everyone is trying to hide the truth from Marcel? is he considered too young to understand his brother's illness? the fact that Leo is also homosexual contributes to the reluctance of parents to discuss the matter with young Marcel. I know from experience that many older people do not want to accept the fact that sometimes even when someone is young, it does not automatically mean that they will not be able to accept reality and act in a more adequate way than even themselves. Except for the fact that the family tried to hide the truth from Marcel, they left a good impression for me? the way they supported their son? even after discovering the truth about his sexuality and illness. The fact that they allowed young Marcel to travel with Leo to Paris to meet his ex-boyfriend was quite a gesture from them? most of the families I know will be reluctant to do so. In the scenes where brothers spend time together, is there much heat? you can see that they are true friends, caring for each other. <br /> <br /> Near Leo is an excellent drama, which I highly recommend
