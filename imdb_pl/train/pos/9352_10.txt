Most people, especially young people, may not understand this film. It looks like a tale of loss when it is a story of loneliness. Some people may never feel loneliness at this level. <br /> <br /> The character Cheadles Johnson reflects the complete opposite of Fineman from the character of Sandlers. Where Johnson felt trapped by his blessings, Fineman tried to forget about his life in the same perspective. Jada is a great addition to the cast, and Sandler sucks tears. Cheadle had a comical role and was a great supporter of Sandler. <br /> <br /> I see Oscars somewhere. Very good movie. If you've ever lost and felt lonely, this movie will assure you that you are not alone. <br /> <br /> Jerry
