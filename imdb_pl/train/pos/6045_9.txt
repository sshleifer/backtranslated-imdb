I was also in the movie, but I do not know if they actually introduced this scene. On the way back from school trip (in 2005) We stopped at the service station at the same time as they were making a movie and we were asked (all of us) to get in and shout Him! Free Bird! We were about 10 years old, or anyone who saw the movie would tell me if this part was actually in the movie, it would be great to know! I remember that I thought that the film never appeared, because another two and a half years passed before it was released. All your comments seem to be good, so I'm guessing it was a pretty good movie, I can buy it, but first I'd like to know if I'm in it! : D Thank you
