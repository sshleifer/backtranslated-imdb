This adaptation of the Pearl S. Buck movie is certainly classic. A real Hollywood epic, it has all the things that have a great Hollywood movie: birth, death, happiness, sadness, joy, despair, etc. There is only one thing that annoys me. I know it was a sign of the times, but none of the two main characters plays Asian actors. Paul Muni was a great actor and performs an admirable job as Wang Lung, the owner of a farm in China. Luise Rainier plays Olana. She does not even look like a Chinese! I think she tried to get a role, but they should take on the role of Anna May Wong. I know why they did not do it, and Mrs. Rainier is very good in the film, but they hardly tried to make her look "real". Even so, it's a great movie, especially if you read a book (I did it in high school, decades ago). This is a must see, just look outside of the casting. I think you can.
