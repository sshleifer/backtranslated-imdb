This is the best of 43 films made by Rainer Werner Fassbinder; at least its success. He was one of the leading directors in New Germany after the Second World War. <br /> <br /> Hanna Schygulla was great because the cold, calculating Maria Bruan, who lost her husband to war, found him after she took the American soldier as a lover, lost him again after he went to jail for her and found him at the end. Her day and half of her marriage, before he disappeared, was longer than their common time at the end. <br /> <br /> That's life. Things come and go, and you do the best you can. You can give up or adjust your way of thinking to survive. Although Maria adapted her thinking and did what she had to do, she never stopped loving Hermann, which makes the end of such a tragedy. <br /> <br /> A perfect drama.
