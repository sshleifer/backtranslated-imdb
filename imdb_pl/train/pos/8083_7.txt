If you have read the books, forget about the characters that Tolkien has built in your head. Representation of hobbits, dwarves, etc. It has been treated as "disney". Dark riders are great, and as I always imagined from books. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is a great movie that combines live motion and animation to get amazing results for the whole year. I just wish (Bakshi) got money to finish his epic. <br /> <br /> It's worth having a video because it will be worth a little after the Lord of the Rings 2001!
