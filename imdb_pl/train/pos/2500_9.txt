... it would probably be the best word to describe this video (in my opinion). except for one great fan service for fan-girls (well, it was unnecessary ~), it was a story that broke me down. hurray for Takahisa Zeze and Gackta! and I know that some people do not agree with me on this matter, but it was not one of the three big actors (guys who played Sho, son and Kei) who gave the best results (for me, anyway). it was Taro Yamamoto, boy # 5 from Battle Royale! <br /> <br /> do not misunderstand me, I like Hyde, I love his voice, but the problem was that some of his scenes were a bit "off", but I loved the scene where he danced with the dead body killing others guys. and Gackt was not that bad either, I preferred his character to be a bit far from the beginning. nothing I can say about my background on Lee-Hom Wang, I will not pretend to know him, but he carried his own weight with a cast of cast stars. <br /> <br /> this movie has paved the way for one of the best collaborations I've ever heard, Orenji No Taiyou (forgive my spelling if you're wrong). while the whole song lasts about nine minutes, you would not notice its length, because you would like to listen to Gackt and Hyde together. <br /> <br /> besides, this movie is a must for fans (huge fan base), but for those who like science fiction, futuristic movies, Asian style.
