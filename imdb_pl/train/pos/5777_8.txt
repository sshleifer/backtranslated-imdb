Meteor falls into the Crater Lake, heat from the impact causes the hatching of the prehistoric egg. <br /> <br /> It's okay, so the plot is just trash. But despite the obvious low budget, this is one of the most thrilling and entertaining monster-on-the-loose movies. There are also good moments of humor. In centuries-old so-called "monsters", which are nothing more than funny creations of men in rubber coveralls or lizards dressed in frills and forced to tear into pieces (cheap style of exploitation), the discovery of this plesiosaur in this little jewel is a great creature Harry ' ego in the style of stop-motion. <br /> <br /> A difficult movie to find, but it's worth finding.
