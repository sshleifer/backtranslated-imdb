Canadian director Vincenzo Natali stormed the artist's house with an intriguing and surprisingly intelligent cube, which is my favorite SF movie of the 90s. This has shaped the basic conceit of a group of strangers who have been trapped in a giant cube-shaped maze, shot entirely on one plane and took over the idea in fascinating directions. <br /> <br /> I was looking forward to Natalia's continuation and although five years elapsed before getting into the next project, I'm glad that it was worth the wait. Cypher is a fascinating exploration of the place of one man in the world and how, through a completely logical chain of events, he finds himself in a situation where he has no influence. <br /> <br /> I do not want to reveal too much about the plot, because one of Cypher's joy is the different ways that turns us around. It's very refreshing these days to see a SF movie that has more than one idea in its head. Cypher is such a movie. <br /> <br /> Morgan Sullivan (Jeremy Northam), one of the innermost people who ever walked the planet, is employed by DigiCorp. They send it to different parts of America to record various seminars. To his surprise they are incredibly boring. Cover subjects as mundane as shaving cream and cheese. <br /> <br /> While Morgan is waiting for one seminar, he meets Rita Foster (impeccably cast Lucy Liu), definition of an ice maiden. He gives him the brush, but there is something he does not like. This is not very surprising considering the dry marriage in which it is located. <br /> <br /> When Rita appears at another Morgan seminar, he tells him that his life is not what he looks like. And I'm not saying anything more about the conspiracy. Doing this would reduce the impact that the rest of the movie has on us, as well as winding paths that are so pleasant to follow. <br /> <br /> As with Cube, Natali shows quite a talent for embracing seemingly ordinary people, pulling them out of the known, and seeing what happens when they are thrown into the unknown. And Cypher does the same. But this is not a copy of Cube. He has his own inspiration. <br /> <br /> Cypher is a film that has more to do with the conspiracy thriller and the story of paranoia. One of the biggest advantages of Cypher is the way these topics go into history without your knowledge. When Morgan realizes that his false identity is a piece of a much larger puzzle, it's just as shocking to us as it is to him. <br /> <br /> One thing that distinguishes Cypher from Cube is how much more refined it is. Where Cube limited himself to a minimalist environment and modest budget with unknowns, Cypher also has a low budget, but Natali saves him as much as he can, allowing him to widen the horizon and run Morgan in an amazing journey through the maze of his own identity. <br /> <br /> Natalia's direction is unique, with a deft hand on the reins. There are several amazing camera angles from the top, such as the enormity of the DigiCorp building as a huge, solid office building combined with a small dot outside Morgana. It seems that the whole color has been bled out of the picture, which perfectly complements the tone of the film as a modern film noir. <br /> <br /> Acting is uniformly perfect. Jeremy Northam is a nice character from her marriage without love to question her own identity. Its performance is excellent because it is so modulated. It seems that it literally changes before our eyes. From a clinical, spine-free mollusc, to a confident man who will do anything to preserve his new identity. <br /> <br /> David Hewlett looks very welcome, who has made such an impact in Cube. He lives in a secret silo that looks like it has been borrowed from men in black. His stage is one of the best because it is an exercise with carefully calculated tension and paranoia. He is a supposed expert in identifying double agents and this is a fantastic piece, brilliantly played by Hewlett. All he needs to do is look at Morgan, and we are drawn into his complex mental game. <br /> <br /> But Lucy Liu is the scene thief here. Too often it is cast in films where its potential is not fully used. But at Cypher, he finally has a character that suits her like a glove. Rita is a reserved, guarded femme fatale, which Liu lives with taste. Each time she appeared, I was up because she was always in control and could reduce the room to silence by virtue of her icy stare. <br /> <br /> Things take a very satisfying end that does not sum up on the ambiguous note the way Cube did it. But Morgan deserves his happy ending. After he was interrogated in this way, I encouraged him in the last scene. This is a perfect ending moment because it is a ray of sunshine after a gloomy 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Cypher is successful in every respect. Addictive, shocking, always fun, it's all that Total Recall wanted to be, but it was not. And this is a refreshing antidote to the overwhelming and inexplicable Matrix. <br /> <br /> Perfect continuation of Natalia. And now I am a devoted fan of this man. Great things!
