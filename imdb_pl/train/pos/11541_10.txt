Matthau and Lemmon are the best in this - everyone else in the film is also great. The dialogue is perfect and very, very witty - and the scene in which Lemmon's character tries to clean the bays in the restaurant, makes me roll on the floor laughing with every time I see it. Anyone who has seen a not-so-great sequel should not be turned away from the original. I recommend this wonderful movie to everyone - I just like it. And the fact that Jack Lemmon plays his character so simply with tragic overtones adds joy to me. These two great boys have made a series of movies with each other, but this one is the best - no doubt.
