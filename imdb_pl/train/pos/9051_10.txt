I watched this when my wife called to ask from another room about my choice of tariff. My comment? "I watch my life!" <br /> <br /> Although younger, but only 5 years or more, "Rocket Boys" remember the absolute urgency with which Sputnick was greeted by our education administrators and how the whole matter of the Science Fair took off and led me and others to a competitive whirlwind. My own tornado went to my own State Science Fair, in physics until 62, although our group was less successful, gaining the support of, for example, firefighters, whom we have asked for advice and advice, after the tragic event, our city went so allowing us to explore the Nike rocket site on the shores of the Chicago lake. <br /> <br /> This movie brought it all back and I bet it brought it all back for a few of us "UberNerds" from the late 1950s and early 1960s. <br /> <br /> We are now in a similar period of brain drain and we really need this movie as a country. Look at this!
