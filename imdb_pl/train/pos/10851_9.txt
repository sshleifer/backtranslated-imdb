I found that "Still Crazy" is extremely funny and not only for those of us who survived this noisy era of rock from the late 60s and early 70s. My 15-year-old daughter watches her with me every time I take out a DVD (do not worry, it's only three times) and she loves it too. <br /> <br /> It is a really loving, poignant and funny nod to the era, and every actor perfectly hits his notes. This was my first introduction to Bill Nighy and I'm happy that his somewhat similar phrase in "Love Actually" brought him more attention. Bruce Robinson was as amazing as Brian, bringing real life into something that could be a caricature of a drug-induced stereotype. It was interesting that Robinson gained fame as a writer. <br/> <br /> I live in Sherman Oaks, California and after watching the movie for the first time I ran into Billy Connolly's local shopping mall (he lived at the time) and told him that this is one of my five favorite movies of the universe time. He invited me to sit with him in the grocery court and for a time we discussed the film. We even talked about the idea of ​​an America-oriented remake before I rejected it wisely. Why mess with the original? <br /> <br /> My only problem with "Still Crazy" is that it was not very popular in cinemas, and too many people did not experience great experience.
