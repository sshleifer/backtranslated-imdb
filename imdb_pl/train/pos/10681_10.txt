While the British produced fun and lovely sitcoms in the 90s - Ab Fab, Men behaving badly, One Foot in the Grave, etc. - the '70s were a real golden age. <br /> <br /> In the 1970s, entire new territories to explore, including sexual revolution, feminism and a slowly growing awareness of the need for "sensitivity", which twenty years later will become a political correctness. Attempts to deal with the confusion of this completely modern world are subtle and not very subtle topics in everything, from the Sketches of Monty Python's Flying Circus to the comedy series, such as The Man of the House. (At the end of the 1970s this grappling resulted in more meditative and bitter-sweet series, such as the Butterflies masterpiece.) Man About the House is a perfect example of the good Britcoms of the time - slightly refined, insolent, fresh, resourceful, sometimes outrageous, with some well-made observations about modern life. Compare this with a cynical show from the 90s, such as Ab Fab, and it's hard to believe that both were made in the same country. <br /> <br /> The man at home is one of the great Britcoms of the '70s, the truth is with Good Neighbors (The Good Life), and About the House's spin off George and Mildred. Its quality is evidenced by the fact that - similarly to Good Neighbors - its creators, writers and many of them have been successful on British television.
