I remember seeing it when I was seven or eight. I had to find the character rounds because it left an impression in my mind that lasted long after the movie ended. And end, now sad, well ... for a 7-8 year-old child. <br /> <br /> I had the opportunity to see this movie recently and I discovered that the plot is too simple, character, two-dimensional ... I think it is a kind of movie that can only be with the innocence of a small child ... It's a pity ... . <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to all parents of small children ... (I saw it in the original French version, so I can not say if the translation is good or not.)
