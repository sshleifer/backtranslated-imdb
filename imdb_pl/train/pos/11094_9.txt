This smooth and rough film consistently provides. This is one of Frankenheimer's best and most underrated films and it is easy to be the best Elton Leonard adaptation to date (and if you scratch your head thinking "but I loved GET SHORTY", you must be hit in the face). In my opinion, no one reflects Leonardo's "sensation" better than John Glover in 52 PICK-UP. Moving the plot from Detroit (novel) to Hollywood (movie) raises the plot ratio to incredible heights. Be a man, drink a few beers and watch this movie. For reference purposes, my favorite Leonardo books are: Swag, Rum Punch, Cat Chaser, City Primeval and 52 Pick-Up. My favorite Frankenheimer movies are SECONDS and THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE. I also have a special place in my cold, movie heart for DEAD BANG and BLACK Sunday.
