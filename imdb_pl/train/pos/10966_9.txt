Gray Gardens is a world in itself. Edith and Little Edie live in almost complete isolation, eating ice cream and liver pate in makeshift kitchen in their (apparently) shared bedroom. Cats lazily, while Edith's mother insults her daughter's elocation. This is the art of Tennessee Williams, which comes alive and should inspire screenwriters and playwrights because the bizarre and overlapping dialogue is 100% real. <br /> <br /> The situation at home reminds me exactly how my grandmother and her 50-year-old daughter lived for a decade (except that they were poor and clean). They fought all day, Grandma talks about her perfect past, while her daughter continually blames her for lost opportunities with men, work and express herself. <br /> <br /> This film is mandatory for anyone who writes a mother-daughter relationship of this kind. It's sad and voyeuristic, but the filmmakers have done an amazing job, making Edie feel comfortable enough to so carelessly unmask. It is rare to see real life this way, and the more unique, considering the context - the remains of a powerful family disappearing in nothingness in the skeleton of their own residence.
