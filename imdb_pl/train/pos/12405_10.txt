I caught this movie about 1990 on video by accident and not knowing what I mean. Many horror fans may have missed the idea that it was a typical prison movie, and those who did it did not like it because it was not what they wanted to see. The above factors are probably the reason for the low rating, but just ignore it and give it a vortex if you're a fan of this genre. <br /> <br /> He has strengths in all departments from the script and atmosphere to action and the prison itself. <br /> <br /> An absolute diamond, a movie that I still have on video today. Check it out.
