I just got to the thirteenth when I saw this series for the first time and watch it again on DVD, over thirty years later. Pictures over the initials never left me. It influenced my view of the world and the peoples in it. My parents were with me long enough to see the series with me, and then we always discussed the program. It gave me the love to study history and the highest grades I got in the public exams of our school! <br /> <br /> The voice and the portion of Sir Laurence Olivier are timeless and perfect. I have the impression that people who survived would feel that this is their version of the history of the Second World War. I can not imagine that I would be bored looking at it. Perhaps a similar series from the Cold War period could now be considered, though it would be difficult to imagine who could replace Sir Laurence. <br /> <br /> Buy!
