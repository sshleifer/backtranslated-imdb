I love full house so much that I could not live without full house. Why did it end? It annoys many fans. Can we have Full House II? Come on! But it's better that we have the DVDs that will help us. But I need the real ones to come up with a new episode. Love, warmth fills the house! All characters are very cute and handsome! Candace Cameron, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, Jodie Sweetin, Bob Saget, Dave Coulier and John Stamos, loooooooove you! DJ, Michelle, Stephanie, Danny, Joey and Jesse please come back to the screen please! How is Michelle after falling from a horse? How are Nicky and Alex? Is Joey alone or has a wife, or at least a girlfriend? Do you still live in the same house? I want to continue living a full home! and please, do not upset me!
