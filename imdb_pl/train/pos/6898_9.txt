It is a film with a pinch of salt from the very beginning with a teacher who ridicules everything French and then produces a rather na√Øve, but very brave hero in Fanfan La Tulipe. Presented by the wonderful Gerard Philippe, this cheerful young man believes completely in the fate of contoured Lollobrigid - especially since he will marry the daughter of King Louis XV! The problem is that La Lollo soon discovers that she is also in love with Fanfan ... <br /> <br /> Driven by good sword fights, cavalcades and other thrilling action sequences, the film moves at a fast pace and many comics moments. Direction is probably the weakest aspect, but the film is so light and does not take it so seriously that I could not give these shortcomings a second thought. Look out for Noel Roquevert, a traditional heavy French film trying to steal La Lollo, making life miserable and giving the script to the fortune teller who reads La Lollo's hand! And what a jewel Marcel Herrand is a megalomaniac and desired by King Louis XV! That's not all: so many beautiful women in one film tell me to be in France and on set in 1952! The film may have appeared this year, but its verse, cheek, excellent narration, immaculate photography and unforgettable Gerard Philippe ensure that it remains modern and pleasant to watch. I would not hesitate to recommend it to my grandchildren, not to mention who loves movies in general, especially movie lovers! Look at this!
