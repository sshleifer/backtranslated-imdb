I started watching this movie, which did not expect anything, just another movie to watch, but from the first twenty minutes the graphics and the main character, who is enigmatic, does not speak much, really got me to this movie. <br /> <br /> I really liked this movie, it was dark, beautifully preserved and really moving. It's a bit slow, but the immersion was complete. The direction was amazing, allowing us to get fragments of it, leading to conviction of Joey and his life behind the bars. The music was really great and well integrated into the scenes. The ending was unexpected with a surprise I had not seen. This is not a movie that we often watch.
