I caught some of this concert on public television and I knew I had to have it. The boys give everyone in Royal Albert a great, often exciting spectacle, complete in every respect. Also clean - without a synthesizer, without lasers and stroboscopes covered with smoke, without a great entrance (and astonished, serious and appreciative audience, all of whom left the rockets at home). <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Cream (or if you've only heard of them); if you're a fan of blues; if you're a rock'n'roll fan; you will not be disappointed by watching and listening to this DVD. You will never lose this DVD because you will never lend it to anyone. (This DVD justifies selfishness, tell them to take their own!) It's too good and too repetitive; you will want to keep it at your fingertips.
