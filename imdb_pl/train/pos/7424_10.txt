I was 16 when I saw this movie for the first time and it was always my favorite movie. Of course you can not deny the attractiveness of Kristofferson in the film - HOW IT WORKS FINE TO ???????????? Hell. He is still here. He is a bad boy who every woman wants secretly. His acting is impeccable. He played a drunker / drug addict only in a way that someone who really went through it, he could - and he had - in 76 finally got into the wagon, so everything was very real. <br /> <br /> Music is WONDERFUL and although in later years I thought that Streisand is not the right person for him in the sense of physical beauty, I think it is more a problem for viewers than women. We girls are looking at Kris - and of course, guys are looking at women's interests - my husband can not watch the movie, b / c her - he does not like her appearance. But I made him sit all over the Ferrari scene at the end of the road to see how well he did - the camera was so perfect, and you were in the car with the music - you should see him on my 50-inch plasma - WOW !!!! And finally, the quality of the transfer was GREAT - anamorphic panoramic and really clean, with excellent color and very low noise, except for dark areas, which is normal for all movies. > <br /> I came back to my mother's wonderful memories and I love this movie together, I bought her a copy for Christmas. I'd like to watch her with her last night. <br /> <br /> I tried to change to the original from Judy Garland, but I think that seeing the first one, I just can not enter the previous era. Watching all the concert recordings in the '76 version was so similar to the one in which I lived. <br /> <br /> I'm working on a Streisand commentary, but it seems that she only talks about herself and hers, so far she barely mentioned Kris or the details about the scenes in the film. Her voice sounds EXACTLY the same as it was then. <br /> <br /> Check it out if you grew up in the same age as me (born in 1960), you will love it. <br /> <br /> Wendy
