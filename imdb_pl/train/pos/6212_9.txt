I really like this movie, although it seems intentionally less "polished" than other Fred and Ginger movies, not to mention the somewhat problematic Harriet Hillard cast in the romantic role. <br /> <br /> Once again, these films have little consequence - Astaire plays a rather unlikely sailor (who turned out to be a brilliant former hoofer (of course!)) and Rogers an aspiring performer in a dingy dance music room. Although their relationship is clear and pleasant to watch, they are stuck in the unconnected main story of Hilliard and Randolph Scott, who fail to find any chemistry between them. <br /> <br /> Although it was a last-minute decision, Hilliard was quite inept because he did not have a screen presence to give the film what he needed, despite being sweet and pleasant. The film could have benefited from promoting Lucille Ball's wise, global character for a bigger role, because it just shone in every little scene and would make a great side-kick for Roger Broderick for Rogers in this kind of bright film (See "Stage Door" made next year , for example, great scenes between these two fantastic actresses). That the one-dimensional figure of Neanderthal Scott finally falls in love with Hillilly, is even harder to believe than Astaire in the Navy! <br /> <br /> Now for an important part, singing and dancing: Nothing more can be said about "Let's Face the Music and Dance" except that it is brilliant and moving, perfectly made and I often end up watching the scene with tears in eyes. However, other songs in the film deserve recognition; "I put all my eggs in one basket" is a beautiful example of Astaire and Rogers' comedic instincts and almost derides their reputation for spontaneous, perfectly synchronized dance. Other attractions include "Rather Lead the Band" and "Let Yourself Go", which show how these two talents can perform just as well as together. I almost forgot to mention that this is one of the few (if not the only) time in which Astaire plays the piano well; It seems that the talents of this man were endless! <br /> <br /> In general, I prefer it to "Top Hat" and "Swing Time" (though only just), because it's more down-to-earth and enthusiastically performed by everyone involved, it's hard not to like the fun factor.
