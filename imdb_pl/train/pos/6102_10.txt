I had to give this movie 10 simply because it did it like many films cast on a black audience did NOT DANGER. This movie was devoid of all the stereotypes about video whores, and also skipped gangsters, rappers and vulgar language. Several relationships between physicians, African Americans and African American men / women have been examined at a completely new and refreshing level. I was very impressed with the films that carefully combined humor with my head with some rather difficult and difficult problems. The film will make you feel happy and sad at the same time. I also saw it at the Boston Film Festival. The premiere took place at AMC Loews Boston and I hope that this film will reach a much larger audience. Black People (and EVERYONE else) LOVES such a movie - if only the industry is SMART enough to put it there! <br /> <br /> As an additional - if your doctor, resident, medical student, premedical student, married doctor, having a doctor's sibling, having a doctor in the family or having a great doctoral period - they would also love this film. He presented residency and practice in a realistic way, which was very much appreciated by doctors, residents and medical students who watched the film. Dennis Cooper completely resigned from his stay in internal medicine, so he definitely applied his knowledge / experience to the film and it is very visible.
