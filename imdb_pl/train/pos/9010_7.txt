A bit bizarre and bordering on bad taste; but smart enough to be worth watching. A young woman associated with a wheelchair Jane Hatchard (Helena Bonham Carter) works with reluctant guardian Richard (Kenneth Branagh). Richard is an artist who dreams of a human flight. He builds an airplane in his garage and intends to fly it. He wants to resurrect his own restless life, taking care of the independent, dying Jane, who suffers from a neurological disease that left only her silent and very small motor skills. In a wheelchair and full of spirit, her last desire is to lose her virginity. He offers to Richard, who will not help her directly; but he is willing to rob the bank to pay gigolo to do the deed. This film was ambitious and humorous for me. Even in this role Carter has a certain charisma and sympathy.
