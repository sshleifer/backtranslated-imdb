In this fun, cheesy copy of "Death Wish" there is an exceptionally beautiful and well-endowed brunette, the highest kari Mani as Billie Clark, an outstanding martial artist and one woman destroying the crew who opens a gigantic drum with a capacity of ten gallons of cruel chopsots whup-a ** on various mindless bandits, rapists, drug dealers and street gang members after some nasty criminals attack her beloved grandparents. Stunningly sensual Mrs. Mani plunges her teeth into her pugnacious, stamping, hard part of a hatchling with a generous, courageous crowd, beating unequal guys with infectious joy and exposing the burning of a hot body in several completely free but very prized naked scenes. Unfortunately, Mani has an extremely irritating rough and grating voice, which is a pure murder on my ears (my favorite moment about the questionable Mani's delivery of her dialogue is the moment when he jokes: "Do not mess with girls in the park, nice!" After sieging a few disgusting Karin's only later film role was "Avenging Angel", in which he does a really stunning full-length nude scene, but there are no lines.) The movie is the single most sensational dingy sequence that appears when Mani is briefly imprisoned for contempt for court fees and shows her significant things in the group scene in the shower. Of course, a lusty lesbian friend from Mani tries to seduce her only so that her unwanted progress will be rejected by a heavy blow! Oddly enough, a lesbian forgives Mani and becomes her best friend when he's behind bars. Given the extra galvanization in Edward Victor's vigorously rough shoulder, dynamic direction, funky-rocking result, captivatingly meager behavior in the game (if lame) cast, constant lively pace, numerous pulling out everything - stop fascinating battle scenes, and Howard's fragile photography Anderson III, this amazingly enjoyable arcade game is essential to watch for die-hard fans of a carefree, low-budget junk grindhouse cinema.
