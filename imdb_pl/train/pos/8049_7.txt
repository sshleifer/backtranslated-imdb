Overall, I have to say that I liked the movie. Some fighting scenes are really good. Especially the fight with Leung Ka-Yan. One of the things that really bothered me was the fact that they used the Asian to play the Negro. I mean really. Talk about bad taste. During the battle scene, one of the fighters on the floor laughs. Otherwise, Sammo copies perfectly the movements of Bruce Lee's fight. 5 out of 10 stars.
