This is a great series for watching the family. We gather around the TV to watch it on BBC America. This is the current version of Robin Hood, which appeals to children and adults. Our teenager and tween-ager like to sit with mum and dad and watch Robin's new exploits. We can not wait for the next episode to be broadcasted every week and we are happy to see "On Demand" free of charge. <br /> <br /> The wardrobe is in the current style. In every story there is a moral. That's funny. Violence is not too high or unnecessary. The soundtrack is absolutely fantastic with the sense of John William. It is an old story about a world that comes alive again thanks to new world talent. <br /> <br /> There is so much rubbish on television that the "reality" is rotting in the brains of the brain to meaningless violence. You should take it for what it is and this is an updated "Robin Hood" that can not be compared to the film exploits of Errol Flynn. It is a jewel that everyone can use. Parents who are afraid that their children will be watching too much violence will be pleased that Robin has lost his taste for war and bloodshed. He is Robin Hood, who would rather try to break free from contention than fight. Marian maid is also an attractive model for young girls. Instead of standing and doing nothing, he takes his part in helping the poor, being the "Night Watchman". The Sheriff of Nottingham is deliciously spoiled, just like the Sheriff should be and looks like Billy Joel and Tim Curry. Guy Gisborne is played by an extremely handsome actor who makes most women want him not to portray the role of a bad guy. <br /> <br /> The only question we have is: "Where is Brother Tuck?"
