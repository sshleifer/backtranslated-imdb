This is an early movie "Pilot" for the popular Canadian television program Trailer Park Boys. It was recreated for management in several networks before Showcase decided to register them in a television series. Great acting and very funny cast make it one of the best iconic comedy movies. The plot of the film tells you that these two petty criminals were circulating after "exterminating" domestic animals for money. If you have a dog next to you that's barking all night, these are the guys you go to! But they get into trouble when they encounter too much work to deal with it and end up in the shooting. Watch this video if you want to understand the beginning of the series. I highly recommend! <br /> <br /> I've rated R for swearing, violence and drug use. <br /> <br /> It is not too offensive (they do not actually show killing animals)
