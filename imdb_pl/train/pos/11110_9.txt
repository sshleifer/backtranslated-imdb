I can not add an awful lot to the positive reviews already present - great acting, balanced writing, multi-faceted characters, a great antihero in Tony, a great commentary to the thousand-year American life. The integral use of psychiatry combined with the problems of Tony's mother are especially fresh and fun. Several other characters add a lot of depth - the interesting story of Hesh as an outsider in which you can meet, Ralphi's total irresponsibility, Chris's double wishes in life and so on. <br /> <br /> I have to delve into some critics, however, especially "glorifies violence / detracts Italian-American". Most writers and actors are Italian-American, will they attack themselves? There are several positive Italian-American figures - chef Artie Bucco, Dr. Melfi and her family, and Cusamanos next to Soprano. Indeed, ex-husband Dr Melfi notes in season 1 that only a small proportion of Americans of Italian origin have ever had Mob connections (certainly smaller than the percentage of African Americans involved in crime, I dare say it.) In both cases, poverty and lack of opportunity are the biggest causes). <br /> <br /> Most heroes do not really choose life; family origin or circumstances largely cover them. Third parties (even Italian) who try to integrate with him usually face bad ends - Matthew and his friend, for example, in Season 2. If you criticize this program, I assume that Frasier made you want to become a psychiatrist, Will & Grace made you want to go homosexual? You probably do not listen to rap music, which discusses gangs, or r'n'b, which discusses promiscuity, or rock music that discusses drugs (or any other combination)? People are not as stupid as some of you ... <br /> <br /> However, not everything is perfect. Many characters appeared only once, with all logic should be seen or at least mentioned in previous episodes - Tracee dancer, friend of Meadow Ally, friend of Uncle Junior (apparently for 20 years, until they split up in season 1).
