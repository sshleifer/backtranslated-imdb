I thought it was one of the best movies I've seen for a long time. It was a great story and showed that people are so complicated in different ways. I have recommended it to all my friends !! I always like a good story and this movie was one of the best I've seen in a long time. I saw how I have a daughter and I do the same as Natalie to learn more about her life and love. He showed us how not only do we live with our families; but also parts of our lives that we do not share with them - because it may not be in their best interest to know all the details of the things we do not do, of which we are so proud. /> I am looking forward to another such a movie and I will not look around.
