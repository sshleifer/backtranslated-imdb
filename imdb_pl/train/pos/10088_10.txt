Elephant Walk (1954). Early Piotr Finch appears as a lord of the court in some godforsaken plantation, where there is always the danger of elephants or crazy Englishmen staying in the midday sun and raging. Well, in the end they do it, of course, after the typhoid or cholera blast, and there is a lot of chaos. Taylor replaced the sick Vivien Leigh in this boiler / adventure. When the elephants storm the house and trap Liz on the big stairs, I still get goose bumps. Thank God Dana Andrews is nearby to save the day. One of my favorite pleasures. In color too!
