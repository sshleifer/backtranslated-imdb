I just finished the Cronicles of the Heroic Knight just a few minutes ago, I find myself extremely contented, but the questions still surround me. Although it seems that the first 7 episodes are in fact a repetition of the events of the first Record of Lodoss War, the truth is that they are not really. It seems that the creator of CotHK had a different vision of how the original ended (and this may be the reason for the first 7 episodes to appear), but I do not think so. CotHK claims that it begins 5 years after the War of the Heroes, to which Parn was part. It seems to me that the director made the first 5 episodes very similar to the summary of the original, to give the viewer a small reminder and introduction to the character and their deeds, because they appear much less after the series in Spark history. Now, when the series starts operating in the Spark part, we are expelled for the next 10 years (15 years since the War of the Heroes). Spark and his crew, in some cases, resemble Parn and his crew when the journey begins, especially the love story that is brewed between Spark and Neese. I also thought several times in CotHK that I threw the original series and if it was not for Spark's long blue hair, I know I would have pressed the stop more than once to make sure the correct disc is inserted. let's consider these serious failures, but the writers have done a great job in creating credible characters and an extraordinary plot. The only thing that hurts is the return of Ashram and Wagnard. Ummmm ... how ?? Do not get me wrong, they are both great villains, although the only feature of the Ashram is that it supports Marmo. Perhaps I missed something during a thick series that explained this part. When it comes to sequels, I recommend CotHK. I put both CotHK and, even more so, the original Record of Lodoss War far above the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Both are more epic than anything I've ever seen or read. I highly recommend it.
