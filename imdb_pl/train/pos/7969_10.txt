Homeward Bound is a beautiful movie. You know where Shadow falls in the ditch ... what, * I cried *, considering I was only six years old, I was crying! cries a lot! Dogs and cats are perfectly trained. A nice family movie, * not * for completely hardened, non-fluffy people or hate animals, but for people like me.
