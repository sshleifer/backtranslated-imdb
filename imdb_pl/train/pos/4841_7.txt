We are not very familiar with Arthur Askey in the colonies, so I almost missed this movie (which had a recent announcement of TCM) because of the negative comments here about his appearance in the "Ghost Train" - which I expected to be completely annoying. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised when I heard laughter. The physical aspects of Askey's comedy and his time, when we give the line, suggest what would happen if Charlie Chaplin and Woody Allen had a child. There is no comparison to Bud Abbott or any of the other regular suppliers of comic relief who appear in the movies of this genre. What's more, you can feel the thread connecting Askey with the British comedy 30 years later; at least from the American point of view, it is clear that he has more in common with Monty Python's corpse than with any of its counterparts here. As for the rest of the movie - the more movies you've seen, the more likely you guess the end, but it's still quite fun and atmospheric and worth waiting for his next performance.
