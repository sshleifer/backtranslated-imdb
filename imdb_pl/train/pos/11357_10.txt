"Citizen X" is a truly told true story of hunting for one of the worst serial killers in history. What makes this story even more attractive is the place and time of its occurrence; Soviet Union in the 80s. <br /> <br /> ** ≈Åagodne Spoilery ** <br /> <br /> Wiktor Burakow (greatly played by Stephen Re) is a newly promoted criminal investigator for the Rostov regional militia. He discovers past and present unsolved murders, apparently by the same person. Murders are unresolved because no one has ever bothered to investigate evidence properly. He is forced to find and detain the killer. His only tools are his dedication, skills and honesty. Its obstacles are the corruption and political ideology of the Soviet system, which discourages the search for the truth. His naivety would have led to a defeat if it were not for his boss, Col. Mikhail Fetisov (Donald Sutherland). Fetisov is a politically clever cynic who understands the game and knows how to deal with the Soviet bureaucracy. However, he also shares Burakov's desire to bring the murderer to justice, even if the official party line is: "There are no serial killers in the Soviet Union!" <br /> <br /> The cast is outstanding. Locations and sets are excellent recreations of Soviet life on the last day. The result of Randy Edelman is particularly good. <br /> <br /> More importantly, this film shows a dark and disturbing criminal phenomenon, both intense and thrilling. It was a film made to order by HBO Films and became a great source of movies that would otherwise never have been made.
