SPOILERS This is a thrilling movie about griffons. But who turns anyone here? When does the hunter change into prey? This rough, dark film is slow and seductive. It draws you in and pulls you down the proverbial garden path, just to kill you, just as you think you are safe. <br /> <br /> Has a riveting script, with good performance (at least from leads). I did not notice the background music, but it was never shocking, so it had to be done well. <br /> <br /> I was very surprised that I liked this movie because I usually do not choose this genre, but he pulled me in and held it to the end.
