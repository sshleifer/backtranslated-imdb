I saw this movie on the cable for the first time about 5 years ago and I could not stop laughing. Everything in the film seemed to be clicking, plot, characters, setting. As for the movie, I would not call it a great movie, but what's supposed to be is fantastic. It matters. The cast can be as good as any other in a comedy movie. Corben Berbson, Fred Gwynne, Ruben Blades and Ed O'Neil are hilarious. For those who have not seen it, I will give you a brief summary: Four criminals meet in a small town in Montana after receiving a letter from a friend about a bank robbery. However, when their friend is arrested by two cops who chased him from New Jersey, they try to find out what's going on and hell breaks loose. The film is really a great comedy of whims and is a bit like the Oceans Eleven version for poor men, only four criminals who can not stand each other, and in Montana instead of Las Vegas. All in all, if I like to laugh, I strongly encourage you to watch this movie.
