I must admit that this movie touched me to the point that I burst into tears. However, I always think twice about things, and instead of writing a praise that defines a film as impeccable and impeccable, I prefer to take a risk of a closer look. <br /> <br /> First, the movie: an undeniable effect on the viewer simply because it starts and continues as a slow-motion movie that does not try to break away from the real scenes of September 11. Thumbs for this genius, because in contrast to WORLD TRADING CENTER Stone, this film fortunately does not focus on the attack itself, but on the precipitation, which, like the falling nuclear explosion, is hardly visible, but dangerous and destructive. The psychological impact, the devastation caused by the events of September 11 and the devastation he caused Americans, is almost palpable in this film. I think Binder was able to closely observe American society after September 11, and Sandler, in my opinion, the sky shot from the average comedian to the real talent that provides an Oscar-winning performance. <br /> <br /> However: In the film BLOOD DIAMOND, the character Di Caprio says and quote: "Ah, these Americans. I always want to take their feelings into account. " Now I do not want to belittle their suffering, but I would definitely like to make a comparison. From September 11, the whole world is confronted with memorabilia, monuments and celebrations on September 11. Hollywood industry and writers such as Safran Foer refer to their work from September 11. Now, this huge amount of cultural products, dealing with September 11, turns the deaths of 3,000 people into the greatest tragedy of this young age. The number of books written on this topic and the number of films directed on this subject and I say this with all due respect, I question the importance of this cruel crime somewhat disproportionately. <br /> <br /> Fact: People die every day because of unjust actions and terrible crimes committed by people who are bad or simply lost. We are waging war in Iraq, Afghanistan, Burma and many other countries. Every day we forget about the poverty that African people suffer from, and we tend to empathize with them to a lesser extent than with the American victims of September 11, simply because they are black and because their lives do not have much in common with our western life. Africa has no money or potential to commemorate its national tragedies in the way America can. What I am saying is: the reason why we feel more like the 3,000 victims of September 11 and their families is that we are constantly reminded of September 11. There is no day without a press article, movie or book that will be discussed on September 11. <br /> <br /> In conclusion: I felt sorry for Charlie Fineman, but I was not sure if I had the right to feel more to him than to Hutu, who lost his entire family in the Rwandan civil war. <br /> <br /> Do you catch my savings?
