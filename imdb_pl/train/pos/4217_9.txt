It is always satisfying when the detective closes the case and the criminal is taken to the book. In this case, the culmination gives me even more pleasure. To see how the smug smile wiped the face of Abigail Mitchell, when she realized that her victim had left the "testimony of death", which leaves no doubt about her guilt, is very satisfying. <br /> <br /> Please understand: while admiring Ruth Gordon's performance, really her character * really annoys me. It is selfish and demanding. He gets his own way by inserting the simple act of a "little girl" who is embarrassing for a woman of her age. Worse, she has now become a judge, a jury, and an executioner against her deceased's husband. <br /> <br /> When Columbo approaches too close, he tries to upset him, manipulating him so he makes the cuff a speech to the audience of high-class ladies. Perfectly turns the tables, giving a very warm and human speech about the realities of police work. <br /> <br /> Nothing can distract Columbo from seeking justice. Abby's final appeal to his good nature is rejected because he has too much self-respect to not do his job well. Here's one situation where you can not get away with Mrs. Mitchell!
