NYC, 2022: The greenhouse effect, the oceans have disappeared, crushing unemployment and the scarcity of water, energy and food ... and the number of residents in New York has exceeded 40 million. This is a small jewel of the image, not only because the future depleted in resources is a reality for us citizens of the 21st century. <br /> <br /> The low budgets opening the titles of this movie are great: a music set, a low-tech "slide-slide" sequence composed only of archival photos from the beginning of photography until 1973, presents unpolluted American pastoral care developing in a contaminated and crowded hell in less than 2 minutes. Concise and unambiguous, it is truly unforgettable. Budgetary constraints also stand behind quite unimaginable cinematography and other constraints, which is contrary to the ingenious assumption of the plot. Sequences at the police station are like the episode of a television detective series from the 1970s, and the other sets of interiors look simple at best. The budget has probably tried to "futuralize" the "Chelsea West" apartment of Soylent Executive with the most modern gadgets, which means that other costumes are cursory, some shots are bizarrely insufficiently filled and the daily surfaces apparently all shot by a smoke filter. <br /> <br /> A memorable scene in which Sol and Thorn (Charlton Heston) share a meal with expensive and rare dishes carefully summarizing their society: they enjoy real bourbon, lettuce, celery, tomato, apple and beef, and really we feel their vulgar recognition of someone's prosperous privileges. <br /> <br /> The key scene of Robinson's death, in which his character is willingly euthanized in a place called "Home", presents him immersed in images of beauty once a flora and fauna, as he remembered them, beautifully contrasted with the jaundice Thorn realizing, that the future went bankrupt, including horrors. <br /> <br /> This is one intelligent movie and its basic message is just as important today as it was in the early 70's. Yes, I know we are not eating the dead yet, but because of our longevity associated with resource depletion, the growing gap in poverty, global corporate capitalism and the uncontrolled destruction of habitats leading to climate change, sustainable Soylent Green forecasts can come true.
