In Iran, women are not allowed to play football. Officially, this is because the vulgar language and the behavior of the male audience are to be spared. But of course it's about sexism. Women are the lower forms of people. <br /> <br /> Some brave girls are opposed to this and try to get to the stadium using various tricks. They are caught by soldiers and kept in a cage until the police come and pick them up. <br /> <br /> Despite the crazy situation, it is a movie with a lot of humor. It is also encouraging how people always find different ways to combat oppression. You will be moved at the same time as you have a lot of laughter. Good work of director Jafar Panahi. It is a heroic comedy in many respects.
