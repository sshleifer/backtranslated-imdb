Everyone should see this movie! It's terrifying, it's scary, but it does not resort to lame things, "jump out of you-just-to-surprise-you-and-not-scary." It's really great. See this amazing amazing movie !!! The director is Stanley Kubrick, easily the greatest director who ever lived. Each of his films are masterpieces, including this one. Shining tells the story of a family who goes to a Colorado Rockies hotel as a winter caretaker and falls into the snow. Well, the house is haunted. The kid is psychic. Husband is easily affected by bad haunted hotels and ... well ... HILARITY ENSUES !!!! Not quite. It becomes a thrilling thriller, in which things are thrown at the viewer from all sides and done terribly. Not just the classic scene of "Here's Johnny". It is unforgettable, but it can not speak for whole movies. It's one of those things where words do not explain it in the right way, and you just have to see it. So go to Netflix and get it! GEEEEEETTTTTTTT ITTTTTTTT !!!!!!!
