I think it is a great example of the differences between two cultures. It would be a great movie to show in the sociology class. I thought it was quite fun and I have to say that I'm a sucker of this feature device "Let me connect and get a job". It seems that most people do not realize that this movie is not just a comedy. It also has some dramatic elements and I think they blend in nicely. In general, I give it a solid value 8.
