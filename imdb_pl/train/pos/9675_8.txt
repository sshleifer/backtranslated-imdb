Most people can say that if you spend a Saturday night watching a movie, you have to really get bored. Actually, I came home after leaving the house and turned on the TV, and there was "Paulie." <br /> <br /> I missed the initial credits, so I did not know his name, but I saw that he has Cheech Marin, so naturally I thought I'd tuned in to "Born In East LA" When I saw him talking to the talking parrot , I was ready to reject it as a kind of film on the flop, which show late at night. <br /> <br /> It's nice to say that it was better. As you know, if you have not done it yet, Paulie is lost and tries to get back to her original owner. It looks like it took years to find her. What should be Pauli's advantage is actually an inconvenience. People meet a parrot who can read, and everything they see is a way to earn money or benefit from it. <br /> <br /> While the character of Cheech Marina "earns him", he is not malicious to him. Dance sequences with parrots are adorable for children, I find them funny. <br /> <br /> Paulie, who is naive, "he quickly learns that not all people are nice people. Especially the owner of the animal research laboratory. The man lies to him, saying that he will help him find the owner, if he helps in research on communication with animals. Paulie got stuck but decides to fool around with this man during a demonstration for others about Pauli's vocal abilities. <br /> <br /> Throughout the movie, Paulie tells her story of the janitor of objects, which finally releases him, some other animals and finding the location of Pauli's owner. This is a touching meeting. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10, the stage of trimming the wings should be put on and not shown. This part may disturb younger children. Otherwise, it is a great movie for older children and adults who are in the heart of a child. (END)
