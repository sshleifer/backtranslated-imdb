It makes me proud of being British. This is definitely the funniest thing on TV. The league consists of Jeremy dyson, Steve pemberton, mark gatiss and lovely blacksmith Reece. Completely underestimated, this horror comedy is perfect. The characters are iconic and bizarre, "Hello Dave." It's a comedy everyone has to watch. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the gentlemen's league is that it is always fresh and always pushes the limits. You do not have to rely on passwords (unlike small Britain) to make it fun. the fact that the league is ready to kill their probably most famous and iconic characters, shows us that they have steel balls.
