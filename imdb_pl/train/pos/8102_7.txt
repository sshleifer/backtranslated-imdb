Things to come is a historical film. Along with Metropolis (1927) is one of the first great science fiction spectacles. It is also one of the first films of extermination. It is amazing how the creators of the film predict the beginning of World War II during the year, and even, in a subtle way, a year that will end in the real world. But then the film departs from reality, depicting a world ravaged by war (only substitute poisonous gas for nuclear weapons, which of course did not exist in 1936). <br /> <br /> The last half hour of the movie is an amazing sight, making breakthrough use of models and matte paintings - later become the basis of the science fiction genre. It is sad that after the things that come, science fiction would be associated with cheap movies b, a stereotype that would not be broken until 2001: A Space Odyssey over 30 years later. If they were stuck in the quality of the effects in this movie, it would be a completely different story in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Raymond Massey and some of his stars play many roles in this movie. Massey plays the big role of Doctor Who as a pilot with an advanced (from 1970) Civilization, which tries to gain a population of a devastated country ruled by a simple leader (a very effective performance by Ralph Richardson). Ultimately, the story covers 100 years. But this is a big problem with this movie - there really is no coherent plot. <br /> <br /> Maybe in such an episodic movie - in a sense reminiscent of intolerance - it is difficult to have a conventional story, but I felt that you could do more with the material, and although the graphics in the last third of the picture are really stunning and worth the price of admission ... the story does not exist, and the movie itself ends abruptly as it becomes interesting. Maybe the producers were thinking about another sci-fi innovation: a sequel? <br /> <br /> The things that will come is a movie that every serious sci-fi fan should see at least once. However, unlike the Metropolis, it may not have repeated views.
