A well-summarized summary of the real event! Well, actually I was not there, but I think it could be. I think there are two typically American positions in the film: "communistophobia" and analogies to Adolf Hitler. They should be obvious to most independent observers. Anyway, Boothe has a great performance, like many other famous actors. The last twenty minutes of the movie are unbearable - I mean it! Anyone who can sleep well after them is abnormal. (That's why it's so scary - everything happened and it probably looked like this). But did this last scene at the air station really take place?
