With a relatively small budget for an animated film of only $ 60 million, people from Fox Animation and Blue Sky Studios have done an amazing job. <br /> <br /> Combine the latest digital animation, perfectly reflect the talents of Ray Romano, John Leguizamo and Dennis Leary (among many others) to create a very funny family movie with a strong message about cooperation, friendship and care for other members of the herd. And how many different creatures are sometimes needed to create a herd. <br /> <br /> While watching this movie, I received a strong political message about getting along with people who share your space - maybe you should have to watch for all the world leaders! <br /> <br /> David Newman - another member of the Newman family of Hollywood composers - provides an excellent result that is not obtrusive, but is used to move action along, and sometimes is positively touching with your fingers. <br /> <br /> The overall look of the movie is amazing; intensely colored, strangely believable fantasy land of snow, geysers, mud, rocks and ice. Individual figures were also delightfully credible, and Ray Romano's expression "Manfred" was a special feast. <br /> <br /> The whole sequence with DoDos leaves no doubt as to where the word "Stupid as it comes from DoDo. <br /> <br /> This is a good family movie that keeps things that can bother or frighten children, are largely cleansed - but still true. <br /> <br /> It would be a great movie to watch in the theater and to buy at home.
