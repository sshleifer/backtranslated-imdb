Coming from the same director who did "Candyman" and "Immortal Beloved", I'm not surprised that this is a good movie. Ironically, "Papierhaus" is a film I have not heard of yet, but it must be one of the best films of the late 1980s - partly because it is the worst film period of recent decades. (Not to mention the Iranian or Swedish "cinema" here ...) Acting is not brilliant, but only solid - contrary to what some people claim (they had to dream about this "miraculous acting", like Anna). History is an interesting fantasy that does not end with a clever way that connects all the loose ends together. These unanswered questions are probably left intentionally, leaving this interpretation to the individual, and there is nothing wrong with that. "Pepperhaus" is a somewhat unusual mix of children's film and horror, with the effective use of sounds and music. I like the fact that the main character is not a typical, very shy, but secretly-genius, outcast-social girl, but a normal, normal girl; very refreshing. I am sick and tired of writers who design their own different childhoods to their books and screens, as if someone has already cared to watch or read about yet another miserly, lonely childhood, as if it were all or if this kind of background nature has a monopoly for good potential. The scene with Anna and the boy "snogging" (for quite a long episode) was a little too big - causing feelings of both vague disgust and amusement - considering that she was only 11 years old, but it was predicted that Burke was 13 years old 14, when it was filmed. I have no idea why they did not improve the age of the characters or did not get a younger actress. It was pretty obvious that Burke was not so young. Why directors always throw older children than what they play, blur realism, never find out.
