I came across this movie on the cable and I was totally addicted. The story of a group of surfers who ride on big waves, waves that are tremendously huge, waves that would make any rational person run away in fear is the one that can be spectacular and makes you understand why people spend their lives chasing waves. There is nothing special about the film, except that it gathers very interesting people who are in love with what they do and allow them to talk. Sure there are scenes of them surfing, but what makes this movie so special is people. Here's a bunch of guys who are so enthusiastic about what they're doing that goes to people watching. In the middle of this movie you will want to set off and learn to surf. Few documentaries have managed to penetrate the passion that these people have and the ability of movies to make us feel that it's a great movie. Look at this.
