It must be one of the best, if not the best movie I have seen for a very, very long time. We had enough action to please fans, and yet the plot was very good. I really liked this movie and started it from the beginning to the end. <br /> <br /> I added blood and gore there, but I brought the realistic nature of what's happening at the front of the movie, and even had a tear of jerk ending for many people that I should think. <br /> <br /> It must be for everyone. I've seen a lot of reviews, I've made a movie, but to be honest, most movies that have bad reviews turn out to be some of the best. confirms it once again. <br /> <br /> Rent this movie, buy this movie, just go out and watch this movie. You will not be disappointed.
