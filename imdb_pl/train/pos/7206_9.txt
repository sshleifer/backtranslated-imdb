A perfect plot of land within the plot. I'm ashamed because of two of my movie heroes who are having fun. It must be my upbringing :) <br /> <br /> He behaved very well. You never know who will be out-out who. The last small turn at the end allows everyone to get their empty deserts. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to everyone. A harmless thriller with a pinch of salt, which, if it has any mistakes, is probably Michael Caine's excessive use of the word "bloody", but it's his signature, right. <br /> <br /> 9/10
