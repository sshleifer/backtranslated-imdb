This is apparently one of the first Shemp movies from The Stooges. (This excludes his much earlier vaudeville years with the band). But the comic feel of the three is the best here. In addition to intense slapstick scenes, there are also other subtle, but equally fun. Watch Larry when Shemp asks him to look at the camera in order to take a picture. Or look at the real object that Moe cries out: "Oh ... very polished mahogany!" <br /> <br /> Emil Sitka is confused, the most stunned. And goon may look scary, but it's kind of funny. He seems to be frustrated and embarrassed by Stoogs, as well as "ordinary" people in other shorts. <br /> <br /> For lovers of Shemp, this is an obligatory episode. It will not let you down.
