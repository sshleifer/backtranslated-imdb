Bromwell High is a comic comic. He was active at the same time as other school life programs such as 'Teachers'. My 35-year teaching experience has led me to believe that the Bromwell High satire is much closer to reality than "Teachers". Rage to survive financially, insightful students who can see through the pomp of pitiful teachers, pettiness of the whole situation, remind me of the schools that I knew and their students. When I saw the episode in which the student repeatedly tried to burn the school, I immediately remembered ......... about .......... High. The classic line: INSPECTOR: I'm here to catch one of your teachers. STUDENT: Welcome to Bromwell High. I expect many adults my age think that Bromwell High is far-reaching. It is a pity that it is not!
