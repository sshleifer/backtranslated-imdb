The film belongs to the Inventor genre - Underdog. Jake Gyllenhaal, Laura Dern and Chris Cooper introduce a little bit of acting to the game with a few standard elements. Well filmed, well-assembled, with a lot of well-made supporting roles. This is it and more. I agree with those who say: "The film celebrates the thrill of youthful inspiration." <br /> <br /> The movie is a nice reminder that achievement can be born from ordinary roots. <br /> <br />
