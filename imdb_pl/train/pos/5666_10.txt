I loved the program when it was broadcast on TV and was crushed when I learned that someone somewhere decided that it was not worth continuing! For years, I kept my copies of this program, the ones I recorded or had a tape for me. This is up to now. The authorities, who finally decided to release this beautiful series on DVD, finally managed to get my willing little hands on the whole set. Which brings me to this part; part about it all is about. <br /> <br /> American Gothic talks about bad verses, basically about the fight between Lucas Buck (aka Buck, from B). She's a bad sheriff in a small town in South Carolina who does things the way she wants everything to be cursory and does not stop at anything. <br /> <br /> I felt that the program was wonderfully written and directed, there was still a lot of life left. I really hated it when it was canceled, but that's how it looks when I finally find something worth watching on TV. <br /> <br /> Gary Cole did a great job as sheriff Lucas Buck, he has the right amount of charm in the verses of evil to distract him. The other actors did a great job, so I think it can be said that even the casting was a hit for me.
