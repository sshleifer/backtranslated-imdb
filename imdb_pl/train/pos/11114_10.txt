It is probably not fair that I have to see most of the interesting reviews about Sopran, and then add what people have forgotten about, but well ....... <br /> <br /> From the point of view of acting, how could any actor fail with these characters? Each of them hypnotizes and intensely strives for life. Tony Soprano - while the crowd "Capo" suffers from mental illness, he still sees his life in front of him and knows what to do to survive. Each of his people, you see their life practically from the inside, like the truest form of voyerism. This definitely highlights the kind of "meddlesome" page in every viewer and I join in! <br /> <br /> Although some of the above do not apply to Bracco, I must say that this is the most recent role for years has good luck. It's Tony's side that makes him listen to reason, which makes him decent, which gives him a break in dealing with his human emotions that he did not feel for so long, if at all. He is simply his savior. (I do not say in religious tones) <br /> <br /> But the knockout performance is undoubtedly Edie Falco. To see her role as a prison guard in another acclaimed HBO series "Oz," and then see her as Livia, is the ultimate compliment for any actor or actress. She crossed the limits of a recognizable actress, which only actresses such as Merle Streep can handle. A kind of chameleon quality to exceed the roles. But as I mentioned earlier, with strong characters like how each actor can fall? <br /> <br /> Livia's strength is her daily confirmation of her self-confidence. She is a survivor because she hopes that her husband and family will survive. She is prepared for the worst because she knows the dangers of her husband's business, but she knows that the lifestyle she has is more than most Jersey women. She's smart, if not smarter and cleverer than Tony himself. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, the biggest crime of the Soprano family is that the viewer has to wait until January 2000 to see the next season. In my opinion, this is the worst thing in the HBO series. It was the popularity of The Larry Sanders Show, Sex and the City, Dream On and others that eventually killed them. Too much space between the seasons and very sporadically. Until then, I will be watching replays in the hope that this programming gap will be fulfilled.
