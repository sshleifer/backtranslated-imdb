This movie was very funny, I could not stop smiling while watching this movie and I watched it twice in two days! The film is unique in terms of humor and visualization, both are great and on a par with other (more serious) movie jewels of Natali Cube and Cypher. Ever since I watched Cypher, I became a huge fan of Vincenzo Natali. Everything he created is very interesting. <br /> <br /> Very nice in this film are music and "losers" heroes Dave and Andrew, embodied by David Hewlett and Andrew Miller (co-writer of this story), actors I like very much. The X-Box Dead Or Alive fights are also great (at some point you can even see Dave playing Halo) and the amazing Andrew's guitar solo, among others. <br /> <br /> All in all a great movie about well-being about friendship. You must see it!
