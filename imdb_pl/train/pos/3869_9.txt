I saw this film at the Viennale a few years ago, where the audience liked it. I also liked the fact that the Summer Phoenix performance still haunts me, which is why I decided to write a comment. <br /> <br /> The story takes place in London around 1900, where a Jewish girl decides to become an actress. He desperately tries to become one, but it's not that the man treats her badly, because he realizes that he has talent and that he connects with the audience and becomes a stronger human being. > There were some reviews if her performance was broken, accused her of being boring, unable to revive her character. I think it's her strength, exactly what Esther Kahn should be, and Phoenix makes a bold decision to make her Esther a rather boring girl. So her transformation at the end is more powerful than it could be otherwise. <br /> <br /> Pictures are great, London pictures at the turn of the century are very dark and sad, you can see how unpleasant life was then. <br /> <br /> The only drawback in my opinion is the length of the movie, you lose contact with the characters, in the end it's just about finding an actor in yourself, so there are no dramatic actions in the film. It is thanks to Phoenix that we do not lose interest in film after the first hour.
