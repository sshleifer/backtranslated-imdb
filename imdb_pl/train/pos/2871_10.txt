Comment? Is my comment needed? We're talking about masterpieces of all time, all seasons and all generations. This is just a type of movie that I still have the patience to watch. In this, as in other Disney movies, there is some kind of magic. All characters are somehow "live" and "real", so it's easy to understand the message even if you do not understand the language (as I did not understand when I first watched the movie because I was about six years old). Maybe my English is not very good, but I've learned what I know mostly from this kind of movie, and it's one more big dimension of these kinds of movies that are rare these days. But there is one big shame. In my country, you can not watch this or any other Disney movie right now! We do not have copyrights, so our children are disabled to enjoy and learn from this kind of movie. So, we'll watch this movie again, "Once Upon a Dream" or ...?
