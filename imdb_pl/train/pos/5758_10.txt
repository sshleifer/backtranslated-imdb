In my opinion, this is one of the best 70s action movies. Not only does it offer a great cast, it is also full of savage gunfights and explosions that are impressive today. The story is about recruiting a veterinarian from Vietnam (Kris Kristofferson) by his brother (Jan-Michael Vincent) to help clean up the criminal element in a small town and what happens when Kris begins to use his position and becomes as bad as the criminals he has been rented to get rid of. It's great to see Kris playing against the type. Bernadette Peeters and Victoria Principal offer great support as women from two male stars. Jan-Michael shows the real movie star in this film. I do not think that Vigilante Force was on video, but sometimes appears on television. This is a great movie for guys who like movies.
