This video has received terrible ratings from almost everyone who voted here, but I am here to tell you whether you like movies like Dude Wheres my Car and Dumb and Dumber this movie is for you. If you play in movies such as Citizen Kane and Casablanca, id must suggest you from a different angle. Even so, I still love this movie and everything, even if it is "kiddy", it is one of the few movies that my friends and I have been able to watch for years and cite whenever possible. GREAT MOVIE. This movie should be AFI number 1 because it's so damn high-class. The only problem with this movie is that you may have a problem displaying it because it was a TV movie created on a channel that no longer exists. So I do not know how to get this movie, id how to buy it on DVD, but I can not find it anywhere. I still have the taped tape from the moment it was first, you can come, if you want, and watch how I can sleep. this movie is rocking and that's all you need to know.
