And this is a great rock'n'roll movie in itself. Regardless of how he evolved (when he was a movie about the disco), he ended up as one of the best films in which children want to swing, but the director stands in their way. Let's get back to those rock'n'roll movies from the '50s, in which the day is saved when Alan Freed arrives in the city with Chuck Berry to prove that Rock and Roll music is really cool and safe for children, and Tuesday Weld he gets a new sweater for dancing. Forward to 1979, repeat the same story, but throw DA RAMONESA, which no one realized then, would become one of the most influential bands in the next quarter century (and then for the obligatory DJ, "The Real" Don Steele). Include all the elements of Roger Corman's comedy, except for a two-day shooting schedule, famous Corman players like Clint Howard, Mary Wournow and Dick Miller (from "Bucket of Blood"), and you have one of the great blockbuster movies that day. I showed a new DVD to a friend who only remembered seeing fragments of it due to the cloudiness caused by the stoners at the entrance, and agreed that it was one of the best movies to watch drunks, not the least for charming leading ladies and great Ramones recordings.
