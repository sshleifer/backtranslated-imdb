So when I was little, I got this movie as a gift, and my sister and I loved it. we watched it all the time. when our friends come, we will have an overnight stay and we will watch the great rock mountains and magical toys of my grandfather. I'm 21 now and I still love this movie, some old friends and I recently got together and watched it, we knew all the songs and we danced and talked about how much we hated Profster when we were little. One of my friends bought this film and magical grandfather's toys for his two-year-old daughter, because he wants to convey our love for this film. It's really a movie that you can let your children watch and feel safe, without violence, without bad language, just lots of great songs and important lessons.
