According to Slavoj Zizka, the host and analyst of this intellectually ticklish route, Groucho is superego, Chico ego, and Harpo id. <br /> <br /> Scenes from the above-mentioned films serve to illustrate the concept: the role of fantasy in shaping reality and vice versa, father's figure, male and female libido, death drive, etc. Here are some Slavoj statements (most as paraphrases): "Desire is a wound on reality", "fantasy is a nightmare", "music is the opium of the people" (loan from K. Marx), "from all human emotions, fear is the only one that does not deceive". The whole is included in the intro, which declares: "in the movies you do not look for your desires, instead the cinema tells you what you should desire" and ends with the cinema view that "cinema is needed today so that we can understand our present reality" - I say until the censorship derails him. <br /> <br /> The division into three parts is only mechanical, perhaps with a view to television projection. For the theater viewer, it does not matter.
