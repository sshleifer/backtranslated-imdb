In 1933, the film was cut from many pieces, because it was very popular in the plot and the fact that Lily Powers (Barbara Stanwyck) will do everything to get great wealth and power. Lily's father forced her daughter into prostitution at the age of 14, and grew up in a steel mill in a small town with very poor people, and her father ran a speech that brought to his home all the masculine characters that kept an eye on Lily. As the story progresses, Lily meets a man after a man and finally finds a man who has everything and is a playboy bank president. It's great to see a very young John Wayne (Jimmy McCoy Jr.) who was only 25 when he took this photo it was produced and Jimmy did not even reach the first base with Lily, even for lunch. A very young George Brent (Coutland Trenholm) performs together with Barbara Stanwyck and they both gave great performances. This is a great film from 1933, which was produced by Darryl F. Zanucka and was closed for many years and is shown on the silver screen. This movie is rather mild compared to what we see today on Hollywood screens, but in 1933 watching these types of movies was very rude. Enjoy
