Watching "Lisa and the child" was an intoxicating experience. The lush visualizations, the integrity of the point of view and the absolute beauty of the scenery and the characters left me in nausea of ​​pleasure. <br /> <br /> The plot is uncomplicated. Deceptively simple. In the container of this simplicity, a world develops that attracts you and leaves you breathless. <br /> <br /> I was laughing. I cried. I have learned. <br /> <br /> This is a movie you can trust - give in. I dare say that it is an act of love intended for every innocent heart. He reaches the heart of the viewer - at any age - and reveals the world with new eyes, as if seen from the heart. <br /> <br /> Adi Da Samraj once said that real Art attracts the viewer's point of view on ecstatic participation in the Reality. I feel that I had the honor to watch - not, participate - in this film, a work of real art.
