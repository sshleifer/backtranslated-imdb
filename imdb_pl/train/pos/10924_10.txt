I saw this kung fu movie when I was a kid, and I thought it was so cool! Now I'm 26 years old and my friend has it on DVD !!! <br /> <br /> We have a tea case and we watched this classic! He lost NONE from the original coolness of kung fu! If you're a fan of kung fu / karate movies, then you have to see ... DVD is available. I believe this movie is also called "Pick Your Poison". <br /> <br /> See you soon!
