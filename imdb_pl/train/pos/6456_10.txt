My expectations were quite high for this film. Everyone I know who saw this movie at the cinema told me that everyone else stayed there because they were so moved. My expectations could not have been higher, nothing but a wonderful disappointment would disappoint me. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed with this movie. I loved how he dealt with difficult subjects without going through the usual steps that usually contain a Hollywood movie. In this video, the characters worked on the problems they had for decades, worked through prejudice, and learned to open. But it did not come easily, not just by singing a song or two. It was painful, it required arguments, it faced confrontations. I felt like in real life. <br /> <br /> One of the scenes that really stuck to me was the scene where Gabriella sings her song. Helen Sj√∂holm is one of my favorite singers, her voice is beautiful, and it could be said that she was not just a lip synchronization with the previous recording during filming (which I often encounter in other movies), she really sang with the whole body and soul. In this scene, you feel what Gabrielle felt. If this movie was made in Hollywood, his song would probably be sung at the end, and it would make her husband open his eyes and see the error of his ways, and also make other people in the village understand something or two. Instead, he came in half and did not bring any solutions. Her husband was not overwhelmed and did not realize what he was going through, and it did not seem that anyone else in the village was more open. It was beautiful, it was clean and touched, but it did not solve all its problems magically. It was real to me, probably it would happen in real life. The whole film seemed to me a real life, nothing nicely wrapped up, but everything with a sense of joy and happiness. You will rarely find a movie that is so realistic. <br /> <br /> There were a few things that bothered me, but hey, no movie is perfect. If you have not already done so, you should see "As it is in Heaven" and be filled with the joy of life, a sense of hope and a feeling that you have rarely touched on films. You will be sad, painful, happy and a dozen other emotions. <br /> <br /> Someone once said that if every person in the world sang in a choir, there would be no more wars. After watching this movie, I have to agree.
