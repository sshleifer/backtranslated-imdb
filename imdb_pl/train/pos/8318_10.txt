An excellent movie. Excellent acting performance of Mary Alice, Phillip M. Thomas and young Irene Cara. Tony King was very realistic in his role of Satin. This film was one of the last mostly "all black" films of the '70s, in contrast to the films "blaxploitation" from that era, this movie had a story and was very well done. The soundtrack of the film, sung by Aretha Franklin, was then popular on R & B charts.
