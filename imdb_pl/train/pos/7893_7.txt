I think I am part of a silent minority who liked this film. Is this one of the best "Nightmare" series? Maybe not, but I had a great time. Freddy Krueger reaches his evil, wise potential. Because parts 4 and 5 were somewhat delayed in the series, I felt that the so-called last part ("New Nightmare" is the real finale) led the series to fall. There are some great nightmares sequences, including one in which Breckin Meyer plays a stoner, who is demolished, falls asleep and stuck in a video game controlled by Freddy. It is both a very original and a funny sequence, especially when we see it outside the dream scene, jumping like Super Mario. And Freddy says a funny version of "Great graphics". And because the movie was made about 10 years ago, he brought back memories when Freddy started controlling the game with Powerglove. Anyone who remembers the first 8-bit Nintendo, remembers Powerglove. <br /> <br /> The cast is great. Lisa Zane is perfectly staffed. I have not seen Yapheta Kotto from "The Running Man" and I think that the last time I saw this movie about 5 years ago. This is another great, underrated actor who has a powerful presence on the screen. Who can forget about the scenes? The best of them is Johnny Depp (from the first "Nightmare") playing the spokesperson for anti-drug advertising. <br /> <br /> The 3D sequence at the end is really amazing! So for those who want to check this movie - please rent or buy it on DVD! I hope all editions come with 3D glasses, but I'm sure that the video editing has removed the 3D element. <br /> <br /> Personally, I have not seen many bad things in the movie. It even developed Freddy's story. The film is a great mix of humor and terror, and the gross effects are great. Can this give a better franchise dimension? Of course it could. But Rachel Talalay did a great job. And finding the perfect application is easier than said. <br /> <br /> And finally, I loved editing the opening credits. Fans of the series will be delighted and will look at it as a tribute to their beloved Freddy. <br /> <br /> My result: 7 (out of 10)
