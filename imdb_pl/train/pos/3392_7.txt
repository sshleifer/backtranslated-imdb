It was a very provocative film, especially for 1973. At the time it was a huge box office success. After the 1970s, it seemed to have been forgotten, but its central messages were too important to disappear completely. It was at least fifteen years before his time ... no one had ever heard of the "greenhouse effect" before 1985.

This may not be the most fun two-hour movie ever made, and the ending can be frightening and depressing, but it's hard to find any movie producer with the courage to deal with such a topic.
