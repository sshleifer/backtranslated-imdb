Everyone has already commented on the pictures (good to great), personality (bigger than life), structure (chronological, with many references to the culture of surfing in time). What is missing is a greater question about sociological significance: throwing the mainstream of American culture into something more satisfying and satisfying. <br /> <br /> In the 1970s I was a surfer. We watched 16mm films at local high schools in SoCal. I remember the great feeling of surfing all day long, until my skin radiated warmth, wearing a Hawaiian shirt and shorts, and watching the latest surf film at night. Often the narrator was the filmmaker himself, reading the script from sheets of paper. Sometimes a surf band or a proto-punk band would add music. I've never been happier. With the exception of hooting and hollering, seeing "Riding Giants" took me back in time. <br /> <br /> IT also reinforced the feeling that life on the edge, without worrying about money and climbing a social ladder, not keeping up with Jones, pushing physically and mentally for a fleeting moment of joy and joy - can be the answer to the question : "What is the purpose of life?" It seems that at least for Greg Noll, Laird Hamilton and similar people have found something that few of us are bold enough or honest with ourselves to live: live only on their own terms. Perhaps the society would break up if we all did exactly what we wanted in life, but it is wonderful to see people who are actually fulfilling their dreams. <br /> <br /> It was the message that made a great impression on me.
