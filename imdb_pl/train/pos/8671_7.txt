Armageddon PPV <br /> <br /> Last PPV 2006 <br /> <br /> The Smackdown brand. <br /> <br /> Results of matches ******** <br /> <br /> We are starting the show with The Inferno match. Kane v. MVP. It was a good match. Nothing about wrestling here. It was about visualization. Overall, it was not bad. There were a few close places where Kane got too close to the fire, but eventually Kane won with a MVP punch in the fire. <br /> <br /> Nice opening. Let's continue. <br /> <br /> Teddy Long announces a new match for team titles: London and Kendrick will defend themselves against: Regal and Taylor, The Hardyz and MNM IN A LADDER MATCH !!!! Let's go! <br /> <br /> Match two: Fatal four-person ladder match. It was a total slaughter. Judging by three of the four teams, you would expect chaos. The places were amazing. Total spot One point Jeff went to Poetry in Motion and London moved and Jeff hit the ladder! Shortly after, Jeff is put on the highest line with two ladders nearby, when MNM intends to kill Jeff, Matt makes him rescues, and Jeff hits the "shot" shot to Joey Mercury! Mercury is wounded. His eye is quickly closed and broken. Mercury is removed from the match and Nitro is still there. He will fight for titles alone! Regal and Taylor then grabbed London and stood face to face with a ladder! Jeff climbs up the ladder and Nitro in a deadly place, throws himself up the ladder to nail Jeff! Incredible! In the end, London and Kendrick retain the title of the tag team. What a game !!! <br /> <br /> It was crazy. I can not understand why WWE has not announced it so far. Buyrate will increase tremendously. I am sure that the value of the replay will be good, however. <br /> <br /> Mercury suffered a smashed nose and eye injuries. He's in the hospital now. Have fun. <br /> <br /> There is no way that anything else ends here. <br /> <br /> Next up: Miz v. Boogeyman. (Ugh) It did not suit anything. Does the Boogeyman ever struggle? Miz sucks too. After the crazy crowd, he kills them. DUD. <br /> <br /> Chris Benoit v. Chavo. It was a strong match. I liked. Chavo hit a deadly superplex at some point! Benoit also hit eight German suplexes! Benoit wins with the sniper. Good things. <br /> <br /> Helms against the Yang-Cruiserweight championship title. It was a good match. Unfortunately, stupid fans did not care about it. WHY? Helms and Yang are very talented and struggle well. I agree with JBL. He cried to the crowd. JBL is 100% correct. Learn to appreciate or get out. <br /> <br /> Mr Kennedy against the Undertaker-Last Ride match. Not too much here. It was a slug fest, with a few exceptions. Kennedy at some point threw Taker from the top of the stage to the floor. The place was fine. The reaction was disappointing. The final point was the Taker Kennedy tomb at the caravan and won the match. Unreal. Kennedy needed this win. They both work hard. Even so, Kennedy needed this win. Undertaker should have lost. Creative has screwed up again. <br /> <br /> Next is a stupid diva. I like women. It does not. At least Torrie was not here. It's refreshing. Judging by the crowd, Layla should win. WWE wanted Ashley. Think about how your break in the bathroom. Next. <br /> <br /> Main Event: Cena and Batista v. Finlay & Booker T. It did not fit either. The price was v. Finlay and Batista v. Booker. Batista and Booker can not work together well. Finlay tries to make the price look good. The finish was unsuccessful. Finlay struck Batista's knee into a chair, and Batista did not sell the shot and ended the match. Lame. This is not the main caliber of events. <br /> <br /> In general, Armageddon would have scored less, but the ladder match was the main event here. It was worth enough money. A few others were solid. <br /> <br /> The Last Word: Good PPV with a ladder match as a savior. Smackdown is not a bad performance, it's not enough. Smackdown must stop allowing price tag. Let Smackdown stand on its own feet. This show proves that Smackdown can.
