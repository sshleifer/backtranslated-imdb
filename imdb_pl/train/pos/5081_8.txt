This movie was great, and even with an incredible ending, it is still worth seeing. The film begins when Claudette Colbert is about to marry Robert Ryan. When the minister asks if anyone has any reservations, the guy jumps up and announces that Colbert CAN NOT can marry because she is already married !! Colbert argues that this is not true, but when they arrive, it turns out that Justice of Peace and many others remember her wedding and even the marriage license signed! It slowly becomes clear that Claudette's mind is slipping, and the people around her seriously doubt her mental health. Then, when the alleged first husband is murdered, all evidence and suspicions fall on Colbert. <br /> <br /> The film is an exciting, mysterious movie about suspense, because I've only described the first part of the movie so far. What follows is extremely intelligent and engaging. Unfortunately, the conclusion is somewhat disappointing, because the leading force behind all this turns out to be "straight from the left field" - and it is surprising because it was so unexpected and impossible to guess based on the information given to the viewer. Even so, the film was so good that I could even justify the inertia ending. In particular, Robert Ryan did a great job of his "knuckle" fianc√©, although other performances were also excellent outside of him.
