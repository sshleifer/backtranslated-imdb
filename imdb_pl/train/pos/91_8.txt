Overall, it was a good movie with a perfect ending; the acting was spectacular, and the characters did not stray from their people. I especially liked the plot, although you knew what was going to happen, it still gave an element of surprise throughout the movie. However, I think that the transition to the end could have been a bit longer (maybe extended) - for me it seemed that it was a bit hurry; as if the writer tried to remove the linens from the line before the rain fell. For example ... What happened to Tristan's brother, Hayden? We know he died in the hospital. Maybe he set the whole thing ?! Who knows! Maybe there will be a sequel? Maybe? If it's ... I can not wait to see it.
