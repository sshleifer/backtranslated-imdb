I was especially pleased that Othello himself was dark-skinned in this movie, and Desdemona had no light hair like almost always. The cast also played very well and I liked the script that followed the original Shakespeare text so much. I must say, however, that some of the scenes were too erotic for a character like Desdemona. I always thought she was very modest and that's why it's not appropriate to show her in bed with Cassio - though it only happened in Othell's imagination. At first, I was a little surprised that the love scene between Othello and Desdemona was shown so openly. But as a whole I liked the film, especially Desdemona crying on the dying stage.
