It was a life-changing one, THIS REALLY YOU !!! The Man In The Moon is a breathtaking experience to watch. Acting was great, the story was great, and it was the perfect start to the career of Reese Witherspoon. see how no one could love this movie. Of course, this is not the best movie ever, although it was close, but watching it was very funny, and I even laughed at one of the jokes and many other small laughs. Of course, there were also a few screams, but also this video was instructive and brightens up your day, although you have to get depressed from time to time. I believe that this movie has not won at least one prize, and I also can not believe that it was seen by so few people on this site.
