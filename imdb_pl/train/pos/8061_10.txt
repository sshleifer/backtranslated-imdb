The performance of Victor McLaglen is one of the best in the history of the film. <br /> <br /> I think we can all feel to "Gypo" because we have all struggled with what is good and what is not and what has happened. It was one of the first photos from the artist's house, which appeared in a large American film studio (RKO Radio Pictures). <br /> <br /> Pictures of Joseph H. August are the best here. However, the dazzling part of August was overlooked; he did not receive an Oscar nomination, which he rightly deserved. <br /> <br /> This is a psychological drama, with thought, philosophy, sadness, everything is given with as few words as possible.
