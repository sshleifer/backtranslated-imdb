I watched this movie when I was almost a child, and naturally, I was moved to tears by this family story of foxes. Fantastic scenery in Hokkaido, perfect story and not only great soundtrack provide rare intimacy with heroes. I'm still looking for a copy of the great soundtrack. For German viewers, it is worth knowing that DEFA dubbing is the only one worth listening to. I recorded both DEFA and BR tapes, but I still only watch the first one.
