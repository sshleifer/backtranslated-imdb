Because of the affair, as a married man. The following two films are recommended. <br /> <br /> 1. Brief Encounter David Lean (1945), UK <br /> <br /> Well, when a woman goes to the train station something can happen. And that's how it happened! How much she wanted to be there, in a small tavern waiting for the man of her dreams. But she was married ... a man who was a fancy woman. <br /> <br /> 2. Xiao Cheng Zhi Chun by Fei Mu (1948), China <br /> <br /> Well, when a woman goes to the market, to buy fish, a grocery store and medicines, going through the ruins of an ancient wall in a small town, what to think about, the melancholy of her life, her sick husband, self-pity and no future ... When a cheerful young doctor appeared, something happened ... doctor was a licealist fantasizing woman <br /> <br /> In both films, from great directors from Great Britain and China, passion versus restraint was so intense, but in the end, intimate feelings did not develop into any physical contact. It gives you a great aftertaste, intensely smelling it without biting.
