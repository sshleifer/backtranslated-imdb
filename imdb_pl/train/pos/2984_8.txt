David Zucker directed one of the most enjoyable comedies of the year thanks to this stupid farce. Yes, it's a matter of acquired taste and depends on the wealth of classic gags, but is consistently funny as opposed to some recent comedy efforts. The film is full of all kinds of jokes, from blatantly obvious to more subtle ones, which need to pay attention to everything in the frame or probably miss them. Like his previous efforts, including "Airplane!", "Top Secret!" And "Naked Gun", humor flies almost every second. There are so many moments that it's easy to overlook a few that fall. What distinguishes this film from other bright imitations in the spoof genre is the fact that it has a real storyline. While others relied on mocking too many famous scenes in almost accidental movies (take "Mafia!", Please), this movie tells a new story with nice characters. He touches sports films in general, and also satirizes the real sports industry, instead of paralyzing any specific films. Even for people who do not care about "South Park", its creators, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, create a good pair of leading actors with natural chemistry. The film also very effectively uses the scenes of athletes, sports announcers and other celebrities, especially a funny piece with Robert Stack "Unsolved Mysteries". By the way, stay with chalk for the last joke with Bob Costas and Al Michaels. In conclusion, Zucker achieved, in words, referring to the sports mix of the film, the home dunk.
