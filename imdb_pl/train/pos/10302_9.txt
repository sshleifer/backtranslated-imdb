This movie is the best movie Jim Carrey ever did. Carrey did not have ordinary facial things in this movie. He was both amusing and sad. Carrey played a reporter named Bruce Nolan. Nolan blames God (Morgan Freeman) for everything that is wrong in his life. Then God comes down from Heaven and gives Bruce his powers. As I said earlier, Carrey did a great job. I also thought that Morgan Freeman and Jennifer Aniston were great supporting actors. The plot was good because it contained many sub-points in the main point. This movie can be funny (Bruce's dog) and sad ("breakup"). The script also worked well. I'm happy that they made a sequel to this movie. I rate this film on 9/10.
