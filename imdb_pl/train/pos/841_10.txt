I consider it a deeply funny dark comedy. Brosnan is a genius; as everybody now testifies, he should not be involved in the role of bonding. Kinnear was as charismatic and as funny as anyone could be in this role. I do not know if I laughed so much during any movie! What an unexpected pleasure! My favorite line would be "I feel like a hooker from Bangkok on Sunday after the navy left the city." Brosnan provided this very non-binding line with such an unexpected comedy finesse. I was also impressed by the performance of Hope Davis. It seems that everyone in this movie broke up from his previous work to the extent that she improved the comedy. If you like the dark and funny "The Weather Man", you'll love it. <br /> <br /> I voted 10.
