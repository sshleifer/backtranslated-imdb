Dana Andrews is one of the actors I've probably seen in a dozen or so films, but who never really registered me. Often clumsy, taciturn, playing the same roles and looking similar to the similarly underestimated Glenn Ford, he is an actor who tries hard to appreciate it; but when you hit the right movie ... <br /> <br /> And that's it. Preminger's moody look on New York's abdomen is as filthy and dingy as almost any 50's noir, and Andrews is in his element as too hard a police officer Mark Dixon, who simply does not know how to play this game to overtake: he hates criminals too much to always play according to rules. At the beginning of the movie, he accidentally kills a murder witness of an illegal crap game founded by a gangster whom Dixon hates for personal reasons, and spends the rest of the movie trying to hide his involvement and lead the gangster to his kind of "justice." Along the way, he engages in the foreign wife of the man he killed (Gene Tierney), and must try to take his father out of the murder. <br /> <br /> Stunningly photographed by Joseph LaShelle, with the hard and brilliant dialogue of Ben Hecht and a truly powerful ending with elements of tragedy and finding grace in a minute or two, this is another noir forever and can be my favorite Preminger's film so far. good as more preaching Laura.
