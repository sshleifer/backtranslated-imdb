My rating 10/10 is just for fun and assumes you've decided that you like "Slaughter High" even before watching. Yes, it's a typical story of revenge for a few years after a dirty joke, but how can you dislike some of the things that are downloading here ?! I could not predict this scene in the bathtub in a million years. <br /> <br /> OK, so maybe we could be cynical and say that this movie does not offer anything new. Well, he does not pretend. This is the kind of movie that the characters of "Krzyku" probably watched and contributed to their rules regarding the survival of horror. Who does not like to watch people suffer for doing these things? Of course, this is a kind of reactionary subtext, because people are punished for doing what they defended in the 1960s. But you still have to love these things! So, apologizing to Don McLean, this clown did not sing for the king and queen!
