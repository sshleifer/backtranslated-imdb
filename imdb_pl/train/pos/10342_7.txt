Melvyn Douglas once again gives a polished performance, in which this time he lives as a detective who can not love before duties and adventures, and the beautiful Joan Blondell (who is not illiterate, as one reviewer suggested, wrote a novel about her early life) as pleasant as ever, his beloved lover. It's almost a comedy screwdriver, almost a movie in the style of Thin Man, almost a series, I think, which did not quite make the next part. It does not quite achieve classic status, but it has all the ingredients for 85 minutes of fun with an episodic but dynamic scenario, great character actors and a direction that makes everything move fast enough that you hardly notice that Williams (Douglas) Columbo is not exactly about detection. I would like more such films.
