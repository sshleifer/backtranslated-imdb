I know it sounds weird from someone who was born almost 15 years after the show stopped broadcasting, but I love the program. I do not know why, but I like to watch it. I love Adam the best. The only disappointing thing is that the only place I found to buy seasons on DVD was in Germany, and that was only the first two seasons. It's disappointing, but fine. I will continue to search online. If anyone has any tips on where to buy from the second through to the 14th season, write to me on darkangel_1627@yahoo.com. I already have the first one. The only disadvantage is that DVDs from Germany only play on my portable DVD player and computer. Well. I still have it!
