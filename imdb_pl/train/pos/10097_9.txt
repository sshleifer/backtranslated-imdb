One of the first OVA purchased by me ("original video animations"), it still has to be one of my favorite anime titles. A cyberpunk comedy of science-fiction action set against the background of an unlikely (as for comedy) background of future pollution in the dystopian society. <br /> <br /> Dominion's "heroes" are tank police with the philosophy "if we can not overcome crimes, we will get bigger pistols" and who, as the name suggests, patrol the city in tanks instead of patrol cars, and who are much more dangerous than any criminal they try to catch. Most of them, if not all, are borderline psychopaths (?) And neurotics, giving a new meaning to the phrase "loose cannons". <br /> <br /> Equally colorful and fun are their opponents, the Buak terrorist and his lamb (wo) men, the Twin Sisters whose existence always seems to be involved in the difficult situation of the Panzer Police. <br /> <br /> The animation is not the most modern, but otherwise it is very pretty; the colorful palette and the cartoon character and mech look match the comedy atmosphere of the Dominion. <br /> <br /> English dubbing is great fun again. The soundtrack of the English version is also very good. I wonder if they ever created an album with a soundtrack ... <br /> <br /> In any case, Dominion Tank Police is great. It is a Japanese cyberpunk with lots of comedy, full of exaggerated characters and situations, so you never take it seriously. Highly recommended.
