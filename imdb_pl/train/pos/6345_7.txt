Costumes and make-up were great, there were some extremely fun lines, and the role was created for Jim Carrey. Carrey did such a good job, as you could do, given the rather disappointing script writing. Sure, it was mainly a children's movie, but if you're going to spend so much money making a movie, you should at least give this story enough body to go beyond what Dr. Seuss does. I expected more from Ron Howard. It is worth to see it, but it lacks the necessary features to become a serious classic, in any respect.
