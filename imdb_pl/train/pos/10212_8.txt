The whole movie is worth watching only for a great last minute - it's the best ending to any movie I've ever seen. Perfect, beautiful, funny, just wonderful. <br /> <br /> I found this movie delightful, even when it comes to it being too serious. I loved it - it's a great love story. And I loved the way the Algerians were woven - and by the way, the music during the final credits is great. I want a CD!
