Good movie with strong performances (especially with two wires). The film is about two American girls who were caught for 6 kilos of heroin at the airport in Thailand. They are both put in prison and one of them signs a confession. Bill Pullman plays a lawyer who tries to get them out. All they need to do is find Nick Parks, who put the drugs in one of the two girls' bags. So far, a story that is not so original (has many similarities with a better Return to Paradise). <br /> <br /> Beautiful action photos and Newton's Thomas Sigel make it worth watching. 7 out of 10.
