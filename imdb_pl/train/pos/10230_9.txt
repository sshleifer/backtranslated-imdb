People forget that there were several King Kong ripoffs-Congo, King Kong Vs. Godzilla, King Kong (1976), everyone is falling apart, but YETI is alone. It borrows only one element from King Kong and it is an animal attraction with one woman. <br /> <br /> The YETI myth is based on Bigfoot (not like King Kong), and archaeologists were fascinated by it. there was, but no scientific data to prove it. <br /> <br /> This video is hard to find, but it's worth watching. For the first time, I watched him on the "Master of dark performances of Elvira" in the early 80's. In childhood, I was shivering, especially when YETI went crazy. I saw it again, around 1:00 in ABC about 2 to 3 years ago. Seeing it again, I appreciated it more, it has some good effects (for its time), and the story concerns a silent boy and his dog and a bad businessman who wants to kill YETI for his own purposes. Also, the music is pretty cool, I like it very much. :-) <br /> <br /> Gianfranco Parolini and Yetians create a great atmosphere of monsters. <br /> <br /> Vote 7 and a half of 10.
