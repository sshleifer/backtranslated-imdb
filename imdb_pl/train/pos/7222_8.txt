Definitely one of the most witty and twisted people I've ever seen. Christopher Reeve and Micheal Caine were brilliant and they kept me through the whole thing. <br /> <br /> Very classic sets and props really give atmosphere to the atmosphere. A minimalist atmosphere works on the whole picture. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is not about the movie itself, but the lack of a decent, wide-screen editing of the movie on DVD. I have a full-screen version (which proves that I love the movie enough to withstand the full-screen presentation), but an amazing Deluxe or "special" version will definitely get my cash.
