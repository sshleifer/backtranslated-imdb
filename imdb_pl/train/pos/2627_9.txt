Finally, Timon and Pumba in their own film ... <br /> <br /> "Lion King 1 1/2: Hakuna Matata" is a disrespectful new look at the classic story. What classic story do you ask? Why "Lion King" of course! <br /> <br /> Yes, if there is one thing that Disney never lacks, it's narcissism. <br /> <br /> But that does not mean it is not a good movie. Essentially, these are the events of the "Lion King" about which Timon and Pumba speak. And for this reason you will have to know the story of the "Lion King" by heart to see where they come from. <br /> <br /> In any case, I watched it on one level and thought "Oh my God, it's so lame ..." and on a different level I had a ball. Most of the humor is predictable - that is, when Pumbaa consists of two beds, big for yourself and small for Timon, in the first nanosecond we all know that Timon will take the big one. But that does not stop him from being funny, which in short IMO means "Hakuna Matata". It's not like it happens, it's like. <br /> <br /> And beware of the warning: there are also fart jokes. Seriously, did you expect something else in the movie where Pumba is the center of attention? But as jokes say, they are particularly good and should satisfy even the most famous connoisseur. <br /> <br /> The returning voice talent is great. I am surprised that some of the actors were willing to come back, and most of them only have two or three lines (if they're lucky). Whoopi Goldberg is especially welcome. <br /> <br /> Music is great too. From "Digga Tunnah" at the beginning to "That's all I need", the adaptation of "Warthog Rhapsody" (song that was cut from "The Lion King" and honestly significantly improved in this incarnation), music leaves me with no what to complain about. <br /> <br /> In the end, Timon and Pumba are amazing characters, and although you can say that "Hakuna Matata" is just an excuse to see them in a variety of funny and diverse compromising situations, so be it. You can rarely find characters with whom you would like to spend time. <br /> <br /> Do I start to sound scary? <br /> <br /> Anyway, "Lion King 1 1/2" is great if you saw "Lion King" too many times. Especially if you are thinking right now, "Do not be stupid, there is no such thing as seeing the" Lion King "too many times!"
