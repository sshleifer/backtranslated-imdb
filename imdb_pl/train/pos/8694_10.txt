It was in 1988 when I saw "The Ronnie and Nancy Show" for the first time (on Austrian television). At the time I was already a big fan of Spitting Image (since he won the bronze medal at the Montreux film festival in 1986). Of course, I recorded every program on tape and watched it repeatedly - especially "The Ronnie and Nancy Show." I remember the scene when Ronnie stood in front of Abraham Lincoln (thinking it was a mirror) and said to himself, "I need a shave." Or the most fun when playing football with your dog - but the opposite! <br /> <br /> It's such a shame that the Spitting Picture seems to fall into oblivion; it was one of the most fantastic and smart TV shows in history. Compared to other satirical transmissions, it was by far the best of all. <br /> <br /> Well, it's been almost 20 years since then and I'd like to be able to see the program again. Can you buy it from someone ... somewhere?
