I'm glad I saw this movie that saw other director films in the past. I thought the production values ​​were great as the costumes and the settings with the bridge. It was interesting how the concept of spirit and demons was treated. <br /> <br /> I agree with some of the other comments on the battle scenes. Sometimes it was difficult to track them. <br /> <br /> Finally, a moral story. It would be interesting to know what some Japanese viewers thought about the movie. This is a movie that I would like to see again. <br /> <br /> Some scenes, such as those in which Benkai and the prince fought on the "psychic" level, were well done. I left the cinema thinking about what happened here. Intense.
