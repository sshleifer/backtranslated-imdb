a bit slow and boring, a story about an old man and his wife who live in a destroyed building and interact with a permanent figure, such as a postman, brothers sitting on the porch, a rich cigar. The river's photography is wonderful, as are the interiors of the period. If you like decorating Banana Republic stores, this is a must.
