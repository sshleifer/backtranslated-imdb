It's a really cool movie. One of them you can sit down and mindlessly watch how the plot becomes more and more twisted; more and more fun. Sally Field, Teri Hatcher (in her hey-day), Kevin Klein, Elisabeth Shue, Robert Downey, Jr ... These are all known, high-quality actors who play like stars / soap producers. If you ever saw a soap opera and thought, "How did they come up with this idea?" You'll love this movie. I've seen it many times; and every time I watch it, the more I appreciate humor, the more I realize how it really works. Do not expect Oskar's quality. It's a fun movie to play, not some artificial attempt to find an "inner man," etc. Sit down, relax and laugh.
