Why is this crap so badly evaluated ?! I've seen this movie over 25 times, I know EVERY line for this movie. It's obvious that I love this movie. Trey Parker and Matt Stone (creators of South Park and the new masterpiece puppet Team America) play the main roles of Joe Cooper, Coop "Airman" Cooper and Doug Remer or "Sir Swish". Throughout the film, they are simply called Coop and Remer. When the movie begins, it reminds us of the broken world where the competition in overpaid sports starts and even goes to create a "Townsell". I have to quote this part of the movie, because this is true for some sports competitions: "And after playing in New England, San Diego, Huston, Saint Louis, a year for Toronto Arganauts, plus one season as bigger in the Desert Inn I'm glad that in I can finally play here in the beautiful city of Miami. "His agent bends:" Minnesota. " Let's not forget about this important part of the movie. It starts so that Coop and Remer are at the school party and they realize that they are still nothing when they talk to their old classmates. Outside, they create a sporty BASEketball after challenging high school basketball heroes. After they were ashamed of this sport, the game lasts for about a year. During this time, they manage to recruit their third teammate, Squeak, who is the day after thinking up the game. According to the film, we find out that Coop, Remer and Squeak are the only virtuous heroes of the sport. The story goes hand in hand with mad blackmail, Milwaukee Beers cheerleaders and a humor so absurd that it will cry you for more. Look, man, it's funny.
