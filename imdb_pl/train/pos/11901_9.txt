As far as I remember, Balanchine's changes in Czajkowski's results are as follows: <br /> <br /> 1) The last part of Grossvatertanz (traditional melody played at the end of the event) is repeated several times. children the last dance before the end of their scene. <br /> <br /> 2) The solo violin, written but eliminated from the Tchaikovsky score for the Sleeping Beauty, is interpolated between the end of the party scene and the beginning of the transformation scene. Balanchine chose this music because of its melodious relationship with the music for the growing Christmas tree, which appears shortly thereafter. <br /> <br /> 3) Elimination of the solo for the Sugar Plum Fairy bachelor. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that the accusation that Balanchine somehow desecrated the great result of Tchaikovsky is wrong.
