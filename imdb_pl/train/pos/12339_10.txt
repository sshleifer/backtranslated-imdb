Dear Joan. A great performance. Where she is not good. I watched the movie and then Jane Eyre right after that ... it just improves. My heart raced. A great old movie drama. That's what I want from a classic movie. The facial expression is worth the whole movie. I'm happy that I have it on video. You do not know what you need in the movie. Beautiful woman ... wealth ... greed ... murder ... detektywi ... pr√≥ba ... <br /> <br /> Clothes are very nice. I wonder what was the budget for this movie? I would like them to continue making such films. Every time they try, they just make a bad movie. Movies in black and white still have a secret.
