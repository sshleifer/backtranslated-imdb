The first 50 minutes of this movie were quite boring. He focused on the personal problems Doyle had had, including his sick wife, death threats from fans, an insistent publisher and guilt over his mentally ill father. Although these topics had a significant impact on Doyle's life, I was more interested in the birth of Sherlock Holmes. The last 40 minutes were perfect. Finally, we saw Doyle's head, how he created Holmes, and why he had to "kill" Holmes. The actors are great. Including the intriguing Selden played by Tim McInnerny, Arthur Conan Doyle, the convincing role of Douglas Henshall and Brian Cox as the "role model" of Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Bell. Locations are good, especially in the case of a TV movie, and working with a camera is enjoyable. If the first 50 minutes were so good in the last 40 minutes, it would be a small masterpiece.
