Despite the wonderful and breathtaking animation, this is probably one of the most uninspiring Disney movies I have seen, and I often do not slam Disney movies. Spirit is a wild stallion who is repeatedly captured by cavalry or Indians who try to "break" him. The ghost ends the bond with the Indians, and in short it's history. With the exception of the beautiful horse animation, neither I nor my five-year-old were very much inspired or excited about the movie. It's ironic that it's titled "Ghost" because the ghost was what this movie could use a bit more. An additional point was awarded for the soundtrack, which was pleasant, with songs by Bryan Adams and Hans Zimmer. And although this movie is rated as G, you'll probably have to explain what "breaking a horse" means for your five-year-old. I did. <br /> <br />
