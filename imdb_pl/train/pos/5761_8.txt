I swear that the zombie was killed twice and kept coming back. I gave this film 8. Let's face it, this is exactly what other reviewers say, ie "Handy Camera", filmed. Hey, hi, hey, welcome to the total production of movies. The fact that Todd Sheets has over 700 zombies to appear in this movie is a tribute to his talents. Yes, the story has gaps, yes, we still see the same zombies, but who cares? Take what it is, a funny and bloody horror movie, one to share with donuts, or to insult people who really care about LOL. Relax people, I suppose you all liked pieces of rubbish, like "Titanic" or "Twister". Calm and support of independent film shooting !!!
