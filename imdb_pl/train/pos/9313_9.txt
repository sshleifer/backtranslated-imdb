I really liked this series - we got the first and only, it seems, series in the UK on channel 4. The characteristics were right for money - a bit like the Simpsons in that all the different aspects of the small town were represented. <br /> <br /> There was no laughter - I did not see it in the American television comedy at the time, with the exception of Larry Sanders, and it really worked well, increasing the suggestion that these crazy cops really liked it, and that not only for cameras. <br /> <br /> All in all, a bizarre little number that tickled me just right: I can not help it, but I think that maybe some of the recipients might have missed it. I think it would be a cult hit in Britain if it was shown at an acceptable time. <br /> <br /> I will end it with my standard commentary: Where the hell can I get it? watch it again? Any ideas?
