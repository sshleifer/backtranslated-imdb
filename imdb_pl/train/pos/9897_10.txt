Okay, I'm sorry, but I loved the movie. I love all the genre of this type of movie from the 80's because you can not see many such movies anymore! I want to ask all of you who say that this movie is just a rip off, or a shoddy imitation, what is it imitating? I've never seen a movie like this before, well, not a horror movie. <br /> <br /> Basically, it's a popular group at a school that likes to do everything that lives, so they decided on a nerdy boy named Marty. It becomes fatal when really gets hurt by one of their little mischief. <br /> <br /> So, it's 10 years later, and a group of friends who have hurt Marty begins to receive school letters. But ... only they receive them! So they come back to the old school and one by one they get knocked out by ....... You probably know what's going on! <br /> <br /> The only part that disappointed me was the end. It could have been interrupted or better thought out. <br /> <br /> I think you should try and try not to be critical! <br /> <br /> ~ * ~ CupidGrl ~ * ~
