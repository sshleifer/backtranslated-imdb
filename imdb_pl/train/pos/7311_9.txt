Halloween is a movie that I need to get out and watch every time it is THIS day a year. I watch it even when it is not a holiday !!! This movie is so great. This movie can be old, but the plot still makes me there every time, and the acting was absolutely fantastic !!! Although I have not seen the remake, I feel it was totally unnecessary. I think Rob Zombie should NEVER change this classic. What kills me, however, is to know that there are people who have seen the remake without even hearing the original. I only got mad at thinking about it !!!!!! he was great and will always be remembered in history as a classic.
