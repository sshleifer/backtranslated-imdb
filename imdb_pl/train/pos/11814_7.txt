Usually, when we use the word "escapist", we understand it negatively; The large-format version of Warren Beatty's "Dick Tracy" proves that "escapist" can be good. It's really one funny movie. As the title character, clad in a yellow, fearless title character, Beatty creates a detective, whom we can all relate to: ready to act, but not without his weakness. <br /> <br /> From there, the rest of the character is almost a world for himself. Tess Truehart (Glenne Headly) is as charming as one would expect from the hubby of every criminal; Breathless, Mahoney (Madonna) is probably the most troublesome person you can imagine; Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino) is an average villain: ruthless but cool. Other characters are Mumbles (Dustin Hoffman) with challenges, music 88 Keys (Mandy Patinkin) and The Kid (Charlie Korsmo). There are also Charles Durning, James Caan, Dick Van Dyke, Estelle Parsons, Catherine O'Hara, Seymour Cassel, Paul Sorvino and Kathy Bates. <br /> <br /> Oh, wait a minute. I have not even explained the plot! The story is related to Tracy's attempt - and so far failed - to find a way to catch Big Boy. At the same time, bizarre events take place in the city, to which answers may be, but not necessarily, closer than everyone thinks. <br /> <br /> Of course, the most important thing about this movie is that watching is fun. If Warren Beatty had trouble keeping his age, he did it well. "Dick Tracy" is one cool movie.
