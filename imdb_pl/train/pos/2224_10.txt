The female kata (played by the sexy Jennifer Thomas II) has a great job, fulfilling all the fantasies of all men on the death row before they meet their creator. And what a way. Luckily, this movie is not real, or we would have many more people in this world on death row. <br /> <br /> It starts really slow. Low and bad action, like most movies (B). It's getting better when it's moving. And it ends with a bang. <br /> <br /> I would rate it very highly on cheap, very sexy movies from the 90's. It must be seen when the children are away or in bed.
