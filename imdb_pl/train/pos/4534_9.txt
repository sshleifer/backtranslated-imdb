Loosely designed as a satire D.W. Griffith's intolerance, The Three Ages was Buster Keaton's first attempt in full-length comedy. The only similarities to Intolerance are the opening scene of the "book" and the fact that similar stories over the centuries have been edited together into a complete movie. Keaton's reasoning to appropriate this style was that if he failed to make a feature film, it would be possible to reduce it to three two-rollers. Fortunately, The Three Ages works great as a comedy and contains some of the funniest routines I've seen in any of Keaton's films. There is nothing special or daring in the story. They are simple boys-girls, boy-girls, boys-girls-girls, but satyrs from the era are noisy and set the standard for the future work of Mel Brooks and all the movies of this genre. However, I do not believe that anyone has ever reached the top of this comedy. No one can play a nice fool such as Keaton, and the acrobatics in this movie are his best. In addition, the appearance of Wallace Beery as a rival of Keaton adds charm to this film. Anyone who thinks that a comedy from the 1920s can not be appreciated by contemporary audiences must see this film.
