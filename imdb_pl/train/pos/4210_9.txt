I really liked this movie. All aspects of the film were at the highest level, including the most important, for me, script and acting. This is definitely one of the strongest roles of Richard Widmark. He is completely convincing in his performance. Only out of curiosity, imagine how Humphrey Bogart or Robert Mitchum could cope with this role. This is my first exposure to the work of Jean Peter, which I remember. She made such a great impression on her that I would definitely look for her another job. Thelma Ritter, in an infamous role, deserved the Oscar nomination she received for the informer. This movie works on every level. Black and white photography is perfectly suitable, and history attracts the viewer from the very beginning. Widmark and Peters have great chemistry in their difficult affair. Definitely recommended, 9/10.
