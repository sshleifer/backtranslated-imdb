I do not know how or why this movie has a modest IMDb rating. This film, accompanied by "I am Curious: Blue" is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The only thing that will disappoint you in this movie is that if you do not like the film process, not like psychology or if you were expecting pornographic pornography. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie you want to watch to relax; is a movie you want to see like any other masterpiece, with time, attention and care. <br /> <br /> ****** SUMMARIES, MAY CONTAIN SPOILER OR TWO ******* <br /> <br /> The most important thing in this movie is that it connects the entire movie as part of the movie, but it does it in such a way that sometimes it is forgotten that fictions are not real. <br /> <br /> The movie is like many films in one: <br /> <br /> 1. A political document about the contemporary social system in Sweden. Which in many respects are still valid. Interviews done by a young woman named Lena. <br /> <br /> 2. Narration about the filmmaker, Vilgotie Sjomanie, who creates the film ... deals with the relationship with his star in the movie and how he should never have been involved in working with people with whom he is supposed to work . <br /> <br /> 3. The movie that creates Vilgot. It is a young woman named Lena (IE. # 2) who is young and very politically active, makes a documentary (IE. # 1). She is also of age and her sexuality and the freedom of this. <br /> <br /> The grandeur and purity of "I am Curious: Yellow / Blue" is how the three elements are connected to each other. In an instant you watch an interview about politics, and the next you watch what the interviewer does behind the scenes, but it does so well that sometimes you forget that it is a narrative. <br /> <br /> Another thing is the dynamics between "yellow" and "blue", which if you see it, you have to see the other one. "Blue" is not a continuation at all. I will try to explain it as best as I can because, according to my knowledge, no other films have done it, although it is a great technique. <br /> <br /> Think about the "yellow" as a living thing, real events in the 14th stage. A complete story. <br /> <br /> Think about "Blue", because all the things IN 14 BETWEEN 14 scenes in "Yellow", which you have not seen, is a complete story in itself. <br /> <br /> Essentially, these are parallel movies ... the same story, told in two different ways. <br /> <br /> It was only when I saw the first 30 minutes of "Blue" that I fully understood "Yellow" <br /> <br /> I hope it was helpful for people who are discouraged by different influences because this movie changed the way you look at the movie. <br /> <br /> Thank you for your time.
