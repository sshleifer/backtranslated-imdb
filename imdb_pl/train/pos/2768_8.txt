In addition to the wooden delivery of Susan Hayward throughout the film, it was as good as any bible movie. Henry King deals with this film with respect for the epic in all small scenes, and Peck is as good as ever. The moving sound score of Alfred Newman, with the twenty-third psalm moving, is unforgettable even after many years. The Goliath scene is a bit hokey, but not so bad in the era in which the movie was made. This goes hand in hand with the smaller biblical epics of the day, "Ruth's Song" and "Esther and the King." It is worth seeing, and Raymond Massy is perfect as a prophet Nathan. The film is complemented by always excellent James Robertson Justice as Abishai and Jayne Meadows as Michol, the first wife of David.
