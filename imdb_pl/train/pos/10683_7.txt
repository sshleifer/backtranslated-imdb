It's better than the average silent movie and it's still worth seeing if you're a fan of silence. However, if you are not yet a fan of this genre, I suggest you try a few other movies before watching this one. This is because the plot seems quite old-fashioned and hard to believe. But still, it's still a good movie and I was interested in it. <br /> <br /> Nice lady unfortunately ran into the wrong man and escaped to marry him. The film begins five years later, when she realized that she was a really brutal thief. Still, he tries to get the most out of it and not dwell on how good life was before this moron entered her life. However, the rent is due and there is no money, so you are forced to look for a job. She becomes a personal dressmaker for a rich woman whose husband is trying to make a business deal. Unfortunately, the lady with whom they tried to connect the potential client for dinner can not do it, and the seamstress is extensively rewarded for the date of the man. Well, like Cinderella, he's cleaning up pretty well, and the man is infatuated with her! What to do now - considering that he is married, and a new boy wants to marry her ?! Well, look at the movie itself to see how it all was resolved. I did not like how they dealt with my husband because it seemed terribly predictable and banal. However, when he did not succeed, I admire how the film also did not give up the finale by numbers and left the film with a few loose ends. <br /> <br /> In total, a very good movie that is worth seeing, but certainly not great.
