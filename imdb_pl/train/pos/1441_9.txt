Performed both gracefully and gracefully, Al Pacino once again collaborates with director Sea of ​​Love, Harold Becker. <br /> <br /> As mayor of New York John Pappas at City Hall. <br /> <br /> A clever thriller, which is the first film ever made in the structure of lower Manhattan, which is zero for the city government. <br /> <br /> The fact that other NYC locations provide vivid settings as the idealistic adviser to the mayor (John Cusack) follows in the footsteps of subversion and concealment that can return to the man he serves and worship. <br /> <br /> Bridget Fonda, Danny Aiello, Martin Landau, Tony Franciosa and David Paymer add more starry brilliance to this thrilling power story. <br /> <br /> And power for power.
