If you still remember this summer, when you had your first kiss, first boy / girl or first puppy out of love ... this movie is for you! OK, so this movie will not win an Oscar, but as a Dominican I loved ... there are a few things in the movie that can get you straight in the eyes if you're not part of the culture ... children are brought up by grandma who is both a mother and and father, the youngest son is an infant and canned bath with Cafe Bustelo (baaaaaaaa Dominican!), Judy harassed by local men, walking to church and lighting a prayer candle ... the glow of the film was in these tiny details. It is true that it was not an extravagant, extravagant work, but it was not meant to be NOR if it was to be an educational tool for people wanting to learn about Latin culture (advice: instead of meeting new friends). A more bitter-sweet, artificial documentary, this film kept him in a real state without being too serious. As in the tradition of "Y Tu Mama Tambien" it was a story about the arrival of one boy. I recommend (especialmente si eres Dominicano!) = O)
