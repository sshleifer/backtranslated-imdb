The brilliant over-acting of Lesley Ann Warren. The best dramatic hobo lady I've ever seen, and the love scenes in the clothing store are second to none. Corn on the face is a classic, as good as anything in the Burning Saddles. The approach to lawyers is also great. After accusing him of taking over, selling his boss and being a dishonest lawyer, Pepto Bolt shrugs indifferently, "I'm a lawyer," he says. Three funny words. Jeffrey Tambor, the favorite of Larry Sanders' later performance, is also fantastic as a crazy millionaire who wants to crush the ghetto. His character is more hostile than usual. The hospital scene and the scene in which the homeless enter the demolition site are the classics of all times. Look at the stage of legs and two great diggers fighting (one bleeds). This movie is getting better every time I see it (which is quite common).
