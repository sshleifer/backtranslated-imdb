I recently saw this movie in Winnipeg - the right one considering the location. First, I read Lawrence's book from the 70s and for me it has always been a very strong picture of attempts to grow older in our society. It sounded when I was young and now resonates even more. When the movie appeared, I wanted to see if history can survive. and he was extremely impressed, especially with Ellen Burstyn's performance. She manages to give us a complete human being, even though the character is generally corrupt and judgmental - someone you do not want to live with. It's great to see how favorite characters come alive so authentically.
