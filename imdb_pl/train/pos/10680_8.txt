As is usually the case with Great Britain, when there is a funny and / or successful sit-com or quiz series, Yanks will come and cook the format and produce their own, grossly worse version. Man About The House is not an exception to this rule, of course. The Yanks (Three's Company) version was impossible to observe, braindead pap, which seems to work forever. A perfect example of quantity over quality (non-existent). The original is, on the other hand, an affectionately remembered jewel, which clever (like Fawlty Towers) pulled out the plug exactly at the right time (as opposed to the 637 episodes of "gaiety" invented by Three's Company). Jo was adorable, Roper's genius chemistry, Richard O'Sullivan made everything look so easy, scripts, though they were not Oscar Wilde's standards, they were invariably ridiculous, and Chrissy was THE MOST dead woman who walks the face of this planet because the Dead Sea was just bad. Nuff said.
