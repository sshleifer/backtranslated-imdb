This one will get reviews all over the map because it does not fit into any form. It's horror - but not nonsense. It is a part equal to a part of the suspense and horror - but without the usual Hollywood screams and violent camera. <br /> <br /> The film's touch is slow and there are no special effects because I think you should listen and watch the characters' faces. <br /> <br /> Forget that Brendan is a graduate of the Buffy universe. It's red herring. He works here. "Camp" is a misreading of the tone of this story. Adrienne Barbeau gives solid performance - so he must believe that the script has something to say. We all know apologies in which the actors seem not to care anymore and wait for the director to snap and withdraw. This is not the case, here. <br /> <br /> Forgive that the bodies begin to fall with almost mondo-funny regularity. I do not think that the intention is humorous - but that you do not get off your feet. <br /> <br /> Think about it less about the horror film "Film" and more about the "games" of horror on this scene - this rotten whitewashed house. Then you can see that it really is about paranoia, fear and spiral madness set in an isolated place in the USA. <br /> <br /> And it's winding. Time travel, mind control, secret experiments and Nazis who can NOT be worried. . .yet. <br /> <br /> I am talking about renting and I will try if you feel like something small. It would be a good choice for Saturday midnight.
