Let me say that I am a huge fan of zombies, so I do not say such statements as above. Secondly, let me say that it is an Italian zombie movie, and that Fulci directed 15 minutes before telling Bruno (Rats, Night of Terror) Mattei. This is not the dawn of dead people. <br /> <br /> That being said, this is one of the most entertaining zombie movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The script is wonderfully awful. Check out two scientists trying to find an antidote ("Let's try to connect these two molecules"). <br /> <br /> Zombies come in all varieties. From whacking cleavers, through maniacs with a machete, to birds! <br /> <br /> Gore is abundant. Legs are chewed, hands are amputated, stomachs break. <br /> <br /> The pace is fast, from one zombie attack to the next. <br /> <br /> Then there's a head in the fridge. Oh, head in the fridge! One of the greatest moments in horror, since Ash got his hand in Evil Dead 2. <br /> <br /> You should already know if you are the person who likes this movie. Take some buddies and some beer, and you'll be on a fun night. <br /> <br /> Did I mention the head in the fridge?!?!?
