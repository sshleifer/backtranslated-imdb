I understand that Paramount wanted to film it with the results of Rodgers and Hart, but he could not solve the problems with copyright, so Burke and Van Heusen, who wrote the most songs for Bing Crosby, made a very nice result. > <br /> I read Leonard Maltin saying that this film "matches Crosby like gloves" and I could not put it better. No, it's not the satire of Marek Twain, it's Bing Crosby, and in 1949 Crosby was the banking star in Hollywood. Once Paramount used a color technician, and Rhonda Fleming has never been more beautiful on the screen. She was a woman for whom technicolor was invented. <br /> <br /> The origin of William Bendix from Brooklyn is a bit different, but it is a good comic effect. Trios Crosby, Bendix and Sir Cedric Hardwicke are having fun with Busy Doing Nothing. Bing has one of his patented optimistic philosophical numbers from If You Stub Your Toe On The Moon. The third song that he sings Once and For Always and with Rhonda Fleming. This song was nominated for the best song but lost to Baby It's Cold Outside. <br /> <br /> It's also nice that Bing managed to record the result for Decca with Rhonda Fleming, Bendix and Hardwicke. <br /> <br /> In this movie, I like the fact that it shows Crosby's comic talents without Bob Hope. I like photos from Road, but Bing was a comic talent to myself, and this movie demonstrates better than any other. <br /> <br /> This is Crosby at the top of your game.
