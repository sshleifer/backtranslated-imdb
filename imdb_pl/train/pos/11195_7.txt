The title has many meanings - boxing ring, where there are differences and complaints, wedding ring, where Mabel feels trapped, and Jack feels that his troubles will end, and the cause of trouble is a bracelet similar to the ring that Bill gives Mabel as a token of love. <br /> <br /> Former professional boxer, Danish Carl Brisson, began his career in Alfred Hitchcock's films in The Ring. A very young Ian Hunter, who had such a long career in films, plays Bob Corby, who attracts the eyes of a pretty girl, Mabel (Lillian Hall Davis) in a funfair. It happens that she is engaged to Jack Sander (Carl Brisson) "One Round", but that does not stop her from flirting with Bob. Bob is convinced to go "one round" with Jack. He goes a few rounds and wins - he is a professional boxer, and he and his manager came to the fair to find out if Jack is such a good player, as they have heard. He proposes to take Jack, and Jack leaves, along with his coarse trainer (the great Gordon Harker), to make a fortune with plans to marry Mabel when he is well. Jack wins his fight and marries Mabel the next day, but the deep attraction she and Bob feel about each other still exists. Jack is suspicious and puts everything into his training so he can fight Bob for his wife. <br /> <br /> Finally a boxing movie in which the hero does not get off the track - Bob behaves and does everything that can be a champion - if only Mabel acted in the same way !!! She left him for Bob - and the fight at the end is powerful. This is very realistic - it takes the last 20 minutes of the movie. From being raw and enthusiastic, Jack is almost knocked out - then between rounds, joining Mabel, gives him the courage to triumph. The question is: why would he even want her back - from the very beginning she did not think about starting a romance with Bob - why would not she do it again? <br /> <br /> The film is full of symbolism. Jack, shaking the promoter's hand, changes his hands on Mabel, accepting Bob's bracelet. When Jack puts the ring on Mabel's finger, Bob's bracelet slides down over her shoulder. In the end, Jack sees the reflection of Mabel in a bucket with a water ring, which gives him confidence. It's an excellent movie that will not let you down. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
