Like Tarzan the Ape Man (1932), only more. There's more of everything, more animals, more diverse African tribes and scenes where there must be thought, if it were good with three or four lions, forty would be better. Tarzan is struggling with crocodiles, the crocodile machine turns in water like a roller, around and around, flapping its jaws. Tarzan can kill him with his ubiquitous knife, if the blown up lizards stop. Tarzan kills lions and rhinos and a constantly growing number of animals. His friends are real chimpanzees, people in larger monkeys and elephants. In fact, they use Indian elephants much more friendly and trained than African elephants - with costume ears attached to their heads. Human history: another white man, worse than the rest, appears to join Holt to go on ivory from the elephant cemetery. Tarzan will not show them the way, so the bad guy shoots the elephant so they can follow him to the deathbed. Will Tarzan intercede and the bad guy shoots him? But, of course, he survives and returns to save Jane. Everyone else is dying, Holt and the bad guy and each of their "boys". People are superfluous, especially Africans, and there does not seem to be much distinction between the black co-religionists who are dying because they work for white men traveling through the taboo country and those black people who kill them. This must be Tarzan's last film before the Hays code will make Jane wear more clothes. There are many underwater scenes in which Jane swims naked and although the light flickers, the movement and flashes are very attractive. Apparently one of Weismuller's friends from the Olympic swimming team made naked scenes, not Maureen O'Sullivan. She, however, moves in the film in the same type of loincloth that Weismuller wears (plus top bikini), showing a great look at the thigh and hip. They still do not have to talk a lot. They sleep together and spend time with cool animals and stay away from the cities. No wonder they are happy.
