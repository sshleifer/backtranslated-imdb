Monarch Cove was one of the best dramas of Friday evening shown for a long time. I am asking the writer to write a long series and aired it on Lifetime, SOON. Each person was very interesting and did a great job with their lines to make the story come true. However, the movie has to last a long time. I would like to see how Bianca's and Jake's child grows up and plays a major role in the film, along with new grandparents planning her educational future. Bring Kathy back to her niece and help her in her life. It was great to see how grandparents solve their problems, but the family business had to be brought back to work and see how Jake and Bianca are going through a marriage of years.
