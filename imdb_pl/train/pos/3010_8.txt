The final performance of William Powell as Philo Vance appears in The Kennel Murder Case, where the murder of a master show dog leads to two more murders and one attempt of the human race. Everything points to how it leads to who and why. <br /> <br /> The murders of Philo Vance SS Van Dine were then the most popular and clever Mr. Van Dine invented a way to sell his books individually to the highest bidder. That's why you see so many Philo Vance and so many studies that put them on. If Bill Powell did not gain more fame with MGM as Nick Nick of the Thin Man series, he would be known as the biggest of Philo Vances. <br /> <br /> It turns out that Powell has entered his little Captain terrier in the same competition in which the murdered dog entered, and then another rival became the first victim of the murder. As usual, Powell appears as Eugene Palette as Sergeant Heath, whose greatest contribution to the proceedings was to use the mass to break the closed door from the inside, where the first victim of the murder was found. <br /> <br /> I said inside and that was the top story, so I was wondering how. Powell has a lovely group of suspects, as large as ever, in the secret of the Thin Man. People like Paul Cavanaugh, Helen Vinson, Ralph Morgan, and Mary Astor are doing their part well. <br /> <br /> Warner Brothers liked this version so much that in reality they re-made it in the 1930s with James Stephenson in his one and only appearance as Philo Vance. There is no candle in it. <br /> <br /> Because this is the only Powell Philo Vance, which is available on VHS or DVD at any price, see this one or get it if you can.
