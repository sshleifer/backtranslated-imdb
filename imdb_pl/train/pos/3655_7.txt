De Sica becomes one of my favorite directors, but this one was a hit for me. A smiling idiot becomes the leader of a community of illegal settlers in a deserted area outside of Milan. This is a detailed and shining story of innocent poor masses, full of evil capitalists and happy police forces, but slowly evolving into a magical fantasy story, as the boy wonders if Toto develops the unlimited power of superheroes. After 10 minutes I was dealing with the always smiling Toto, and when magic took over, I stayed in the dust. There were so many wonderfully arranged shots, so many good characters among settlers, that I still thought that it was a waste, that the film was not more serious with its material. The coupling of neo-realism and fantasy comes out more as a "see-what-we-can-also-do-mom" -type experiment rather than a fully developed song / art.
