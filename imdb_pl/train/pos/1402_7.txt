Contains spoilers <br /> <br /> "Hollow Man" is probably the weakest film Paul Verhoeven, director of great films such as "Total Recall", "Starship Troopers" and "Robocop" ever made. <br /> <br /> It's probably not his fault. For some reason, Verhoeven got stuck with a mediocre script and used it best. <br /> <br /> The first part of this movie is rather good, with many cynical jokes, great special effects, and even Skunk Anansie on the soundtrack. Unfortunately, the movie falls flat in the second part, if it turned into a standard slasher movie or maybe a very bad Alien clone. The ending is especially funny <SPOILER> because Kevin Bacon comes back to life after many incidents that should (in a logical sense) kill him. </ SPOILER>. The whole thing is really shallow: the subject of becoming invisible is never fully explored. <br /> <br /> But all in all, Verhoeven manages to keep well above average with this film. <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 out of **** stars
