Often misunderstood Zabriskie Point is Antonioni's political film, Antonioni's American film. Stylistically follows "Blow-Up", which means that the tempo is faster than in previous epos, though certainly no less idiosyncratic. <br /> <br /> Essentially, the common mistake is that the film glorifies the hippie generation. Not so. <br /> <br /> Both heroes come from very different backgrounds. Mark from "rebellious" youth, Daria from the corporate real estate agency. But in Antonioni's real fashion, both are alienated, and both try to escape from the surroundings. Mark leaves the meeting of rebellious students and the Black Panthers, disappointed by the empty rhetoric, while Daria is still worried about his car. <br /> <br /> Antioni, the main director, after presenting the rebellious youth as confused and shallow, then moves to the city. Environment saturated with corporatism, billboards ads, senselessness, which must constantly expand to satisfy a similar expansion of the population, while generating profit. It's an environment that both heroes flee from, though it seems to be a coincidence. <br /> <br /> Indeed, when Daria stops in a small village on the outskirts of the desert, the environment is just suffocating, and people were just as lost cases, the best example being the old boxing champion, now brought back to the shadow of himself, sitting with beer, smoking and talking nonsense. Stunning melancholy sequence, even more powerful thanks to the inclusion of half wild children living around, brought by some "benefactor", but "destroying a real piece of American history." Antonioni's opinion about hippies is not very unclear. Only a half-positive look at the canvas of human alienation. <br /> <br /> And then there is a desert, a landscape accustomed to the destructive effect, in turn pure and frightening, primordial, wild and dead. The sequence in which two heroes love each other, "combined" in a fantasy generation of "flowers", reflects a similar sequence in the "Red Desert", where Giuliana tells her son a story. It's a colorful break in a colorless landscape. Living half-fantasies in suffocating reality. <br /> <br /> The ending probably belongs to the pantheon of great endings in the cinema, a Western civilization torn to pieces. Katarsis, exorcism. <br /> <br /> Two "international" films by Antionioni (British "Blow-Up" and American "Zabriskie Point") are less effort than previous masterpieces, but mainly because of faster pace and inevitably invented settings (swinging London, floral power of America). But when it comes to it, it's clear that he did not lose his advantage.
