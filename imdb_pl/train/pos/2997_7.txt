William Powell is Philo Vance in The Kennel Murder Case, a 1933 film starring Mary Astor, Paul Cavanagh, Eugene Palette, Helen Vinson and Ralph Morgan. The exhibition in which Philo entered his Scottish terrier, the Captain serves as a background for a closed secret room with too many suspects. The secret is very clever, and the solution is complicated and interesting. Because the gadgets are still quite young, the camcorder's work is a bit static, but Michael Curtiz does a good job directing the action. <br /> <br /> The supporting staff is excellent; the cast casts the film. Many actors have played Phil Vance, including Paul Lukas, Basil Rathbone, Wilford Hyde-White, Edmund Lowe, James Stephenson, Alan Curtis, Warren William and others. Powell played it the most (five times) and is best suited to the role - very relaxed, but also serious. It was done before "The Thin Man" catapulted him to the big star - he spent about 12 years in the movie, starting his career on the stage in 1912 at the age of 20. An extraordinary man, an extraordinary presence on screen and an extraordinary actor who lived to be almost 92 years old. We are lucky that his films are available on DVD and TCM today. "The case of breeding killings" is a great story and a funny movie - do not miss it.
