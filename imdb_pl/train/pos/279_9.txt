I love the way this game can make you literally jump out of your seat during the game. The way the screen jumps and flashes when you get hit is very realistic, and at the same time you have to remember that it's just a game, not quite. The sound effects and sound are amazing. There are many types of weapons and various casting spells, and you can even choose which spells are to be stronger. You get this stone that can fend off enemies while you regain mana to blow enemies into even greater magic. The best part is that you are very nervous all the time and you are afraid of what may lurk in the next corner or what may pop out for you. If you want to get full experience, try to play on it using headphones.
