Garde à Vue must be seen many times to understand what hints it contains. If you are not used to French verbal movies, based on conversation and fighting for cunning, not to action, do not even try to watch it. You will get boredom only to death and you will calm the opinion that French movies are not for you. <br /> <br /> Garde à Vue is a verbal film, basically based on dialogues (written by Audiard on the occasion), and it cruelly cuts through the curtain of appearances. <br /> <br /> Why Maître Martineau (Serrault) prefers to be wrongly accused of being a murderer of children than telling the truth? Because during the murder he was with an 18-year-old girl with whom he has an 8-year-old sexual relationship. His wife knows, he is jealous of this, and he prefers to be executed (in 1980 there was still the death penalty in France), instead of revealing the only "pure and innocent" aspect of his pathetic life.
