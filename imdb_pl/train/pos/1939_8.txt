I do not know why I chose this movie to watch, it has a strange title, and from the description it just looked different. Every now and again, it's good to try a movie that is slightly different from the mainstream Hollywood character / thriller, and this movie certainly was different. From the very beginning, this movie intrigued me, but I could not understand why until the end when the movie, when I realized that the movie is great, because the characters were so real. I thought acting was great, and the character development really makes you care about them and I hope that in the end everything will turn out to be good for them. I think that anyone who watches a movie can somehow refer to one of the characters, and that makes watching great, and some laugh at the pure ordinariness of the actors. <br /> <br /> At the climax of the movie you will definitely feel good and will stay with the feeling "things will be OK". I am sure that it will have a broad meaning and give him a chance.
