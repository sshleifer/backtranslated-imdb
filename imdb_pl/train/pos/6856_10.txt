It's a strained, tense masterpiece by Brian De Palmawith, amazing performances all around! He is extremely uncertain and often frightening, and the result is fantastic, and all characters were amazing. Yes, it often spoils Psycho, but it is still a great horror / thriller, with a fantastic opening and a shocking and unpredictable finale! This is without a doubt one of the best horrors / thrillers I've ever seen, and the elevator scene is one of the most memorable scenes in history, and Michael Caine is simply amazing! The ending is great, and the hospital scene at the end is absolutely terrifying, and in the end I'm shocked! It never disappointed me, and the stem sequences are absolutely brilliant, and Nancy Allen and Keith Gordon had fantastic chemistry! It's a tense, tense masterpiece of Brian De Palma, with amazing performances all around! The direction is amazing! Brian De Palma does an amazing job, with amazing camera work, amazing angles, fantastic color use, amazing zooming in and out of great POV photos and keeping the film going very fast! There is some blood. We get bloody stabs, knifing, bloody gunshot wounds and 2 bloody throat cut. Acting is amazing! Michael Caine is AMAZING here, he is amazing in the acting department, terrifying, he is very nice, he was mysterious and really just did an amazing job overall I loved him! (Cain's rules!). Angie Dickinson gives an unforgettable performance here and she was quite beautiful, and she had good chemistry with Caine. Nancy Allen is AMAZING GORGEOUS! And she's fantastic here, she's extremely nice like a prostitute, she's had great chemistry with Keith Gordon and she's staged a huge show! Keith Gordon is very good as a kid, he had excellent chemistry with Nancy Allen and he was very nice! Dennis Franz is good as a detective. In general, this is undoubtedly one of the best horror movies ever made, and I say that you immediately drop what you do and see it! ***** with 5
