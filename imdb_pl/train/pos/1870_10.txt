This movie is great! It touched my stone cold heart. I could not refer to racial discrimination that Antwone experienced because I live in my country. I think it is really difficult to be discriminated against. <br /> <br /> We watched this movie in our sociology class at New Era University and I did not know it was a real story, I thought it was just created by an intellectual who wants to bring fresh air into the industry. This is very good. <br /> <br /> This part of me was shocked when Nadine abused Antwone (who was only six) sexually. If I was on his shoes, I could jump on the ten-storey high building. I greet him for being so strong! <br /> <br /> The scene that moved me here is the moment when Antwone finally saw his mother Eva face to face. He did not give her or anything, instead he told her about the achievements he had acquired over the long years they had been separated. (I think I will do it when I have the chance to trace my roots.)
