For the first time I saw this mini-series many years ago on British television and immediately captivated me. This surprised me because I am not a big fan of either "Jane Eyre" or "Wuthering Heights"; I consider the protagonist of the former to be hypocritical, and the latter work as an exaggerated slap. <br /> <br /> "Tenant of Wildfell Hall", like the aforementioned works, is also somewhat depressing in parts. The darker parts of the film were however compensated by the excitement of Helen's escape, the breathtaking wild and beautiful Yorkshire landscape, and the sexual magnetism of Toby Stephens. <br /> <br /> This movie successfully presents the frustratingly restrictive lifestyle of all women at the time. At best, they suffered from a small domestic tyranny presented by treating women in the Markham home. At the other end of the scale is the unfortunate Helen, who married a rich, high-skilled man, but is exposed to brutality and humiliation alternating with long periods of neglect. He escapes and experiences a short moment of freedom, but as a mysterious woman living alone in a rural community, he inevitably becomes subject to malicious rumors and speculation. <br /> <br /> Tara Fitzgerald is excellent as a long one - Helen Markham suffers. She is not only incredibly beautiful (despite this terribly unflattering hairstyle) with the most amazing cheekbones, but she is also capable of playing the main role in the film. Tara is dignified and reserved, and at the same time allows us to see that Helen is still dangerously vulnerable to attacks. Rupert Graves is a depraved and, at the same time, interesting Arthur Huntingdon - after seeing him, I never imagined another actor playing this role. Pam Ferris deserves special mention for the role of indulgent mother Gilbert, like the actress who played his sister Rose, and Simon Carter, who is an inexorable vicar who likes good things in life. Finally, I was able to watch this movie only for Toby Stephens; he is handsome, durable, sexy, sensitive (but not in a nauseating way). I am not even sure if he is a good actor, because my hormones stop me from objective judgment! <br /> <br /> If there is a fault in the film, the use of the flashback that I felt disturbed the flow of history and made it somewhat misleading. Other people who watched the movie with me also had problems with it, and I found that I needed to explain to them that certain scenes were in fact retrospective. <br /> <br /> I am extremely grateful to those responsible for making this film. I not only paused the video (a rare event), but it led to the purchase of the great novel by Anne Bronte. Of course it was better than the movie, but only a narrow margin. I recommend that everyone interested will watch the movie, and then read the book in that order. <br /> <br />
