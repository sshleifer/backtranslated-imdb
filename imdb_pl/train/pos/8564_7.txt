I do not expect this film to be well understood by viewers from outside Romania. Says it certainly about the value, and perhaps about the lack of universality of the film, but also talks about how in Romania the history and even the lives of ordinary people differed in comparison with other countries, even in Eastern Europe. <br /> <br /> The film is an adaptation of the novel Marina Predy, a controversial novelist who died during the communist regime shortly after the publication of the book. He tells the story of an intellectual, a professor of philosophy whose life is crushed after being imprisoned for false accusations at the end of the Stalinist era. Essentially, the first part of the film tells the story of his struggle for survival in prison, the second describes his attempt to regain his life after his release. His release is actually only apparent, Romania of the 1960s asks him for various types of compromises and crimes, but his struggle for survival is as difficult as morally, as in prison. <br /> <br /> The film is superbly played by some of the best Romanian actors. Stefan Iordache, who has a major role, would be at a different time, and another place would be a superstar, we can get a good look at his wonderful acting art. The film, although it suffers from undecided stories and sometimes collapses in irrelevant details or comics of a character, is still an important turning point for Romanian cinema, as well as for the process of recovering moral and historical values ​​in Romanian society.
