First of all, female lead is too beautiful to miss. Now actress Wang Zu Xian, who played Xiao Qian in the film, is 42 years old and is elderly. It is always good to look through these glorious times when we watch such old school productions in Hong Kong. <br /> <br /> The film is one of the most influential titles from the 80's. The decoration of the artistic set and other aesthetic aspects are hypnotizing. In a more fantastic way, the film had a black humorous tone. I feel like in a horror movie, but in the end it is not scary, but only fun. <br /> <br /> I had experience translating the second script of "A Chinese Ghotst Story" and thought that this script is decent. However, when I saw this movie, I was disappointed for the first time seeing a movie other than the script, for example on a smaller scale and involving more comic roles. However, it turned out that it is better performed in terms of entertainment. <br /> <br /> If you saw Lord of the Rings, you will notice similarities in this movie to LOTR. The climax is like Miranda Otto's mirror fighting the Witch of the Ring. It's definitely laughter. Bravo!
