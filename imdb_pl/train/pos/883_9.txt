I sat back, watching "Read My Lips", a plate of Freedom Fries. The food was quickly forgotten when I was fascinated by Jacques Audiard's original and wonderful thriller. <br /> <br /> Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) is a secretary at a company that develops large construction projects. In fact, she has serious responsibilities that often do not belong to secretaries, and she is capable and ambitious. And thwarted by the masculine hierarchy that will use it, but will not reward it. <br /> <br /> He's working on building up faster than he can, Carla has to hire a secretary. Go to ex-con and general layabo Paul (Vincent Cassel). He lies about his skills and in fact there is nothing that any legitimate company would require. After Paul's initial serious misunderstanding about Carla's interest, they both became allies. A strange friendship begins. During a feat that would make the real Carla a serious rival in the "Schoolgirl", she surpasses her selfish male opponent at work with Paul's grip. Get out of the rival. <br /> <br /> Carla is practically deaf without her hearing instrument. He hears almost normally. Turns off the hearing aid to isolate yourself from unpleasant sounds and annoying people. She is also very lonely. A heroic make-up effort was created to make it look simple, but it is really beautiful. There is no boyfriend. He takes care of her, so a friend can have communication (this is a French film). Worse and humiliating, he agrees with the girl's request that she spend time somewhere while this married friend has this with her lover in Carla's bed. Not very nice. <br /> <br /> When Carla and Paul get to know each other better, there is a slightly suppressed, larval side of a not so ancient criminal. By the way, there is also a story about Paul's relationship with his conditional release officer who perfectly complements the main storyline and has his own great surprise. <br /> <br /> "Read my lips?" The brilliant Paul realizes that Carla's ability to read lips, even from a distance, is more than a fun salon trick that appears to be first. <br /> <br /> Hence the caper grows. It's enough to say. <br /> <br /> Paul and Carla are a real criminal couple. He wants love, but he will also take the money. He wants it, in a sense, but business must come before the possible erotic saturation. Together, Cassel and Devos are strong actors who very convincingly carry an extraordinary crime story. <br /> <br /> Rent it or buy it, but if you like a good crime story, choose "Read my lips". And you may want to watch it several times: me. <br /> <br /> 9/10
