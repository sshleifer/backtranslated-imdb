Star Trek: Hidden Frontier is a long-acting online movie for fans, made entirely out of love for the series, and must watch for Trek fans. The production quality is exceptionally high in the case of a film for fans, although sometimes it can be stated that they are ecological. However, this does not differ from the general experience. CGI ships are fantastic, as are the scenes of space battles ... On the other hand, in earlier episodes (and even occasionally in newer ones) I could say that some actors / actresses do not feel well Roles, but once again it does not deviate from the general experience of new Star Trek interpretations. The cast and crew really came up with something special, and as a whole I highly recommend this series to the fans of The Next Generation and Deep Space 9.
