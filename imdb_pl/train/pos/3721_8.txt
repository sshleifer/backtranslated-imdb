It was one of the best war movies I've seen, because it focuses on heroes more than on a real war. Everyone is doing a great job, and because most of them are unknown, everything seems more reliable. The footage from the camera is great, as are the stimulation and editing. This movie will actually reach you and make the audience look after charcottes.
