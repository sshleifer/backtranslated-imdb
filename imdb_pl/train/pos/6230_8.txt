1936 was the most prolific year for Astaire and Rogers. Their second film for RKO is the third film from this collection? "Follow the Fleet" by Marek Sandrich. This time, Astaire is painfully uncomfortable like Bake Baker, a sailor on vacation, who just goes to the dingy cafeteria on the waterfront, where Sherry Martin (Rogers) utters romantic sweets in everyone's ears. Yes, did you guess? they're hot again. Only this time sister sister Sherry, Connie (Harriet Hillard), threatens the whole beautiful romance, falling in love with a reliable sailor Bake, Bilge Smithie (Randolph Scott); in a sense, use them and throw the guy out, forcing Sherry to rethink the opinion of all the sailors in general. Irving Berlin gives the class an immeasurable class, a classical note, including the standards "Let Yourself Go", "I put all my eggs in one basket" and "Let's Face the Music and Dance". the latter is a God-inspired skit on suicide, which turns into another immediately recognizable and completely sublime belt deux for Fred and Ginger. <br /> <br /> The transfer to "Follow The Fleet" is slightly weaker. The gray scale remains well balanced, but now it is a bit thick, with not as much tonal variation as the previous titles. Grain is still present. Like age-related artifacts. Once you decide on a slightly dense and sometimes softer image sharpness, the overall impression is more than acceptable for the movie of the year. The sound is mono, but very nicely balanced. The extras include a storyline, a theater trailer and a short topic, but what's strange? no audio comment. Considering the importance of this film in the general canon of Astaire / Rogers, this is an unusual oversight of Warner Home Video.
