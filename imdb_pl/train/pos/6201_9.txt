Henry Fool Hartley Hall was an independent film masterpiece and certainly his best work. It has a huge depth of character, a subtle, complicated dialogue and a perfect emotional ending that captivates. I remember that I stopped him several times during the first watching to absorb what I saw and felt. Henry Fool was a complete movie from the beginning to the end and did not require a continuation. <br /> <br /> So I was surprised when I heard about Fay Grim. Fay was not one of the main characters in the first movie, and he seemed to exist more as a worrying imposition of vanity and ignorance in the real world that her brother Simon must struggle when he matures. In her own film Fay matures, although her maturity takes a completely different path. Szymon went from almost autistic isolation to only a slightly introverted genius. Fay begins his adult journey as an immature, completely normal, spoiled child and reacts to the attack of funny circumstances, becoming a mature, completely normal, experienced adult who has no benefits. He deals with problems as every man does, with determination, little thought and weariness. While Simon has learned to control his mind, Fay learns to control his emotions. <br /> <br /> The film contains several affectionately memorized elements of its prequel, but differs significantly in tone for the majority of the film. Henry Fool showed you a raw, boring, ignorant world that contrasted with Simon's inner passion and creativity. In Fay Grim, the world is a living, crazy, emotional place that shows the stupidity of her young life, and by contrast she discovers an inner wise woman who has not been developed or nurtured by a similarly weak mother. <br /> <br /> The film consists of two parts, the first of which refers to the beginning of Fay's fight, and then hardening because of authoritarian hostility, and the second concerns her struggle for relaxation only enough to regain Henry. Initially, fans of Henry Fool may wonder how a movie can be considered a sequel, and thinking that it is blasphemy to follow such an intense film with spy freaks and physical comedy. But that's the subtlety of Fay Grim. Continuation tells of Fay's journey and, as I said earlier, her goal is to find life-giving reason in chaos, not creative chaos in orderliness. Parker Posey is a great actress who perfectly captures the language of Hal Hartley. Elina LÃ¶wensohn may overshadow her with emotional involvement in this role, allowing Parker to play both a simple man and a comedian against the live, stage comedy that unfolds around her. <br /> <br /> With Henry's entry into the picture, the film begins to take a sobering turn. All Hal Halley's films are plays, and each game must have a full circle. At the end you showed that Fay's newly developed character and integrity are the offspring of her time with deadly intense Henry, whose keen honesty and unique passion ignites a spark in everyone she meets. <br /> <br /> Fay Grim is an excellent film that does not surpass Henry Fool, but shows that the nuances of his art are proof of his genius. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I think that anyone who makes this film not only missed the point (and especially the subtlety of Parker Posey), but he could not be too interested in the movie, Henry Fool.
