I was very surprised by this film. I was touched by the life touched by Paul to find my "wife", the little girl he was separated from. Humor was also very good and did not hurt the story, just as I thought he would probably do it. Actually, I expected that "paulie wants a cracker" joking to hurt this movie, but even that was done in a very humorous scene that gets very moving when Paul is in a press conference in a research lab. So if you want to see a good movie, "the animal that speaks," check it out, much better than in my opinion, Dr. DOLITTLE. Finally, PAULIE has a surprised surprise that is very well made.
