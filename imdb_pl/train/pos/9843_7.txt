He composed several characters that would not normally be seen together (not to mention, try to save a human child and bring it to your father). They start as enemies and end up as the best friend. If it sounds like a Disney movie, it's (only by 20th Century Fox). The trailer of the movie was one of the best I've seen in ages, but the film does not match the expectations of the set. The problem is that the creators of the film have not decided who is the target audience of the film. Yes, there are jokes in the film that only adults will understand, but the movie is mainly aimed at children. Parents will like the fact that for 90 minutes. their children's attention is focused on something other than on them. The backgrounds are perfect, and the voice is good, but it's nothing more than a nice movie. Children will love this movie, adults will only like it.
