What do you not like about this movie? Every year, you know that during the holiday season you will receive one or two videos on the yule wave, and most of them will be terrible. This film is definitely a new new idea that has been quite well done. A very fun approach to a rich young guy paying his family for simulating a real Christmas. What is the use of having such money if you can not have fun with it. It was a win-win situation for everyone. An ordinary family gets six characters, and a rich guy can experience Christmas as he imagined. Only if. <br /> <br /> Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) was incredibly difficult to bear and it was just a riot to see how the family reluctantly met his absurd demands. It was a fun and funny movie.
