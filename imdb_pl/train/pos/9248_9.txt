Hold Your Man finds Jean Harlow, a working class girl from Brooklyn who falls in love with Clark Gable and is in trouble. The film begins as his movie, but before it ends, the pressure definitely changes to its character. <br /> <br /> The film opens Gable, pulling the street game with his partner, Garry Owen, and a sign screaming cops. Because he is being hunted by Gable's ducks in Harlow's apartment, and being such a lovely guy, he protects him. <br /> <br /> Soon he is connected to it and unfortunately with his rockets. Gable, Harlow and Owen are trying to get the badger out of drunker Paul Hurst, but then Gable will not do it. Of course, when Hurst realizes that this is a fraud, he is still painful and aggressive, and Gable must strike him. But then he landed dead in front of Harlow's apartment and that platinum blonde hair makes it easier to identify her. He enters his partner in the unintentional cause of death. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is her and her adaptation to live in prison. Her interaction with other prisoners gives her very good scenes. I think that part of the material was later used in the classic MGM cage. <br /> <br /> Harlow also performs the title song and it is a flashlight-style ballad, very popular in those days. He speaks / sings it in a way similar to Sophie Tucker and quite well. <br /> <br /> Gable is well manned as a cheater who develops conscience, a part he often played, especially in my favorite movie Gable, Honky Tonk. <br /> <br /> There is still Harlow who will shine in this movie. I think this is one of the best she has done at MGM, her fans should not miss this.
