Sarah Silverman is a dangerous bitch! She is beautiful, sexy, funny and talented, dark and demonic. I have read another "comment" in this program, as well as the content of the forum and people just do not get it. Nothing that appears on T.V. it is not an accident. Too much money, time and work is put up for production of T. V. so that there are errors. This show is stupid because Sarah wanted it to be stupid. This series is a minor, because Sarah wanted her to be a minor. I thought the jokes are great, and the thematic program and other music numbers are wonderfully weird. It is very similar to Playhouse Pee-Wee for the maladjusted, narrow mustache of 20-year-old glue, Future of America from the Valley. The cast is amazing. Scenarios and actions are at a good pace. I hope this concert will be successful because Comedy Central did not let David keep his show. Who is playing Sara's sister? It is not on the list of plans on the program's homepage. I would like to see her performance. Does anyone know about her upcoming concert dates or DVDs that may float there?
