The wooden horse was one of the first "great" stories about the escape from World War II, telling the true story of Eric Williams and others during the escape from Stalag-Lufft III in October 1943. I really like this movie, but I had to do it on the VHS from Amazon in England and pass it from the PAL format in the USA. I read a book when I was in high school, after watching a part of the movie in the early 1960s on TV Drwiny tormenting Peter and Jan trying to escape from Germany during the war is more realistic than escape escapes presented in the Great Escape. This film is a lost treasure that should be more accessible to the American audience.
