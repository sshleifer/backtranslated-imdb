Here is the peculiarity: a contemporary movie about a serial killer who has no battle scenes, no one died, did not race a car and did not hear loud noises ... and takes place in Russia. There are only two short action scenes, but they are terrifying. <br /> <br /> The rest of history is detective work and how much bureaucracy the poor detective had to go to solve the murders. It is a very grim film, and the "grim" best describes the character of the hero (Stephen Rea). However, the story is not depressing and is very interesting all the time. <br /> <br /> Rea is outstanding as a determined, clever-looking detective. Jeffrey DeMunn is simply terrifying as a killer. Donald Sutherland's Russian accent is suspicious, but he plays the only character in this movie that has some warmth. <br /> <br /> Once again the story is peppered with liberal orders, here and there, with one and two references to prejudice against homosexuals, the total validity of secular psychology, police and state officials as prostytutki / primitivist / bigotic, yadda, yadda, yadda. <br /> <br /> Otherwise it's an intelligent and refreshing crime movie. It is quite a unique film that is probably not well known, but is liked by people who saw it. Because it's based on the real account of this killer, it's even more chilling in your veins. Do not give it up just because you do not know anything about it.
