Rating "10/10" Master piece <br /> <br /> A few years ago I heard Spielberg's comment that he would make a film here and there if he had a chance. Well, Mr. Spielberg, I think nothing is perfect, but this movie - along with Schindler's List - is the best. Even Oprah works well in this! <br /> <br /> What interested me most is the realism of the story and drama. Such things have happened and are still taking place in the world.
