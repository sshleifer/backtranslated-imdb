When I saw the dentist, I thought it was very cool. But this movie is not for everyone, especially for people who do not like scenes with bloody scenes, because the dentist has many bloody scenes. That is why it has an R18 rating. It's about a Beverly Hills dentist, Dr. Alan Feinstone, who discovers that his wife Brooke is cheating on him with a poolman. It is best to go to the dentist "before" watching this. But if you do not like going to the dentist anymore, it's best not to watch this because you can put off your life. The dentist has the best bloody revenge I've ever seen. Who has ever seen a movie in which a dentist (Spoiler) pulled out all the teeth of a cheating wife and cut out her tongue without anesthesia? A huge, fantastic movie, but not for everyone.
