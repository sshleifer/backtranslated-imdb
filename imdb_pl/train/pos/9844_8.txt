There are very few movies that are as much fun as this one. I was lucky to watch this movie in a theater "reserved" for lovers of movies like me, so it was not so embarrassing to sit and laugh until my jaw was completely sore, and the sleeves of the shirt were wet from drying eyes ... br /> <br /> Sometimes the story was a bit "slow", but it's probably the best - a little rest between rolling (almost fell from the seat ...) was very welcome.
