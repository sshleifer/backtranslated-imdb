One of the reviewers notices that it does not matter what Welles actually says or does, he moves you. I agree. He was and remains an exceptional force in the film. More than a triple threat that could work, write and direct, he had a genius extremely suitable for the film. You can consider whether he would be a painter at a younger age. This film certainly reinforces this impression. Musician, theater actor, heir to Shakespeare? It's hard to say, but I am very grateful that his time is filming with the movie, and he has it captured on film. I like the accent. I like face, size, style, mind and games. I love all his films and I'd like to have more. I especially like other actors contacting him in the film. Many have never been better or at least in some other way with him because he was definitely there. Even at the end, when his beauty was ruined, perhaps by his own intentions, he could not be ignored and made every scene he was in. The eye goes to Welles, and one wants another minute, the next movie, the next hour in his company. That is why we all want us to come across lost pieces cut from his films, because we know, we all know that there is no part of his unworthy times. Observe this and be grateful for the opportunity.
