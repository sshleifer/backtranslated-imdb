This movie did not let me understand, it is and will remain my favorite movie of all time, mainly because almost all emotions have been spread over 157 minutes. The most difficult thing for me is that when I want to hear the amazing music and songs from the movie, I have to put it in my DVD player, so I was wondering if anyone knows who sings the song in the movie and where they can be found, because I've looked everywhere, I can think sporadically for the last 5 years. My favorite quote from the movie is that in court the lawyer says: "But your own words require direct confrontation, or is it not a direct call to violence?" Biko replies: "Now you and I are confronted, but I do not see violence! ! "<br /> <br /> CRAIG ROBERTSON Fife, Scotland
