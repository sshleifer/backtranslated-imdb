This anime is a must for Evangelion fans. This is an earlier work of Anna Hideaki, but his unrestrained, dramatic style is quite right. Also, those who did not like Evangelion might find the release a bit more enjoyable. Gunbuster is rather unique to science fiction anime because it's based on real science. In fact, the program has several small "science lessons" explaining the physics of some of the events in the film. One of the great dramatic points in the film is the relative passage of time at speeds close to the speed of light. The series is doing a great job dealing with the imaginable traumatic experience of leaving the Earth during a six-month mission, approaching the speed of light and returning to Earth, where ten years have passed. The main character remains aged 17 or 18 in the entire series, while almost all other characters get older. I warn you that this show is sometimes heavy. He also has some of the most undeserved breast pictures I have ever seen. Quite easily, I ignored scant uniforms and boo-hoo scenes, because the series is also very good, but viewers with low SAP tolerance may want to stay away from it. Interestingly, Gainax, as always, ran out of money in the last few episodes. However, they managed to use a black and white film and action sketches to get a good resolution anyway. The ending is a bit stupid, but it left me in such a good mood that I could not resist temptation. Gunbuster is, in my opinion, one of the best pieces of Anime around.
