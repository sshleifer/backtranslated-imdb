I remember watching it in the original in 1962 as a five or six year old, and REALLY enjoying it. I recently had the opportunity to watch it again for the first time since, because it was broadcast in "Walt Disney Presents" on the Disney Channel. I forgot most of it, and some of it was intended for children, but it was still pleasant. I can not wait to show it to my niece and nephews.
