This show was a breakthrough in the American comedy because it was the first sitcom in which the whole African-American cast performed. Unfortunately, it has never been broadcast on British television. <br /> <br /> The Evans family is a poor African-American family living in a tower block. Dad's name is James, he's trying to manage the house, but his wife, Florida, always gives him an edge. Three children are artistic JJ, moody Thelma and young intellectual child Michael. Always a Florida friend Willona's gossip home. <br /> <br /> I watched two episodes of this program on youtube (Black Jesus and Sex and the Evans Family - only two on the site). You may be wondering why the English viewer was watching a series that has never been shown or hardly heard in his country. The answer is this. In 1976, the first British black sitcom named "The Fosters" appeared. Only two series were created, which now seem to be forgotten. But I watched the episode and I was really impressed. Then I found out that the scripts were identical to the "Good Times". They were exactly the same characters, but with different names - Sam Foster was a father, his wife was Pearl Foster, and three children were Sonny (young Lenny Henry), Shirley and Benjamin. Pearl's lucky friend was Vilma. (To read about The Fosters, I wrote a review on this topic). While watching "Good Times" only two things annoyed me. First of all, it was a melody about the opening (horrible) and secondly the audience's laughter. I like laughter from the audience, but someone would say a bit of a funny line and the audience would go crazy and start to clap. Besides, it was a very funny program. Let's hope there are more episodes on YouTube and hopefully someone will release The Fosters on DVD in England. <br /> <br /> The best episode: Sex and the Evans family - episode 1 episode 6 was called Sex in the Black Community. The second episode that I saw, Black Jesus was the title of one episode of "The Fosters"
