"Opening of the Night" issued in 1977. Trying to be ambitious production. It only works in the truly stunning performance of Geny Rowlands. Her character in the theater actress Myrtle is not necessarily someone we love in real life. He is absorbed in himself, often unbearable and makes life unhappy for the people around him - in other words, he is no different from some actresses! Myrtle is also a woman on the brink of collapse - we are not entirely sure if the demons with whom he fights are real or imagined, although we are secretly caught up early. Rowlands is of course well directed by love with her talented husband, actor / director John Cassavettes, who also plays a part in the film. This film is not without flaws - it is too long, and the last part of the movie, in which Myrtle goes to the stage, being very drunk, seems almost cruel. "Improvisation" in some dialogues - at least on stage - takes too long. Some of the supporting characters give good performances, especially from Ben Gazarra who plays a poor Myrtle producer. Joan Blondell's character is never fully developed and I could never understand why she was in the movie, except for the calm of Myrtle. Watch this movie only for Rowlands - it's fascinating all the time - and it's hard to take your eyes off it, although sometimes you'll want to.
