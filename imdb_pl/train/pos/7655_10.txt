Not seeing this movie for about 20 years, I'm still impressed by his strong impact and stellar action. Of course, one of them, Mickey Rooney, is really AMAZING in his role as a "killer" in the lead role. I also remember the jazz-bite note and naked black and white photography. I love Mick's last line before he comes out on a lead poisoning dose (I think Stranglers raised her to the line in one of their songs - Get a Grip on Yourself). Let's get it out! Additional note - the recent magazine "Review of the film" wrote a large article about "Babyface Nelson" Don Segal, which was made several years before "Last Mile", as well as Mickey Rooney. Another delight over Mick's intense and nice performance. Perhaps this is the beginning of a surge of gratitude for really great cinema performances.
