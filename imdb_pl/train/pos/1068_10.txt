I think Dark Angel is great! The first season was perfect and had a good storyline. With Max (Jessica Alba) as a runaway with X-5, a manticore creature, trying to adapt to normal life, but still "saving the world." And hunted by manticore for the whole season, which gives the series extra spice. <br /> <br /> The second season has suddenly become a bit strange compared to the first one. The plot disappeared, and the series lost some of its charm, mainly due to all the strange "creatures" appearing. Do not get me wrong, the second season is good, but with a bit of "mantika". However, they managed to return to the new promising story in the final episodes of season 2, in which I had a lot of hope to see more. <br /> <br /> So I really want them to start creating new episodes. And for that James Cameron can not go wrong. In conclusion, I would say it's a great series, but I still hope for the third season!
