In my opinion, it is much better than in two versions from the 90s, but it is still not that good. It feels outdated, probably because it is, but it does well in comparison to other BBC 1980 tracks such as Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey. <br /> <br /> The length of this adaptation allows a much better adaptation of the book than one from the 2 90's and St John Rivers is at least covered, though not very well. Timothy Dalton is very good as Rochester, but the actress who plays Jane is much too old. There is definitely room for a TV adaptation of this length, which has more than ten voices on it.
