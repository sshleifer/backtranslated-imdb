Alice (Claire Danes) and Darlene (Kate Beckinsale) are the best friends ever and after graduating from school decide to go on a trip to Thailand. Because of the incident, they meet a young, attractive, mysterious stranger who invites them to Hong Kong for the weekend. But at the airport, Alice and Darlene are confused with the heroine of drug trafficking and are sent to prison. Now is the time for the ultimate experience and true friendship. It was a pretty good movie, I saw it a few times and after a while you noticed that there are a few holes in the story, but the movie still provides entertainment. Claire Danes did a great job as usual, she is a great actress. I would give Brokedown Palace 8/10
