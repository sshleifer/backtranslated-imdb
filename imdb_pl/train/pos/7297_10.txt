I really liked this movie. Acting was great, as was the plot. Jeff Combs has more talent than he is recognized. The only part of this movement that I would change was the ending. The death of the creature was too macabre for the Sci Fi channel. <br /> <br /> There are interesting religious messages in this video. Jeff Combs apparently played the character of the Messiah, and the creature (or shark, if you prefer) represented anti-Chirst. There were a few particularly frightening scenes that had "the end of the world". I noticed this only after the third watch of this classic creation function. I know that many people will not relate to Christianity, but if you look closer, you will get it.
