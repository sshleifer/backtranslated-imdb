I do not understand your objections to this film. It is a tense, exciting extension of the character created in the "Basic Instinct". The only part of the story, which is the least unrealistic, is the fact that the character Sharon Stone is still alive and is not in prison at this late date. <br /> <br /> SPOILER ALERT: As the film progresses, we're presented three theories of what's happening: 1) the character Sharon Stone kills all these people because he is crazy (depending on the risk); 2) The crooked policeman David Thewlis kills these people to frame the figure of Sharon Stone; 3) David Morrissey's analyst kills these people for revenge. What disturbs most people in this film is that none of these theories is ever described as a "real" story. (Although the analyst is in a psychiatric care center that kills a police officer, the only killing that takes place on the screen.) <br /> <br /> I think it's a genius story machine in the spirit of "2001, Space Odyssey. "WHO cares about what is real? The blonde is really crazy, the policeman is really crooked, and the analyst really wants revenge. Interactions between these and other characters in history are important. As in real life, everyone is more complicated than anyone thinks, and the reality is more complicated than the movie. End with it!
