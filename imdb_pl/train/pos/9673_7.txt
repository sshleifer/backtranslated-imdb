Paulie sounds like the most saccharine, lachrymose and sentimental trash you can find, but in reality is much better than you would expect. The stupidity of the plot could easily set the tone for the whole film, but in most other sections the film is charming. <br /> <br /> If you're wondering, Paulie is a parrot. Bought for a little girl with speech difficulties, Paulie becomes her best friend and goes with her everywhere. During the speech therapy class, he even sits on her arm and becomes a superintelligent speaker himself. However, Paulie is sent away by the girl's mother and spends the rest of the film trying to get from New York to Los Angeles to reunite with her. <br /> <br /> Why then was this horrible sounding movie successful? First of all, it offers some interesting and impressive animatronic effects. Second (and much more) he dares to accept his absurd premise and tells a truly moving, often moody story, without worrying too much about the obvious flaws of the plot. Thirdly, he has some surprisingly strong performances, including Jay Mohr as a devious cheater, Gena Rowlands as a nice older woman and Cheech Marin (yes, a burning Chee Marin!) As a musical immigrant. This may not be classic, but Paulie is a sound entertainment for children of all ages.
