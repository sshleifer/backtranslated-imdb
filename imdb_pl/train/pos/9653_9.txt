The first love is a desperately difficult subject that can be convincingly used in the cinema: the all-pervasive passion usually ends up as a fake imitation or, worse, somewhat ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Lifshitz manages to avoid all traps and provides a moving, sexy, engaging story of love, catastrophe and possible redemption while simultaneously touching some of the deeper themes of human existence. <br /> <br /> The basic story is an 18-year-old Mathieu, a lonely, introverted boy who meets Cédric, a brasher, more sociable, but equally lonely, during the holidays with his family. When the summer warms up, they fall in love, and when the holidays end, they decide to live together. A year later, the relationship ends with a catastrophe: Cédric cheats Mathieu, who, desperate, tries to take his own life. He will survive and, to regain the perspective of his life, he returns to the seaside town where he met for the first time, this time hidden in the cold of winter. <br /> <br /> If you told such a story, never have such an impact: most of them are implied, everything happens not sequentially. <br /> <br /> A complex narrative is necessary to get a deeper feeling of passion, thanks to the use of counterpoint and time perspective. Fortunately, the three terms used (summer of love, psychiatric hospital after suicide and winter reconstruction) are marked with colors: warm yellows and oranges for the summer, almost terrifyingly cool blue for hospital scenes and warming browns and blues for the winter seaside. <br /> <br /> Both of the main actors have presented themselves perfectly, while it is a joy that Stéphane Rideau (Cédric) got used to his abilities (I am more used to seeing him stretched in the rather inactive drama of Gael Morel), Jérémie Elkaim (Mathieu) must be honored with a special distinction: you can feel his loneliness, and then his almost incredible passion, and then his character falls apart behind the wall of aphasia. Beautifully made gestures reach far beyond the dialogue. <br /> <br /> The topics are almost classical in the French cinema: our difficulty in understanding what a different person feels; our difficulty in full communication; changing sands of meaning? The title of the film "Presque rien" ("Almost nothing") points to all these and even one of the key scenes of the film: trying to understand why Mathieu tried to kill himself, the psychiatrist asks Cédric if he ever cheated on him ?? "No fin enfin, oui u une fois, mais ce n'était rien" (No? Well, once, but it was nothing). Cédric still loves Mathieu? he brought him to the hospital during a suicide attempt (which we do not see) and tries desperately to contact him again when he comes out? but he can not understand that he has lost him forever, because something that seemed nothing to him (a senseless affair) is everything to Mathieu. <br /> <br /> While the film is darker than the rather unfortunate poster by Pierre et Gilles would suggest, it is not without hope: we see Cédric's slow, painful attempts to come back to life, first by the cat he adopts, then by working in local bar and finally contact with Pierre, who may be his next love. But the story ends: teenage passion, during the year, perhaps the beginning. So what was it? Almost nothing? Certainly not when you live?
