This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I have read the book and I liked it, but this movie expands everything that is famous for the book. Acting is fantastic, especially from Jon Voight who plays Sir Sir, a very bad character. This movie has a way of telling a story that keeps you going all the way, all the way to the end, where everything is connected to each other for a wonderful ending. I also love the way it is directed, flashing back and forth between the modern stories and stories of Stanley's ancestors. The story was written by Louis Sakhar, yes, but it seems that this story is made for the film, and Andrew Davis is doing a great job. I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes good movies.
