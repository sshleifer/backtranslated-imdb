WWE Armageddon, December 17, 2006 - Live from Richmond Coliseum, Richmond, VA <br /> <br /> Kane vs. MVP in Inferno match: So this is the fourth match inferno in WWE and it's Kane vs. MVP (I wonder why it was the first match on the card). I only watched the final parts in which Kane burns the MVP butt when they are on the apron, then MVP runs around the arena screaming? the reef eventually extinguishes the fire with a fire extinguisher when the MVP extends around the entrance ramp. A funny and visually quite funny ending. 7/10 <br /> <br /> WWE Tag Team Championship: Initially it was to be William Regal and Dave Taylor, and Brian Kendrick and Paul London (c) in a regular team match. However, GM Teddy Long appears in the ring and announces that it will be a fatal 4-way ladder team match. MNM and The Hardys are thrown in and all of this is chaos. One word to describe this eye opener? Wow. Man, I can not really remember how many places there were in this match, and words can not do it. There was one particularly noteworthy place where Hardys set the ladder in the swing position, and Jeff jumped off the top rope while Matt held the MNM for killing, then WHAM! Nitro flew away, while Mercury apparently spattered him and bled like hell with wounds on his face. He had to be taken, and Nitro continued the match alone. The next point was the moment when Jeff beat London while FLIPPING from the ladder. There were also other breathtaking breathtaking places, too much to remember. London finally unbuts the straps to win this rave show-stealer. 8.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> Boogeyman vs. The Miz: Two men are thrown into the ring and around until the Boogeyman defeats the bombs to ambush, and then drools worms as usual on Miz's lips. 5.5 / 10 for a three-minute incognito. <br /> <br /> US National Championships: Chris Benoit (c) will face Chavo Guerrero in another typical Guerrero match. Some of the good places are the superplex from the highest Chavo rope and the extraordinarily long chain of German suppressors from Benoit. Vicki Guerrero enters the ring with his belt to nail Benoit, but Benoit scares her and takes a long time to decide whether to put her in Sharpshooter or not. Thanks to this, Chavo can go on roll-up, but Benoit throws him again and Chavo is locked up in Sagittarius. End of the game. Nice battle, though sometimes slow. 7/10 <br /> <br /> WWE Cruiserweight championship: Gregory Helms (c) vs. Jimmy Wang Yang for this match, in a fairly moderate match. The match had some good spots? Helms, above all, moves away from the top rope? but the crowd did not seem to be involved after he had witnessed the ladder match, and Yang needed more in the air. Helms won the match after rejecting Yang with a stick on his knee. 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> Undertaker vs. Mr. Kennedy in the last ride: After a series of matches between the two, this time it is the last match, the second of its kind and the winner must lead the opponent out of the arena in the caravan. Pretty good for what those two could offer. Kennedy coped with a lot of Taker, and even freed himself from chokeslam to throw Taker on Armageddon about 15 feet below; and thank God for Kennedy, otherwise it would be brutal. Kennedy almost won, until Taker returned to the hearse (I liked the view of the camera inside the hearse). Taker missed the steel pipe and threw it to Kennedy, but instead he smashed the caravan window, but then he smashed Kennedy with his chair and after that another chokelam and tombstone on the roof of the caravan followed. Kennedy was unconscious, and Taker led him out of the arena to win. I really got interested in the willingness of these guys to take / donate real sick photos. 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> Santa goes to the ring, I go "what the hell?" Like many kids in the crowd, and then the word "lingerie contest" comes to my ear. Break time. <br /> <br /> Batista and John Cena vs. Finlay & King Booker: talk about charisma and technical. This match was actually quite a good main event, with a rush of rational transition from one team to another and maintaining good tension. Even Finlay got the right shots for his opponents this time (I doubted his strength against the champions), and he and Booker could not cheat? except for one place where Booker drove the scepter down his throat. Price. Batista hits Bombe on Booker to win, he did not see F-U; The price he made 5 Knuckle Shuffle and I think he did STFU too. It was probably the best technical game of the evening, and the participants really did what they could, without a ladder 7.5 / 10. <br /> <br /> Being a WWE fan on a regular basis, I have to agree that Armageddon had many eye-catching elements and the ladder match consumed half of the show; In the Last Ride match quite nervous places appeared, and the main event also fell well in its category. All other matches also met their requirements, except for the Boogeyman vs. Vs. The Miz and useless underwear contest. In general, Armageddon was a very nice pay-per-view and despite some serious setbacks in the PPV chronology, Armageddon wishes a goodbye this year. PPV rating: 8/10.
