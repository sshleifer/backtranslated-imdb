Well, in the end it was a nice surprise. his trailer did not foresee a good movie at all, it was even a bit misleading. Part of Jeff Bridges in particular was a positive surprise, well-written, sardonic and funny. However, less real, I do not think a guy who got where he got would show signs of such disrespect for everything that his current company represents. One does not become the best suit, just to doubt it. The end of the film during the Dolce Vita show was too banal, trite and quite disappointing. And of course a guy like Pegg's character would not have survived his first week in such a New York warehouse. I hope one day I will see a decent role written for Megan Fox, here she looked like a poor actress playing bimbo. By the way, I do not understand why he is the "sex symbol" of the year, I see hotter girls on almost every cover of every magazine.
