I saw this movie in 1984, for the first time we started watching "This Is Spinal Tap" and after 5 minutes we were ready to fall asleep. Instead, we went to see this movie. If you have a conspiracy theory in mind, you will want to see it. <br /> <br /> The question you have to ask yourself while watching this movie is: Do you think the government would be able to do it? (In my opinion there is no doubt that they could) <br /> <br /> But I do not want to give away too much information, because it would be a spoiler and I think that you should watch the movie for yourself. <br /> <br /> But to tell you, we're still talking about this movie 20 years later and trying to explain it to people is not the easiest thing in the world.
