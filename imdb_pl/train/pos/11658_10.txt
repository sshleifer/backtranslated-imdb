The first animated feature film from Ireland is also one of the best animated films I've ever seen. It's real warts and the whole story, which does not resemble any of the other Oscar-nominated and any other movie of this or that year. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film has Abbot of Kells, a village in Ireland builds a wall around his city to prevent the Viking from destroying the city if they ever attacked. His nephew, Brendon, is a young monk who does everything in his power, but he meets his uncle's anger by doing things in his own time. When the legendary illuminator Aidan arrives from the ruined monastery, Brendon drifts towards him and his warm personality. Aiden's uncle's astonishment is to teach Brendon how to illuminate. To help Aidan to work on his wonderful book, rescued from his ruined monastery, Brendan goes out into the woods to get the material to make the ink. Outside, he meets Ashley, the spirit of the forest with whom he develops friendship. Unfortunately, the abbot discovers that he has gone beyond the wall and is hell to pay. But the vikings are lurking in the distance ... <br /> <br /> Forget what you think about this movie that you are wrong. Even what I have explained does not do this film justice. This is a simple story in which much more happens. It's a great movie about trying to find your way around the world, about the coming demons and finding the beauty of the world outside the walls. (Because the film says that the world is a dangerous place and does not cease to exist even if you build walls). <br /> <br /> This is a film that treats the audience as adults and deals with all life, including the dark. There is death and destruction, joy and happiness. It is not covered with sugar. People are dying. Monsters lurk. (it frightened some children), but in the end there is hope. Honestly, the darkness in this movie is completely different than in any American movie. Forget about "sadness" in the Pixar movie, it is real, and its refreshing and shows how homogenised it has become even Pixar. <br /> <br /> The animated film Gennda Tartakovsky-esquire (Samurai Jack) looks actually based on Celtic art of that period. It's a movie that looks different than others. Here again is another movie that takes the film frame and uses it in every possible way. Images are designed to fill the available space as much as possible. Often the film manipulated things to make it look like a page in the legendary Book of Kells. Its stunningly beautiful and best described as art comes alive. <br /> <br /> Director Tomm Moore created a movie that is a masterpiece. I can not say more. It's a masterpiece. This is one of the best animated films I've ever seen.
