I will never forget when I saw this title in the video shop back when. I've always been a big fan of Weird Al and when I saw this movie, I rented it and watched it. I was too young to appreciate Al's subtle humor and satire, but I remember it much later when I was old enough to understand what I was watching. If you are a fan of "Al", especially his earlier works, you will enjoy this movie. This is done in the MTV-esque Rockumentary style and tells a real (but sometimes exaggerated) tale of how Al became where he was in 1985. his music.
