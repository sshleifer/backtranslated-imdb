Considering the lack of art in African cinema (or Black American Cinema). Idea offers a multi-dimensional view of the community assigned to hoods and dealers. But it's funny that it's not a focus point or even a short topic. However, the most unstable is the claim of independence from these topics. The genre is unique and not typical. It's almost a departure that first catches the eye, so seeing it twice is crucial. The film has aesthetic qualities that give it a real cinema art. <br /> <br /> And it is this real art with an African voice that is extremely rare. The film is not copied to achieve its message, introduces innovations and provokes, drawing out subtle stereotypes (not racial stereotypes, but based on character). It contains many messages that contain very fast character development. You have to remember that this movie is shorter than 10 minutes and very quickly able to set up a character. It is also recommended to use colorful texture and music. But considering the director, the last venture of Owen Alik Shahadah 500 years later, you can expect music. But from the point of view of the subject it seems that the idea is a departure, but the satire eludes indirectly with the social problem - genius things!
