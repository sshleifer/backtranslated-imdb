It was the worst movie I've ever seen, but it was also the best movie. Original Sci Fi movies are supposed to be bad, which makes them fun! The poem "I like my well-done dinosaurs!" Is probably the best quote ever! In addition, the plot sounds like something from a dream caused by a pot. I can imagine it now, the writers wake up after a long night, when they get high and play a dance dance revolution, and then put together ideas: Space Marines have reached an alien planet that is attacked by dinosaurs and has medieval houses to protect the scientific team investigating the planet. The best idea! In fact, it fits the full checklist of the Sci Fi movie: medieval dinosaurs' guns, space travel, terrible game <br /> <br /> So go watch this movie, but do not buy it.
