Bill Paxton plays and directs this amazingly original film. I watched for the first time how good it was. The opinions I heard were fine. As a result, I expected the average thriller. However, because of Paxton's excellent direction and acting, the movie is worth watching, especially if you're a horror fanatic. The video also helps returns of shares that last until the end credits. The strongest part of the movie is the plot, which I must say is very original and it is the one I have ever seen. Well done also for two young leaders who excellently convey emotions, if these confused boys. I give this film 9/10 and I strongly recommend that everyone catch it.
