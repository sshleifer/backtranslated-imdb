Even in the 21st century, taking care of children is dangerous: women have miscarriages and give birth prematurely. Seventy-five years ago, women often died during childbirth. This is the theme of "Life Begins": a look at the "difficult cases" of the maternity hospital. Loretta Young plays the main role, a woman brought here from prison (what crime she committed is not relevant to the plot) to give birth; she is in a conflict about having to give up her child after birth. She's in the ward with a few other women who share their joys and pain. <br /> <br /> Although Loretta Young is a leader, excellent performances, as usual, are presented by Glenda Farrell. Farrell was one of Warner's "B" women in the 1930s, appearing in supporting roles, and sometimes leading in B movies. (Farrell played Torch Blane in several episodes of "Torchy" series B). Farrell plays a future mother who does not want her children because they will interrupt. She does everything she can to disturb the nurses, including to smuggle alcohol into a ward (of course in Prohibition) and drink like a fish - apparently they have never heard of alcoholic fetal syndrome in 30s. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, unlike most films from the early thirties, women are not clumsy idiots entering the path of heroic men - this situation is reversed, and the future fathers are jelly-shaking mounds. (Be careful of the veteran character Frank McHugh as one of the waiting fathers.) "Life Begins", being an early talkie, treats the subject with a large dose of melodrama, but it is quite a lovely little movie. Turner Classic shows it, though rare; I only saw that it appeared for a few days in honor of Loretta Young. But it is a very recommended watching when it appears.
