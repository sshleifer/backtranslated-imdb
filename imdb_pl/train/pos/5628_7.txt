After reviewing some of the other comments, I have a main complaint here. <br /> <br /> The two main characters are attractive in their own way - beautiful "victim" and handsome, of course "out of the center", blue-collar hero (if he lacks "completely mad") "- turn back from himself, something like a Kabuki Caucasian scenario. <br /> <br /> It's okay, and this is obviously mainly the "rotating table" storyline. However, my dismissed complaint is that I think the director has been absorbed in the desire to display Farrah's well-known and obvious physical features. Starting from the fact that she is temptingly dressed in a thin robe, and with many scenes that are more than needed to get any dramatic effect - and at the same time extremely pleasing to the eyes, these distract attention from the level of thrilling drama. <br /> <br /> Her roommate I'm sure I'm in written and directed form - but their skepticism and histrionic babble and sobbing do not sound true - based on Farrah's previous experience with this guy, the obvious proof of his arrival to their premise only with the worst intentions and that there would be absolutely no basis for exaggerating what had happened. <br /> <br /> But this is a movie and a story, captivating so much despite, as for the reason, the director's work.
