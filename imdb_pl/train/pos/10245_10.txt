it was my favorite movie when I was young, it had everything that was great in children's films from the 90s ... nice dinosaurs, cute kids, eccentric black character and some great songs (not the typical little mermaid / beauty and songs types of beasts, but those that are fun on a regular basis)! Recently, I came across this movie and I still love it as always! I recommend it to everyone of all ages to see this movie and I definitely think that it should be presented to the younger generations! I'm sorry, not the most instructive, I'm in a hurry ... just please, trust me. all who oppose this film, kill their inner child!
