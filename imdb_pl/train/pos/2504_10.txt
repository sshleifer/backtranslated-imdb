When I saw this movie for the first time, the first thing that I thought that this movie was more anime than a movie. The reason is that it requires vampires doing amazing acrobatics. Stunts are very similar to Matrix movements, such as moving too fast like bullets, and jumping very far. Another reason the movie is good is that the cute anime faces are made during the movie. The way Gackt does his pinched faces or just the way they behave, VERY ANIME. I think it's a really good movie to watch. ^ _ ^ The action in this movie is 10 (not to mention that Gackt and Hyde are also 10). ^ _ ~ If you're fans of Gackta and Hyde, you have to see it.
