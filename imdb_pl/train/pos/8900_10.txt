This is an amazing classic monster from the 1950s! I just love the look of the '50s in general, just like cars and music. Anyway, I love the look of a blob. I love it when everyone is in the night of horror, overflow in the theater, and a droplet falls and breaks the party. Another thing that I love about her is that it takes place all night, just like Halloween II. <br /> <br /> When Steve and Jane do, they see a meteor collapse from space. There is a droplet inside the meteor. Whenever a blob consumes a person, it becomes bigger and bigger. They try to convince the city dwellers of a monstrous monster, but no one believes in it later. Can anything stop this creature? I highly recommend BLOB !!!
