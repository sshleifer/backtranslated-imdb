A nice movie, although I think he had the potential to be even better if he had more depth. It's a mystery in the middle of the movie when it comes to knowing why Elly is such a loner. Then, when we finally get an explanation coming back to childhood, there are still not many details. Perhaps they showed a flashback or something like that. <br /> <br /> In any case, it's still a good movie that I watched again. 7/10 <br /> <br />
