Jesse and Celine (Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy) are two strangers on the European train. They both come from very different backgrounds, are American and French, and talk a bit on the train. Jesse manages to get Celine out of the train and discover Vienna with him. In the next few hours they both wander around Vienna, accepting everything that the city has to offer and becomes madly enchanted with each other. But will this new relationship survive the sunrise. <br /> <br /> This wonderful romantic comedy is a breath of fresh air for the genre that has disappeared. Written and directed by Richard (Dazed and Confused) Linklater, "Before Sunrise" never gets bored due to his small cast. In fact, it thrills thanks to the leads that make you love their characters and have a great charisma between them. Intelligent dialogue makes this a must for fans of romanticism.
