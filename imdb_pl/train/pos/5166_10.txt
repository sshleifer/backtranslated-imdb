Indian summer! It was very nostalgic for me. I found it fun, cordial and absolutely enjoyed it! Anyone who went to the camp as a child and sometimes would like to return to "good Ole days" for a short time, really must see this! It starts when 20 years later a group of old campers returns to the "meeting". I will not comment on the story anymore, because you have to see it yourself. The actors were great and contained all the stars. Everyone in him played a great role. You really felt like you were part of the movie. Alan Arkin was particularly good as Uncle Lou. He plays a guy who everybody would like to have in his life. It's also a good family movie. I would suggest it to everyone in the blink of an eye! Highly recommended!
