This film has an all-star cast, John Candy, Richard Lewis, Ornella Mutti, Cybill Shepard and Jim Belushi. The troubles that all of us face when they lie to protect themselves are great, and I highly recommend that you see this movie, it's worth it! John Candy is in the best form in Once Upon A Crime, just like everybody else! If you and your family are looking for a great family movie, this is your ticket. Everyone gives great performances, great acting, great comedy and great timing, which is rare in movies these days. A great plot, a great mystery (which I love anyway) and, in general, worth the money spent on it. So take your kids, get some popcorn, juice, tea or fizzy drinks and enjoy the show !!!!
