If you've ever been sad about not being able to get a DVD movie, it was probably the "Delirious" you were looking for. How often do you laugh when watching routine comedies? I was too young to see Richard Pryor at his best, and when I was old enough to see Eddie Murphy's Delirious and Raw (not so much fun), I never knew where Eddie had much of his inspiration. Now that I'm older and I've seen both Pryor and many of Murphy's comics, I realize two things: every STEALS from Eddie, while Eddie KOCHA from Richard. It's a huge difference: Eddie was original, funny, provocative, thoughtful? and more. He was something he had never seen before. He was everything we needed. These days, Eddie Murphy is boring and old? but he was once King, and "Delirious" was the largest castle ever built. Really one of the funniest roles of all time.
