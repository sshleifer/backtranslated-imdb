A fascinating movie based on real history about Australian Lindy Chamberlain (Meryl Streep) accused of killing her daughter. She claims that the dingo took her child, but the story is very suspicious. The film tells about the media circus that took place around the issue, the way Australians interpreted what was presented in the media, and the lynching mentality of the crowd, which ultimately led to convincing a woman based on scarcely available evidence. I love movies that are challenging the media, as well as movies that look hard at how people are restricted by the justice system. I always thought juries should be shown to 12 Angry Men before they turn to their duties. This is not, as is often said, a liberal film, but a clinical look at how we as human beings interpret events based so much on our prejudices and the desire for revenge. And Cry in the Dark is also clinical. Schepisi is careful not to make a melodramatic film at all. Some may find the movie boring or dry, but I think the movie is addictive.
