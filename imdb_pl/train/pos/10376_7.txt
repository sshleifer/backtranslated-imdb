I just watched Rolla and what was the pleasure. Toby Malone's performance really stood out, and I really cared about what's happening to Matt in the whole movie, which in itself is very funny, very dynamic with a good mix of well-rounded characters, which is a big achievement, taking into account that there is a short time. There are also many good twists and turns that will make you guess the end. Other characters you have to watch out for are completely demented Tiny and the crafty, attractive Jesse. Maybe there is not a huge budget for the Hollywood blockbuster, but do not let it put you off, you can do a lot worse than check it out, you will not regret it. Fun. 7/10
