I just watched it on the television in the sky was missing the first half hour. I wondered if it was a real story, so I watched it to the end. at the end there was not a short saying what happened to everyone. It reminded me of speed, but at the end of the day I do not think it was released in the cinema because we saw the following error. what we saw was that they take off the hood (hood), and then there are two shots of the car with the police car in front, which tries to release it when the mask turns on. he had me on the edge of my seat, especially when I thought that the child would hit the bridge and, of course, when the bridge would not be lowered, and then it would be. I'm afraid I burst into tears, so it was not that bad !!!!
