I like watching people doing breakdance, especially if they do it both in the best scenes of this movie, and in the disco club called "Roxy". Especially during Christmas, because "MC Santa Claus" also appears. <br /> <br /> Even if it's an old movie, and even if I recorded it from television, when the Film Archive of State in Finland showed up in the summer of 2004 on my own big screen, I went there to check it out. It is much nicer on the big screen than on TV. <br /> <br /> Even if many people think that watching it on the big screen is a waste of money at the cost of the ticket, I do not agree with it and I think that when I paid the ticket I got the money by seeing it on the big screen , especially those in the front row of the cinema, an unforgettable experience and much better than just video.
