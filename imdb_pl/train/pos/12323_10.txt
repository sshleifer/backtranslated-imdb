This is the best Chinese movie I've ever seen and, in my opinion, much better than Hero or Chrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. The film is a unique combination of several genres: it's a beautiful love story, action movie, comedy and horror at the same time. The most amazing thing is that it all goes well! <br /> <br /> This movie definitely makes it go to my five and it should be nice for every movie lover. Action sequences have traditional unrealistic jumps, and even flying, but the way they are filmed differs significantly from the Hero style, and flying always looks great and usually has sense (ghosts can fly) <br /> <br /> See this film, you will not regret it. 10/10
