The title is onomatopeic, the sound of a tram tapping on rails. It is metaphorical for everything that people who live in a landfill can not have. The misery of these people is illustrated by the passing tram, which represents the relatively unattainable rich life of the middle class. The most moving is the pathos of a little boy and his beloved, but unfortunately crazy father. It was the first Kurosawa film in color and uses beautifully shocking colors, colors visible only in dreams. The film is surreal and surpasses beauty. Compassion for humanity is the strength of subordinates, but as always Kurosawa focuses on capturing the beauty of the film. It is a masterpiece of cinema genius.
