I've read over 100 Nancy Drew books, and if you're not clear enough yet to get along, Nancy Drew is YOUNG Nancy Drew's film, not an 18-year-old who does not go to school about books. That was when she was sixteen. Naturally, she would not be as smart as the one in the book, considering she's only in the 10th grade. Besides, I thought the movie was very nice. It was clean and suitable for everyone. Sometimes it was fun. I thought Emma Roberts did a great job. She was eloquent, with character and charming. I liked the awkwardness that Nancy and Ned had around them because they apparently were not old enough to be in a serious relationship like in books. It was a lovely PG movie that I really enjoyed because, unlike most people of my age, I like movies without sex, drugs or profanity.
