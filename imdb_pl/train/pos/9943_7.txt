The film never claims to be something spectacular like many films. Movies are a time of fun and entertainment. And that's how it was. This is the Korean version of the man Bring It On. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning you can feel the rest of the movie and how it will end, but joy is not a surprise the way the movie is a copy of another. Instead, the joy takes place in the way of the other two bandits becoming men. That's why the movie is fun and funny. <br /> <br /> The camera works, especially dolly moves were very well made. The script, though a bit weak, was too pleasant in that the characters were not two-dimensional, but full of life and desire. This movie will not win any Oscars or any popular DVD sales, but a fun watch and fun experience.
