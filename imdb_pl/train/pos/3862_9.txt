Because I am always looking for something new and unique, I watched this movie online. I thought it would be another movie with the grade "B", but I was amazed at the acting of the two main characters. All the actors in this film were very talented and well-directed. The plot was great and unique, with a great moral to tell. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely not for someone who is looking for sex, "Stupid and dumber" or blood and guts. This is a wonderfully moving film showing the gloomy reality of life combined with the kindness of the human heart and enough frivolity to interest him. <br /> <br /> I would prefer this movie from many movies with an "A" rating, I've even seen a large number with high box office earnings. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie.
