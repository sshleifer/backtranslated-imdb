In the Old West there are always people who live by violence and women hold their breath. The famous ¨ city of Tamer, named Clit Tollinger (Robert Mitchum), is hired by citizens to get rid of gunmen (Leo Genn, Claude Atkins, among others), Baronland's bandits. There he meets a blacksmith (Emile Meyer), his daughter (Karen Sharpe), her boyfriend (John Lupton), marshal (Henry Hull) and salon owner (Ted De Corsia). Clint as a lawyer is appointed deputy, who brings peace and puts some of the following words to the cartels: ¨ Warning, carrying a weapon or other weapon in the city is forbidden. Check all the equipment in the office of the marshal ¨. Clint finds her ex-girlfriend, the local madame (Jan Sterling) responsible for the Saloon girls (Angie Dickinson, Barbara Lawrence among them). But the city council is afraid of the strict methods carried out by Clint. Finally, the landowner appears and tries to murder Tollinger with his own hands. <br /> <br /> This is an incredibly exciting story of the sheriff who has only one killer. It starts with a slowly moving West, but it is a surprise to us with dark figures and a solid plot. The story is almost bleak, the dragon comes to the city just in time to make sure that its citizens, but later events are getting worse. The most important is burning in the Saloon and climatic clash at the end. The phenomenal and wonderful role of Robert Mitchum as the avenging angel and bitter shooter is the whole program. A lively and lively song by Alex North (Spartacus, Cleopatra), Climatic Black and White Lee Garmes. The film is stunningly made by Richard Wilson (Al Capone, Three in Attic), which has survived for good as the episode "Invitation to the shooter and aneZane Gray". The visible results of this unusual West.
