I was very surprised how much I liked this movie. I thought it was funny, sexy, painful and warm. Andie MacDowell's performance was nuanced and sensitive. For the first time, the director of the movie MacDowell did not make her beauty a different character in the film. The romance between Kate and her young man is wonderful when you look at him very well. Her relationship with her friends is both a thorn and a balm in her life. Imelda Stalinson, who was MVP in many British films, does a great job at it. There is some tragedy in it, but I think that the film is finally saved by brilliant acting, pure direction and witty writing. The quality of the film is excellent and the music is good, although not available on the soundtrack.
