This movie is a great example of a movie that divides people into two groups. Those who get a joke and those who do not. People usually attack what they do not understand. This film has a comic style and charm that has been unmatched ever since. It's a GREAT comedy .. and a GREAT love affair. This is the perfect movie about a date. A great movie for someone who wants a good, happy laugh. And if your perspective is too tense, maybe this movie is not for you and you may need advice. The injustice is that Paramount has kept this film on the shelf since the early 1980s, never seeing the light of day on DVD. However, feel the urban version of "Newlyweds" is a good idea. It's strange that my two favorite romantic comedies have never been released on DVD. The second is Gene Wilder's "The World's Greatest Lover," on which Fox has played since the early 80's ... However, "From Justin To Kelly" is in almost every video store in the country. There is no justice in the world. Perhaps those who have taken the time to enjoy "From Justin To Kelly", I am sure that someone is watered enough to "get". Sometimes with age, people lose their sense of humor ... And sometimes they just disappear and find comic satisfaction in the repetitions of "Full House".
