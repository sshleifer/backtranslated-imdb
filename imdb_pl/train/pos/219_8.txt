Simon's carefully written dialogues are really electrified by Matthau and Burns. You can literally hear the crack of the script. There are several films that can develop such a relationship between actors and the scenario. For example, the famous downhill scene could be more boring if fewer actors were involved. Matthau seems to be born to play Willie Clark (of course Oscar moreso in "Odd Couple") and with all the peculiarities and manners Matthau pushes into the character (the line in which he claims to be living in the city with him, while Lewis lives in the country where Lewis is "absent", is the quintessence of this example) make it one of the best performances I've ever seen in any role in any role, whether comedy or drama or anything else. Dot. Matthau and Burns work together perfectly; The contrast they represent underlines Simon's superb talent for creating a comedy conflict. This film is simply one of the best "must see" and requires its prestigious place on the pages of film history.
