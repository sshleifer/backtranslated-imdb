I was really stunned how much a movie that is over 60 years old can impress me. It's almost two hours, there are absolutely no stars in it, there are subtitles, but it is still interesting and exciting. The realism of the film made the most impression on me. You can almost feel the chill of the ice, because you can see that the storms are real. It's a relief in the CGI world, like our days. I wondered how much it must have been for Van Dyke. I read somewhere that filming took 17 months. Who already wants to talk about "Titanic"? It's a great movie with great news and I recommend it to future directors to see how wonderful and realistic films can be if they are directed only with realism, not with visual effects.
