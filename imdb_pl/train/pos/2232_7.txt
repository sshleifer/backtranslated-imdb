I saw it when I was 17 and I have not seen it since then. "CBS Late Movie" showed him regularly in one place. I remember how sad and depressing it was that I really had a stomach ache. The effects were not what they are today, but they still conveyed a sense of loneliness in the Amazon, after losing both parents and looking for a way out, very good. I remember worms and worms the most, so realistic, eating her body. It's a dark movie that was a controversial topic at the time, although it was probably heavily edited for television. I would like to remember more details, and if I ever have the opportunity to see it again, I can comment more. I've been looking for this for years. I believe that it could be shown in CBS under a different title. I have no idea if it has ever been released on video.
