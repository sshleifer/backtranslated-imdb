This movie is full of wrestling Treats from horrors: chained sleepwalker, premeditated murder, crazy (slightly lesbian) female scientist with an even crazier father who wears a mask because of his horrible disfigurement, poisoning, horrible castles, werewolves (man and woman) , adultery, killed lovers, Tibetan mystics, half-man / half-plant victim of some unnamed experiment, robbing graves, mind control, bricked up bodies, car accident on a lonely road, electric shock, knights in armor - a lot, all seasoned with an incredibly horrible result and one of Foley's worst jobs ever done. <br /> <br /> The script is incomprehensible (even by the badly named standards of the Spanish horror), and part of the editing is just bizarre. In one of the scenes in which the main evil scientist goes to visit our heroine in her bedroom in one of the badly named: "This is fantastic. I do not understand. Explain to me again what it is like ... ". film, there is a sudden manual clipping of a girl's thighs when she gets up from the bed for no apparent reason, other than veiling the cut in the "Mwahaha!" evil scientist! All your werewolves are mine! speech. Although why they went to the trouble I do not know, because there are a lot of other shocking jumps in the whole place - even allowing me to look terribly and scan the print I saw. <br /> <br /> The director was, according to one interview with the star, drunk by most of the photos, and the film looks like this. It's an inconsistent mess. It became even more inconsistent with the inclusion of the material from the madness of the werewolves from another movie "The Mark of the Wolf Man" (produced 4 years earlier, with the same actor, but playing with more aggression and with different shirt and makeup - I AM there) in Spanish for "Continuity"?) and more of the liner of another actor in the wolfmanian style, which revolves around in a long shot. <br /> <br /> The music is incredibly bad, changing almost randomly from the full orchestral frightening house of the musician, to bosannova, to the longest piano and chime duo ever recorded. (He thought about it, maybe it was not a duet, it could be a solo, the piano part was so simple that it could be picked up with one hand while the player hit the gong with the other one.) <Br /> <br /> it is one of the most dazed trance states that has been causing bad movies of the year. Be happy. <br /> <br /> Favorite line: "Ilona! This madness and perversity will turn against you! "How true. <br /> <br /> A favorite shot: a lover, revealing his dead girl, dropping the candle in a cartoon-like surprise display. He leads an amateur rank there.
