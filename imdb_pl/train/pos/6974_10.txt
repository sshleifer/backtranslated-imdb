I recently watched Caprica again and thought I might as well write a review! I saw it for the first time just after I saw the final of the Battlestar Galactica series (being a big boy drooling from the show showed me that I was sticking to anything I could do from the show world), so I did not know what to expect ... I left with a smile, though I must admit ... <br /> <br /> The story begins dramatically on the planet Caprica and we present various interesting characters ... I will not give too much but there is a dramatic event that dictates the course of history, but I suggest that you he looked at it. <br /> <br /> I have to say ... Esai Morales is the hell of an actor whom he brought to a young Joseph Adam. .. (father Admiral in Battlestar Galactica) I found his acting place and I could believe that he is the father of William Adama from BSG ... <br /> <br /> Also Eric Stoltz precisely fits his role. ..! Attention! It was good to see Polly Walker outside of Rome! Do not sit down and do not watch Caprica, expecting to be like Battlestar Galactica, because the plot is quite simple and anyone can watch it ... without having to watch BSG !. <br /> <br /> This program is a well-written drama for those who like drama with a bit of science fiction there!
