IMDb lists this from 1972. For some reason, but other sources that I have seen, including excellent program notes, this means '68. It does not matter much, except that it's quite interesting to see this abstract collage of film and video (one of the first works of art that apparently combined both films) in the context of the 2001 Star Gate sequence released in the same year. Pure abstraction is not really my thing, but I can take it in small doses, and super saturated optically printed colors and the psychedelic feeling of this series of flowers, Rohrschach spots, birds, etc. They are quite attractive and quite beautiful. Certainly helped to pave the way for many other emerging artists video in the 1970s and deserves to be better known.
