My girlfriend and I have something to do. So I'm trying to search for movies that have robots. And this movie has robots. Big. They overcome the clash and the roar from each other, and the fate of the nations hangs in balance. It's really cool. You have to forgive this film for its many shortcomings and just try to appreciate what the director and his team of technicians could put on the screen while working with a clearly strained budget. It is very difficult not to like this movie. Because of these great robots. They looked like Transformers and fought like professional wrestlers! It made my girlfriend smile. And that's good enough for me. Particular attention should be paid to the veteran character of Paul Koslo: as a maniacal Russian villain, irrespective of whether he ruthlessly stamps on his helpless opponents after they have given up or complain that their proximity in the bar caused his vodka to taste "Like blood" (the line that he delivers with Bel-Lugosi's delicious accent), he apparently has the ball and the movie is a huge benefit when it's on the screen. It's a cool little movie that deserves a cult reputation.
