Adorable! In October, I saw home imports at Philly with my children. We loved it so much that we saw it for the second time with my parents. I have not heard them laugh like that for years! It was the first time I remember a movie that my parents and children could enjoy. It's really cute and we can not wait for it to come out on DVD. They must create more movies, such as domestic imports. It's refreshing to go to a movie that can be enjoyed by three different generations (and not be ashamed). I have not seen a movie so cute from My Big Fat Greek Wedding. I loved Mindy Sterling as a mother. She was also at Austin Powers. Howard Hesseman is funny in this too. I remember him from WKRP.
