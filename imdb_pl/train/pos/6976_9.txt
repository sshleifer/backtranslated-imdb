I did not see BSG, I tried to watch it once in the middle of the show, but I could not get to it. However, I saw Caprica Rebirth yesterday. I felt a little lost, so I decided to watch the Pilot today and I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. I think it is a promising program, and the only side effect that has had on me is that now I want to watch BSG. <br /> <br /> But I really liked the fact that I did not have to be a BSG hardcore fan to understand what was going on in Caprica. From what I read on the web, they tried to reach the female population, because BSG had achieved much more men, and at least in my case it worked. <br /> <br /> However, I suggest that if you try to watch the show, do it from the beginning, starting with the remote control.
