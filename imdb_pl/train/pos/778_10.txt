I'm not an expert on acting or other film details, but this movie just hit me deeply. I think I will never forget it. One scene especially (I think everyone who saw the movie, will know what I'm talking about) is imprinted in my brain. <br /> <br /> I also watched a similar film Lilja 4-ever (as mentioned by the previous commentator). It was also very moving, but not so simple and brutal. If you are sensitive at all, it will bring you tears, but Anjos Do Sol (Angels of the Sun) can stay with you forever. <br /> <br /> This is a very depressing issue, but I think not, I hope that the film will be able to pay more attention to it. <br /> <br /> More people must see this movie !!!!!!
