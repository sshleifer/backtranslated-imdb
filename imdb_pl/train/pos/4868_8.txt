I gave this film 8 out of 10, reserving 10 for eg Amadeus and 9 for Slumdog Millionaire last time. This film is close to Slumdog, but it is difficult to judge such a film without understanding the Balkan life, mentality and soul that Kusturica presents masterfully. To understand this, you really have to be one of Balkan. It's an amazing movie, much better and more contemporary than its previous films that are boring at the time, I think Kusturica is moving forward with this movie. I like humor (Balkan humor), photography is art itself, each scene is artistic to the limit. The story is probably a fairy tale, do not remind her now, but remember to read to my daughter that she sleeps a similar story.
