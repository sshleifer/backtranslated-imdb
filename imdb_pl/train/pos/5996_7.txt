Time and again I have stated that if people do not want to make alterations or sequels, they should stop watching them and instead venture into the world of an independent film. Having said that, the last time I saw the independent film alone had to be easily six months ago. Here is an overview of india, which I've noticed on YouTube; the Cure. <br /> <br /> You can say straight away that the film will have an avant-garde approach to the film, which is telegramsed in the use of extreme close-ups, scopophilia and fast editing. He is proud of his appearance - and he has the right to be. For the most part, it is a very nicely composed small piece, with the exception of one unforgivable disregard of the 180-degree rule and the comically evil effect of the shot, which is a phenomenon that seems to be a showcase for projects financed by itself. <br /> <br /> Despite these amateur mistakes, most shots are really nice. We were presented with a good use of props and locations, a good visual game and a very atmospheric, fluent edition, which is more praiseworthy, because it is definitely something that you will not see very often when submitting Youtube. The plot is fragmentary and although the basic assumption is quite simple, some may have difficulty tracking exactly what is happening, but what we see here is an avant-garde story at work; in fact, you can not expect a simple structure of three acts, and if it does, you may not be ready for this kind of movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there is a sound in the case of the film. What you hear all the time is a distorted voice reader who often sounds unhappy, and even worse is continuous background music that goes through minimal change and adds nothing. So much attention is paid to visuals that sounds sincerely neglected, and this becomes really obvious when you realize that you just missed the four sentences of the narrative and you have to step back to pick up what has passed your attention. > <br /> Then give him the watch, but do it with the sound off. <br /> <br /> Last thought; Has anyone else remembered the cover of Doug Naylor's novel The Red Man at the beginning of the movie? If you have a book, you know what I mean.
