I came across this (Akt-I) with pure stupid happiness and it was over ten years ago. It was not even what was mentioned on the cover. It astounded me. It intimidated me. It shocked me. In the end, I forgot about it and almost a decade later I happened to think about it. Then he went and bought both acts. They were even better than the beginning. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that while the armored police do not stop fighting crime, they guarantee tanks and heavy artillery, it seems that they really had difficulties with criminals. It is never shown or is simply a lie, because it seems to be easy most of the time. If this piece of being at war was really propaganda, it certainly was not shown as such. <br /> <br /> I do not think the original Japanese version could be as good as the Americanized version of this one. But when it comes to this story, certain translations have certainly been lost in translation, but you can justify them.
