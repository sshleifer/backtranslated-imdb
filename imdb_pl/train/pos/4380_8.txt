This is a very good, unappreciated action / drama / and a somewhat historical movie. <br /> <br /> The basic story concerns Rob Roy's loans of Â£ 1,000, his theft and problems that his family and indirectly his clans cause. <br /> <br /> Cunningham (Tim Roth) is an amazing villain and character in this story. Brutally cold and if you look at his face, he seems to be able to look away and look completely bad. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy (Liam Neeson) is also perfect, but I think the writers used the word honor "1 too many times. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is strong and the whole film is very well preserved and filmed. <br /> <br /> The action is exciting and the sword is very realistic but not too bloody. The story is good and you really want Rob to win. <br /> <br /> In total, it's a bit less classic.
