I've always been a big fan of Cybill Shepperd since I saw her a few years ago !! This film certainly shows it in the best light! The movie was so wonderfully planted and played !! From time to time, he throws some fun lines to make this movie one of the best I've ever seen !! Everyone is really alone !! Especially Robert Downey Jr. and Cybill Shepperd, they really made the movie come true !! I also loved a little bit where Mavis loses his wig and almost dies when he falls on the floor !! This is the movie at its best !!
