I saw this movie only once, on TV and it has not been repeated. It's weird when you're considering garbage that repeats itself over and over again. Usually horror movies are a source of entertainment for me, but this one really scared me. <br /> <br /> DO NOT READ THE NEXT PAGE IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE <br /> <br /> the most terrible thing is that the city dwellers are chasing a preacher, where his wife is almost dead (they have poisoned her). He asks who the hell you are, people. One by one they give their true identities. The girl who pretended to be deaf to ruin and seduce him says, "I am Lilith, a witch who loved Adam from Eve."
