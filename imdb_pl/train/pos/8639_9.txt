I have to start with an apology because I thought that the first 75-80% of the movie was fun. It's mainly because of Brad Pitt's performance. Spot on. <br /> <br /> Acting for everyone involved was pretty good, but Brad stole the movie. The atmosphere was perfect in every respect. I'm not a big fan of Pitt, but it must be one of his best roles in history. <br /> <br /> Brutal, honest, Gritty. All good words to describe this movie. <br /> <br /> I read the previous review, and the person said that the justification of Early violence is not explained. This has been explained, but luckily they do not have to go into graphical details to understand their point of view. <br /> <br /> Generally, I gave it to 9 because each scene bar 1 or 2 was effective. I think humor in the first half is perfect for this movie. Underestimated.
