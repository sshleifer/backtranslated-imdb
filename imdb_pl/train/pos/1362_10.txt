Me and my groovadelic 20 colleagues just can not wait for this great Parker Posey CLASSIC! I tried to rent it on a DVD, but I can not find it - it's a shame because I'm sure the features will be "extra special" !! :) We recommend this amazing flickerino comedy for a date and even a cozy night at home! It would also be a type of purring movie that you can watch with your cat, and even throw a party based on a party party like the one in a movie that loves the cozy, squeezing Parker Posey at the end. Oh, and be vigilant for the catchy and HILARIOUS ending of the surprise ... step back, Sixth Sense, you just went through the radder movie! I'm sorry, no offense, I just call it as it is! Take it from an old movie lover, the comedy just is not better than the "Party Girl" with Parker P! Feel it! Regards, Ronald Marie MacDougall (aka DJ Cyber-Rap)
