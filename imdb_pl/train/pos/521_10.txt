This is probably one of the most original love stories I've seen for ages, especially in the case of a war-based film (shortly). Essentially, it is a story based on two worlds, one obviously real, the other fictitious, but the filmmakers say in the beginning that it is only a coincidence if it is a real place. In any case, Peter Carter (the great David Niven) was about to crash on the plane, he was talking to June (Planet of the Apes' Kim Hunter) before he jumped out and said he loved her. He was supposed to die from jumps without a parachute, but somehow he survived, and now he sees and loves June in his body. This other place, like heaven, is unhappy because he survived and would come to their world, so they send French conductor 71 (Marius Goring) to convince him to leave, but he is obviously in love. Peter suggests to him that he should appeal for the preservation of life in the court of the second world, he has this in mind. Of course, love wins when two lovers announce that they will die for themselves, and June even proposes taking his place! With Robert Coote in the role of Bob Trubshawe, Kathleen Byron as an angel, short (then unknown) Lord Sir Richard Attenborough as English pilot and Abraham Sofaer as a judge / surgeon. David Niven was number 36 on the Top 50 British Actors, he was number 86 on the top 100 Tearjerk for a happy ending, he was number 47 on the Top 100 Films, he was number 46 on the 50 Best British Films, and it was number 59 in the 100 biggest films. Outstanding!
