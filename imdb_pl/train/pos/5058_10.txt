There should be more videos about our Native Americans. I especially think that using real Native Americans would be right. I know that Archie Belaney, played by Pierce Brosnan, did a great job in presenting this character because he was an Englishman. But my suggestion for Hollywood is to put more American Indians in roles and never use anyone else. Sioux Nation has been placed too long on the rear burner. Their poverty is a disgrace to our country. I am deeply convinced that our country should return the Black Hills to Sioux. We ask Israel to return their lands to the Arabs, but we do not make any efforts to do the same, we should be ashamed. We must practice what we preach!
