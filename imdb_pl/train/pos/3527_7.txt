Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis) meets a mysterious woman (Fay Helm) at the bar and invites her to see the show with him. Agrees on the condition that they do not exchange information about each other - even names. Sometimes these are the best dates. However, when he returns to his apartment, Inspector Burgess (Thomas Gomez) and his team are waiting for him. Scott's wife was murdered. His alibi is a mysterious woman, but no one remembers her, and as a result Scott is condemned to death for the murder of his wife. His secretary Kansas (Ella Raines) is not convinced of his guilt and decides to find a woman who can save him from the death penalty. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie, and the viewer is 100% for trying Kansas to reach the truth. We follow her in several memorable scenes, such as Mac's bartender (Andrew Tombes) at night and a claustrophobic place where drummer Cliff (Elisha Cook Jr.) takes her to a meeting, drinks and dances while he jams with his friends. It is such a glaring representation of sexual desire that it is a prominent part of the movie, because everyone sweats intensely and rhythmically throughout the duration of the scene. Ella Raines is good in the role of the main woman, and Thomas Gomez is a nice policeman. Alan Curtis began well as a disoriented, innocent man, but when he was arrested, his performance turned left when it became completely unpleasant for Kansas for no reason. God knows why she got stuck with him. <br /> <br /> The movie does not allow you to guess who the murderer is, as we know from the middle of the movie, but it does not matter. In fact, it increases the tension and dramatic development of the story, just as Kansas discovers what is happening and then getting free! It's a good movie with some great scenes, but although Elisha Cook Jr. has a memorable role, I just never like him in anything I see in him ... someone will give me a neck tie .....
