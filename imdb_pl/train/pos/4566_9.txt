Daniel Day-Lewis is Christy Brown, a cerebral palsy victim who uses "My Left Foot" to write and paint in this amazing film from 1989. The film also features Brenda Fricker as Christy's mother, Ray McAnally, Fiona Shaw and Hugh O'Conor. Their great performances, great screenplay and great director Jim Sheridan help paint a vivid portrait of Christy Brown, an artist and writer who died in 1981 at the age of 49. <br /> <br /> Brown was born in a lower age a middle class Catholic family in which his mother was constantly pregnant (a total of 22 children, 13 of whom survived). His father thought that Christy was mentally handicapped, as well as physically handicapped, but he would not let his son enter the house. The children in the family said goodbye to him every day when they went to school, and then his mother fed him and talked to him. <br /> <br /> In the movie, Fricker conveys the meaning of a woman who, despite being surrounded by a huge family, needs someone to talk to. Christy does not speak. In the end, there is a trolley where he can go, and children from the neighborhood who have known him since childhood, include him in all their activities. The only part of his body that works really well is his left foot, and when the children learn how well they kick, they put him in football games just for that purpose. One of the most beautiful parts of the movie is the relaxing way other children treat him. <br /> <br /> There are many powerful scenes, but none is as powerful as Christy writing "Mother" on the floor holding a piece of chalk between her fingers. "It's real Brown," says his father, lifting him on his shoulders and taking him to the pub. Entering the pub, he announces: "My son is a genius." Everything changes when Christy gets old because she has the young boy's desires and emotions. He develops crushing, he is rejected and goes more into himself, turning to painting. In the end, he goes to the clinic in a nearby clinic and works with a therapist, Eileen (Fiona Shaw) at home. He falls in love with her. When she learns that she is engaged, she almost goes crazy. But he survives to live, paint, write (three books in total) and love again. <br /> <br /> Because it is a movie, necessarily some things had to be omitted and the characters combined. Brown was not diagnosed with cerebral palsy for some time, which was omitted in the film. The therapist Eileen is actually a combination of three important therapeutic figures in Christy's life and although we know that his mother thought she had a good mind, in fact she worked very hard with Christy when he was a child teaching him the alphabet In addition to Mary, Christy had 12 an old relationship with a woman he dedicated to "My left foot". And the typical ending of Hollywood, 9 years before his death, where negligence by his wife could be a factor, does not end history. <br /> <br /> After all, Christy Brown's biography is incredibly powerful, all the more due to two performances: Hugh O'Conor as young Christy and Daniel Day-Lewis as an adult Christy. O'Conor's facial expression and the way he pulls his warped body, tugging his gut. One is exhausted and depressed at the same time. <br /> <br /> And what about Daniel Day-Lewis, one of the greatest actors in the world - completely animates Christy, a fully muscular pose, an intelligent human being capable of cursing, being angry, bitter, drunk, obtrusive, lusty, funny and loving. He earned Oscar's reward in the same year that Tom Cruise was nominated for the "Born on July Fourth" award. I remember that someone wrote a letter to the editor somewhere that Cruise was so sensational, what was wrong with the Academy? Nothing to change. Nothing at all. <br /> <br /> Brenda Fricker is amazing like Christy's mother, who never ceases to believe in him and what she can do, and who keeps her family and husband together in difficult times. The great thing about Fricker's performance is that support, love and work ethics tend to be natural for the mother. A character would never consider himself a heroine or someone who does something extraordinary. Fricker shows us a religious but not a fanatical woman who believes that her duties on earth are being a good wife and mother. And no matter what, even when her husband does not have a job, she throws her daughter out of the house for being pregnant, whatever she is doing. He spends money on Christy's wheelchair, gets pictures of his daughter and child, and starts building a room for Christa at the back of the house. All part of the work a day. A performance worthy of the Oscar she received. <br /> <br /> Brown's life was more complicated than this inspirational movie, but it's an amazing achievement for everyone involved and compulsory.
