So we went to a compromise. It was quite a charming film, I liked the direction of art (he felt much more "real" than most children's films), and the costumes were not too sweet. The children of the actors were not bad to watch (adult performances tended to be tacky). It's great that they showed how child abuse is being mistreated over others, and that children are fighting intimidation. <br /> <br /> I do not know how many adults would like to see it for themselves, but it's a great movie to take a child. And because "Barnyard" was apparently frequented by more than 100 children at once, I REALLY am glad that instead we chose rarely watched "worms".
