The best way to describe Europe, which is high on the list of my favorite movies, is the shout that appeared from the companion after the film ended: "I did not know that movies can be done like this". Completely original in its visual style, it is one of the best examples of what cinema can be. It's as far from the "master and range" shooting style as possible; perfectly integrates many layers of image, sound, effects, props, dialogues, voice, performance, editing, lighting, etc. ... everything is equal, none dominates. Despite the short-sightedness of "dialogue" in Hollywood, cinema is not about dialogue, or on beautiful lighting, action or music. Works best when all elements are on equal terms, where ONLY MIXING of these elements, in the order or combination in which they are presented, will convey the idea. Decrease or eliminate the contribution of one element, and the movie does not matter. "Europa" is what cinema should aspire to.
