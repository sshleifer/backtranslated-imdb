Sure, it quickly became uneven after this film, but from "Knife In the Water" to "The Tenant" Roman Polański could always count on providing something fascinating and unique. Despite many topics (alienation, paranoia), there are no two similar films. The story of this is somewhat similar to his own "Repulsion" from ten years ago, but the tone is completely different. "The Tenant" manages to balance out darker than the dark absurd (I am a bit hesitant to call it humor, even though the bizarre behavior of the characters and the dialogue were occasionally funny) with some really tense paranoia. Polanski has always been a master in building anxiety, and the moments in this film are almost unbearably terrifying. The general eccentricity of this movie is also a plus. <br /> <br /> In addition to the outstanding direction of Polański as usual, the rest of the cast and crew offers great contributions. The actor Polański is often eclipsed by director Polański, but his performance here really reflects his awkwardness and the feeling of being an outcast. The themes of social discrimination make this film more than just a strange thing because of being weird. The rest of the cast also offers strong performances, especially the sympathetic turn of Isabelle Adjani and the annoyingly melyvn Douglas and Shelley Winters. "The Tenant" is often underestimated, because people are ready to boast of both "Repulsion" and "Rosemary's Baby", but they are just as brilliant as any of these classics. (9/10)
