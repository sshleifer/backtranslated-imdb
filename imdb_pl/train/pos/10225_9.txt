I was laughing, reading all the idiotic comments on this movie, <br /> <br /> because it's obvious that those people who criticized the movie never saw it or were stupid enough to pay to see it. <br /> <br /> The best reason to watch was at the Elvira exhibition a few years ago. Elvira directed the movie with as many laughs as you can. <br /> <br /> This is a monster, compared to hundreds of scary American movies. Much better!!!!
