What an amazing movie! It was very scary, great acting, well-written, nice twists, interesting characters, very good direction and an unexpected ending that will leave you with a smile on your face. This is one movie of popcorn horror, which may not be attractive to fans other than horror, but is still one of the best thrillers in the world! I highly recommend it ONLY to fans: <br /> <br /> 1) Genre of horror <br /> <br /> LUB <br /> <br /> 2) An actor or actress appeared in it. <br /> <br /> *** with **** stars! <br /> <br /> PS - I am sick and tired of people who compare this, and other contemporary horror movies, with SCREAM. You know what, they DO NOT WANT to be like SCREAM. Everyone is like "Oh, they copied SCREAM!". Well, if I'm not mistaken, SCREAM has also copied other films! Actually, almost EVERY horror copied the previous one. SCREAM is a good movie though. But still ... stop comparing and enjoy what it is! <br /> <br /> GO AND MAKE ONE! <br /> <br />
