Noni Hazlehurst, Colin Friels, Alice Garner, Chrissie Amphlett and Michael Caton - what more could you want? Monkey Grip, based on an award-winning novel of the same title, explores Nora (Hazlehurst, a single mother falling into addiction to heroin Jobe (Friels).) Simple story is really amazing thanks to great acting (especially Noni Hazlehurst) and cool use of small budget The only disadvantage is (if you can pick it up) that the story takes place in Melbourne, although for budget reasons the film was shot mainly in Sydney, so you see trams (Melbourne scenes) in several scenes, followed by Carlton Post (Sydney scenes), otherwise "Monkey Grip "is a must see (I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but it is) at least for the award-winning performance of the former" Play "School" and the presenter "Better Homes & Gardens" Noni Hazlehurst. <br /> <br /> 10/10
