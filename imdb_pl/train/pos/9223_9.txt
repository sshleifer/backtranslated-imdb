Ashanti is a movie from the 70s (more precisely 1979). It reminded me in a sense, The Wild Geese (Richard Burton, Richard Harris and Roger Moore during a mission in Africa). It's also a very good movie and I loved it. <br /> <br /> David (Michael Caine) is a doctor working in Africa and married to a beautiful Ashanti woman named Anansa (Beverley Johnson), who trained in medicine in America and is also a doctor. While they are doctoring, one day she is kidnapped by slaves working for an Arab slave trader named Suleiman (played perfectly by Peter Ustinov of all people). The rest of the movie is David, who is trying to get her back. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine is of course a brilliant actor and plays a character who is very determined and ready to do anything to regain his wife, but rather hopeless with weapons and action. He was helped first by an Englishman fighting against the slave trade, which no one knows is happening (Rex Harrison!), Then briefly a helicopter pilot (William Holden), and then an Arab called Malik (Kabir Bedi). Malik has a score to settle with Suleiman (he is very intense, very addictive character), so he leaves with David to find him and retrieve Anansa - it requires a great scene in which David fails to get his camel. <br /> <br /> Then there is a lot of adventure. There are also many moral questions. From this point forward, progress in this story is somewhat predictable and there are several freedoms associated with conspiracy to move things faster, but everything is quite forgivable. The question is, will David get to Anansa before Peter Ustinov sells it to Omar Sharif (yes, of course Omar Sharif is in it!)?
