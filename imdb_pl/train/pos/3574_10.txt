It is sometimes difficult to say why exactly such a movie is so effective. From the moment I first came across "The Stone Boy", something told me it would be a great movie. Even so, it seemed very unlikely that I would have the opportunity to see it myself. Then, one day, browsing the online catalog of my local library, I saw that they had recently bought a DVD edition of the movie. What I am extremely pleased with because the photos have stunning depth and quality, which an old copy of VHS could never repeat. <br /> <br /> And speaking of cinematography, I have to distinguish it so far and above the most stunning aspect of this film. As a photographer who realizes almost exactly the visual style presented in the "Stone Boy", I strongly believe that a great operator can almost carry the film on his own. Here he has a lot of help from an extremely talented cast and director who perfectly understands what history needs. But having Juan Ruiz Anchia behind the camera makes practically every scene a beauty. And you can hardly say that. Most movies would never expect something like that. Scene by scene contains some details, some visual magic that will take your breath away. <br /> <br /> The director, Christopher Cain, had a long and interesting career. As far as I know, this movie is not very representative. But sometimes, to catch the director at the beginning of his career, before all large budgets and loss of concentration, you can find real subtle magic. Cain withdraws in this film, lets something happen with his own life, and then even further. Like the early films of John Sayles, characters have space to breathe, time to talk. Side stories happen because it happens and that's how life is. Cain presents an unusual, raw, almost even painful understanding of human nature in this film. <br /> <br /> Acting combines much of this story. When people say when they are in this movie, they do it as real people, not held back by the fact that they play characters. Gina Berriault's screenplay allows extremely talented and respected actors, such as Wilford Brimley, Robert Duvall, Glenn Close and Frederic Forrest, to spend time simply by living. Whether the things they have to say are small or have a deep meaning, everything comes down to the weight of pure reality. <br /> <br /> When you look at involved actors or the great soundtrack of James Horner, it seems strange that such a movie is almost forgotten. Perhaps what makes "The Stone Boy" what it does, is the period in which it was created. It is the feeling of a hangover from the 1970s, which reminds me deeply of my own childhood. People talk about the '80s in terms of modern styles and music, but it's not the 80's that I've lived or remember. The appearance of images, understated and dark, knowing the quality of action, and the overall result should be under the skin of every person who grew up in or near this North American era. I see myself in it. I see how I saw the world. And a movie like "The Stone Boy" sees the world as it really is. <br /> <br /> More information on this subject can be found in: <br /> <br /> The Black Stallion (1979), Never Cry Wolf (1983), Tender Mercies (1983), Testament (1983), Places in the Heart (1984), Matewan (1987), High Tide (1987), Driving Miss Daisy (1989), The Secret Garden (1993), The Secret of Roan Inish (1994), Wendy and Lucy (2008)
