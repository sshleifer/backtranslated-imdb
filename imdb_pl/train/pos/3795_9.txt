After watching this movie at the SF Independent Film Festival, I could not wait to hear how to get a copy. Jim McKay gave a speech (Q & A) about a later film in which he introduced his ironic situation: how to get a distribution of a film that depicts minorities (women, non-whites) working on solving controversial issues (teenage pregnancy, teenage motherhood, racial identity, households) lonely mothers) and how to write a faithful script on all these topics as a white man in the mid-thirties. The multiracial, multi-gender audience, in which adults are predominant, was enchanted by the fantastic plot of the film, detailed characters and a fantastic presentation of "real teen life". However, most of the teenagers left the building, which led me to the conclusion that this film is best seen by adults with children as a starting point for discussion, not as many adults, "the film should see teenagers, it's about them. Hence distribution questions - how to get our hands? Internet (retail) would be a great path - it's a movie that will be buried like "Puppies" or other radical contemporary teen movies - and McKay seemed to react. Regarding his merits as a scriptwriter / director, McKay was sensitive and detailed in his work - he allied himself with the Crown Heights neighborhood, where the film is embedded, collaborating with actors to portray characters in their own vision of what they think they should be - the results are disarmingly realistic.
