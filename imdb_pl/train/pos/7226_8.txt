A bit typical movie from this era. Of course, for the first time he was created for this world on stage, but still a very good movie from the beginning to the end. Peter O'Toole and Susannah York make a scene on the silver screen and they both do it effectively. The story on this subject is very small and anyone who is not familiar with this type of research outside the rhythm can be a little discouraged. All in all, however, a good movie in which Peter O'Toole and Susannah York are starting to work.
