A longtime fan of Bette Midler, I must say that her recorded concerts are my favorite. Bette kidnaps us with his jokes and brings us to tears with his ballads. Bette, literal rainbow of emotion and talent, best shows her repertoire and new songs from the album "Bette of Roses". It covers generations of people and offers something for everyone. The one-of-a-kind Divine Diva proves here that she is the most talented artist.
