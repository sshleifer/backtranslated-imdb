I have no idea how Texan (director, Douglas McGrath) and American actress Gwyneth Paltrow have ever done it, but seeing it again will remind you what went first into the confusion around Mrs. Paltrow! I have long since left the woman and I still feel that it is rather boring in my Oscar-winning show "Shakespeare In Love", but it gets all the hits right here - it's almost perfect as Emma Woodhouse. She may have won an Oscar for Shakespeare, but it must be remembered. <br /> <br /> Of course, she is surrounded by a great cast, including Toni Collette, Greta Scacchi, Juliette Stevenson and ... Jeremy Northam is very attractive, as is the love interest, even if the script is somewhat in the declaration of love for Paltrowa (in this process, allowing all tension to leave their relationship); A few years later, Ewan's hair is a bit easier to do than in the year 96, and personally I think that the furious Alan Cumming is a dangerous presence these days. But there is no doubt that Sophie Thompson (sister of Emma Thompson, daughter of Phyllida Law) stands out as Miss Bates; what this version needs is a scene in which Emma agrees with Miss Bates because she is a character who fates us. The film is worth watching (again) because of the performance itself. <br /> <br /> In summary, it has aged wonderfully with grace to lose and enough subtlety to sort out the British class system. It is worth to rent (because it is unlikely that Paltrow will be so good again - but we will always have Emma).
