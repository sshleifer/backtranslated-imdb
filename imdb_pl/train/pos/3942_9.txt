1939 is widely recognized as the best year in Hollywood history, with more classic films than any other, and John Ford has directed the three best, "Stagecoach", "Drums Along the Mohawk", and this beautiful tribute to border days and a young lawyer with to save the Union, "Young Mr. Lincoln." <br /> <br /> Because the world was plunged into a war that America was afraid of, but he knew he would be drawn into it, Abraham Lincoln was very interested in thinking of people in 1939 as someone who faced the same dilemma in his life and triumphed. On Broadway, the award-winning "Abe Lincoln in Illinois" by Robert E. Sherwood with the physically dead portrait of Raymond Massey played in packed houses (the film was shot in 1940). The continuation of his epic biography Carl Sandburg "Abraham Lincoln: The War Years" was published and quickly became a bestseller. President Roosevelt often referred to Lincoln in his speeches, and the Lincoln Memorial in Washington became the most popular landmark in the city (the fact that Frank Capra made good use of "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"). /> <br /> All this was not lost on Darryl F. Zanucku in 20th Century Fox; as soon as he read the script of Lamar Trotti on the first days of Lincoln as a lawyer, he described it as "prestigious" production and appointed John Ford to direct, and Henry Fonda to the star. <br /> <br /> Fonda you DO NOT want to play in Lincoln; he felt that he could not bring justice to the "Great Liberator" and he feared that a bad performance would hurt his career. Even a filmed make-up test in which he was stunned by how much he would recall Lincoln would not change his mind. According to Fonda, John Ford, with whom he never cooperated, sent him royal for the first meeting and explained that he did not introduce the Lincoln of Legend, but a young rural lawyer "jackanape" who faced the first murder trial. The humiliated Fonda took on this role. (John Ford suggested a different scenario, but the result was the same!) Of course, they found a chemistry that worked because almost all of their pairs gave "classics". <br /> <br /> Unlike Lincoln's melancholy Lincoln, Abe Lincoln in Illinois, Ford's vision consisted of a timid but nice young lawyer who easily befriends and misses his mother, whom he lost, too young ( as a result of ties with the pioneer mother) this becomes an important part of the story). Injustice moves him and says "common sense" to quell violence, interspersed with doses of humor. Both productions play in the (undocumented) relationship of Lincoln with Ann Rutledge; in the Ford version, the couple are really in love and devoted to each other. After her death, Lincoln often visited her grave to share her life with her "spirit" (the theme "Ford would continue in" She wore a yellow ribbon "). <br /> <br /> The attempt to murder is the focal point of the film and shows the huge talents of the star and director. Fonda deftly depicts Lincoln's lack of experience, but a sincere faith in mercy-dutiful justice, and Ford underlines the abyss between urban "intellectuals" (represented by the pompous DA Donald Meek and his slick "adviser", Stephen Douglas, played by young Milburn Stone) and informal, bending rules of Lincoln's government sense. With Ford "regular" Wardem Bond as a key witness, the process is both unconventional and riveted. <br /> <br /> With the closure of the film, when Lincoln goes into a turbulent distance and its destiny (dissolving in a statue in a Lincoln monument), the viewers could comfort the message of the movie that if the cause is right, the good will eventually win. <br /> <br /> "Young Mr. Lincoln" is a really amazing movie, from an amazing year!
