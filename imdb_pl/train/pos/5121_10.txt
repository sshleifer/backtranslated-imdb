I am a big fan of the film, but not for the typical reasons. I think Travolta and Winger played higher than average, I think the sets were representative of the place and the era, I liked the soundtrack and Charlie Daniels Band. I think, however, that the photography was amazing! Ever since the indoor scenes were filmed in a real club, and Gilley had low ceilings - maybe a height of 10-12 feet and smoke that was supposed to simulate a "smoke-filled bar", it hung 2-4 feet below the ceiling. The camera managed to take pictures through the smoke and focus on the actors, bull, bar, women, dance, low light that was actually in the bar! What a feat! Sure, there was auxiliary lighting, but in order to keep the atmosphere of the bar they had to be low-light shots. Ray Villalobos (cameraman) was outstanding! He got a few pictures that he did not hope to achieve, and their influence brought the film a sense of reality. Thanks, Ray - Great job!
