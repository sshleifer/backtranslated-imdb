This movie was my first exposure to Eddie Izzard. We had several friends in one night, and for some reason we surfed to HBO over the evening. Someone named Eddie Izzard was included. I tried not to laugh too loud at the first jokes. I did not want to be "responsible" for the rest of the group's joy from something that apparently killed me. After laughing for more than healthy, I gave up - like other of us (we were not stoned or talked about insurance and pensions ...). After that we were strangled. Plots, storyline, bizarre but brilliant connections throughout the sketch are nothing but brilliance. Since then, I've been addicted to every comedy of Eddie-Izzard I can get. His work is a pure genius. His comedy seems effortless. It seems more like this hysterically funny friend who is hanging around in your home and wandering around this or that ... He is convulsively funny. It gives you the impression that a joke is between you and yourself, the only true lover of humor. If you are disappointed with this film, you have no sense of the penultimate humor - nor humor, as they say in the UK.
