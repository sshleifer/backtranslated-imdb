We have high expectations for this. . . because his Zombie 3 is the official continuation of Zombi 2 and directed by Lucio Fulci. . . but . . . co-directed by Bruno Mattei (with Night of the Zombies) and not written by Dardino Sachetti, but by Claudio Fagrasso (Night of the zombie) and his shot in Phillimines, like Night of the Zombies and reminiscent of Night of the Zombies The Living Dead). the result is more like the companion of Hell of the Living Dead than Zombi 2. Fabrazio DeAngelis, who produced Zombi 2 and its editor Tomassi (?) and efx gianetto De Rossi, gave Zombie 2 its magic. . . Zombie 3 is not magical. . . is like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich without peanut butter. But over the years I accepted Zombie 3. I could have sworn that I saw the version in which the soldier was bitten in the arm and went to the hotel room. . . there was a pointless Fulci-cut, and Mattei / Fulci-cut is the one on DVD.
