This is the only full-length film about the world of the bridge. The first 10 minutes turned out to be a bit slow, but then the movie is absolutely perfect in describing professional bridge players and how they earn a living. <br /> <br /> Some scenes are very funny. I do not think that the non-bridge player will gain the charm of the movie. <br /> <br /> Some of the dresses are really beautiful, it's a pity that the film is black and white - I can only imagine how they would look in color. The way the media is presented is totally funny. There is no way on earth to ever be like that. <br /> <br /> See as soon as possible and tell your friends about it.
