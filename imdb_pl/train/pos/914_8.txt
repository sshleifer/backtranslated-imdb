Vivah is not a classic. However, in times of hardcore action, breakthrough special effects and complex plots (of which no one has yet mastered Bollywood), a simple film, like Vivah, is quite encouraging. The story that we all know is a journey from the first meeting of the couple to their eventual wedding after moments and trials. Nothing more nothing less. Music is not in the same league as MPK or HAHK, but it does not force the senses. Two songs stood out for me - Mujhe Haq Hai & Do Anjaane. While Milan abhi aadha and Hamaari shaadi were hummable. Shahid acts honestly and shows great potential. It's good to see him play something different, but "cool guy" that he normally does. Amrita is very sweet and perfectly fulfills the role of a docile little girl. Alok Nath, Anupam Kher & Seema Biswas are great support, and the rest of the cast performs a sensible job. The Suraj direction is simple but effective. The main disadvantage of the film is the slow pace that can test the patience of many young viewers. But all in all a good, clean, decent family movie.
