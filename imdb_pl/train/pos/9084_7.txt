Yes, some people said that this movie was a waste of money, but I'm the kind of big fan of filming a dragon / ending world / holy shit. <br /> <br /> But if you take my point, this movie had some of the best action sensations were quite good. But this kind of film, in which everything came into more difficult times, or when the evil was a triumph, fell to save them at the right time. Although there were a few funny lines and gangs in the whole movie that surprised me. <br /> <br /> 3D graphics were damn good. I mean, 3D effects for this kind of film were GREAT !!!! The great battle, which was shown in the trailers, will meet all expectations related to the film. The fight between good and evil at the end was, I must say, that it could have been longer and a bit better, it was still quite good. <br /> <br /> Now for parts that I think could be better. The beginning was quite good, showing the parts that led to the great battles. I mean, if you really do not want to watch this movie in cinemas, at least it's DVDer ... <br /> <br /> I've generally loved this movie, but the plot just came to make it fast and better only to make it well.
