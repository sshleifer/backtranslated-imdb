"Holes" is not only a "film for children", but also how events from the past affect us today, regardless of whether we know about them. When teen Stanley Yelnats III (Shia LeBoeuf) is sent to a POW camp, where he is forced to kick all day, he discovers many things about the camp and his personal relationship with this camp. Thanks to flashbacks, we learn that many things are closer than we realize (you will understand it better when you see a movie). LeBoeuf does a pretty good job, as do the other cast members: Sigourney Weaver, Jon Voight, Tim Blake Nelson, Henry Winkler, Patricia Arquette and Earth Kitt. A very interesting movie.
