I have no words to describe how good this movie is. Only a genius like Amrita Pritam could write such a true picture of division times. The film haunted me for many days. <br /> <br /> Urmila played the role of her life in this film. She played the role of Puroo, and Manoj Vajpai in the role of Rashid no less. It is hard to imagine someone other than the two in the role of Puroo and Rashid. Punjabi's costumes looked so natural on Urmila, and Manoj looked like natural Punjabi Mussalmaan. <br /> <br /> Sandhali Sinha as Lajjo and Suri as Ramchand did a fantastic job. Priyanshu Chattarjee did a good job as Triloki. <br /> <br /> Some of the scenes you simply can not come up with. When Puroo meets Lajjo for the first time, it brings tears to his eyes. A climax is simply an assassin. I was expecting a tragic ending, but fortunately the ending was great. <br /> <br /> This movie is in the same category as Pakeezah, Mughal-e-Azam, Banaras, etc. Not to be missed.
