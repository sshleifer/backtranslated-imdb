This is essentially a variation on the theme of House Of Wax, both the plot and the role played by the star of both films, Vincent Price. In both pictures, he plays a talented artist who is sent down, falling into madness, when his creations are usurped by other, less talented and less scrupulous people. In this movie, he plays an illusion designer for stage magicians who aspire to become an independent performing career to be frustrated when another illusionist, Big Rinaldo (John Emery) insists that he honors his contract and gives him the first choice of illusions he designs. The price is already bad for Rinaldi, because his ex-wife is now Rinaldi's lover. He uses his talents as an illusionist and as a brilliant follower to avenge himself on Rinaldi and others who frustrate his plans for being a performer and designer. <br /> <br /> Price is almost the whole performance here and gives a well-rated star as a wronged man whose troubles earn the sympathy of the audience. The rest of the cast is competent, if colorless, and the weight of the whole undertaking falls on Price, which easily lifts the burden. <br /> <br /> A good solid B movie melodrama, it's a crime movie, not a horror film, and it's enjoyable, provided you do not expect a masterpiece. Shot in black and white is low to the top and is best seen as a melodrama and enjoys the presence of his star giving an idiosyncratic performance
