This independent film is about the life of a group of people taking part in adult swimming in Connecticut. The plot is quite thin. What drives the film are characters, played splendidly by unknown actors. Distinctions in the cast include Brewster as a high school teacher who experiences marital problems, and Weixler as a casino dealer who shines as a stripper. Both actresses give natural performances and work well together. This is an impressive feature debut by writer Schechter and director Setton. The latter maintains the narrative in a quick clip. The title of the film and the poster suggest something primitive, but this is a great little comedy drama.
