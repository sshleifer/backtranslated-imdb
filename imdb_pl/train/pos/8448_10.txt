I've always been a big fan of Homicide: Life On The Street, so when I heard the upcoming movie coming up, I could not wait. <br /> <br /> Let me just say that I was not disappointed. It was one of the most powerful 2 hours of television I have ever seen. It was great to see everyone back, but the greatest pleasure was to restore Andre Braugher, because the relationship between Pembleton and Bayliss was always the strongest part of the comprehensive program.
