De Grot is a very good movie. The great story comes from Tim Krabbé's novel, which also adapted the story to the screen. Some really top-class acting, not only Van Huêt, but above all Marcel Hensema, who mainly worked on television before the performance of Axel van de Graaf. The film seems to be a copy of the thriller and provides the perfect mood. Then we start to learn about Egon Wagster and Axel van de Graafie, and the story is gradually revealed in a very fascinating flash-back structure that adds a more romantic character and dramatic character to the film. In the end, all this ends with an emotional ending that catches the audience with the help of throats. Make sure you know the least about the story when you're going to see the movie. Must see, especially if you like 'Spoorloos' (the original adaptation of The Vanishing screen).
