This is one of those movies that create better trailers than full-length feature films. The concept was really cool and different, the humor was unique, I just felt that there is no opportunity to put a "blow" in this movie. Too many lines and gags have remained hanging for too long, without a clear ending, and they have not really made me laugh. Wilson, Wilson, Farris and Thurman were great. Wanda Sykes was underused in this film and needed more exposure, as well as more opportunities to turn her character into more time on the screen. 7 out of 10 for me, more from a DVD rental company. I was also looking for a good music video during the final subtitles, something that became a trademark for these romantic comedies, and la Something About Mary, Meet the Parents, but again I was a little cheated by the fact that Could be a much better movie with a bit of music and more fluffy lines. It seemed RUSHED in theaters.
