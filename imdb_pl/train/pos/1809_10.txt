All Dogs Go To Heaven is the coolest animated film that has dogs in 1989. Previous Don Bluth Film Earth before time (1988) was successful. Dogs are as cute as small mice. I just want to hug them when they're cute. Where was I? Oh yes. His animation is beautiful, the characters are great when they are perfectly calm, and the songs are sweet and touching. It opened on November 17, 1989. The same date as the little mermaid produced by Walt Disney. Carface is so important because he wanted to kill Charlie. He should be ashamed! The Love Survive Song by Irene Cara and Freddie Jackson was so beautiful. All dogs go to heaven is the best animated film.
