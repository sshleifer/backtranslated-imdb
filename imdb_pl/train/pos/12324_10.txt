This movie is amazing. Thanks to the great characters, especially the old fencer who can fly in the shape of a fireball and jump over trees, this movie tells the classic story of the struggle between good and evil. The score is a bit cool. <br /> <br /> Very, very recommendable. Not for the smallest children. This deserves 10.
