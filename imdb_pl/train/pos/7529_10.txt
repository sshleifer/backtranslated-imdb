Two years have passed and usually everyone looks different, some for good, others for worse. I still enjoyed it as much as I did the original. <br /> <br /> Some of the disadvantages they had, like Joker's change, now have no red lips and look like more black hair and black pupils, are still expressed by Mark Hamill, which is probably a plus. They made Poison Ivy more white, becoming more planted, and Catwomen looks much different, not as "attractive" as in the original. <br /> <br /> Though costumes like Batman, Batgirl, Killer Croc and Scarecrows look bad, especially Scarecrow. <br /> <br /> The show is not as dark as the original, because Batman does not work the same as it used to be. Most of the time he works with Batgirl and new Robin, Tim Drake. While NightWing (Dick Grayson) often comes to the rescue. Batman gave up the yellow logo and with a black wing on his suit and it looks like he has become a bit bigger, but he's still kicking a lot of butt. <br /> <br /> The show is not as good as the original, mainly because of some of the rebuilt characters, but the stories are as exciting as ever, and the dialogue is still elitist. "Over the Edge" may be one of the biggest episodes of Batman, so make sure you check it out. <br /> <br /> Generally 8-9 / 10
