Here's what I wrote to some friends before: <br /> <br /> SAINT KRAP, Grudge is honest with God, one of the scariest movies I've ever seen! I am either very soft at my age, or Sam Raimi and Ghost Pictures have done the KICK A ** job! (I can not wait for Boogeyman!) <br /> <br /> I was very scared I was sitting in a dark theater and I regretted that I did not have anyone, anyone sitting next to me (except the hero in "Grudge".) I swear, there were many jump scenes that were NOT expected! I felt stupid, but my nerves did not care! I was on the edge of the whole movie, from the initial subtitles, and the music was fantastically terrifying. I still think about this sound and I DO NOT like it! <br /> <br /> I loudly gasped and cried: "oh" on one stage !! Oh, yes, I even half covered my eyes! However, for the wise: I think some of the scenes were a bit psychotic. My DH hated Event Horizon and thought that whoever wrote it is sick and psychotic, but I do not remember the movie, so I can not compare it. <br /> <br /> I can not say that "I liked" this movie b / c I was terrified, but he was very good and terrifying. The final scene too ... whoa! For being a 32-year-old mummy, I think I can have nightmares in this movie, especially because of this sound. Please, get out of my head;) <br /> <br /> In summary, it's not a more modest movie when I grew up (Jason, Freddy). This is the most frightening movie. Perfect for Halloween. <br /> <br /> Two great trailers for this movie are Boogeyman and The Ring 2 !!
