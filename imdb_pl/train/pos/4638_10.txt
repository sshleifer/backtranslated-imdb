I saw this movie when I was in Israel for the summer. my Hebrew is not fluid, so the subtitles were very useful, I did not feel lost at any point in the movie. You tend to get used to the subtitles after about 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> This movie has dispelled me !!!!!! It presents two of the most famous taboos in the Middle East: a homosexual relationship between an Israeli and a Palestinian. It allows a person to enter both spheres of conflict simultaneously. A dilemma, it entailed emotions. The film ends in tragedy, when anger and rage lead one of the lovers to one side! absolutely must see !!
