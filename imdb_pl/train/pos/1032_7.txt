Film with news, but pretty good. Excellent casting, from top to bottom. Interestingly, the plot of Bette Davis is basically a retrograde story! Extremely negative reviews (throwing the surname on the screenplay / playwright, associating it in some way with very negative comments about "Angles in America", etc.) They are opposed to making the film too loud about Germany during World War II. Wow, this is just too sophisticated understanding of morality for me. <br /> <br /> Theater and film scenes and acting are different in time, and of course 70 years later this particular film would not have been realized in this way. Yes, Casablanca is a better movie (I think), but even though it was made in the same year and has Nazis in it, Casablanca is primarily a love story. The love story in this film takes second place on the spy story - more thriller. Both have quite a large number of cheap tricks and great actors. Children are a bit tedious and can be edited
