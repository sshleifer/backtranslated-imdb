Martin Sheen, Michelle Phillips, Stuart Margolin and the late Vic Morrow are the human stars of this film about a young man looking for answers about the death of his brother. Mr. Sheen, Mr. Margolin and Mr. Morrow turn to their roles first; Ms. Phillips has a little less than the enviable task of trying to spice up a film made especially for television (twenty-five years ago), providing "sexual interest" with no sex. The real star is, however, the "California kid"; Ford coupe from 1934, borrowed from "Jake" Jacobs, put in front of the camera and subjected to training, which will leave the viewer panting, panting and holding the edge of the seat with bated breath. <br /> <br /> The action of the stage is spectacular (though some of the dialogs are a bit bad), which makes the evening great. In this way, all "car films" should be created. <br /> <br /> Try to catch it on the late movie channel; it is worth the wrong dream.
