Dick Tracy was not the best for many comic fans because they wanted something with blood like Batman. Dick Tracy plays innocence simply as a comic with villains who have serious disorder of appearance and play. Warren Beatty directs and plays the main role that fights crime, even without the use of super power. Since childhood, I've liked Dick Tracy because of the comic atmosphere of the main colors: red, blue, orange, yellow, green and black. It's the perfect movie for anyone who can watch it with children. Al Pacino is like Jack Nicholson in Batman and he plays Big Boy Caprice with enthusiasm. Madonna as a child who is the second villain in this film, does not play the same boy toy that he represents. Like I said, without blood, obscene, sexual insinuations or anything that could offend someone.
