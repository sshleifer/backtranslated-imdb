I saw this movie for the first time about 11 years ago, when my former accounting professor recommended it to me. I was amazed that the film from 1968 could consistently and amusingly present computer crime. Maggie Smith is delightful, and Ustinov perfectly plays the "retro hacker". "About Nolo Mio" !!!!!
