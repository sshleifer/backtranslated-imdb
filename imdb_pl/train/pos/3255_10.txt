Each stage was perfectly connected. This movie had a great cast and crew. I mean, how can you have a bad movie with Robert Downey Jr. in this movie, none will be and will never be. It has the ability to lighten each movie with its amazing talent. This movie was perfect! I saw the movie, which sat alone on the shelf with films in "Blockbuster" and just as he called me, I could not resist picking him up and taking him home. You can call me a sweet romantic, but this movie just touched my heart, not to mention that he made me laugh at the same time. Although I cried, I admit, in the end, the whole movie just brightened my view of life after this event. I suggested my horror, action and a pure movie about the mood of a brother who loved this movie. This is a film with a good feeling. It can make you laugh loudly, touch your heart, fall in love and enjoy life. Whenever you deliberately go past this movie, be aware that you are consciously making a choice to live and feel this inspirational movie. Who knows? What if it can really happen to you? And keep the mind open to the mystical wonders of life.
