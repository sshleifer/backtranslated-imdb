Since I remember, I loved airplanes and flying. I am now in college with a private pilot license and I want to become an advertisement. I never remember why I was so obsessed with this subject until I came across my old Tail Spin tapes in my basement at home and it struck me. My parents bought every tape they had, and it was the only program I watched as a child. I remembered this subject when I was growing up, and I can quote it today. This is absolutely amazing and I plan to buy a DVD soon! It is really great for children and adults and is absolutely timeless. I do not have enough of this series.
