It's a great movie in many ways. I liked everything in my family. The animation is excellent and it shows easily that there are many producers who make films that are so visually brilliant as everything that comes from Disney Studio. <br /> <br /> One of the differences from the normal Disney tariff is that this Dreamworks movie does not contain a wise side crack for relief in comedy. And there are no sudden moments when the characters break into the song. I am sure that the scene at the beginning of the film would not appear in the image of Disney: the birth of the Spirit. But it's tasteful and it's not offensive. The "ghost" was a great breath of fresh air. Do not get me wrong. I've been in love with Disney for years and will continue to do so. <br /> <br /> "Spirit" is another example of a great animated tariff. As soon as it was over, my children wanted to watch it again. I had the same feeling. I totally recommend it.
