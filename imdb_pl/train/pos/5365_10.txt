Running Man is often dismissed as another Arnie action thriller, full of explosions, bad word games and shootings, and there's a lot to be honest to be honest. People looked at it and compared it to the Terminator series, saying it was one of the poorest films by Schwarzenegger. <br /> <br /> But give him 18 years and you will be able to appreciate it in a different light. Instead of being another mindless action movie, it works very well as a parody of reality TV. That's true, quite different from Stephen King's book, but I doubt if Hollywood, with a passion for optimistic endings and the so-called "ordinary guys" who turned out to have the skills of a trained commando, would accept it in its current form. <br /> <br /> But with a review. <br /> <br /> Ben Richards (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a police officer working in the dystopian United States, where democracy belongs to the past, and the whole country is ruled by a combination of government / media conglomerates. The economy is in tatters, food is rare, and the state makes people distract, producing sadistic shows so that they can watch, for example, Jumping for Dollars, where people jump for money down angry dogs, and the most popular is The Running Man, an entertainment program led by slimy Damian Killian (played by a funny Richard Dawson), where the supposed "criminals" are pursued by theatrical, provocative "stalkers". <br /> <br /> Some, however, are trying and acting against the government. When a group of hungry people protests in the city of Bakersfield, California, a helicopter piloted by Richards is sent to the "peace" (ie Kill) protest. When Richards refuses to shoot innocent people, he gets arrested and framed for the murder of people in the crowd. He was sentenced to a slave labor camp, but escapes with the help of the resistance leader (Yaphet Kotto) and escapes. <br /> <br /> However, his freedom does not last long and after kidnapping the network Amber Mendez employee (Marita Conchita Alonso), trying to escape from people chasing him, is again taken prisoner, but this time he is forced to appear in The Running Man. <br /> <br /> And of course, the whole movie goes into the standard Arnie mode. Richards is introduced into the post-apocalyptic wilderness of Los Angeles (why LA is always destroyed in these dystopian worlds?) And forced to flee from "persecutors", along with two other prisoners who escaped from the labor camp. Amber is also curious about Richards' protests about innocence and discovers he has been framed. Guess what will happen to her? So when Amber, Richards and two other guys are running around trying to avoid their pursuers, we soon realize that Richards is not just a cop. It's Super Arnie, an unbearable one-man army that can crash bad corporate dictatorship and fight obese men in holiday lights, while being just an American guy with an Austrian accent. <br /> <br /> Yes, the rest of the movie becomes stupid, loud, classic Arnie from the 80s. There are many exciting battle sequences, scary punk trademarks ("He had to divide" being my favorite ") and general formal final confrontation and a happy ending. It's very fun to watch Killian react to this typical "healthy" way of playing host games, and some of the funniest moments in the show focus on the contrast between his interactions with the crowd as a seemingly friendly host (watch out for the cursing old woman!) And cold, cynical a man who is in fact who will do anything to increase the number of grades. <br /> <br /> If you are expecting a smart film with high hair, you will be disappointed. But if you want a great movie from the 80s, that's it. But the great thing about this movie is that it was quite prophetic. <br /> <br /> If you look at the entertainment that we have today, you will see how reality TV is going - shows showing people willing to introduce everything in five minutes, and producers too eager to let them humiliate themselves television. It is no exaggeration to imagine that some nasty television producer tried to get the right to show people that they would be executed live on television. But we already had it in ghostly movies about the prosecution of al-Qaid hostages published on the Internet. It seems that in the current climate, at least some people are fine, watching the real death on their TVs. <br /> <br /> With this in mind, in combination with the fact that everything seems to be rebirth of the 80s nowadays, you have to be impressed by the foresight of this film. Of course, we have not got there yet, because it's terrorists, not mainstream media, who bought us easily accessible programs with real human death, but you just have to think about how long it will take before someone decides to check if he can find a way to a show that combines the desire for entertainment and the willingness to devote to their morbid curiosity ...
