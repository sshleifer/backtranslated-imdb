Burlinson and Thornton are giving a great performance in this film together with Dennehy. Although it is initially thought that it is only about love, it really goes deeper. The beauty of nature captures this film, counting among the best I have ever seen. The horse scenes are absolutely fantastic !! Every horse lover will love this movie! <br /> <br />
