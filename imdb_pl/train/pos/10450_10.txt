I accidentally scanned the TV channels and found this wonderful movie about two beautiful human beings that draw themselves together in a very innocent and virginal way. Ethan Hawke (Jesse) "Tape" '01 and Julie Delpy (Celine) "ER" 94 TV Series (Nicole). This girl and guy will warm your heart and soul and make you think deeply about your past relationships and how you really would like you to follow your hearts with a guy or gala that you loved deeply and lost sight of over the years. Jesse and Celine have great conversation and deep eye contact with a great magnetic explosion between them. I am looking forward to SEQUEL for this film in 2004 and if you watch this movie, you will feel the same way.
