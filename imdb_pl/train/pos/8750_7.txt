Brokedown Palace is the story of two best friends, Alice and Darlene, who set out on a spontaneous trip to Thailand and go to jail after being caught with drugs in their luggage. In this way, the film can become a serious and moving movie, such as "Return to Paradise", but instead the movie decided to focus on the situation of girls and their friendship. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale play great performances, and the film is more about mutual interaction - suspicion, jealousy, challenge and testing their friendship and ultimately sacrifices in the name of friendship. This film does not delve deeply into politics, or even the severity of prison life (which is somewhat exaggerated) and focuses more on these problems with friendship. <br /> <br /> There were a few holes in the storyline and some parts that simply did not seem credible or realistic. We did not feel the real fear and hopelessness of their situation as good as we could. And we have a very small sense of life outside the prison walls, and Bill Pullman plays a supposedly poor lawyer who turns out to have a golden heart. In short, it should be much darker on all sides than it was. <br /> <br /> But overall, I liked it. Acting was good, the soundtrack was perfect, and the plot had enough twists to stay interesting. Worth seeing.
