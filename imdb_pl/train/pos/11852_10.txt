Spirit is a unique and original look at Western life from the point of view of a wild horse and Native Americans. The film focuses on the friendships and dangers that a wild horse encounters in his life. and realism. <br /> <br /> The music is fantastic, with songs by Bryan Adams and music by Hans Zimmer, who was also responsible for the incredibly popular music from the blockbuster Disney from 1994, The Lion King. > <br /> The story is not too deep, but the fact that it is not as in-depth as some films, in my opinion does not diminish the whole movie. <br /> <br /> an excellent movie that I liked a lot and which is suitable for the whole family. Not to be missed. (10/10)
