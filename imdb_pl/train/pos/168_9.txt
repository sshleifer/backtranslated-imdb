This is one of the best Talkies by Joan Crawford. It was the first merger of Gable-Crawford and made the MGM and the public understand that they are a sizzling band, which led the studio to make the next seven films with them as stars. <br /> <br /> The film convincingly shows the fall of brother and sister who, after their father loses everything in the stock market, must take care of himself and earn a living. Life is hard in a crisis, and soon even their attempts to find a legitimate job will prove futile and resort to being active in the underground world. <br /> <br /> Joan Crawford is great as a sociable minor. She is clever, complex and credible. She even soothes the theatrical stiffness of the early actors' style. Clark Gable is damn rough, masculine and harsh like a gangster without nonsense who engages in Crawford's character. In the same year, he would play a similar and even more successful role with Norma Shearer in "A Free Soul", securing his position as the highest male sex symbol in MGM. <br /> <br /> If you like Crawford in this role, do not miss "Paid", which she did a year earlier, which is also one of her best early performances Talkie. <br /> <br />
