All good films "inspire" some of the films that imitate the followers. I was afraid that "Gladiator" was not so good in the movie because I did not see any movie that for many months had something similar to Roman on the shelf with new releases. Then I noticed the latest Full Moon offer, Demonicus. I am a fan of the series Puppetmaster Full Moon and Blood Dolls, but I have never seen any of their non-lethal puppet movies. In any case ... <br /> <br /> Demonicus chronicles what happens to a group of holidaymakers in the mountains of the Alps. One of the campers, James, finds a cave with old gladiators artifacts and feels forced to remove the helmet from the corpse and try it. He becomes possessed and, like the demonic gladiator Tyrannus, is forced to kill his friends to revive corpses that are the real Tyrann. <br /> <br /> Consent, like many full-length movies, has little or no budget at all. Sometimes the editing and the director was so amateur that I would swear that I was watching the Blair Witch Project. Trying to cut off my limbs and heads reminds me of Monty Python's sketch. The weapon, though seemingly real, looks really vivid. It looks just like it was filmed by a group of friends using a digital camera over the weekend. Of course, there is nothing wrong with film production, just do not rent it, expecting a technical masterpiece. It seems that the script was also tried, because Tyrannus does not behave like a gladiator till the end, at least he speaks Latin. <br /> <br /> Everything goes aside, I really liked this movie. Maybe not as much as a deadly puppet movie, but Full Moon still delivers! The only thing that disappointed me was that at the end there was no Full Moon videophone!
