"De Grot" is a great Dutch thriller, based on a book written by Tim Krabbé. Another of his books, "Het Gouden Ei" became the great Dutch thriller "Spoorloos" ("The Vanishing") from 1988. This one is not as good as this thriller (though much better than the American remake also called "The Vanishing"), but it happens to be close. <br /> <br /> Especially the opening times are great. We see a man, later we find out that his name is Egon Wagter (Fedja van Huêt), coming from a plane in Thailand. When he picks up his bags, it's pretty clear he smuggles something across the border. These scenes are perfectly directed, photographed and played. There is a kind of tension that you would not normally have in such an opening scene. Later, we see Egon signing a deal with a woman with Thailand, both say they never did something like that. <br /> <br /> From this moment the movie is constantly played back and flashing. We see Egon, still as a child (played by Erik van der Horst), befriends a guy named Axel (as a child played by Benja Bruijning). We learn how they grew up as friends and how Axel (as an adult played by Marcel Hensa) became a criminal. Egon, in the meantime, goes to college and settles with a woman. During this time, he sometimes meets Axel, but does not really want to have anything to do with him. <br /> <br /> The film is in a sense chronological. Shows Egon and Axel as children, than as students, young adults and in their thirties. But from time to time, as I said, the movie goes back to the days when they were children and jumped again. Every time we see them as children, it explains something that happens when they are adults. <br /> <br /> There are small spoilers here. <br /> <br /> The title means "Cave" and it is a cave that gives the film a happy ending, although in reality it is not so happy. Like the beginning, the ending is great. The middle part of the movie is fun and in a sense distracts our attention on the first scenes, and finally come back at this moment. This edition gives the film a happy ending, although we can say that the dramatic ending is in a way happy.
