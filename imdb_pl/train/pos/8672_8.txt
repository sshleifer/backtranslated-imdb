The last PPE WWE in 2006 proved to be a hit among fans, but only for one reason, a ladder match that was to be held only with Paul London and Brian Kendrick against William Regal and Dave Taylor. But when the last shit PPV was December for Dismember, WWE knew he had to do something to get the fans talking again, it was useful when MNM and The Hardy Boyz were introduced to the mix and announced that the match would be a ladder match. <br /> <br /> The match was brutal and was one of the best ladder games I've ever seen, but Joey Mercury's face was a complete mess. Johnny Nitro did not even check his partner, they just kept going as if nothing had happened, and Taylor and Regal did nothing during the match, except to hit people with a few arrows from the ladder. In the end, London and Kendrick retained their titles. <br /> <br /> Elsewhere, Kane defeated MVP in a decent inferno match when he set fire to a stupid MVP suit. Chris Benoit defeated Chavo Guerrero in a decent match, Gregory Helms defeated Jimmy Wang Yang to keep the WWE Cruiserweight Title in a solid effort. <br /> <br /> But the main event was a total mess, King Booker joined forces with Finlay to take John Cena and Batista. The action was cheesy and nobody cared about who chose Batista for his partner. <br /> <br /> Overall results: Kane defeated MVP in inferno match. <br /> <br /> Paul London and Brian Kendrick have kept WWE Team titles against The Hardy Boyz, MNM and David Taylor and William Regal in a ladder match. <br /> <br /> Chris Benoit defeated Chavo Guerrero to keep the US title in a decent match. <br /> <br /> Gregory Helms defeated Jimmy Wang Yang to maintain the Cruiserweight championship. <br /> <br /> Boogeyman defeated Miz in a terrible match. <br /> <br /> Undertaker defeated Mr. Kennedy in the last match. <br /> <br /> John Cena and Batista beat King Booker and Finlay in a disastrous match. <br /> <br /> Overall rating - B
