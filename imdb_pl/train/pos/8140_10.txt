For the first time I saw this movie on a movie channel (HBO?). I was a fan of Public Enemy, NWA and other early raps and I saw CB4 in cinemas. In any case, the promo caught my eye and I wanted to see what this is all about. Well, I knew right away (WARNING!) And I was right. The parody songs themselves make this film worth watching over and over again (My Peanuts), but the overall flow and implementation of the film were great. You have to love the satire of rap groups (of course NWA), some rappers (Eazy E, Flava Flav, Ice Cube) and humor of the three NWH members. Who can forget scratching at Tone Deaf? It is a pity that this film did not get the recognition it deserved because it was overshadowed by CB4 while it was being released, but in my opinion it is a much better movie. If you know and like a gangster rap from the 90s, you will be watching and laughing for a long time. If you are not or do not like "rap", you are joking, at the expense of the genre.
