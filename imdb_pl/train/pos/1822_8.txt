The unforgettable masterpiece of the creator of The Secret of Nimh and The Land Before Time is a very moving sweet-bitter cartoon. I remember it very well from childhood, it was fun, sad and very beautiful. Well, it starts a bit dark, the dog who escaped from the pound, and is killed by an old friend, goes to Heaven and returns. But it becomes sweet when he befriends an orphaned girl who can talk to animals. Some of the scenes were a bit scary as opposed to other cartoons, like the sequence of Charlie's dreams, but everything else was fine, and the songs were fair. Unforgettable role of Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise, I love this guy, ahehehe. And Judith Barsi Jaws The Revenge, God bless her soul, poor girl, do not deserve to die, but now he is in Heaven, all good people go to Heaven. Generally it is a very good animated film, Don Bluth is classical enough to embarrass anime and Disney. Recommended for the whole family. And know this, if you have an original movie about it, you find after the movie, Dom DeLuise has a very important and special message, I must love this guy, ahehehe.
