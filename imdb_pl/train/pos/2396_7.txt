This is a very funny movie that accompanies Macbeth's attempts to produce in New York. Although he has a lot to say about power, jealousy and ambition (Macbeth's motives) in our modern world, the movie works best when it does not take itself too seriously. Recognizing actors such as John Glover, Gloria Reubens and David Lansbury perform good work in major roles, but for me the most important was the comic scene in which the "murder" of Banquo (John Elsen) is practiced. Probably a more entertaining movie for those involved in the theater, but anyone who likes Shakespeare should enjoy the movie.
