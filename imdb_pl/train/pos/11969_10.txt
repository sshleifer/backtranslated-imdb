I loved this adolescent program and I'm still watching the DVD of the first season at the age of 19. What can I say? I grew up in a house similar to the one at Full House. I had a father, two sisters and a dog. I think the only difference was that I did not live with my uncle and my dad's best friend. I also grew up with my mother at home. I do not know what I would do without Full House on TV. I think Stephanie (played by Jodie Sweetin), D.J. (played by sister Kirk Cameron, Candace) and Michelle (played by Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen) are my favorite characters. I can refer to each of them because I'm the middle child of my family, like Steph, I'm a younger sister like Michelle, and I'm an older sister like D.J. I really like the fact that the program always has moral values, because I do not really like any of the programs similar to O.C. I also like the full house comedy. Uncle Jesse (John Stamos), Joey (Dave Coulier) and Danny (Bob Saget) are hilarious as girls, friend of dad and dad, respectively. The story says that after my mother's death, Danny's best friend, Joey and his brother-in-law, Jesse, help raise their children. Three men trying to raise three young girls = fun. Every character in Full House is full of heart, funny and truly credible. Joey is a beginner comedian with the heart and soul of a child. Jesse is a cool, uncle-driven motorcycle who is softened by his three nieces and later by his wife Becky (Laurie Laughlin from Summerville). Both children and adults will be delighted with this performance. Guaranteed.
