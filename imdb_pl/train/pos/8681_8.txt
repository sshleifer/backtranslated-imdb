This drawing is short on the storyline, but it is a visually stunning work. They will be very, very minor spoilers: <br /> <br /> This short has a "story" that is incredibly small - underground gnomes are responsible for the return of spring every year, but they have to struggle with the winter that is not yet ready to withdraw . Both gnomes and the storm have their own songs. It's actually a plot, as it is. But this cartoon is not about the plot - it's about color and animation. The graphics are unique. Already in 1936. Such a bright color was still something like a novelty and here is an amazingly inspired work. <br /> <br /> My favorite moments of short sound surround the movement of liquid colors through pipes. In more than one point there is a series of pipes aligned in a row, from the shortest to the highest, and the colors pass through the pipes, and the music track gives the impression that the government was a pipe organ. <br /> <br /> The visualization of the battle between the emerging green and the winter storm, which refuses to leave it calmly, are extremely well made. These kinds of shorts were things that Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising are known for, but they probably also helped lead to their final departure from MGM, because this cartoon probably exceeded the budget, and MGM ultimately decided that they could better control costs if the animation department were managed by someone more cost conscious than Harman and Ising. <br /> <br /> This is a really beautiful cartoon and it's worth seeing. It is available on DVD Attack of 30 characters. Recommended, especially if you like good animation.
