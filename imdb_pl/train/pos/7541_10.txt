This Showtime movie really deserves a much better viewer rating than 4.5; I gave him 10 based on the history and action of two stars. After reading the comments of the viewer, I was surprised at how many people expected this movie to be a comedy. Yes, I see that IMDb lists it as Comedy / Drama in Genre. This is certainly misleading, right? Fortunately, I saw the movie before logging in to this site, so I did not have that expectation. In fact, basing on the summary of what I heard, I fully expected that it would simply be a drama. I wonder if the disappointment that this is not a funny movie has caused so many low votes. <br /> <br /> Another factor that could have caused low voices is that this movie is very "driven by characters." "Driving Miss Daisy" is an example of another movie based on a character who comes to mind. Someone previous comment complained about a boring attempt. Tom's (Danny Glover's) work scenes seemed to divert attention away from the real plot of the film. I mean, how he built up his family up - or his personal soldiers, if you like. However, they served to establish credibility and justification as his right to move to Greenwich and transfer to the world. <br /> <br /> Tom's obsession became a compulsion. He proved that he would not stop at anything to blend in to the white area. His worry when another black man moved next was not because of the color of the skin. It's because of everything that the "interlocoror" represented; everything Tom left. In fact, Tom became the cookie Oreo: Black outside, but White inside. <br /> <br /> The last 20 minutes of this movie are among the most powerful written, directed and actor (by Whoopi Goldberg) I've had the pleasure of being a witness. I realized that the culmination of the film was not an obvious event that happened next (I do not want to give it away). The climax is verbal and Whoopi delivers it. I'm still not sure if it's a conversation when she tells Tom, who college Tom-Two is going to or when he releases it, all in the middle of the night and Tom wakes up. Nevertheless, the solution is great. You know that life on this street will never be the same. <br /> <br /> My favorite way of moving the character: people get through problems, they suffer, they dance, they grow, they change and they live. As an audience member, I can learn or inspire something.
