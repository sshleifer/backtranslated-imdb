The two were excellent - the best since the series returned. Certain parts of the story have been stitched from previous films, but these TV programs do not do it at present. What we have here is a great science fiction story. A great big (really frightening) monster trapped at the base of a deep well, excellent aliens in The Ood - the best "new" aliens, about whom the reborn series came up, a set of basically nice and reliable human figures (along with several unnamed "unnecessary" people in real security fashion Star Trek), some philosophical topics on a large scale (love, loyalty, faith, etc.) and some special effects from the top shelf. <br /> <br /> I loved every minute of it.
