The wonderful use of inflated technicolor illustrates the optimistic extremes of today's Christmas. The preview element during the scenes (Miko≈Çaj and Pedro summarize the behavior of the society peeping through the telescope) is unique (and of course, Jean-Luc Godard, although he was subtle, stole this topic in his film "Pierrot le-fou"). Highly recommended!
