The classic novel by Robert A. Heinlein "Starship Troopers" has been attacked in all of Paul Verhoeven's films from the TV series in many years, as well as in many games. But none of them, so to speak, really capture the spirit of his novel. Games are usually unrelated, the TV series was more spin-off, and the less you were told about Verhoeven's film, the better. Little, however, knows that in Japan an animated adaptation has already been made, it has released Heinlein's death year. And, believe it or not, despite the differences, this six-part animated series is the most faithful in the adaptation of the Heinlein classics. <br /> <br /> The most obvious advantage of this series is the presence of powered armor of armor, something that we were deprived of in the film Verhoevena. Like the book, the series focuses more on heroes and their relationships than on action and space travel, although we see a lot of each. While events occur differently than in the book, the sense of the story of the book is present. Rico and Carmen have a romantic entanglement, but it's a bit more affected than in the book. While some may believe that the dialogue and interaction of the characters are slightly worse than the book (it's getting a bit anime, but what did you expect?), But it's much better than the movie. Heinlein's political views are only removed, in contrast to the film in which they are reversed. The biggest benefit of the series, however, is the climatic battle on Klendath between soldiers and worms / aliens, which includes a type of action with power armor, which we would like to see in the film version. > <br /> Generally I liked this series because I wanted to see a vision closer to Heinlein. And I think they've dealt with it well. If you find this series, look at it.
