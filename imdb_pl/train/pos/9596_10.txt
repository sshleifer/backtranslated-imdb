This film documents the transforming experience of a group of young men, and the experience of watching is in itself transformative for the viewer. Few films even aspire to this level of transcendence and I can not think of any other film - document or drama - that achieves this. There is no other movie in which we both laughed so much and cried so much. Yes, it's about DMD and available journeys; in these matters it is a viable undertaking, but it is more. It's about friendship. It's about life itself, about life every day you live. And this is a great, fun, adventurous narrative. That's why God created cinema! See this movie !!!
