Lauren Bacall lived with her husband Humprey Bogarts and death when she made the movie. Rock Hudson was at the peak of the fifties of the '50s. Dorothy Malone is in excellent shape and earns an Oscar for her support. Robert Stack is nominated and does not fit his role. <br /> <br /> The story is a bit of soap from another time, but just as valuable as most of the dramas. It's amazing how well drunks can lead the movie, and how quickly the early sequences form in a few movies. <br /> <br /> You can see why the cast is so good and properly in terms of production this movie is very good. You can say that Bacall is distracted during this movie, while her game is ok, in some sequences she looks emotionally exhausted. <br /> <br /> The sexual references in this film are so gentle that many of today's young viewers do not realize who they are. The film does a good job of telling a story and actually leaves it at the end of the sequel, though none was ever created - although Written Beyond THe Wind would be a good title.
