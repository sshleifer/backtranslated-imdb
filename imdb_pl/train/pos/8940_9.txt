The autobiography on which this film is based remains one of the most thrilling books I have ever read. He tells of the amazing stories of two sisters who earned devotion and respect, working well at the age of 70 as a teacher and dentist, and then lived with dignity for the next 30 years. Ruby Dee steals the film thanks to the perfect nuance as the rebellious "black" Bessie, the dentist. She not only expresses her anger, anger and wisdom; allows you to know exactly where they come from, using the economics of words. Diahnn Carroll has the impression of an older sister, a teacher, perfectly, but I'm afraid he never believes he is over 100 years old. Regardless - stories are worth telling. Amy Madigan is a bit too extreme and intrusive in behaving overwhelmed and uncertain in the first half of the movie as a reporter of the Caucasian NY Times. This is also just a small dispersion. All these stories are a real attraction and although two or three are slightly damaged in translation, most of them go to the end. <br /> <br /> I recommend the book as a necessary reading to all those who recommend all books to. I can not completely abandon this TV movie in this thin air, but it certainly gives it enough flavor to be very valuable in itself.
