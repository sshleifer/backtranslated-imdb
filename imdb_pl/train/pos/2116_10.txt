Was there ever a movie more charming than this one? One of the reasons why everything works so well is that a group of actors really seem to interact and influence their lives. His center is the "affair" of James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan, who cooperate with each other and can not get along face to face, but they are completely anonymous to each other as puma pals. But there are also supporting characters and, unlike many romantic comedies (including "You've Got Mail", the latest update of "Store"), they are not just raised to support the two main roles and their needs. Everyone becomes a complicated part of Ernst Lubitsch's rich tapestry. One of the most moving scenes in film history takes place when the almost tragic Frank Morgan in disbelief and humbleness looks for someone who could eat a Christmas dinner. You must see! **** outside ****
