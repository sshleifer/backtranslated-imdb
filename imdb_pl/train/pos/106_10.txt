The first von Trier movie I've ever seen broke the waves. Probably a nice movie, but definitely stands in the shadow of Europe. Europe tells the story of a young German who wants to experience Germany just after the Second World War. He takes a job that his uncle arranged for him as a purser in a luxury train. Because of his work, he travels through almost completely destroyed Germany, meets with the killing of traitors and hunts for ex-Nazi party members. Society suffers from corruption. His uncle narrowed his consciousness, focusing on work, which he also has as purring on the train. By chance, the main character engages in bombardment and terrorism by a group called "werewolves" who puts pressure on him to help them place bombs on trains. The atmosphere is amazing. The viewer is transferred from the stage to the stage by a man trying to introduce the viewer into hypnosis, and then counting to wake you up in the new scene. Only when you think you have seen a lot !!!!!!! Europe!!
