In 1999, I hated the first episode of this program ("Protesting Hippies"), in which I avoided the rest. However, when he appeared in "The Paramount Comedy Channel", I looked at it completely and to my surprise it turned out to be absolutely funny (Motto: never judge the comedy series in the first week)! <br /> <br /> In 1969, "Hippies" play Simon Pegg as "Ray Purbbs", the editor of the underground magazine "Oz" called "Mouth". His friends are feminist Jill, relaxed Alex and half-jokes Hugo. In the late 1960s, there was incredible optimism among young people that they can change the world by printing magazines that nobody reads. Instead of mocking the naivety of hippies, "Hippies" are sensitive to her. Scenarios of Arthur Mathews brazenly parody many icons of that era - "Hair", "Woodstock", "Graduate", and even the infamous attempt to obscenity "Oz" from the early 70s. Excellent cast performances; "Alex" by Julian Rhinda-Tutt surprised me with the figure of Richard O'Sullivan from "Man About The House". It is a pity that there has never been a second series, probably because of people like me. If you missed "Hippies", try. Once you pass the opener, a feast awaits you!
