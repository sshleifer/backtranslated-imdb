This second film is just as interesting as the previous one, except that there is no tension. We know what he will do and what will happen before it even appears on the screen. Then the pleasure comes only from the way in which various tricks and their consequences occur. We know that there will be dynamite in the car, that it will lose the wheel, that the car will collide, talking about the car. And it happens. Now the details and details are to discover them in the film. The fact that he can be baited by some stupid woman is obvious and must come, but we know he has seen her and knows he is being trapped. How will he get out of this? This is what you need to discover yourself. And do not worry, he'll get the main trader, but what a different story it is. The fast boat does not fit our busy beaver on the river. We also know when he will be injured. They did not know what bulletproof jackets were in those days. It is true that it has been recently discovered that some geographical indications do not have this type of equipment in Iraq. But what is the meaning of such a movie? This is an insistence on the hunt for human traffickers and blindness that does not see that this prohibition creates a problem. But the film is a constant and perfect illustration that there is no value that could stand in the way of this moralistic crusade against the forces of evil. Why not just legalize these goods so that they can be properly observed and observed? When something is not illegal or pushed out of the way, using them is the least pleasant to do. This is forbidden or restricted, which is attractive. <br /> <br /> Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris Dauphine University, Paris University 1 Sorbonne Pantheon and Versailles University Saint Quentin en Yvelines
