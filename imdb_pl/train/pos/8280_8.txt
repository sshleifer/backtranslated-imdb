George and Kim travel with their young son Miles to a remote cabin in northern New York, when their car hits a deer and turns in a ditch. But what seems to be an ordinary misfortune is the beginning of a terrifying journey, in which the myth becomes reality and the body-eating spirit, half-animal and half-human Wendigo, haunts the small town ... "Wendigo" by Larry Fessenden is provocative horror, which often feels sullen in the family drama. Acting is great, the characters are well developed and there are times that chilling in your veins. Subtle flashes of Wendigo are handled efficiently and it is never clear what is real or what is imagined, and even if history takes place only in Miles's head. "Wendigo" is my first contact with the work of Larry Fessenden and certainly will not be the last. Give this film a chance if you do not mind watching something unconventional. 8 out of 10.
