For the first time, I watched this movie when I was a child and it is the only moment in my life that I remember when I put my hands on my face and eyes in horror on one stage. I remembered it again with a conversation with my friends from the union and quickly bought it on video with a lot of hesitation, which I might add (to my surprise I found the only network in the US, when I was made in England!) Again my reaction and to to my surprise, they were almost the same, out of pure terror and fear, and my heart never beat so much. In my opinion, the movie "THE BEST" ever made, Hollywood movies seem to be tame compared to Pony and Trap (shit), sorry for the pun. However, the power of this film and the union while watching it with about twenty of my colleagues is amazing. I've never heard so many screams, boys! Even the sight of this movie evokes in me the fear of this particular scene and leaves me feeling that I will never go alone in the dark !!!
