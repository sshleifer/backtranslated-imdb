I never bothered to watch this movie in cinemas, but I remember that I still heard that name. In the end, I watched him this week and what a joy. For some reason I was expecting him not to be too good, so I was completely surprised when I sat down and got stuck with him, and then I found myself totally involved. I read many other comments from users and it impressed me how many people talk about her fight in the ring, but what was great in Diana is the fact that he is a real warrior in life. All he needs to do is find a place where he is who he is and the ring helps her get there. A very smart story and I'm amazed that Michelle Rodriguez did it for the first time in her life. Adrian and her coach were also quite good. <br /> <br /> This film is a bit rough on the edges, but it does not matter in the slightest. The story, testament and performances completely outweigh any disadvantages (which usually appear in the production of indie films). An attractive portrait of a girl who finds herself triumphing over her situation and K.O. for Michelle Rodriguez!
