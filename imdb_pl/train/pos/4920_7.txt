No, not really, but it's a really good movie and unfortunately it's a forgotten gem. Black and white fits the film. <br /> <br /> A simple formula, the guy had a plague, and the authorities have to track down everyone he had contact before they die. <br /> <br /> Very well-focused, and acting is great. Richard Widmark as a leading man is good, but he is completely obscured in the acting rates by Paul Douglas as the police captain and Jack Palance (never better than that) and Zero Mostel as bad. Unfortunately, Palance played similar characters in some really gangster or war movies.
