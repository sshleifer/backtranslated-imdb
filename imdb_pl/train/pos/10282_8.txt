If your idea for a thriller is car chases, explosions and dozens of people mowed by fire, then "House of Games" is certainly not a movie for you. If you like and appreciate psychological drama and tension, see it all. <br /> <br /> "House of Games" tells the story of a renowned psychologist and writer, Dr. Margaret Ford (Lindsay Crouse), who tries to help the patient and engages in the dark world of cheats led by the charismatic Mike (Joe Mantegna). Saying something more about the conspiracy would ruin the tension. Honestly, I find it hard to believe anyone who says he saw the upcoming twists and turns. Like a clever artist, this movie draws you into a network and puts you to sleep. <br /> <br /> The story is tense and well crafted, intelligent and laconic dialogue, working uniformly well (Mantegna is brilliantly charismatic). Some complained that Dr. Ford was not a very nice hero and wondered why Mamet would make Lindsay Crouse look so unattractive. But Dr. Ford is to be cold and restrained; What's more, her home atmosphere is in a sense crucial for the plot (at one point I think that the damage to her sexual self-esteem is a key part of her motivation ... I will not say more). <br /> <br /> "House of Games" is a dark look at the bottom of human nature, which ends with a hint of uncomfortable ambiguity. You will be attentive every second you watch, and you will stay with you for a long time.
