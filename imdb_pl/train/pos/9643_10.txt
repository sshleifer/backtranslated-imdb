This movie has everything. Emotions, power, affection, charming nude dance on the beach of Stephane Rideau ... It exposes the need for true inner communion and external communication in every relationship. Just because Cedric and Mathieu are gay couples does not mean that nobody is useful. I would probably classify it as a gay movie, but one that can be appreciated and loved by heterosexual people, as well as homosexual and bisexual people. Mathieu's inability to cope with his emotions reveals the way our society does not encourage us to act in a different way, and that creates discord between him and Cedric. This is definitely a must see !!!!
