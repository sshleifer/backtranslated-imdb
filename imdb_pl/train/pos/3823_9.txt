I saw this movie in the worst possible circumstances. I have already missed 15 minutes when I woke up on an international flight between Sydney and Seoul. I did not know what I was watching, I thought maybe it was the movie of the week, but I was quickly caught by the performance of the main actress who played the young woman who had been kidnapped. The message began to change and I did not see the coming ones, and thanks to the final subtitles I was looking through the guide to find out what I was watching. It turns out that I discovered with a delay Do-yeon Jeon, who won the prize for the best actress in Cannes. I do not know if Secret Sunshine is typical of Korean cinema, but I go to the DVD store to learn more.
