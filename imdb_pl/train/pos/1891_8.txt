When you see this movie, you'll start to realize how drastically untapped the estate is, which was Dudley Moore. In our archive there should be several such films. <br /> <br /> He was already at the highest level before he went to Hollywood, both as a comedian and musician. But above all, he is remembered for his connection with Peter Cook, on television and one or two indifferent British films. Perhaps the best of them was "Bedazzled". <br /> <br /> He always had a tendency to be dimmed by Cook, who jealousy and malice raised their partnership and enabled Moore to realize his true potential in America. The result is "Arthur". <br /> <br /> This is a really great movie. Moore's clownish comedy as a drunkard is undeniable. The script fits perfectly with his style with many funny, almost surreal digressions. There is something so British about him that I am surprised that he found such an appeal to American flavors. Tommy Cooper, an anarchist comedian, drew blanks in the same way. It is Moore's almost childlike sensitivity, which is so endearing. <br /> <br /> Liza Minelli and John Guilgud have a tendency to play simple roles against him, but they still have great one-liners. In particular, John Guilgud provides him with a sarcastic and severe authority that is a treasure to watch. He always steals every scene he's in and deserves an Oscar. Correct me if I'm wrong, but never played any other comic role. <br /> <br /> There is a continuation movie "Arthur 2 - On The Rocks". He never achieves the same sublime levels of fun as he achieves, but he is still quite good. Guilgud appears only on the first episode and as a ghost. It's darker. And there is a bit of an interesting search for the soul. It will disappoint if you first look at Arthur. <br /> <br /> Hollywood seemed to be losing interest in Dudley's hug after these two shows. Eventually he returned to Britain, depressed and apparently dying. <br /> <br /> But "Artur" is a sample of what could have been. We can only imagine other great films that should have been made. <br /> <br /> Yours is unfortunately missing, Dudley.
