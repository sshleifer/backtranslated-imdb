Reviewed at the world premiere show on September 9, 2006 at the Isabel Bader Theater at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF). <br /> <br /> It was an interesting assumption, but it seemed that it took too long with too many stacks of eWaste (recycled computers, keyboards, cables etc. sent to China by a ton, then sorted and processed for new products for sale) and other havoc. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers tried to get more people interviewed to strengthen the human element, but they were often prevented because of Chinese censorship. However, what was there was interesting. Particularly striking was the pieces of a Shanghai real estate agent who showed his luxurious residences and gardens, intertwining with the scenes of others living in medieval conditions. The view of the track's opening in the factory of 480 m was also quite good. Scenes from the activities of the Three Gorges Dam project were also complementary to Jia Khang-je's films on TIFF (the plot Still Life / Sanxia Haoren and documentary Dong), which were also built around this theme. <br /> <br /> Director Jennifer Baichwal, producer Nick de Pencier, operator Peter Mettler and theme Edward Burtynsky were on stage during the Q & A after the world premiere. Producer Noah Weinzweig was presented to the public and thanked him for the most-important person who helped in accessing land in China.
