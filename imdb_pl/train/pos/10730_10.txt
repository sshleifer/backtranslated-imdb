Unfortunately SpaceCamp appeared more or less at the same time as Challenger Explosion. Which really put an emphasis on when to extract them, and even if they should, bring it out. I'm glad they did it. For the first time I watched SpaceCamp on the drive-in movie. What really improved the viewing significantly. <br /> <br /> When I heard about Lea Thompson and Tom Skerritt. In the movie, I've never heard of others. It is a great shock for me that I found all these young actors and acting really well! Of course, Kate Capshaw was perfect too. <br /> <br /> I especially liked the scenes where the children were shown how to act as a band. Scenes of children preparing for the trip, which they could only count on. The actual launch of a spacecraft is of course old news. However, this one was different. <br /> <br /> In total, this is one of my most valuable films. Maybe escapist, but for a cosmic nut like me, it was fantastic. After probably renting it for 30 - 40 times. In the end, I found him in a store and bought it. Now, if it appears only on DVD. I will probably have it forever. This movie gets 9 out of 10 from me.
