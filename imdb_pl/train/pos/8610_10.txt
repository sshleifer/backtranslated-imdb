Diane Keaton gave an excellent performance in this rather sad but fun story that involved many young people and their dark secrets. Diane Keaton, (Natalie), "The Family Stone," 05, who had the only daughter and loved her beyond words, can describe it. She always called her and said, "Surrender to Dorothy," which was the expression used in "The Sorcerer of Oz," 1939. An emergency car accident occurs and Natalie becomes deeply involved with her daughter's friends and lovers. As Natalie examines, the more truths she learns about herself and her true relationship with her daughter. A great movie to watch and enjoy, especially all the good acting of all supporting actors.
