It was the best movie I've ever seen about Bulimia. It got exactly what Bulimia really is and how it is not always about being lean and slimming. He showed how people with Bulimia tend to think about things like their look at life, friends and themselves. The best line and part that really shows what the Bulimia problem is is when Beth says, "It's not about you!" This line showed a lot about characters and others with the same problem. This showed that people with Bulimia do not have this problem because of anything that has anything to do with anyone else. It has to do with them and only with them. It shows that the time has come to talk about a problem person instead of paying attention to yourself. It showed that at that moment Beth had to look for attention, and she needed her mother's attention the most.
