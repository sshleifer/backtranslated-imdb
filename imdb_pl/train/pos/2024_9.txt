I loved this mini series. Tara Fitzgerald did an amazing job, presenting Helen Graham, a beautiful young woman hiding with her young son in a mysterious past. As an anglophile who loves romances ... this film was just my cup of tea and I recommend it to anyone who wants to escape to England in the nineteenth century for a few hours. I must also mention that Toby Stephens, who plays very magnetic Gilbert Markham, is enough to see this great production.
