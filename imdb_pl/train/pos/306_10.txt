Well, I saw "They all laughed" when it came out in <br /> <br /> Europe around 1982 and they kept unclear but expensive souvenirs. I just saw it again on tape, almost twenty years later ... Bogdanovich has a real affection for heroes and kind sympathy, which is also difficult to feel. Perfect comedians and actors, good lines for everyone and for pretty good editions. I was laughing and I was smiling all the time. Like all of us, sometimes. Go take it.
