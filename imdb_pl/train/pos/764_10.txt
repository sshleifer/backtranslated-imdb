No doubt, Beat Street is the best film about the breakin scene. Everything is in place, clothes (puma), music and most importantly dance! The plot is basic, but hey, what's the story to tell there? The main purpose of the film is to show what children from that moment do, which was important for them. It shows that generally teenagers are good, everything that was important for these everyday children is music, dance and friendship. Recently watching the DVD, I was very surprised how well it stood the test of time! The clothes did not look outdated (perhaps because Puma now has a huge return), the music still sounds fresh and the dance still attracts attention. A film that every 10-25 years old should see as part of their youth culture.
