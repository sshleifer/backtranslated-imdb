It's the perfect day for swimming. A normal family wants to use it and go to the beach. Unfortunately, it happens that the father is imprisoned under the jetty and neither his wife nor his little son can help him - while the wave increases. The woman (Barbara Stanwyck) takes the car and looks for help. <br /> <br /> A short film by John Sturges (69 minutes) is powerful because of unanswered questions. Stanwyck finds a guy who could help, but he has to pay for it. The film poses a double question. How far would you go to help the man you love, and on the other hand - watching Stanwyck's behavior towards a stranger - does he really love his husband? Like a good story, this film leaves the viewer the questions himself that only he can answer.
