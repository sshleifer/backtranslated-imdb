This movie is there with the classics of all time. Music, camera shots and acting are excellent. Showing the film in black and white gave it a much better look and perfectly complemented the music, like Psycho. It is surprising how few people commented on this film. I guess it's a difficult movie to find. I gave the movie 9. See the movie and you'll know what I'm talking about.
