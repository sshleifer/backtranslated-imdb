For a long time I have been enjoying the series of Prohibited Rights and the Order. Kathryn Erbe, Det. Alexandra Eames, the female detective is rather tough and seems a bit bitter in the Criminal Intent series. See her other side in this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie shows the wonderful soft side of these talented actresses, and if you're a fan of Criminal Intent, this movie is fun in her acting and you get quite a good yarn of family difficulties in the South. <br /> <br /> I did not like the role of Albert Finneys in this film because he did such a convincing acting work of an older southern guy that he is hard and intolerant and does not accept changes. It reminds me of so many men from my youth, and the portrait is divine, but it's probably hard to like him in this movie. <br /> <br /> Katryn Erbe is easy in this film and that's why I recommend it as a 10-star star of criminal intentions, law and order fans.
