This film is visually stunning. Who cares whether it can work or not. Each scene is a work of art composed and captured by John Derek. Locations, scenography and costumes perfectly match the history of love, beauty and wealth. In a sense, I would like to see this film as a tribute to the story of John and Bo Derek. And ... this comment would not be complete without mentioning the role of Anthony Quinn as a father, mentor, lover and his image of a man who was lost in a bygone era when men were men. There are some of us who value strength and direction in trust that contributes to a sense of self-confidence, restraint and security. Yes, they do not do such people anymore! But how often do you meet women who are created like Bo Derek.
