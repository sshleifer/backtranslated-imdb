Other reviewers seem to think that this is a terrible movie. It just is not real and a bit unfair. <br /> <br /> Acting is of good quality and the direction goes with decent fluency. I do not think there is anything wrong with the way to combine the stories with Tarantino-esquire. Perhaps this is just a new tool for the directors to try. I thought it made the movie more interesting. Perhaps a few elements of the script need to be tightened, but this is the only fault I can find. Nestor Cantillana gives great results as Sylvio, also Antonella Rios is stunning and worth the admission price.
