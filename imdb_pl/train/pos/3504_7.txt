This movie is like a movie project. As if the filmmakers chose a cross-section of society without experience and work. Characters, however, are a bit uninvolved and naive. Despite this amateur atmosphere, the film is effective. It's like a cross-section of life with children in the neighborhood who are trying to realize or cherish their honest sexual feelings. Being brought up by my grandfather, of course, this generation is a shame about sexuality. This ensures a predictable but well-made conflict. Probably the most enjoyable was the way the main character developed a little in his romantic relationship, pursuing deeper sexual feelings. A good watch, but nothing moves ....
