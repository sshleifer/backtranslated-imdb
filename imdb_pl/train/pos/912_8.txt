This film evokes many memories of the old classical cinema, in which the actors did not have to take off their clothes so that viewers could watch their movie. <br /> <br /> First of all, I think that the main advantage of this film is the incredible chemistry between Shahid and Amrita, it's definitely creating a movie. <br /> <br /> I have seen many comments about the fact that the film is sick and sweet. In response to this, I think that this is a correct analysis to some extent, but given that it is Barjatya's film, I think that compared to MPK, HAHK, HSSH and MPKDH, it has been significantly tuned. Watching HSSH was almost unbearable in some places. <br /> <br /> In this film, however, when sentimental moments come, you smile, wishing the budding couple all the best and hoping that nothing bad will happen to them. <br /> <br /> Another advantage is the performance of Shahid and Amrita. They both acted very well, especially Shahid, who looks great in the movie. Amrita simply looks stunning and should be taken seriously as the future main star. <br /> <br /> Although I really liked the film as a whole, I feel it was too long. The middle part could have been cut off, which could hit even more. I also think about music, although it suits the movie, when you see that the situations are a bit old-fashioned, and the film could benefit if a more current soundtrack was available. Although the pictures of Mujhe Haq Hain and Hamari Shaadi Mein songs are wonderful. <br /> <br /> In total I definitely recommend this movie, its romantic, it looks stunning and has a dramatic climax (I will not go into details in case you do not see it. <br /> <br /> PS If you are willing to cry, take a handkerchief (I needed a few)
