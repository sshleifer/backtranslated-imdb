Sports films have never been my thing, but a small handful of them work for me. The best are those that focus less on sport and more on characters such as Raging Bull, Wrestler and Girlfight. This is a great directorial debut for Karyn Kusama and a great first performance for Michelle Rodriguez. Girlfight feels both realistic and engaging, which is enough to make him an unforgettable movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite simple. Diana Guzman is in the fourth year of high school, but due to the selection of fights in the corridor is close to expulsion. As a possible way to release her anger, she signs up for boxing lessons in the club where her brother trains (at the father's request). <br /> <br /> In ninety minutes we, viewers see something unusual. Diana almost literally changes from girl to woman. We see it in her body as well as in her behavior, especially when one of the boys in the club is attracted to her and she goes into it. In the film there is no bad scene or lame / invented moment. The only mistake I would say that you can fix is ​​that one of the ending threads ends with what appears to be an unfinished note. In addition, Girlfight is a great movie.
