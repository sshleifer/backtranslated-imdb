Another exquisite taste of the superhero movie after Batman: Dead End, which only stimulates our taste buds and makes us want more! That's how a real superhero movie should look like and feel like it! Even the difficult kind of fanfilm. Attention to detail, character and operation is undeniably real. Although it is a production with limited resources, it shames big, budgeted, starred productions of "other" movies associated with the superhero. Here the main and supporting characters act and look as if they were real people. Finally, Superman, who looks "great" and looks real! Batman in the way it should be, without a flashy rubber, bulletproof vest that would hide skinny bodies for overpaid actors who do not deliver. I just want some reasonable Warner Bros. Exec gave OK to create the full length of the adaptation of this gem. I do not care if it's about theaters or straight on DVD, I would never get tired of watching. The plot itself is worth my hard-earned dough for it. I hope that "bigwigi" in Marvel's and DC's productions will look and see what a really well-made movie about superheroes should look like. The end of the "Batman and Robin" fiasco, Hulk, Daredevil, etc. Learn from these little directors and find out that there should be no reason to "invent" the hero for the movie, just to "bomb" theaters. Mr. Collor ... We need more directors like you !!
