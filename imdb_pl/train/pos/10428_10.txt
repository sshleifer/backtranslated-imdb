An amazing film, which in theory should be boring, but delivered with subtlety and an amazing acting game, which I have not wanted to find for a long time. Instead of relying on stereotypes and too dramatic moments, the plot takes place in a series of incredibly realistic moments. Leading heroes are not perfect, so it's easy to refer to them as people you know. The film does not try to attract laughter, does not push the ideal into the audience, but it shows us the possibility of true love in all circumstances. <br /> <br /> I am now restless waiting for the weekend, so I can see the continuation. Moving, provocative, funny look of love, which in my opinion should be absolutely romantic classic with Casablanca and breakfast at Tiffany's. It will soften even the hardest heart.
