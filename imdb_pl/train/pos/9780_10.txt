I saw this movie at the BIFFF festival in Brussels, spring 2004. What a surprise! This German production, stylish and ingenious shock, is one of the most terrible flicks I've seen. I warn you: this is not a joke! This terrorist has a large cast of good actors (for example: Peter Martell as a European guru has a strong presence), excellent direction, nice production project, very good soundtrack and many heavy sfx like Italian horrors of the eighties. Body torn to the bones ... and blood is spilling ... this wild Stopper will catch you ... and give you dark dreams ... You have to see it !!
