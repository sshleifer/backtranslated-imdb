Has anyone been able to buy this movie? My uncle "Hutch" was a real pilot (not Reel) who saw him throw wings in the air and then grabs them with his fist when he was rewarded with the pilot's wings. <br /> <br /> It's only on the screen for a few seconds, but my family would like to have a movie. He was killed in battles over Italy, he was only 24 years old. Do we know the movie studio that did it? <br /> <br /> Has anyone seen this in a video store like Blockbuster? I would like them to share entire catalogs of these old films, because it is so cheap to make a DVD nowadays. <br /> <br /> Write to me at nfny40@yahoo.com if you know where I can buy a copy. Thank you.
