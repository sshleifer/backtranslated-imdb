In my opinion, A GUY THING is a funny, witty, sexy, romantic and completely beautiful chick, which guys will also like. I thought Jason Lee and Julia Stiles were stunned by the dazed future groom and his future sexy cousin. If you ask me, they light up the screen like magic. You can also feel their chemistry between them. Before I discuss this, I would like to say that the performances were of the highest class, the direction was impeccable, the production project was nice, the casting was perfect, and the costumes were perfectly designed. To sum up, I recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of Jason Lee or Julia Stiles. You have lots of laughter and emotions, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick it with a friend and watch.
