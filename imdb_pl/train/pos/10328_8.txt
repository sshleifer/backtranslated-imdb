The creators chose the best people to work and set the stage wonderfully. Each interior is full of details that tells people who live in it. Regardless of whether it is the twenties (first story), the present (ie 1950) for the middle story, or 1910 (last), costumes and settings are carefully observed and created. I love the picky costumes of two old ladies in the sanatorium - an exquisite lace put on by the best Shetland scarves. Roland Culver as Ashenden is very attractive, but do not worry about young lovers, Raymond Huntley is a man who hates the health and independence of his wife who afflicts our emotions. Usually he played comical, pompous types, but here he is subtle and convincing and very impressive. The China Seas (a great movie from the 1930s with the participation of Gable and Harlow) stole the plot from the episode of Mr Know All (and also told the story of Kipling). I would like us to see more of Naunton Wayne as a jealous husband - though she has a good moment looking melancholically in a Mexican hat. I love this stylish bird who also plays his wife.
