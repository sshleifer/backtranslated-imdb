You must see it to believe it! Directors Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield have done something really great, it is 10 out of 10, so I can not believe that another user of this network rated him so poorly unless he expected to see an ordinary movie with people, love scenes and so on. I am also convinced that these kinds of documentaries are a great way to wake us up to save our beautiful planet. Finally, it has nothing to do with Al Gore's documentary "An Inconvenient Truth", consisting mainly of long monologues, painfully and "truths" not always accurate, as many scientists have already pointed out. <br /> <br /> The best thing you can do on earth is not to miss Earth.
