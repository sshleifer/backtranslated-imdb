OK, this is not a perfect movie in any way, but I do not agree with IMDb's general opinion that it is really bad. I watched many flixes from Hong Kong in the 90s and I loved this era very much. At that time, I never saw the Black Mask and only saw it last week for the first time. In addition to the embarrassingly low dubbing, which my copy on DVD did not give me the power to turn off, the film contains raw energy and bravado that penetrated the films of Hong Kong at that time. I still stick to my views that when it comes to the action, these guys, regardless of their budget, add an element of magic to the screen without Bourne Supremacy, Casino Royale or Mission Impossible movies - I just think they lack spontaneity and feel too regulated) will ever reach. What is this? It's a feeling that filmmakers experimented when they were filming and editing, not afraid to leave in some blemishes to learn lessons for the next time. For me, it makes watching movies all the more fun and dangerous.
