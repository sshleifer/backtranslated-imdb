I really liked this movie. I was fifteen when this movie came out and I could relate. It will be a movie that I would show my children to inform them that the feelings they have are normal. It's funny to see how we could be so degenerated by things at such a young age ... who knew we would be bouncing ... time after time ... again ... Great movie !!!!
