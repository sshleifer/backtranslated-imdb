This is one of my favorite family movies. I loved it when I was little and it still keeps me when I'm older. I still laugh at the same old jokes and I can even shed a tear at times. I have never cared about animals that speak, or at least about animals animated by the United Nations, but the one I advocate for. It's quite an old movie, but it will always be a place in my heart. <br /> <br /> There are no other movies about live animals that I could think of at the time when I could even compare like that. I can praise the film too much, but I do not think it will show up. I really have great news that "the house is where the heart is." At least that's my message. I definitely recommend it for a good family movie night.
