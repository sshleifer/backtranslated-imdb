I do not know why people always want a deeper meaning in films or whether they consider them worthless. <br /> <br /> And what about entertainment? Something that distinguishes Morgan Freeman. He has a chance to show off a bit. Paz Vega, his friend, has a career opportunity, and Brad Silberling gets a name that attracts people to watch his movie. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a good movie. A bit of humor, a bit of pathos, a bit bittersweet, but nothing more. I got a special kick from Jim Parsons as a receptionist in a construction company. When he looks at Freeman with adoration and says, "You make me want to be a woman." It's just fun. The scene of the fight between Mrs. Vega, her ex-husband and his girlfriend, is also great. <br /> <br /> In short, it's a charming, charming movie that will make you smile. You could do a lot, much worse.
