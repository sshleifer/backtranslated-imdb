For those who commented on The Patriot as accurate (which essentially satisfied the English), it was interesting to watch this movie. In all respects it was the bloodiest war in which Americans were involved and they were the only present nationality. So it was very refreshing to see something resembling the historical accuracy of the Atlantic coming from this side, which did not paint America as martyrs or saviors. All in all, what brought the film home was a real horror of every conflict and how the deeds committed in the war only bring worse deeds, often ending innocent suffering. It was not a movie where you cheered on someone, but they both regretted and hated everyone.
