I saw this movie yesterday for the first time and I loved it. I am a student writing on screen and I loved the way in which smaller characters intervened when something significant / climatic happened on the stage. <br /> <br /> I thought that the dialogue is very sharp and the assumption of history is rather shocking - at a certain moment Barbara Stanwyck openly flirts with her daughter's boyfriend; And giving life to her husband, whom she had not seen in ten years; And at the firing signal "two shots, then one" connects with his old shaggy colleague Dutchman (the reason why she left the city in the first place!) EVERYTHING AT THE SAME TIME! Moral majority had to be completely upset when they saw this movement in the 50s. <br /> <br /> I love costumes and photos and dialogue straight from the hip - just to see Barbara Stanwyck and What's doing "Bunny" Hug is reason enough to rent this movie to DVD. <br /> <br /> One of the best films from this period I've seen for a long time.
