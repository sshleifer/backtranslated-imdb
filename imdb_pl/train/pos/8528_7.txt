Most of the time I like Peter Sellers. I've never seen him portray a Briton from a higher class before. It's pretty good, though you see the Clouseau Inspector's pieces in the mix. It does not get interesting until Goldie Hawn arrives. <br /> <br /> I never expected that youthful Hawn would provide such a solid performance. Her timing was great, and her expression was priceless. The way he alternately shoots sellers of lecherous characters and seduces him is beautiful to watch. Word sparing, as I rarely see in a film from that era. <br /> <br /> The last thirty minutes of the movie DOES NOT FLIGHT. It is worth failing to see the first sixty. Hawn is naked for a few great seconds. Be happy ...
