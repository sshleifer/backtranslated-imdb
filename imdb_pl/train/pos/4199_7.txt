The only thing about this movie that scares me is that the DVD is so expensive. At the moment, it's too much for my budget, or I would buy it because the movie is a good example of the film noir ... and I like watching Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and Thelma Ritter. <br /> <br /> Criterion creates a great DVD, but sometimes the starting price is a bit too big. This is the case with an 80-minute black and white, mono sound film that is good, but nothing extraordinary, cinematographic. <br /> <br /> The story is a story here (as opposed to visuals, actors, sound, sets, etc.) as a pickpocket (Widmark) accidentally ends with a spy microfilm in its possession after counterfeiting Peters' portfolio. (say it three times!). Everyone except Peters is the credible hero of the movie: Widmark, cops, American agents and communists, especially Ritter as "Moe", informer. She and Widmark are the stars of this film. <br /> <br /> Peters does a decent job by playing on a cheap fleet, but loses credibility in the beginning, "falling in love" at Widmark at the first meeting, although it is nasty to her. Only in the world of the movie !! It is a pity, because this absurd part of history breaks away from her. <br /> <br /> This is an average movie noir, which means good, but not great and certainly not worth having at a price of 25-35 USD. For this price you can do a lot better on the film noir market.
