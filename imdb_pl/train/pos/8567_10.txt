I liked the movie and would suggest to anyone who would like to have fun. Do not take the film too seriously, because remember that it is Disney, and its rating was rated G. It's a good pure fun, although some parts can be recognized by adults, but children would never notice it, especially the "triangle" between Cruella , Le Pelt and Alonso, a loyal Cruella. Glenn Close is fantastic and really made Cruella her own and she is extremely frightening, even when she is "cured" of her loving fur ways, she can arouse fear among the audience with their shakes that literally shake the theater. (I even discovered that I'm jumping in my place when she surprises you with her "bipolarness" like a dog loving Ella.) All in all I will go and see it again in cinemas, I liked it so much.
