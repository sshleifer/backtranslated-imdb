Yes, I remember this one! Many years since I watched him. The story was completely surreal, but still great! Everyone who evaluates and evaluates films should have in mind what the right movie is heading for. Similarly with "First Kid", which has a similar pattern. Some movies - like this one here - are aimed at ordinary and comic nonsense. Such films can not be judged from the point of view of a hypercritical reviewer. Of course, there is a lack of quality in these films, there is a lack of a sophisticated story, very often the first-class actors are missing, but if they meet their basic assumptions - that's good. I do not have this movie here on my favorite times list, but I still thought it was funny, it had some very nice sequences and it made a good story. Brian Bonsall is an intelligent actor anyway.
