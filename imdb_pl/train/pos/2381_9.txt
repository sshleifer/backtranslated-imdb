Timothy Hines' "Classical War of the Worlds" is a very funny movie that, of course, goes to great length to faithfully reproduce the classic book by H. G. Wells. Mr. Hines does it. Me and those who watched his film with me appreciated the fact that it was not a standard, predictable Hollywood movie that appears every year, such as the version of Spielberg with Tom Cruise, which had only the slightest resemblance to the book. Of course, everyone is looking for different things in the film. Those who imagine themselves as amateurs of "critics" only criticize everything they can. Others judge the film on more important grounds, for example, playing, that's why most people never agree with "critics." We were pleased with the effort that Mr. Hines put in the fidelity of the classic novel H.G. Wells, and it turned out to be very funny. This has made it easier to overlook what "critics" perceive as their faults.
