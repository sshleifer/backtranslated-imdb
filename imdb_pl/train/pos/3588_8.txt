When I saw this movie, I was amazed that it was just a TV movie. I think that this movie should be in cinemas. I've seen a lot of rape movies, but this one stands out. This film has a certain realism, which is very rare in today's films, let alone television movies. He tells the story that I am sure that he is very realistic for many rape victims in small towns today and considered it very reliable (which is difficult to find in other films focused on rape). I also thought that Tiffani Theissen and Brian Austin Green were amazing in the parts they played. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who likes movies that have some harsh reality in them. I liked it very much.
