What was the network, the diagnosis of murder? I thought it was CBS. Am I right, are you? Also in those days, the actual production of H.Q. it was close to Van Nuys airport. I certainly remember, because I practically made almost two episodes in these daze. More. I remember the first days. I found an article in Reader's Digest that gave this actor / writer a hint for a great episode. So I was rewarded for suggesting this. Rewarded or not, unfortunately I did not develop it and I was cut out of it all because of poor advertising. So I just learned to justify it as it always is, hard ... Throw the dice ... Caps !!! Simply Mr. Van Dyke's side strap. He had a house in the Brentwood district on Chalon Road and it was an amazing party house. Dick had a great sense of modernism when he built this house.
