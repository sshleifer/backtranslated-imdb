"The Lady from Shanghai" is known as one of the most troubled productions in Hollywood. The original Welles's cut was picked up by the producers and cut into ribbons. This made the obscure history of mystery even more difficult to track. The posts have dubbed a lot of their dialogue because of the density of the Irish accent, and the dubbing is too obvious and badly done. The most disastrous of all, Welles and his screen, and the real life lady Rita Hayworth were falling apart in a relationship, and their turbulent chemistry appears on the screen. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, all this is overcome by the fantastic direction of Orson Welles. It makes the film extremely stylish and moody - every scene seems to breathe at the back of the screen. In addition, the characters and scenes are so bizarre that they border with the dream and the surrealist. This feeling of eccentricity raises the scenes often found in these films, such as the sequences of the courtroom inside. Usually, court dramas are boring, but Welles's direction and bizarre accents make them as fascinating as anything else. The ending at the carnival is almost like David Lynch. <br /> <br /> Acting here is also very good. Despite their failed relationship, Welles and Hayworth both give decent performances - but their interactions are only a little lacking. Everyone else is great and delightful, especially Everett Sloane and Glenn Anders. "The Shanghai lady" has its problems, of course, but it's worth seeing to see one of the masters of cinema at its best. (8.10)
