I really liked this one and even though the ending made me angry, he still gives me 10 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Four college girls (Baltron, Kelly, Stahl and Cadby) are going to Florida the way they meet Two guys (Turner, Davis) really do not contribute anything to the story, but they are at least somewhat nice. Girls agree to meet Florida boys to have fun, but they have problems with the car and they never do. One of the girls decides to go to a nearby gas station for help, and the other three stay at the car. <br /> <br /> Soon one of the girls must use the bathroom, being in the middle of nowhere. there is no choice but to go into the bushes. Soon, she becomes a witness when a man (March) suffocates a woman, in horror the girl escapes from the area, she has not gone far, but manages to get lost. <br /> <br /> Her friends at the car are looking for her, they are also going to the forest and they are falling into the same man, one of them sees a dead woman, the man responds, shooting girls on the head, the other girl runs away, manages to return to car, where she is also killed. <br /> <br /> After all, the other two girls find each other and because they break into the gas station, they are arrested. That's when I started to get mad, these poor girls are scared for their lives, and the redneck cops do not believe them. <br /> <br /> They are ill-treated, and one of them remains alone to let the madman kill her in the cell, the other friend manages to escape, but not without a dangerous situation. <br /> <br /> This film has nudity, good actresses, a psycho imitating shower scene, graphic violence against women, and a solid story. Some women will probably find this offensive, and sensitive people will NOT like the ending, but most of all it is a very unknown film.
