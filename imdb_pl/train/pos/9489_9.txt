I am not tired of saying that this is one of the best political thrillers in history. The story takes place in a fictional state, but of course, it's about Kennedy's murder. The truthful and honest district attorney (in the role of Yves Montand) does not believe that the murder was planned and executed by a single Daslov (= Oswald), and although all other officials want to close the case, which he constantly investigates with his team. br /> <br /> The scenario is written tight and fast and maintains the voltage to the end. The part about the Milgram experiment on the authorities is (though not interesting) somewhat out of place. The final sequence - explaining who Ikar really is - partly shot in slow motion and amplified with the soundtrack Morricone is the most powerful sequence I've ever seen in a movie.
