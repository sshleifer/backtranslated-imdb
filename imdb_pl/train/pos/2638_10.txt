One of the best movies for all ages. You'll never be able to look at LION KING again without thinking about the extra story that this movie adds. Almost 40 years, I watched it with my wife and two sons after work tonight and for so long I did not laugh and did not enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> Take some time and watch it with your children. It reminds you of how Disney used to be when you were young.
