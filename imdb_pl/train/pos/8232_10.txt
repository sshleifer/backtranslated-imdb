One day he meets Flora, his old date, who is now the wife of Achilleas, and lives with his father-in-law and his guardian, Machim. he also has a son named Johnny, who appears at the end of the first period and the whole second, the rest of the main characters are Michalis, Alekos' assistant at the butcher and bi-sexual, and Corrin, the lost sister Achilleas, who turned out to be the best prostitute in all of Athens the series are Soso's attempts to kill Alekos, because he is cheating on her, but everything else that happens in him is of lesser importance, a brilliant script, an excellent plot, poisonous quotes, and in esome performances and great direction.
