I really liked this little movie. This is a moving film about struggle, sacrifice, and especially relationships of friendship between different nations (especially the child actor who plays Miki is especially good). Around World War II, there are so many impersonal films taking place that this convincingly told small story is a real break from the norm and original. I will also add that this movie is far from boredom, very far away !! Of course, the horses are great and the landscape is breathtaking. For anyone who really treats their animal as part of a family (I), this movie will be particularly rewarding. Recommended for movie fans who are looking for something different.
