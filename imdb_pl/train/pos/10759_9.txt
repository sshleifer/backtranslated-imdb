It is true that you always remember what you did when the catastrophe or tragedy struck. And nothing more than September 11, 2001, the date that changed the entire global landscape in the fight against terrorism. <br /> <br /> No, this document was not going to live in events leading up to 9/11. The film's creators, brothers Gédéon and Jules Naudet, decided to make a documentary about the trials and anguish of a New York firefighter from New York. They went to the academy and did some training, and chose their "probe" (firefighter) to join them in the New York fire station, in the house of Ladder 1 and Engine 7. But their production was to develop and contain the time, considered for the only shot of the first plane hitting the World Trace Center. <br /> <br /> I traveled with a friend on the train from the night of playing the LAN and I received a phone call around 850pm local time from my dad, who informed me about the above. A few minutes later he told me that he was different and that the WTC was attacked. By the time I got home, the upper floors of the twin towers were burning and burning, and they fell to my horror in an hour. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers had two cameras operating that day, one who followed the team during a routine call and who immediately went to the WTC after hearing and seeing that the plane hit him. We follow what is possible, the only filmed sequence of events in the WTC1 lobby, where the first rescuers, paramedics and police had to understand what had happened and quickly developed a plan of action. A second camera, held by a second brother, went to the WTC to look for siblings, and during the journey captured many words of New Yorkers, as well as a sense of chaos in the vicinity of Manhatten. > <br /> Documents include numerous interviews with men from Ladder 1 and Engine 7, which miraculously did not suffer any loss. But being the survivors also brought their own set of psychological turmoil, which struggle with reconciliation with the event. Thanks to the events that take place, we learn about strong comrades among those men who risk their lives and end up working each day to save their lives. <br /> <br /> We started with what the document was supposed to be, the events of that day were completely sharpened and became the subject of interest, up to the rescue phase, where hopes for finding survivors under the rubble were sustained by people who work all through 24 hours in the sense of collapsed steel structures. This is not a fabricated movie, and what you see here can not be reproduced in any other document (and the heavens, not the sound scenes for Hollywood blockbusters). It is as close as you can get to this day, being a witness to this event from near. <br /> <br /> DVD with code 1 has a separate additional hour of 4 interview sets with men from ladder 1 and engine 7.
