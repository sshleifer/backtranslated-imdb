They did it. And, boy, they did it fantastically or what! The BBC finally brought the Doctor back to our screens on Saturday evening, where he should be! And they did it with style! <br /> <br /> EPISODE ONE: "Rose" - One of the strengths of the new series is Russell T Davies as a writer and executive producer. He is a fan of the show and knows what other fans want, but he is also an experienced writer, so he knows what other people want. Another strength, perfectly shown here in this first episode, is Billie Piper and her character Rose Tyler. Finally, the Doctor's companion receives a credible story behind him and a strong character. It's nice to see the return of the Autons - a nice nod to the Classic Series. <br /> <br /> EPISOD TWO: "The End Of The World" - At the beginning of this double account we will show TARDIS "Strengths, we end in history, in which special effects are everything! They now have the technology to create real, reliable environments and monsters - no more rubber suits! Also tips at the end of this episode regarding the past of the new Doctor - very intriguing to kill all the Lords of Time and make him the only one. <br /> <br /> THIRD EPISODE: "The Unquiet Dead" - We "We had a future, let the past now. The first episode written by non-Davies is somewhat flat in some places, but it deserves Charles Dickens Simon Callow, and the sudden turn of the action, when the pathetic Gelf is revealed, is not after all so miserable ... br /> <br /> EPISOD FOUR: "Aliens Of London" - the consequences of the Doctor's actions are fully explored in this series, not only because of the repercussions of Rose running away from him. We also have our first cliff; though not the best. The Slitheen are an interesting dark character, though they may look too CGI for their own good. <br /> <br /> EPISOD FIVE: "World War Three" - The second part of this story about Slitheen mainly suffers from the same problems first. In addition, clips from the next episode, which will appear at the end of the current episode, are annoying and spoil it to people. <br /> <br /> EPISOD SIX: "Dalek" - Yes! We had the future, the past and the present (ish), but now we are reaching for good things - the return of the grandmaster of the Doctor. Here I think that we can complement Christopher Ecclestone - he was a genius as a Doctor and no more than in this episode, where we see the pain on his face when he mentions the Temporary War and the alien nature when he almost turns into Dalek himself. <br /> <br /> EPISOD SEVEN: "The Long Game" - really only a story that will be a prologue to the final of the series. Rescued by Simon Pegg as a fastidious editor and Tamsin Grieg in a funny episode. The media control us - we have never done this before, have ... <br /> <br /> EPISODE EIGHT: "Father's Day" - this is a great episode. Full of human emotions and heartache for Rose and the real consequences of what happens when you really ruin history. Full assessment of Billie Piper here. <br /> <br /> SECTION NINE: "Empty child" - I do not think this kid is very scary. IM sorry but I dont have. However, this is a good episode, but cliffhanger could still be better - these are the pieces of "Next time" that spoil them. John Barrowman is portrayed here as Captain Jack, a dizzying Conman - he's a good actor who has been around for some time, but only seemingly noticed now. <br /> <br /> EPISODE THIS: "The Doctor Dances" - part two of this story of World War II - very well made in the historical context. A nice, optimistic ending, though maybe a bit confusing for younger viewers, when "Mumia" reveals itself? <br /> <br /> EPISOD ELEVEN: "Boom Town" - probably the weakest in the series, but it does not mean that it is bad. Nice return to Slitheen, as well as an interesting study of the figure of Doctor and Rose. <br /> <br /> EPISODE TWELVE: "Bad Wolf" - it starts quite stupid, with a bit of good humor and brazen play on popular TV programs over her in Blighty. However, things quickly become deadly serious, and the revelation at the end is the best cliffhanger in the series! <br /> <br /> EPISOD THRITEEN: "Parting with the roads" - Goodbye Christopher Ecclestone. Fantastic Doctor in many ways, David Tennant must really work with socks to be as good as he is. The regeneration scene at the end is beautifully reproduced. Oh, and the Daleks are coming back - in the extreme! God bless CGI because they would never be able to do it normally! <br /> <br /> In general - brilliant! 9/10
