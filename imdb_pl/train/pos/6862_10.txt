When people ask me why I like movies so much, I usually say, "Have you seen the sequence of art galleries in" De Palma's Dressed to Kill "? This scene itself represents everything I want to see in the movie. If I was a movie director, it would be the kind of thing that I would like to do. "Pure cinema" is one of the ways to describe this sequence, and it's really amazing how the whole film of De Palma's director works with the same high artistic frequency of this scene. It's a dream-like movie, smart as hell, with more joy and intelligence than a dozen connected films. I think that the film raises an important point, which will always be the subject of heated discussions: can the film rely solely on technology and still be considered an artistic success? The film has no message to say, acting is great, but it is in the service of style, and the script is not logical. De Palma's film is a really good example of how a style, when properly supported, can support a full-length movie. Of course, Michael Caine, Angie Dickinson, Nancy Allen and Keith Gordon give great performances, but this is a director's film until it disappears. This is a sensational demonstration of the possibilities of a medium of film. I will not tell you how the Hitchcock film pays homage (I do not want to spoil any surprises), but I think that De Palma goes beyond the story and manages to create a movie that largely sums up his entire career. Not for a weak heart!
