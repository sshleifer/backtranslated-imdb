Diego Armando Maradona was sixteen in 1978, when Argentina won the World Cup at home. He was already the biggest star and the biggest player in the country obsessed with football. Everyone pleaded with Cesar Luis Menotti to play the boy's genius, but the manager thought he was not ready yet. <br /> <br /> History records that Argentina won the World Cup in 1978 quite convincingly - they did not need Maradona. The same was not true in 1982. Spain was a disaster catalog for Argentina. Menotti - still burning the chain - this time played Diego, but the opportunity was too great for such a temperamental boy. Maradona signed a contract with Barcelona on June 4, 1982 for about $ 7 million - nine days later he played his first match at Camp Nou, and Belgium beat Argentina one-zero. It was not a successful debut, and although he scored two goals against Hungary in the next game, Maradona will remember the World Cup as the place of his nadir - Brazil's primitive irritating foul Batista in the second round, which suddenly ended his tournament and Argentina rules as world champions. <br /> <br /> But now it was already behind him. Maradona waded through the crazy times in Barca and left in 1984 to join Naples. It was like he was finally home. Neapolitan tifosi did everything to lure Maradona to the poor, weaker Napoli. Gifts from old women and pocket money from young boys troubled by millions of Camorra as part of the transfer fee, and the city was determined to feel at home. So for the time being Maradona was El Rey - he brought his Argentinian side to Mexico as one of the favorites, and with the new manager - Carlos Bilardo replaced Menotti. <br /> <br /> Maradona is the hero of this story, a one-man machine winning the World Cup. In 1982, Hundreds of young men died in a senseless battle for the Falkland Islands; now the British press missed the rematch (with the same result) in Mexico City. Maradona was still regarded with distinction in England, more remembered for a great performance in Britain during the route in 1980 Than in Spain. But he was still Argie: an enemy. <br /> <br /> England started well and Lineker could score after just twelve minutes. The key event took place within 8 minutes. Fenwick, a large and limited English defender, was booked - now he was terrified of taking on any challenges around the penalty area. <br /> <br /> After the strained first 45 minutes the second half started with a bang. Maradona was dancing after 50 minutes, but he could not find a way out. Similarly, Valdano's attempt only hit white shirts. Then a moment of shame that serves as the epitaph of Diego. Hodge strangely plugged the ball back into his own penalty area, Shilton hurried to pick up the ball - but there was Maradona, who somehow hovered over the English goalkeeper to knock the ball into the net. How did he do it? Simple: handball. <br /> <br /> The most famous foul in the history of football has passed in slow motion. Each spectator waited for Mr. Al-Sharif from Syria who struck a blow for foul (he did not). Shilton looked and appealed to the line judges - he ran back to the central circle. Until he kills the Pope or becomes the first man to stand on Mars, when this great man dies, this moment will be shown first - a long, slow, slow movement, and then a look of joy on his face. The next picture will be his next gift for the world - the best goal of the World Cup. <br /> <br /> Burruchaga stroked the ball to Maradona who was circling the right side of her half. He turned and accelerated from Beardsley and Reid. It was real Diego - he bumped into Butcher and attacked Fenwick. Fenwick now had the opportunity to stop the attack. Normally, he would aim his boot somewhere near Maradona's thigh - he would surely pick up a red card, but who cares? Then Fenwick had a brain wave - he hesitated and decided to run to Maradona waving his hands - maybe he tried to push him away? Diego fired the box when Fenwick fell. The butcher ran next to a genius, as if offering him encouragement. Shilton panicked, and Maradona turned around and prepared to score. Now Butcher remembered his role and tried to maim the Argentinian - instead he gave an extra boost to the shot that hit the target. England was coming home. <br /> <br /> During this magical Mexican summer, the world has found the successor of Pele. In fact, the biggest player in history has been exceeded - Pele was great in 1958 and 1970, but he had great players around him. Maradona did not do it. 1986 was his World Cup.
