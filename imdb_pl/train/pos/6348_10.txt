Jim Carrey is good as usual, and although there are many "moments of Jim Carrey", it's definitely not a "Jim Carrey movie". <br /> <br /> It is mainly aimed at children and I was able to enjoy it as such a movie. He was promoted in Israel as another film by Jim Carrey, so those who expected a strange comedy were disappointed. <br /> <br /> The film has a nice time and works well as a movie for children. I can not say I LOVED the movie, but again I'm not his target group!
