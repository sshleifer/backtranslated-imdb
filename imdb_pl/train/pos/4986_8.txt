Lensman is a rather less-known Anime jewel from Toho and MK. It is loosely based on the novel, but reminds me more of the game "Metroid". <br /> <br /> If you want to see this, see in Japanese with subtitles or just in Japanese. The English version of the dubbed was almost trimmed and edited to death. <br /> <br /> There are not many new ones, even though it's the first animated function to combine CG graphics with hand-drawn animation, but it's nice to watch.
