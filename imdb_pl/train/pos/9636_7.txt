The lonely depressive French boy Mathieu (Jeremie Elkaim) on vacation in the summer, meets and falls in love with Cedric (wonderful Stephane Rideau). The quiet and slow movie is very frustrating. On the one hand, I was absorbed in him and I really felt for two boys. On the other hand, I was nervous - the movie is always flashing from past to present without rhyme or reason. It is very confusing and pointless. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS AROUND !!! <br /> <br /> There are also tons of holes - Mathieu at some point does something that ends him in the hospital. What is it - we have never been told! Then he breaks up with Cedric and tells everyone else that he lives with him. Why? We were not told. Then he inexplicably joins another guy at the end. Why? No explanation. Sure, Cedric loves Mathieu, and Mathieu lives in the same city, so ... But it's a tribute to the movie that you care about heroes so much. If only things were explained! <br /> <br /> Elkaim as Mathieu is not good. He is tall, handsome and has a nice body - but he can not act. His acting idea sits with a blank expression on his face - all the time. On the other hand, Rideau is great. He is VERY handsome, has a very nice body and is the hell of an actor. It also has incredible sexual magnetism. There is full frontal male nudity, lots of kisses and quite clear sex scene in the movie, which is great - most movies avoids showing male-male love scenes. This does not work and helps to see how the characters care for each other. <br /> <br /> So a frustrating movie, but it's worth seeing - especially in the case of nude Rideau scenes - that is, if you like handsome nude young men! <br /> <br />
