I rented it a few years ago, the video shop had only VHS then. Straight to video struck his steps (you know where the covers use the same font and color schemes for successful movies). I did not know what to expect except what was printed. The first thing I thought about watching was "what the hell is wrong with the sound?" - Of course, there was no dialogue dubbing. The words echoed, so I stopped munching anything I had to pay special attention to because there is no Shakespeare here! The story is quite simple, the boy meets a girl, etc. What struck me that it was fun and cordial, the people in the film did not look like caricatures inscribed in the story, but rather non-actors uprooted temporarily from real work in the set). All the time you start to feel what is the creator, and then you see that there are no trials of cheap humor (people hurt their privates, using profanity, it could not hurt marketing.) There was something honest about it, if they had a bigger budget, it would be better What I think is everyday, but they went ahead and did it, I felt that this is what the independent film production is about. Indy is thrown around as if it were a genre ... Ha! .. it's fun!
