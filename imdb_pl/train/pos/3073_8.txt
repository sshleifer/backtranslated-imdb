This is a movie that Hollywood needs to do more. No extravagant props, no car chases, no clever individual inserts. Only people dealing with being human. <br /> <br /> William Macy plays an unlikely murderer who works for his father, Donald Sutherland. Macy is a compulsory son, Sutherland is the dominant father. The son wants to leave the business, his father will not let him. Macy loves her son, beautifully played David Dorfman ("The Ring"). He also begins to fall in love with Neve Campbell, the girl he meets in the psychiatrist's waiting room. <br /> <br /> This is an interesting combination of characters, and the film follows a reluctant killer when he balances his own needs with his family. There are many moving scenes, especially between Macy and his little boy. And as one might expect from the film with William Macy, there is also a bit of humor. <br /> <br /> Excellent work around, actors and director. It's nice to know that they can still make a good movie in Hollywood with a small budget.
