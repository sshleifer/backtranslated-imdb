I watched as many TV series as I could watch on TV, but unfortunately I started work, which made me work in the evenings. At least I managed to catch his recordings ... and of course I bought a recently released DVD from the whole series. Watching the DVD, you can see that the animation at the beginning was a bit more primitive, but after the completion of the pilot eliminated a large number of disadvantages. The voices are well-matched to the characters, and the writing is excellent. Watching the animation returns to its roots by refreshing adult themes. The point is, with the way society has come in the last century, today's standards have to be a little more blatant to be considered an adult-oriented show. Characters have very realistic personalities and are placed in parallel situations to what we often encounter in real life. It's your typical sitcom in this respect, but humor is more like what you'd expect from late-night TV, like talk show or Saturday Night Live ... when SNL was really funny. Good job, Dreamworks. You may have to work with one of the more liberal networks to maintain this series ... and improve the marketing of goods for the series to help cover high costs. It is a challenge to do this for a cartoon with a mature nature. Hmm ...
