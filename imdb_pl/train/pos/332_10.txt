Although I have not seen this mini-series for more than twenty years, I still remember how to achieve a balance between character, story and story of wonderful adventures. The use of special effects has been restricted, creating a poetically more literal than literal story. The two versions that I saw were dubbed (English and French), but the actors seem to speak their own language not only in Italian, so there is a problem with synchronization. It does not spoil the story's story. Among the cast Irene Pappas as Penelope is the most recognizable among Americans from North America. Recommended to all who return to Odysseus.
