I really liked this movie when it was released, and I'm still doing it because the plot makes you feel hopeful about life in general and people too ... one of the things I like about Lawrence Kasdan's films . In addition to positive vibrations from the movie, there are other reasons to like Grand Canyon. First of all, he has an outstanding cast ... For example, Kevin Kline and Danny Glover. In my opinion, Crash, a highly rated film that won an Oscar for the best picture, was very similar to the movie. The difference is that the Grand Canyon makes you feel positive. Crash had the opposite effect with me; it was very dark. I would choose Grand Canyon over Crash every day.
