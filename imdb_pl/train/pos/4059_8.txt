The first of Ghibli's official films, Laputa is the most similar to his predecessor, Nausica, but while Nausicaa was an SF epic, this is more of an adventure comedy with a rather weak SF foundation. <br /> <br /> For the first half of the movie, I thought I would love it. Once again, you are impressed by Miyazaki's attention to detail and his ability to conjure up an imaginary world in meticulous, beautiful perfection. Animation, although still not in the league of later Ghibli movies, is a bit better than in Nausicaa. <br /> <br /> I mentioned in Nausica's review that one character is drawn in the anime "Lupinesque" style. There is a whole bunch of them here: pirates. They are a comic element in the film, though I do not know why it requires a comic element. There was nothing funny on Nausicaa and I think it would be better. Still. Having said that, Dola, the pirate leader, is certainly the most memorable character in the film (even if she is basically a female Long John Silver.) Do not be surprised if you remember "Treasure Planet" sometimes) and is well spoken by Cloris Leachman in the American dub . <br /> <br /> The English cast of the voice is very good. However, something about this movie started to be pear-shaped for me halfway. I think the best way to describe this is that the characters are absorbed by the huge range of the story. I'll come back to that later. <br /> <br /> There is so much to admire in Laputa, and so many people apparently love it, I almost feel nasty just for giving her 8 out of 10, but for me the operative word sounds "admire". It was more impressive than personally influencing and after more than two hours it began to drag. <br /> <br /> For me, the key thing was that I really did not care about any character. Disney would take care of character development, make you really fall in love with it, and not leave it as a two-dimensional element to move while staring at the amazing views in the movie. Even that would be bearable if there was a bit of hard SF in history to compensate for it, but it was basically a lot of gobedegooks about princesses and magic crystals. It is there that Laputa falls, as far as I am concerned, and that's what stops him from potentially 10 out of 10 movies. Having said that, I must admit that Miyazaki was the leader before Disney in general in 1986, when it is believed that their movie from the same year was very sharp "Great Mouse Detective". <br /> <br /> Laputa is a good movie in a sense an amazing movie, and you should definitely see it, but I feel it is exaggerated. I definitely prefer the earlier "Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind". <br /> <br /> BTW, if you can see them in chronological order, watch out for the fox squirrel from Nausica appearing briefly in Laputa.
