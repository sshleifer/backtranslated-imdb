I like my favorite Ronald Colman and the debut guy you see in such movies as If I Were King and Kismet. I like him as the epitome of civilization, as in The Lost Horrizon and Random Harvest. Meditative Colman is not my favorite. <br /> <br /> But in "Double Life" precisely because his role as actor Anthony John is so unconventional to him, Colman was considered an Oscar for the best actor in 1947. He became his best known part . <br /> <br /> Colman is an actor who takes the method very seriously. He just finished a successful run in a comedy of manners and is quite nice. To change the pace now that this game has finished its run on Broadway, Colman introduces the rebirth of Othello to New York. On the opposite side, as much as you can. <br /> <br /> His main lady in both is his ex-wife Signe Hasso, who loves him very much, but can not change his mood when he is at work. Colman loves her very much and wants to get her back. But he's heading for a mental breakdown when he starts to get confused with the jealous Moore Othello and Hasso with her role of Desdemona. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Shelley Winters as a poor waitress, who depressed Colman about his madness and she ends the game like poor Desdemona. Killed in the same way, and now is a matter of police officer from the homicide department Joe Sawyer. <br /> <br /> Colman's performance is so good that one wonders if it is a professional threat to the actors? I would shiver to think so, whether there were any unsolved killings at Laurence Olivier and Orson Welles or near him, and then they told Othello. <br /> <br /> I could never buy this story because of it, but I certainly applaud Ronald Colman and what he did to this part. I'm sure he won the Oscar, but one of the other nominees was his good friend William Powell for Life With Father. Others this year were Gregory Peck for Gentlemen's Agreement, John Garfield for Body and Soul, and Michael Redgrave becomes Electra for Mourning. <br /> <br /> Colman receives support from the rest of the cast, including Edmond O 'Brien, who is in the unwanted part of Cassio in Colman's jealous fantasy. You still will not find the equivalent of Iago in "Double Life", nobody makes jealousy, it's all in his mind. <br /> <br /> And this is from one of the most cultivated and civilized minds of the last century.
