Before watching this movie there were many things for me that contradicted this movie. <br /> <br /> First of all, I was a typical high school student, in the Shakespeare class, which I did not even like, much less understood! Shakespeare would be nothing more than AMAZING if I did not pour all my concentration into his almost encrypted art ... encrypted by his extremely difficult to understand language ... and then I still would not have the majority of it. br /> Second, it was 4 hours! I never thought it could be a good thing. <br /> <br /> Well, I'll tell you something. This movie was so masterful, so beautiful that I actually understood the whole language during its performance. Now the script was written to the letter in this movie, the same script that was incomprehensible to me in the Shakespeare class. And here I opened my mind and understood it. I almost doubted myself while watching the movie! But here ... when it is performed, and then Shakespeare comes to life. This version of Hamlet showed me that Shakespeare is indeed the master who wrote great stories. When I saw it on the big screen, especially in the big budget (with beautiful cinematography and photography), and amazingly worked in Brannagh and manned, somehow ... I understood what was happening. What has been said. The language is amazing and passionate. It allows for more severe emotions ... when words can not describe something, maybe Shakespeare's words can. <br /> <br /> To this day, I maintain that Fist of The North Star (animated, English dub) is the biggest movie ever made. No movies provide more pure entertainment. But for the film to approach the dethronement of Fist from this position (which Hamlet did - it was close), is really amazing .... inspirational. It was not a movie. It was an event. <br /> <br /> Even more amazing, it made me appreciate Shakespeare. Wow. Powerful. A powerful word. One of the rare, REAL powerful movies. <br /> <br /> Thanks to him, two hundred trillion stars emerge from the stars of infinity. Yes Yes. <br /> <br /> By the way, all the kids in Shakespeare's class ... forget. You're wasting your time. You must see the performed performances. Only then will justice be done to them.
