Almost the whole movie takes place in a public bath in China. There are no fancy sets, no explosions or charming people - only good writing, acting and directing (Hollywood, notice!). <br /> <br /> A distant son returns home when he believes that his father is dying. He is surprised to see that Dad looks good and intends to run a family business as usual. In fact, he notes that his father and his late brother have really established a close and caring relationship and it soon becomes evident that he is out of the loop! Dad is very traditional, and this visiting son comes from a big city and really does not see the value of an old bathhouse. How their relationship changes and where the plot comes from is unique and credible. <br /> <br /> I was happy to see that not every Chinese movie is a photo of the action (such as those with Jet Li or Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), because I do not care about these crazy movies. The shower, as well as spring in a small town are two great examples of good Chinese films about the PEOPLE!
