This story is exceptionally unique. It's about the two pilots who save Earth from aliens, but they must use a special speed that makes everything around them age quickly. The whole series deals with pilots dealing with losing time, friends and mentors. <br /> <br /> The ending could have been fantastic. It started to end with a complete note and leave a real mark, but instead it ended with a super happy Disney note and it annoyed me VERY bad. <br /> <br /> Animation is decent in 1989, but it can not match today's. I also heard how many complained about the cheapness of nudity. Actually, I think it's pretty decent. Most nudity was justified except for episode 2, where there was excess. <br /> <br /> Generally deserves a look, but the ending does not allow you to be a classic.
