I'm tired of my 4 and 5 year old daughters who are constantly watching Nickelodeon, Disney and the like. It seems that old, tired tales are constantly interrupted. When my daughters could not go to the market this afternoon, because one of them was sick, I wanted them to just rest and rest for a moment. I turned on the TV and searching for something else, I turned channels. My finger stopped the surf channel the moment I heard Harvey's voice. I love every single thing that this man did, and when I saw him doing a voice-over job for a little duck ... well, I could not change the channel! My daughters were immediately mesmerized by the cartoon and the more we watched a concert TOGETHER, the more I loved him with the message. He is not necessarily a supporter of "homosexual rights", but rather anyone who has ever been ostracized as a child for anything. I had friends who were chosen for one or the other ... too fat, too thin, too feminine, being a tyrant, not smart enough, just one of my parents ... you name it! As a rule, children can be very cruel to themselves, so I was happy to see a funny cartoon that actually conveyed LIFE's message to the audience. My girls already accept others as they are and do not choose others because they are different. My older daughter actually defends her friends if they are chosen (it happens that we have one mom and this little girl is often chosen - it warms my heart when Kassie intercedes for her!). <Br /> <br /> So those of you who condemn this program because you feel that he is a supporter of "gay rights" or are forced to "accept certain views", you clearly and completely missed the meaning of this poignant little cartoon. <br /> <br /> And if you need to explain it ... well, you need more help than any television program could offer.
