Jimmy Cagney is constantly pursuing your eyes in this story of a stage producer who is energetically grappling with upcoming "talking" films. <br /> <br /> This story of love, deception, women and dance is presented in a way that you are never boring as a viewer. The direction of the mass scenes in the rehearsal rooms was extremely well done. History has never really got lost at this crazy pace. <br /> <br /> Some parts of the material presented here have become a bit outdated, but it does not matter, because looking at it in the frame of 1933 is fantastic to watch it alongside many other films that were released at that time. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Cagney is a view of the aching eyes in this film, never losing calm, as an always-working producer of announcements for the cinema as an intros. In this way he tries to save his butt before leaving the business, he was a Broadway producer before he started doing it. Joan Blondell is fantastic as a neglected interest in love, Nan, gives such a captivating spectacle that is so unusual for films of that time, it's so cool to watch a woman who is portrayed as a strong woman for a change. <br /> <br /> The only problem I had with this movie is huge productions at the end. They were wonderful, beautifully choreographed and wonderfully produced in themselves, but they simply did not fit the story. The only link they have to the main story is that Cagney had to put 3 previews in three days to get a contract and that's what he did. It was hard for me to believe that this was what the girls tried during the entire movie and that these sets would fit the cinema. In this way, "Sitting On A Backyard Fence" was much more appropriate to the plot. <br /> <br /> It seems that the productions at the end stopped this wildly dynamic story and it was not good. I was tired after seeing the first musical sequence, and then I realized that two more were coming. These sequences also giggled the audience. <br /> <br /> All in all a great movie with a sour finish. <br /> <br /> 9/10
