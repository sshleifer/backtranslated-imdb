The couple (Janet and Richard) set off for a camp in a forest near a huge swamp. After camping and enjoying nature, the couple take shelter of what they think is an abandoned home. Soon a couple of refugees appear and after many delays inevitable, they manage to rape Janet and block Richard in the bird cage. <br /> <br /> THE LAST HOUSE ON THE FILM LEFT must be one of the most underrated horrors in history. This is one of the more sick and twisted shocking early 70's. What's more, I discovered that it is very charming and beautiful in its perverse tone. I love CAGED TERROR. Music definitely helps give the film personality as well as beauty. I think the movie is quite scary. <br /> <br /> The disadvantages mainly concern the stimulation of the film, that is, the film is rather slow and meandering. Although I did not mind stimulation due to the beauty and tension of this film, I think that both will be people. Acting is not very good or dialogue, at least in the early stages. This movie requires a bit more patience than usual and is not for everyone. <br /> <br /> In short, it was a good movie. This is not the biggest horror I've ever seen, but it's definitely great fun. This is not the easiest movie to find. You can find it in the USED section in many stores if you look strong enough. It's not for everyone, but if you're a fan of the trash cinema, it's definitely worth checking out.
