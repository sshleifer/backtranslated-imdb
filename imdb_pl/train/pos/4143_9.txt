No, I'm not kidding. If ever, ever, you have the chance to see this movie. If you want to cut your arm to see it, see it. Worth it. <br /> <br /> Fatty Drives The Bus is not like any movie you've ever seen. He takes the trash cinema and picks it up to a work of art. Although it contains weak shots, idiotic characters, bad dialogue, strange acting and photos that belong to public access in Iowa, it actually achieves its purpose as a movie. It strives to be the stupidest, strangest, most elusive movie you've ever seen. And this boy always succeed. <br /> <br /> I will make a story for those of you who are worried about such things (the filmmakers apparently did not), but you do not really have to pay too much attention, because the whole plot of the film is presented in a very long passage of text played before the initial subtitles. In any case, FDTB (as his admirers call it) is the story of a bus tour through Chicago led by Satan. You see, Jesus is in the city and all passengers on the bus should die, and all their souls would go to hell, except Jesus in the city, the butler in hell dismisses work, and this angers Satan, because, well, he does not like to look like a fool before man, so he decides to get people on the bus to sign their souls directly, but he's a devil, so he needs to change, otherwise who would go on tour with him, so he dresses up as Roger and gets on the bus where the driver never goes he's called a name, but he's a bit fat, so it's probably Fatty. Bus (and riders) are on a collision course with crazy! <br /> <br /> Examples of madness: the title repeats on the screen 3 times. I do not know why. The character appears on the bus halfway through the journey without explanation or introduction, and from time to time sits next to others, and they look at her as if she did not belong. I do not know why. Two characters fall in love and exchange long looks that are really the same repetitions. I do not know why. After Satan gives a monologue about the transformation into a human form, the title card flashes "Satan will change." I do not know why. One of the characters is a woman who is very visible as a man in oppression and is referred to by other characters as "charming Bridget". I do not know why. <br /> <br /> If I had one good thing out of my apprenticeship in Troma last summer, I got my own copy of Fatty Drives The Bus.
