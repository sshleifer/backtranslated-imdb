"A Bug's Life" is like a favorite candy bar - it is filled with great pieces that make up something really tasty. <br /> <br /> History could not be better; he is clever, has a "heart" (emotions), and each character has a nice "bow" (height or change). For comparison, the only characters in "Toy Story" that have an "arc" are Buzz, who learns to love being a toy, and Woody who overcomes his aversion to Buzz. In "A Bug's Life" there is a lot of laughter and charming moments. All actors perform great voice work, and the animation, both movement and details, is great. <br /> <br /> This serious movie enthusiast does not take a look at "10", but this movie certainly deserves the "10" that I gave.
