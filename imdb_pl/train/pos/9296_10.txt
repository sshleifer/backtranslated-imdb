I love that movie. It's a bizarre, funny, brutal, surreal, crazy-minded thing, and certainly not your usual comedy. <br /> <br /> If the movie is not funny, it probably does not match your tastes, so it's difficult to write a review for. <br /> <br /> For comparison, other comedies that I love are The Big Lebowski, The Princess Bride and Zoolander (he got me the second time). They are different, but my taste definitely fits the unusual, and I am willing to accept that most people just do not like such things. I am not sorry for having an unusual sense of humor - at least I have one. <br /> <br /> Scenes and characters from this particular movie are well connected, verbal humor is funny, situations are intriguing, acting is very good (as you would expect from cast), although the casting requirements of the cast are not particularly high. The overall package makes the game fun, fun, playable and brutal at the same time.
