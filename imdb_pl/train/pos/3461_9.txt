This episode of Columbo is probably more familiar to the director, Steven Spielberg, as one of his early films. Look at the role of Jack Cassidy as a murderer who kills his partner in writing to maintain his lifestyle. Jack Cassidy will appear in later Columbo. In the end, Columbo meets his character in the form of Jack Cassidy. He is a mysterious writer who plans to make an ideal murder. After the first murder, his next victim would be an irritating shop owner / widow who would blackmail him with money. Instead of losing more money, he kills her. Watching Cassidy and Falk as always is very funny. Knowing Falk as Columbo makes it possible to watch it after having seen this episode for many years. Today's television forgets about the success of years, that people will want to watch programs again if they like characters. It is not about who does it, how or why, knowledge of Columbo and his sympathy reaches high scores in viewers like me.
