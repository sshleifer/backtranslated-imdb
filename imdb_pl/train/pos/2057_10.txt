In 2002, there was no day when I was not chased by scarecrows I felt that this movie coped well with a serious problem <br /> <br /> He restored many memories because he was so realistic <br /> <br /> Even today I have nightmares about corn and I can not even get close to canned things for fear of my life. <br /> <br /> I must admit, however, that at some point the movie I had to turn off because it hit too close to home <br /> <br /> For those of you who have never been attacked by a scarecrow, watching this movie, you could find out how it was for us victims. <br /> <br /> This movie teaches us to do not take life for granted or mix with corn, believe me, I was there and I have scars <br /> <br /> Watch the movie, its amazing and educational
