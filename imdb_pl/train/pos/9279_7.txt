Bezafi's comedy-drama "Offside" by Jafar Panahi presents some women trying to enter the sports arena in Tehran from which women are banned. The official reason: a lot of vulgar language, and footballers have legs shown. But of course this is a case of sexism. Most of the film is made of gentle comic relief because women are trying to ask men serious questions about why women are banned from entering the stadium, and one woman even makes up her own plan to oppose men. <br /> <br /> As I understand it, all of Jafar Panahi's films (including one) are forbidden in Iran. The real tragedy is that the overthrow of the Prime Minister by the CIA in 1953 and the later support of the brutal Shah gave Ayatollah Khomeini a pretext to use his narrow interpretation of the Koran to establish a chauvinistic society and that current George W. Bush policy towards Iran gives Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is a pretext for the cowboy's actions and tightening censorship. <br /> <br /> First of all, it is a neat look at people who are inventing ways to challenge the system. This is not a great movie, but it's worth seeing. Considering all of Jafar Panahi's films are banned, I wonder how he can even do them.
