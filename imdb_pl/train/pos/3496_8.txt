I'm surprised how many people give this traffic less than 7 stars. <br /> <br /> But they just do not understand the movie. <br /> <br /> The story is about growing up in a difficult situation. <br /> <br /> There is a crazy grandma who really wants for the best grandchildren. <br /> <br /> And there is a good reason why so many critics like this movie. /> And that's because they understand the movie. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry about the low performance of some people. <br /> <br /> I would like to write a short summary of the movie, but IMDb requires writing 10 lines. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I have nothing else to say.
