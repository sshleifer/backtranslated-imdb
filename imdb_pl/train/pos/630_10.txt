I did not expect much after this movie. I got a ticket for an advanced show. I just finished my work. It was hot and I was tired. I had to wait in the cinema for 40 minutes and it seemed that there was no cold air flowing through the corridors of the theater complex. <br /> <br /> After taking a seat in the theater, tired and frustrated, he started, I did not recognize any of the actors at the beginning, but the film was perfect. From the very beginning, I was absorbed in a movie, getting more and more excited about every passing minute. I think this movie is supposed to be a fantasy / fairy tale classic. The actors were fantastic, the pace was perfect and the ending was magical.
