"The Godfather", "Citizen Kane", "Star Wars", "Goodfellas" None of the above is comparable with the complex brilliance "Soprano". Each character has layers on the layers of absolute truth, completely and completely three-dimensional. We take care of Tony Soprano with all our hearts, even though in the simplest model, good versus evil is bad. Soprano is the most provocative, intricate and fascinating hero ever made at this moment in history. If you are in the mood to be openly questioned as a viewer and forever change your feelings about entertainment, watch "The Sopranos". I oppose anyone who sits down and watches the first episode of Season 1, and does not want to continue the series. Each season is completely brilliant in its own way. DVDs are necessary for each collection **** of 4
