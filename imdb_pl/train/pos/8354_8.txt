I saw the movie originally a few years ago during Friday's Cinemax after a dark series (at a time when the cable box was built like a keyboard) and it intrigued me. Although the film has a senseless aspect, it is well made. The performances of Depardieu and Dewaere are very pleasant. Together they have good chemistry, and Miou-Miou makes pink fur looks breathtaking. be done in these politically correct times (at least not in the United States), because it seems to sensitize things like violence, robbery and casual sex. This film proves that with a talented cast and a talented director, a good movie is a good movie no matter what. It saddened me that I found out that Patrick Dewaere had committed suicide and I will check him with Depardieu and Miou -Widz in Get Out Your Hankerchief in the near future.
