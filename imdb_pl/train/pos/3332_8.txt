Yes, commitment. Let's say "Fever Pitch" can make you believe that it's a baseball movie. <br /> <br /> But no, you do not have to be a baseball fan to really enjoy this picture from the Farrelly brothers. But of course, if you are one, you will enjoy even more; with all references (quite accurate, I would say) to the Boston Red Sox and its bittersweet story; from Bambino's Curse and everything that's assigned to it, including those two words that you CAN NOT say in front of a Boston fan: Bill Buckner. <br /> <br /> Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon depict two people who can usually have a second thought about entering a relationship: a successful workaholic who is also a wealthy meeting with the teacher? The thing is that Fallon's character captures Barrymore's heart, being fun, caring, sweet and perfect. But her friends ask her a logical question: if she is such a guardian, why is she still on the market? Enter the Boston Red Sox. He was so devoted to his team, since his uncle gave him tickets for the Sox season; he has never left his home in Red Sox at Fenway Park for a long time. <br /> <br /> And this delicate balance, how much a workaholic wants to give up his man's obsession; and how much this crazy teacher wants to compromise to maintain the OTHER love of his life, that's what this film is all about. <br /> <br /> At the beginning, you might think that sporting obsessions of film fragments are exaggerated for comical relief. Well, unfortunately I have to admit that I do not. I, as a die-hard Houston Astros fan, can say that all are true. I would like to try every possible way to see every Stros game; listen to them on the radio or follow them on the Internet. I read the Chronicle sports section every day. And yes, my room looks like The Shed, a souvenir shop at Minute Maid Park; with a wardrobe full of Astros equipment, including 5 shirts, 20 shirts and you know the rest. Fallon's character even has a Red Sox MBNA MasterCard. <br /> <br /> Fallon was credible enough as a fanatical loyal Red Sox, even though he could do it without becoming a cartoon (thank God Adam Sandler was not in it); And the plot revolved around how the couple tried to cope with the passions of others. <br /> <br /> I would say it will be a classic romantic comedy. It is not enough to be one of the best films ever; but it certainly breaks the form in this genre and is attractive enough for men and women.
