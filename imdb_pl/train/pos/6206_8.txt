I am a fan of Hal Hartley's films, especially "Henry Fool" from 1997. "Fay Grim" is a continuation of this film and has a similar style and sense of humor. The plot, however, is completely different. Fay Grim (played excellently by iconic Parker Posey) tries to track down her missing husband's notebooks and finds herself among conspiracies and espionage. Supporting cast (most of the people from the first movie, as well as Jeff Goldblum, Saffron Burrows and the very welcome comeback of the 90s, Elina Lowensohn) is excellent and the film has many surprises. The director claims that this is part of the "Star Wars" trilogy, serving as the "Empire Strikes Back" series. If that's true, I can not wait for the third part! I just hope I do not have to wait 10 years for it.
