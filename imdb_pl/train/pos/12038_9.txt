Yes, a real classic! This is what British drama, realism and minimal use of special effects (and too inflated budgets) is all about. The last time I saw this drama was when he was last shown on British terrestrial television in 1994. It really should be watched by everyone who likes the frightening story, no big names, no less great actors. unknown and as such, this great drama probably will not be broadcast soon. I recently acquired The Woman In Black on VHS, so now I will be able to enjoy this truly great British drama. You should try and enjoy it too! <br /> <br /> Mark R. Horobin
