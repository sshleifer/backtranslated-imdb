The silent movie "Duma of the Clan" with Mary Pickford was to be placed on a fictional island off the coast of Scotland. In fact, most outdoor shots were shot at Marblehead Massachusett on Marblehead Neck near several rocky coastal geographic areas, including Churn and Castle Rock. My first interest in the film was due to two factors: 1) the location of the movie Marblehead in my hometown and 2) the fact that my grandmother Lizzette M. Woodfin was hired as deputy Mary Pickford during the filming of several scenes, including the "cliff scene". Both women were small (5 ') tall, and both my father and grandmother were linked by the fact that she was back to the camera on the cliff stage as part of the Chiefton film set. I just wanted to tell this story to future historians and film lovers. The film itself (my DVD copy is a bit weak) is very well done with lots of action and expressive acting, including several scenes where Miss Pickford introduces a strong woman. I liked it and would like to get a better copy, although I'm not sure if there is one I have seen on various movie sites that other copies are dark due to deterioration. A very nice movie about a silent species with lots of action!
