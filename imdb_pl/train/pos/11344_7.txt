Pufnstuf is what it is. I saw it at the cinema at the age of 4 and have very nice and vivid memories. Seeing it as an adult, you can catch references that are over the heads of the target audience - like the one in which Jimmy's witch's gray wig is pulled, and Witch Hazel (Cass) mocks "I knew he had brown roots!". This is, of course, strongly influenced by the flower power culture of that time, and in some respects quite progressive. Different, for example, sends a clear message to young viewers about being yourself, does not work with the package, and nurturing what is about you is different. It may be a hymn for the gay community, it should be a great song. <br /> <br /> Martha Raye, Cass Elliot and Billie Hayes are great as witches, and the cast of Living Island gives it all to the limit of their costumes (including Billy Barty, Felix Silla and other famous names). There's a lot of acting in the movie - there's nothing subtle really, and when little Jack Wild has to express his concern for the abducted residents of Living Island, it's really little more than screaming. It's a drama and comedy spread on a trowel. Although I think about it - I could never stand the flute. <br /> <br /> I love the soundtrack, especially the above-mentioned "Różny", but also "Zapal świat", "Pufnstuf" and even "Wildness" by Jacek Wild. What's more, it is now available on CD from tasteful people from El Records in London. See here for more: www.cherryred.co.uk/el/artists/pufnstuf.htm
