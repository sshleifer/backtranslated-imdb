How amazing is this movie! I have seen it over and over again for years and I am always enchanted by it. The reason why the film is so easy to see again is of course the shocking performance of young Bette Davis. She does not just steal every scene she's in, but she's actually a lot nicer and better photographed (not to mention sex) than any of the films she's done in her home studio at Warner Brothers, done by RKO Radio Pictures ). She has a very flattering make-up and has very attractive hairstyles and oh, those charming big eyes (especially in the restaurant scenes that take place in the London Soho). Her body was so winding when she was young. Get it in a cheap dressing-gown that he wears in his great explosive confrontational scene with Leslie Howard. And oh, she is the absolute power in this scene. Howard is a little too upset, but he makes the impression of the hero's sensitivity. Frances Dee as a sweet, pretty young Sally who really loves him. The score of Max Steiner is both charming and thrilling. Great performances and taste from the thirties make it a version of the classic novel.
