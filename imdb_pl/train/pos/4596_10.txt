This is Jackie Chan's best movie and my favorite movie. After the disappointing US release of "The Protector" directed by James Glickenhaus, Jackie accepted this idea and put it in Hong Kong. It is also probably the most brutal Jackies movie, with the audience huddled on ground-breaking exploits. <br /> <br /> The action is fast and furious, Jackie and his crew really put the maximum effort into the fight project. The bones were broken and blood spilled over the process of creating this movie, as you'll see in the subtitles. <br /> <br /> The script is a simple matter of cops and thieves, nothing special, after all it was written around the action. I must say that the English version has some suspicious dubbing, but that should not discourage you too much. <br /> <br /> So look around, break down beer and enjoy. By the way, the film was called "Glass Story" by the stunt crew. Why? Let me convince you!
