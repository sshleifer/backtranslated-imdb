This movie has a great acting game, great photography and a very strong story that really makes you think about who you are, how you define yourself, how you fit in, whether you accept playing a role or free yourself ... There are already perfect comments regarding these aspects. I want to comment on the formal setting of the film. Basically, it's two people on the roof. There is unity of place and time, with two heroes and a radio acting as a choir. Many directors turned Greek tragedies into a movie, many directors filmed modern stories as if they were a Greek tragedy, but no director, in my opinion, managed to get as great as Ettore Scola to approach the purity and power of the great Greek tragedies. in the story and formal settings. Masterpiece.
