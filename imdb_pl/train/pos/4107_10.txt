I loved this movie! It's really bizarre, extremely funny, morbid, witty ... There is no point in talking about the content of the movie, because then I would give the result! You must see it without knowing what's going on! Everything is connected and has its own reasons and why. It begins subtly, and then things start to roll faster and faster until they reach the climax of the craziest explosion you can imagine! Watching a movie is even more enjoyable when you know all the tricks. The actors are great, especially Ivan Trojan, whose last scenes are a real masterpiece! I highly recommend this movie, it's one of the most original movies I've ever seen!
