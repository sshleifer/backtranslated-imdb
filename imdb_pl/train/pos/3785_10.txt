This film is very underestimated. He is very ingenious, creative and clever. It's just fun and in my opinion this movie is in the first place. But the film was forgotten when it first appeared, and it became even more overlooked over the years. "Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey" also bombed at the box office, while the first was quite a hit and very popular. <br /> <br /> I think the problem may be that this movie was released in a few years too late. In 1991, Bill and Ted already seemed "yes" to the 80s ". Although the 1980s were only a few years ago, the landscape of music and style for children has changed so dramatically as gangsta rap, hip hop, Pearl Jam, Nirvana, grunge and Seattle sound. Bill and Ted with the music of Ozzy Osbourne, Van Halen and Guns N 'Roses, along with their 80s style, seemed out of place and very obsolete in 1991 and I think it's one big reason why the movie he bombed at the box office. No one except surfers said such things as "perfect!" And "false!" In 1991 "Gremlins 2", which also appeared in the early 90s, met a similar fate that it was a good movie, which he bombed at the box office, because it was too connected to the 80's. The transition from the 80s to the 90s was a much faster change than in the 90's and 00's. 1991 was nothing in 1988 or 1989, while currently, 2002 and the last year 2001 still looks / looked like 1995 or 1996. <br /> <br /> If only "Excellent adventure", which was made in 1988, was released NA TO instead of 1989, and "Bogus Journey" was quickly released and released in 1989, then it would probably be as wildly received as the first one.
