In the end, I wanted to see it in the cinema. A few years ago I saw Fritz Lang's video on video. I was hoping that the perfect screening conditions would work in their magic. <br /> <br /> The conditions were perfect at Cinematheque Ontario. Flawless printout along the entire length. Inscriptions in the original Gothic German script with simultaneous translation into English, accurate, without being too literal. Live piano accompaniment. Ideal. <br /> <br /> The magic of the movie sprang up for a moment, but eventually she did not catch it, at least for me. <br /> <br /> This movie has no real connection with Wagner's cycle, like me. I knew, but some did not. Wagner adapted the 13th century. Niebelungenlied for own purposes. Part I of the epic Fritz Lang - "Siegfried" - has much to say to Wagner's listeners. <br /> <br /> "Kriemhild's Revenge" is the story of Siegfried Kriemhild's wife, her marriage to King Etzel (Attila) Hun and her desire for revenge against Hagen and Gunther, the baptized Nibelung, for Siegfried's murder. The spectacular conflagration in this film probably evolved and expanded in Wagnerian myths to his Götterdämmerung, his Dusk of the Gods and the end of Valhalla. This movie remains unearthly. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie is spectacular. Huge sets compete with the series "Cabiria" (1914), which inspired Griffith to "Intolerance" (1916). Their decoration marks a new reference point in barbarian splendor. There is a huge cast of scars, dirty Huns and Burgundians from Art Deco. And battle. Battles that never really end. <br /> <br /> Kriemhild is successful in his plan of revenge. She manages to destroy everything around her. Her loyalty to the martyr Siegfried does not seem to arise so much from love or devotion, but from something closer to psychosis. Lady Macbeth shouted, "Take me away here." She knew that she was emotionally unprepared for what she must do. But Kriemhild does not show any normal human emotions and certainly nothing equals a female principle. He is already "the most effective from the cruelest cruelty", from the very beginning to borrow Shakespeare's opinion. Margarethe Schön and her director convey it with anger. I do not want to exaggerate, but this is the only expression that will ever "revive" Kriemhild's face. This is the best performance in one sound. However, this is clearly intended, not just a case of bad action. <br /> <br /> What we have then on offer is a one-dimensional sketch of Fury's revenge. Some may see Kriemhild as a reinforced heroine. I simply perceive the film as misogynist.
