The Bourne Ultimatum (2007) Review: After an exciting set of two people, we get the last part. Here's my opinion: <br /> <br /> The Bourne Ultimatum has it all. We have Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) on the tips of those who know everything. He ran too long. This time it ends. <br /> <br /> Bourne Ultimatum has a great storyline, amazing writing, fantastic direction, tension and some of the best summer actions. Matt Damon provides the best performance possible so far. He has the conviction and growing desire of an anxious killer. <br /> <br /> There is a bit of intelligent humor and some good tension here. Reactions to certain events will make you either laugh (in a good way) or cheer. (or both) I've heard a lot of intelligent laughter in the theater and a lot of clapping. The audience loved it. <br /> <br /> The Bourne Ultimatum delivers everything in a nicely packed packaging. All goods, then some. This is, in my opinion, the best movie of this summer. <br /> <br /> The Last Word: A perfect ending. The best of the trilogy. That's how you should do summer movie thrillers. I love the Bourne trilogy.
