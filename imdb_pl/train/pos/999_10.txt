I'm amazed at how this movie (and most others have an average of 5 stars and less when there are unpleasant movies with an average size of 7 to 10 stars on IMDb.) The fanboy's mentality hits again. "When this movie came out, everyone slammed it in. Even my ex The girl said it was questionable, and after years I sat down to watch the movie and enjoyed it, even laughing a little, and The Replacement Killers are movies in which people called the director Antoine Fuqua as the black Michael Bay. since most of Fuqua's films are smarter than anything Michael Bay has invented. Anyway ... <br /> <br /> Story: Alvin Sanders (Jamie Foxx) is a former convict who is used by nonsense treasurer Edgar (David Morse As a pawn to catch an assassin named Bristol (Doug Hutchinson), Alvin's every move is followed by a worm implanted in the jaw after an accident. h that were made in a robbery that broke down. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx is funny and great like Alvin Sanders. Alvin is a fast speaker who is much smarter than he lets. Doug Hutchinson is okay as Bristol. It can sometimes be exaggerated in the behavior of John Malkovitchque. He was better here than Looney Bin Jim at Punisher: War Zone. David Morse is a good tax agent. Even Mike Epps is as funny as Alvin's brother, Stevie. Both he and Jamie had some funny moments on the screen. <br /> <br /> The only disadvantage of the movie is that some of the rehearsals in the thriller are falling. The scenario on the racetrack is too high, but I could not look away. The director went all the way, so he gets points for it. Plus, the scene of a bomb with a treasure agent tied to a chair while the detonator rests on the door was quite clever. <br /> <br /> In total, Bait is not a bad movie after a long shot. It's never boring, it's always fun and I did not check the watch every minute. That should count something. Bait is one of the most underrated films of the 2000 period. <br /> <br /> PS: for the reviewer who claimed that this movie is too violent .... How long do you live under the rock? I'm sure you saw the Die Hard series and EVERY film by Quentin Tarantino. But these movies are not violent? Weirdo.
