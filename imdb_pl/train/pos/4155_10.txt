What a great episode for this great series. This is TV perfection at its best. The story takes place in 1968 and is beautifully shot in black and white, almost film-style noir with deep shadows and raw images. It's a story about two men who fall in love, but I do not want to mess it up. This is a rare presentation of what homosexuals met in the 1960s in America. Written by the illustrious Tom Pettit, directed by the great Jeannot Szwarc, we move through their lives, their mutual love and tragedy. Taking such a delicate issue makes this episode even more stunning. Our emotions are as torn and sharp as characters. At the end of the spine, when they played Bob Dylan, "Ah, but I was much older than me, I'm now younger," Byrds sang. This one goes far beyond 10 and further to the stars. Beautiful.
