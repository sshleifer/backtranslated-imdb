This is short and factual. Writing the story used in Star Trek: Hidden Frontier is surprisingly good. Acting is on the whole map, but the main characters have been working on improving their skills over the years. It's hard to believe that this series has been going on for almost 7 years and will end in mid-May 2007. <br /> <br /> I will not change what has already been said about sets and graphics. Considering that it is voluntary work, with no profit, it is quite amazing. <br /> <br /> If it was a professional production ranking, I would have to give him 5 for a good story, but for terrible sets. However, as a fan-based production, I have to give it an excellent rating, with the exception of a few other efforts, this is the league itself. For the pure volume, I do not think it will be right. Congratulations to the cast and crew for the effort that many admire.
