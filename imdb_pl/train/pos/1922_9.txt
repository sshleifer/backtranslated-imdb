Let me say first that this show was at the highest level when John Ritter was there. After his death, the program dropped somewhat, but the producers did not give up the show, adding James Garner and David Spade to the regular cast in 2003-2005. <br /> <br /> Exhibition centers around the Hennessy family, Paul (John Ritter, peace be upon him), his wife Cate (Katey Sagal), their daughters Bridget (Kaley Cuoco), Kerry (Amy Davidson) and their son Rory (Martin Spanjers). When Ritter was at the concert, I'd be screaming with laughter (and I'm proud to admit it), but now that he's gone, I'll only laugh with occasional hearty laughter. I am very happy that I fell in love with the trance of this series after Ritter's untimely death because he made Eps with Ritter a lot better. <br /> <br /> Ritter's character is so well preserved and well rounded that you can help him, but love him. He always heads girls on dates, but he really wants them to be happy. This is the best daddy hates the boy's entertainment. <br /> <br /> Katey Sagal is also great and she is also a nice character. After Ritter's death her character provides such a strong influence and strength not only to her children, but I believe that Sagal has shaped the life of Cuoco, Davidson and Spanjers, because she and Ritter have been friends for a long time. <br /> <br /> The funniest person on the show will be Bridget Hennessy, played by Kaleya Cuoco. She is the best blonde: great, slow, depressed, but she is a wise person. She is ridiculous with her innocent "blonde humor" and how self-conscious she is. <br /> <br /> Amy Davidson can become a bit annoying like Kerry, but that's her character. The only disadvantage of the program is that the show never gives Kerry anything he could be happy with. She's always married to Bridget, and her character feels like she's just thrown in there. <br /> <br /> Martin Spanjers as a lone Hennessy's son is hysterical, and when Ritter is on display, he's mainly a comic. After Ritter's death, the series presents several threads for Rory. <br /> <br /> David Spade and James Garner are just laughs, sometimes there's a story for C.J., Spade's character. Garner plays Father Cate as some information about the past. <br /> <br /> In summary, I give this concert a great review, because it is a great program that had a tragic event that mutilated him. You'll love it. <br /> <br /> 9/10 - spy
