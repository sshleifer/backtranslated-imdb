In a sense, I liked The Lonely Lady. Give Pia a break. It looks great and has really nice eyes. What you do not like The scene in which Ray Liotta is raped by the garden hose was quite brutal and cruel. In fact, many of the things that happen in this movie are glaring and cruel. But this is a kitschy movie. Many kitsch movies are not bad at all. I liked it better than Valley of the Dolls, which was not only tacky but boring. At least it was not boring. <br /> <br /> Pia is very naked and seems to be poorly written. Watching her talk about Pushkin and Byron with a guy three times her age is unbelievable. I'm sure that Pia is a nice person in real life, he just does not design the writer's atmosphere. She looked much happier when she worked as a housekeeper for this guy from Saturday Night Fever and dressed in a shiny disco dress. <br /> <br /> Several scenes are fun. The one in which he tells the binomial actor that he is pregnant, and he rolls his eyes and throws at her to "stop spinning!", All the time practically regretting every bimbo who waves next to it. > Pia's nervous breakdown scene is good. It was probably a mistake to go to a supernova (a whirl of floating faces and a scream from frozen frames - whoa!) And her later catatonic numbness is exaggerated. , though. I want to see someone doing this speech in the drama class. <br /> <br /> But again this is the trash we're talking about. Worse you can find in every movie of the week in the eighties.
