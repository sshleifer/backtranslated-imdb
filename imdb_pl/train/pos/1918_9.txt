I will be honest that I was a junior in high school when this sitcom was broadcast for the first time at ABC. I did not think I would like it at all. But thanks to John Ritter, I felt that it had some potential in it, and besides, I liked something else. Acting was great, not too many awful comedy lines from second place, John Ritter always brings his game when it comes to comedy. It was a great program to watch and I will tell you why it was a great performance. My father, who never watches the series, just watches movies, sports, law and order, actually sat down with my three brothers and two sisters, my mother and me, and watched the program I think because John Ritter was in it. I really think that this program will continue to work if John Ritter God rests in his soul, it's a pity he did not die.
