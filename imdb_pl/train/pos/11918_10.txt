"Angels in the Outfield" was originally a 1951 movie from Ted Turner's library; Disney rewrote it in 1994, this time using California Angels (now Los Angeles Angels) as a band (Disney was the owner of this and Anaheim Mighty Ducks Hockey Team, also, good use of words, huh ?????). <br /> <br /> This movie was about a few orphaned children who wanted to have a family. The man promised the boys a family, only if the Angels won the pennant. So one evening, he called God on this. The boy who was praying could see help coming along the way (and ONLY this boy); for example, when the first angel fell, the player hit the ball so hard that he not only broke the bat, but also the ball !!!!! For most of the season after All Star in 1994, Angels were at the top of the AL West (which my Rangers home team is one and still is). However, they lost the match because the boy was outside instead of White Sox / Angels (then there was no Central Division in Baseball, hence Chicago is in the West) and no angel was there to help. In this way a new rule was created: no angels can help in master games. But wait! In the final championship game Angels won !!!!! It really was a miracle! <br /> <br /> What I liked about this movie: It's a good movie. I mean, I've been praying every night for the last few years asking for help at school and the like; Look at me now! My work was good !!!!! First of all, it shows that if you believe, God can send his angels to help you with the troubles you may have in life. Second, it's a family baseball movie that's always exciting. It's also an old Disney movie; I saw it recently on the New Disney Channel (blech !!!!!). <br /> <br /> "Angels in the Outfield" will change your life forever when you see it !!!! ! <br /> <br /> 10/10
