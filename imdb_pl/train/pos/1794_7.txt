In the middle of Lajos Koltai's "Evening", the woman on her deathbed asks the figure appearing in her hallucination: "Can you tell me where my life went?" The line could be embarrassingly theatrical, but the woman who says it is Vanessa Redgrave, passes it with utter simplicity, and the question takes your heart out. <br /> <br /> Time and again, a film based on Susan Minot's novel, sentimentalism and ordinariness, attracts attention, offers admirable performances and evokes emotional involvement, just like a few recent films. With only six months a year, the cinemas are now two memorable, significant, valuable films, and the other, of course, "Away from Her" by Sara Polley. Hollywood could turn the "Evening" into a neat vehicle with two pairs of real mothers and daughters - Vanessa Redgrave and Natasha Richardson, and Meryl Streep and Mamie Gummer. Richardson is the daughter of Redgrave in the movie (with his sister played by Tony Collette), and Gummer plays Streep, who is younger than himself, while Redgrave's youthful incarnation is Claire Danes. <br /> <br /> Add Glenn Close, Eileen Atkins, Hugh Dancy, Patrick Wilson and a large cast - yes, it could have turned into a multi-star platform. Instead, Koltai - the brilliant Hungarian cinematographer "Mephisto" and the director of "Fateless" - created a subtle team work with a "continental sense", a story unfolding in a high-class Newport environment, in the days preceding the wedding, which is full of troubles. <br /> <br /> Missed calls, wrong choices and obligatory adherence to social and family pressures are quite a good soap opera, but the quality of the letter, the direction of Koltai and unselfish acting "Evening" above this level, in the rarefied English air, French (and several American) family sags from an age before its contemporary surroundings. <br /> <br /> Complex relationships between mothers and daughters, between friends and lovers, adding a difficult triangle, meet clearly, comprehensibly, irresistibly. The individual melodies are woven into a symphony. <br /> <br /> And yet, with all the above emphasis on the band and disinterested performances, the stars of the "Evening" are still shining, Redgrave, Richardson, Gummer (an exciting new discovery, looking like her mother, but very different actress), Danes they carry most of the cargo - until Streep appears in the last moments and of course steals the show. Dancy and Wilson are also worth the admission price. <br /> <br /> As with "Away from Her", "Evening" stays with you for a long time, inviting you to think about its history and characters, and relive the emotions it evokes. After two hours, the movie takes a bit long, but the way it stays with you after it is welcome among many movies that are cold long before popcorn.
