I loved this movie !!! The protagonists were people on whom you could feel. The young man returned from duty, still in love with the girl he had left. Tom Drake is always perfect in a romantic role and Donna Reed as the love of his life. The look that gives her, as if he was hungry to see her, as well as her hesitation and confusion, as well as her feelings for him, were played very well. The rest of the bizarre characters in the store were perfect because they tried to combine them. The most touching scene, however, was a young couple in the house of his great-grandfather. I was laughing in part, I was crying in some and I liked watching this movie very much. In fact, I watched it about 5 times. He must definitely see romantic totalists.
