This film about two Italian brothers who came to Germany with their family is simply great! <br /> <br /> This is not an idealistic film, I would say that it shows life as it is or was in the 1960s and 1970s, when the main story takes place. The characters are very nice, but they also have "dark" sides, which means that you believe that they are real people. A great movie with great actors to show that life is not fun all the time, but that you can find happiness with "fire and passion", as the main character of Gigi would say.
