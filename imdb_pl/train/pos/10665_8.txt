As a disclaimer, I've seen this movie 5-6 times in the last 15 years and it was not until this week that I saw a musical. This allowed me to judge the film without being contaminated with what was or was not in the musical (however, it stung me when I watched the musical :)) Actually, I believe that Michael Douglas worked quite well in this role, together with Kasey. I think her "Let me dance for you scene" is one of the best parts of the movie, worth adding compared to the musical. The dancers and singing in the film are much better than the musical, as well as the cast, which is at least 10 times larger (it's easier to do in the movie of course). Decors, lighting, dancing and singing are also much better in the film, what you should expect and have actually been delivered. <br /> <br /> The songs that were common with the musical are better made in the film, the new ones are pretty good, and the whole movie just delivers more than a musical, in my opinion, especially compared to a musical that has several decors . The only bad point of the film are obvious cuts between talking actors and named singers during part of singing for some characters, but their dance is impeccable and the end product was more enjoyable than a musical
