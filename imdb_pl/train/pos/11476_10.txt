Day zero is based on a massacre in high school. and his movie diary of two boys. at first you do not know what will happen, you think it's just a bad student movie. until they start talking about the horrible things they're going to do in this pretty school. until they talk about bombs and guns and shoot at the forest. they talk a lot about this movie. everybody knows that this movie is a good movie you forgot about, watching a movie and watching a real movie made by two boys. <br /> <br /> both boys behave as if they were in a strange cult. they burn everything there. like games at dvds book stations, housework, school stuff. these two boys can be your friends, brothers or people you see walking down the street. goes through everyday activities (and this is the making of a gun.) In the films that they make, he mentions the intimidation that happens to them and how people say things about clothes and what they pack in, I do not say well, but many people do such things. <br /> <br /> and this is with the fact that people suspect that they like it, because of the delicate theme they chose in this movie. <br /> <br /> this is my review on day zero. <br /> <br /> and let's say that the final scene of shooting is collapsed.
