The original DeMille movie was made in 1938 with Frederic March. Very good movie. The Hollywood love of remix brings us quite an interesting movie with Yula Brynner. Of course he was brilliant because he almost always seemed to be in all his films. Charlton Heston as Andrew Jackson was a genius. However, the film tended to be a bit longer. It does not move at the pace of the 1938 version. Still, it's a fun movie that you should see at least once.
