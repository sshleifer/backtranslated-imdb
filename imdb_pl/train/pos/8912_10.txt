I have read many comments on this site, criticizing The Blob for being cheesy and campus. The film was abandoned for amateur acting and weak special effects. What to expect from a group of people whose only experience is the production of low-budget, locally produced Christian shorts (Valley Forge PA). Let me tell those overly critical reviewers that this movie has never been so serious. This fact should be obvious on the basis of unmatched theme music, along with stupid texts played over the initial subtitles. On what was supposed to be, this movie is perfect. I've seen a few recent attempts at a very low budget, the Blair Witch Project was one of them that has absolutely no entertainment value or intelligent thought behind its story. BWP was a pure excrement. On the other hand Blob was well thought out, well-written and funny. The scene in which the old man meets a meteorite and pokes the mass contained in it with a stick, was perfectly done and really terrifying. The scene in the doctor's office with Blob slowly moving under the blanket on the stretcher while he absorbed the old woman, was a film masterpiece of horror. The bottom line is that I love this movie. I challenge everyone who took $ 120,000, inflated to today's dollar, and make a movie that's almost as fun and as successful as Blob. It simply can not be done. DOT! <br /> <br /> Thank you for taking the time to read this review.
