Good story and excellent animation. The influence of Frazetty and Bakshi is obvious and good. Anyone who likes Conan the Barbarian or the Dungeons and Dragons game should enjoy it. The fight between good and evil is clear, although it may seem that sometimes our hero is neutral. Most often in the fantasy movies Elves are usually depicted as having white skin, and blond hair, goblins and orcs have dark skin and hair. Anyone who knows the work of Frazetta, Bakshi, and even Tolkien knows that they are not racists. Anyone who likes fantasy films should like this film. It is not intended for small children due to violence and sexual innuendos. The cast was well done, and the scenes and music are paramount. I hope that soon someone will put this gem on DVD. I consider myself lucky that I have a copy of VHS in good condition.
