I think that many people have written this as another of Tom Cruise's strange films (Magnolia, Eyes Wide Shut), but Vanilla Sky is definitely his own movie. Many people said it was strange; it was not. It was different and confusing, but not strange. Strange is Stanley Kubrick or Pauly Shore. Another is The Truman Show. The Matrix or The Game is misleading. And unlike Kubrick, this movie has its own conclusion. Everything makes sense - maybe not right away, maybe not even today, but it will make sense. Vanilla Sky is misleading because David Aames (Tom Cruise) is confused. That's it. That's where the so-called "bizarreness" appeared, which caused the critics to leave. If they wanted to "open their eyes" as the original film from Spain in 1997, they would have seen it. And if it's not enough to see it, go to the music. Cameron Crowe offers a great soundtrack; uses it to set "feel" - this familiar element that many movies miss. In songs such as "Good Vibrations" The Beach Boys, playing in the dramatic and emotional climax of the film, creates an unusual, but amazingly "right" feeling. A great movie, in the script, music, acting and paintings, Vanilla Sky is unfortunately a superficial fashion film critics criticize to seem intelligent. Excellent: A +
