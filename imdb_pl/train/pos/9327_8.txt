I write this after seeing The Perfect Son at the Gay and Lesbian Film Festival in Sydney in 2002. In Sydney, Australia. <br /> <br /> When their father dies, two beloved brothers meet at the funeral and after discovering it. with brothers dying of AIDS, they embark on a heartfelt journey of reconciliation. Both are doing a great job of creating gradual warmth and respect that arises between them as the film progresses. However, I have a certain talent for the movie - while the dying brother behaves badly, he does not look at it. A person with 0 T4 cells would look bad - even working on make-up did not make the actor look sick. A small problem, but one that makes it a bit less realistic. Despite this one minor problem, The Perfect Son is a great movie and should have a chance to see it. I hope to release the DVD in the near future!
