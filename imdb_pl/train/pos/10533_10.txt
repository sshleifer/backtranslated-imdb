I totally agree that "Nic" is a fantastic movie! I have not been laughing so much while watching a movie for ages! and David Hewlett and Andrew Miller are fantastic! they work really well with each other! This movie may not appeal to some people (I can not really say why without corruption!), But each of them alone! I really liked it and I highly recommend it! <br /> <br /> The director is great and some shots are very clever. It looks like they could have fun while filming! <br /> <br /> Although there are only 2 main characters in the film and there are not many props that actors can take care of to make the movie enjoyable.
