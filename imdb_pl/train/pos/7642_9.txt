It really was not a big cash draw, but I was happy to surprise <br /> <br /> with this movie. James "I did a few things for Farrah Fawcett" Orr <br /> <br /> co-author and director of this film about an ordinary average guy Larry Burrows, who thinks his life would be <br /> <br /> amazingly different if he got homerun in a key baseball game <br /> <br /> when he was 15 years old. But thanks to the mysterious and magical barman <br /> <br /> Mike, Larry has his wish, but he soon realizes that his new life <br /> <br /> is not exactly what he hopes. <br /> <br /> I must say that this movie really impressed me. The critics gave him a mix <br /> <br /> and I have to admit that the concept is really interesting and well done. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's a small standard, but it contains enough <br /> <br /> fun moments, a drama and a great game to make it really <br /> <br /> good. James Belushi (I think) was an Oscar worth his role. Jon <br /> <br /> Lovitz is perfect, and Linda Hamilton and Renee Russo shine in <br /> <br /> their roles. Michael Caine is perfect as a bartender. To <br /> <br /> just a good movie with a good lesson. If you have never seen, <br /> <br /> I highly recommend you check
