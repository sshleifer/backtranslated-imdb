Deathtrap acts like a movie about who has what he did to someone, because it happens mainly in one plan. The assumption is that a talented playwright, whose star falls, receives a wonderful manuscript from a former student, so he plans to take off his protégé and adjust his play to the (loud) protests of his wife. Or you think in the first half of the movie. Behind the half mark, Deathtrap begins to throw turns and surprises that turn his assumption over his head, then around and then in a crazy rotation, all the while holding the right title. This is a great mysterious movie imbued with wit. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine, as a senior playwright, plays in this movie - a somewhat bizarre and very dramatic Briton. No surprises - he does his usual good job. He gets the best Deathtrap line he performs excellently: "What is your definition of success, being gang-banged in a state prison?" <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Christopher Reeve juggles comedy and drama in a surprisingly powerful performance ambitious (and psychopathic) of a young playwright. He can also show his very subdued body, which he had to keep from Superman films. <br /> <br /> Caine and Reeve have collaborated in another film, which is one of my favorite comedies - Noises Off. Similarly, it revolves around art, although Caine is the director this time, and Reeve is an actor. They were joined by comic veterans Carol Burnett, John Ritter, Marilu Henner (Taxi) and Mark Linn-Baker (Perfect Strangers). Together, they demonstrate the disasters that meet the cast and the team jumping from the bed. At first glance, the movie looks mostly slapstick, but looking at it, it turns out that it's a lot of subtle jokes that require more than one viewing. I would like this underestimated movie to be available on DVD.
