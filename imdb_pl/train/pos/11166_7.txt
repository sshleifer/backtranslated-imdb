George Raft as Steve Brodie, a carefree, dancing gambler who can never deny courage, is opposed to tormenting, sentimental Chuck Connors (Wallace Beery). Soft to the touch for every trader, Connors impulsively adopts waifs and boggies, especially the escaping orphan "Swipes" (Jackie Cooper, along with kittens!) And homeless Lucy Calhoun, from the city innocent with the ambition of becoming a writer. <br /> <br /> In this culture-dominated culture, communication takes place mainly in the form of violence (you can see why THE BOWERY is Martin Scorsese's favorite). The exploding cigars provide a gag. "Swipes" likes to throw stones through the windows in Chinatown, by the way lighting up the laundry. (The simultaneous arrival of volunteer firefighters Brodi and Beery leads to a brawl, during which the building burns to the ground.) Beery casually breathes a troublesome girl and hits anyone who disagrees with him, including Brody, whom he defeats, the night struggle at fist on the moored barge to regain control of his salon, a lost bet that Brodie will not have the courage to jump off Brooklyn Bridge. (Brodie makes a jump, but only because the trick with the mannequin fails in the last moment.) <br /> <br /> As usual, Walsh fills the frame with details, illustrating the taste of the sirloin's daily life; singing waiters, intimidating bartenders, whores from Suicide Hall fell into Black Maria, tailors gathering unfortunate people from the street and forcing them to buy suits they do not want. A small but admirable little movie.
