I caught this film late at night on the cable and was pleasantly surprised. I can only imagine why this movie was not better known because the subject is very disturbing. But if you cope with the topic of sexual abuse, it is a well-functioning, full of tension and very interesting movie. Both Richard Gere and Claire Daines are very good at it. And although the topic is not intended for people with weak hearts, the movie does not go out of being brutal (for example 8 mm). <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it to anyone who likes the serial killer and suspense films.
