It is such a joy to observe this intriguing project. So refreshing and educational. Not just a filmmaker who can find out what can be achieved within 5 minutes of the screen time, but also as an audience that may not be so loving enough in such a short time. <br /> <br /> 20 short films about love in Paris are unique, but some of them, as expected, stand out. I thought that the Tom Tykwer (Natalie Portman) segment was the best, although the mimes made me smile in the same way. <br /> <br /> I clicked on the "spoilers" option of this review bus ... read this spoiler enough. Just watch. Do not read what I write, but watch the movie instead. <br /> <br /> And smile.
