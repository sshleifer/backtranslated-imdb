This film is inspiring for anyone who is or has been in a difficult cavity, both financially and emotionally. You will definitely laugh, which is the best medicine! :) Left in a bad financial situation, when her husband dies, Grace must find a new way to make money and it is not completely legal, which adds humor. Even my boyfriend liked it, so do not think it's chick-flic.
