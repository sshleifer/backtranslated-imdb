This star Alec Guinness is a very good funny political satire in the corporate industry, as well as a light eccentric character study. <br /> <br /> The pace is a bit slow in the case of comedy, and none of them is really rolling. type on the floor funny, maybe with the exception of sound effects for experiments. But he has his funny moments and is very clever in the implementation. The segment of large explosions is probably the most farce element. <br /> <br /> The union procedures are quite perverse, very similar to I AM ALL LEGAL; especially the feminist socialist with a slight romantic infatuation with the figure of Guinness. Political machinations actually lead this story. Ernest Thesigner is very known as heavy. <br /> <br /> I do not think this one works as well as THE LADYKILLERS, KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS; but even Ealing's light comedy is better than nothing.
