Charles Boyer is supposed to be a Spaniard and came to London to buy coal in the "Confidential Agent," a film from 1945 with Lauren Bacall, Katina Paxinou, Peter Lorre, Dan Seymour and Wanda Hendrix. Boyer is Luis Denard and everyone wants to stop him, except for Bacall. His documents are stolen, accused of murder, but he is determined to get coal for his people so that they can fight against the fascists. <br /> <br /> This movie has its good and not very good sides. High prices for the atmosphere and tension, and this is very fun. Bacall is amazingly beautiful, Boyer is full of passion, Paxinou means, Lorre is sloppy, Hendrix is ​​pathetic enough, and Seymour is outrageous. <br /> <br /> Not so good points: Bacall is supposed to be an Englishman, and Boyer Spaniard. Oh no. Boyer is great in his role even with the wrong accent, but Bacall is 100% American, not British upper class. They both do not have chemistry. Conclusion: Bacall is in a sense incorrect. Her acting also does not make sense; is better in other movies. But she is a surprisingly looking woman and you can forgive a lot. <br /> <br /> Paxinou is close and hateful. Dan Seymour almost steals the entire movie as a hotel guest who explores human nature. It's a great part, and his performance is perfect, and some of the other actors are not so good. It was certainly a case of small parts, only small actors. Seymour was not a small actor. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing even with its disadvantages.
