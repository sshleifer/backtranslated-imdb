I really liked this movie about the relationships that were sometimes created between American soldiers and Japanese women in post-war Japan - as well as the obstacles that created prejudices for them. Brando goes from contempt for the Japanese (which is natural, considering WW2) to fall in love with a Japanese woman and the desire to marry her. His performance is fine (I'm not a big fan of his acting style) and the movie is wonderful. Red Buttons received an Oscar for the moving performance of another GI who falls in love with Japan (although the Japanese women who play alongside him also did an amazing job). <br /> <br /> I do not want to mess it up but the movie is good to watch with a box of tissues. <br /> <br /> This movie can say SOMETHING and be funny at the same time. A mostly underestimated gem.
