Most people know Paul Verhoeven as the director of many good (and bad) sci-fi movies in Hollywood. But he had beaten generic thrillers in his homeland long ago. History is the basic premise of femme fatale, nothing new or fascinating. Verhoeven thinks he can do it better by adding a series of dream sequences that, instead of defining our main character and his situation, are used as a way to accelerate the predictable story. The script was solid, dialogue helped us spoil the effects of bland history. What really made the movie good, it was great acting. Jereone Krabbe was amazing as a "tortured artist" and the supporters were also very good. In addition, Jan De Bont's pictures give the film at least some life, helping to make Verhoeven look at least as a director. <br /> <br /> 2 / * * * *
