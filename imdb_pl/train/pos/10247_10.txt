This movie is forbidden in almost every foreign country I think about. The Japanese (?), Who play in this, had to be really desperate in looking for a job, or we are just friends. Here's the scoop: <br /> <br /> Three thugs torture the helpless helpless woman, use all sorts of things to finally kill her, burn her, kick her, spin her in a chair (over 200 times!), Use sound torture ( forcing her to listen to static sound for more than 20 hours! This does not sound bad at all, but MAY make you nervous.) They throw in her insides (probably from an animal) while she is knocked out, and she goes crazy when she wakes up. And who can forget about the grand final of the GREAT FOOTBALL TORT I WATCHED! <br /> <br /> If you have not heard of these movies and are watching them without knowing the simulated snuff movie, you think! (just ask Charlie Sheen) That guarantees that people will go crazy and get sick! As I said, clean underground. Check it out if you're a fan of underground horror or foreign gore. If not, I highly recommend reading the series before watching! Gore, shock and creativity gets 10, but with the story and all of it it's 1. Underground classic ... <br /> <br /> My final rating is 8/10 <br /> <br />
