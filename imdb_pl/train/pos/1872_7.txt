Not seeing the movie in the original theatrical release, I was joyfully surprised when the DVD appeared, because this movie did not have the wide distribution it deserved. <br /> <br /> Denzel Washington's directorial debut and the finished product have nothing to envy other films with the same subject of more talented directors. The film has a very professional appearance. It shows that Mr. Washington has learned a lot on the other side of the camera. He brings a different point of view to this film. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about the film is undoubtedly the excellent performance of Derek Luke. He is an actor who, with the right tips, will go far, without a doubt. His approach to a restless young man, at this point in his life, in chaos and suffering because of the bad life of his hands, has so far been inflicted on him, is very true. His Antwone is a great portrait of a man in pain, which is basically very good and has so much to offer, but no one seems to see this side of his character. <br /> <br /> In the worst moment of his despair, Antwone is sent to Dr. Davenport, played by Mr. Washington, in a very sober, though in some way subdued way. Because of anxiety at Antwone, he longs for the possibility of opening up to the man who wants to help, but because of the restrictions imposed on his office, he just three sessions, and then he must release the patient. <br /> <br /> Things work because Antwone is able to convince the doctor to continue working with him. The Antwone past is revealed in detail. The violence she suffers at the hands of Mrs. Tate, his adopted mother, is at least brutal. The attempt of an elderly woman at the Tate home for sexual harassment gives Antwone the bitter taste that remains with him throughout his adult life because he has been hurt by the shame he brings. <br /> <br /> Antwone finally finds love with Cheryl, who is patient enough to make him see another world through the love she and the support he gives him. <br /> <br /> Lead protrusions are really very good. Dr Davenport Denzel Washington also has its problems. He is also not a happy camper. Antwone can help, but he can not help himself or his relationship with his adoring wife. <br /> <br /> The talent in the film is amazing. Joy Bryant is doing great Cheryl. Novella Nelson, who is a great actress, is wonderful as Mrs. Tate, abusing her adopted mother. <br /> <br /> Reuniting Antwone with his unknown family is a bit too sweet and sentimental, but of course, if you believe that Fisher finally finds happiness, you also have to accept this part of the movie.
