Starlift is a pleasant and interesting phrase for all stellar musical images that each studio spent during World War II. When you have stars like Gary Cooper, James Cagney, Doris Day, Gordon MacRae and Randolph Scott etc. in the movie. And with people like Gershwin Brothers, Cole Porter, Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn delivering music, it's an easy-to-make movie. And the plot is not even an obstacle. <br /> <br /> What is the story behind the two Air Force soldiers, Dick Wesson and Ron Hagerthy, trying to meet the Warner Brothers star Janice Rule, using as a trick the fact both come from Youngstown, Ohio, and Hagerthy's father was a dentist at Rule, and also half of the city. The scheme works too well because Louella Parsons soon places it as an element in his column. Yes, Louella is in the movie too. She must have liked Warner Brothers, and Jack Warner had more to satisfy her needs than other studio bosses, because she used the studio to publicize her Hollywood Hotel radio program during the day. <br /> <br /> But the rest of the plot also touched real efforts of Ruth Roman, who also played to make a studio and other concerts at the bases of the Air Force for soldiers and women going to Korea. Some of the names I have mentioned and others are singing and appearing in the Travis Air Force program, where a lot of this movie has been shot. <br /> <br /> One special issue has been made for Phil Harris' talents who sing / tell the ballad Look Out Stranger, I'm A Texas Ranger assisted and assisted by Virginia Gibson, Frank Lovejoy and Gary Cooper. Yes, Cooper looked like he had a great old time joking about his image. <br /> <br /> This is the oldest stereotype when you say you do not like them anymore, but not really because you do not have a studio system that includes all of these talents under the contract. This is one of the reasons for the fall of the old studio system that we can mourn.
