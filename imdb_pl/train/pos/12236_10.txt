I saw this movie in 1959, when I was 11 years old at the cinema with my family. <br /> <br /> Then I thought it was very funny. . . even though I was too young to understand 90% of what makes this great movie so much fun! I saw it this morning at "Turner South". When I watched this, I was completely stunned by laughter! "The Mating Game" is a unique classic from the past century. If you're too young to experience the charming period in the story that produced this movie, I'm sorry. It is not possible to watch such films and understand how they can (even today) deliver such a wonderful piece of sky to "old watches" like me. <br /> <br /> Having said that, all I can do is respectfully ask that younger people refrain from commenting on films such as "The Mating Game". <br /> <br /> Films like those were created for the generation that preceded the current group of your people. Therefore, these films speak a different language than any of you understand. <br /> <br /> In other words? if you do not understand the problems with the film, do not be embarrassed by offering comments that? honestly ?? does not make sense.
