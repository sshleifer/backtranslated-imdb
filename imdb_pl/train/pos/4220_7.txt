This is the one where diminutive Ruth Gordon plays the author of Agatha-Christie murders, which closes her nephew through marriage in a safe. Gordon thinks he murdered her niece, and the young man dies from strangulation, while Gordon travels to New York. However, he manages to leave some hints, scratches on a few black safes and an improvised and well-hidden note. Columbo enters the matter, suspects it immediately and solves the puzzle, simply using its supernatural mystic intuitive powers. Oh, and Mariette Hartley is on hand as Gordon's secretary and a would-be blackmailer. Hartley is, I believe, the great daughter of psychologist B. F. Skinner. I'm not sure if her ancestors had anything to do with her attractive navel, which is displayed during the belly dance sequence, but I've always admired Skinner. <br /> <br /> Murder is well treated. It's a good plot, and none of the performers or crew will let anything go. But the outstanding figure here is Ruth Gordon, only skosh with a height of over five feet. She was over 80 years old and looked. There are times when it almost staggered, but it consistently exudes charm. Her acting is idiosyncratic. You can never be sure when it's serious or when it puts Columbo and the audience. She also gave some good lines. What is the humor of Gordon. Columbo does not have any frequent comic moments. <br /> <br /> All in all, a good job for everyone interested.
