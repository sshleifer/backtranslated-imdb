I desperately need it on tape, not on DVD, and soon! <br /> <br /> I have one nephew who is in the infantry, but has not yet deployed, although he left for Iraq shortly after December 2008. I lost my beloved half-son in Ramadi Iraq 9-15-05 from an unmanned bullet in the green zone. I have another nephew who joins the army as soon as he graduates from high school this spring because, like his older brother, he has an idealized and romantic idea of ​​what is in the military. My stepson died after only 10 days in the country and he never left for any missions, so my nephews have no way of referring to any of the experiences shown in this sincere document of any kind of personal experience that may have been passed down by my deceased son. <br /> <br /> I can do nothing with those who are, and now they have gone, but I have one who did not raise his hand and was sworn in. I desperately want him to be so informed, none of them did. <br /> <br /> Please help me with this. <br /> <br /> The documentary film The Ground Truth is the best visual reference I have ever seen. I must somehow let my youngest nephew see what he is getting into before it's too late. BUT: (do not laugh) I NEED my mother to see it first. He must actually see and hear these men and women, not just their idea, but the truth about what they will be submerged in, perhaps forever. Then she will have an emotional determination to force my brother to watch the movie, and when he does, he can then make his son, my youngest nephew, watch him. Then my nephew can start taking it seriously. <br /> <br /> ((is there another time when it will be shown on TV? If so, please tell me when?))) <br /> <br /> However, my mother is not a problem DVD player, I still use the video (is it correct? With tapes?) So I have to find a way to watch this movie. Can I buy it from anyone in this form? If not, is there any other way to get it in the form of a tape from anyone? Is there any legitimate link from which I can pay to download it to my computer and then send it to the tape. If so, who should I contact? I am willing to pay for the privilege, provided it is a legal link. <br /> <br /> Or, if you have any alternative ideas, I will consider everything you can suggest. <br /> <br /> Help me, I have already lost a very precious and beloved person, I already know that my oldest nephew will never be the same when he comes back, and I can lose him too. I can not lose three, and the emotional harvest for all those who come back is too high a price to pay for every male child in my family of this generation. Please help me. I am happy to call you, write me a number, if this is the best way to get the information you need. Thank you very much for all the help you can offer. <br /> <br /> Sincerely, Lori Swanberg l.swanberg@yahoo.com
