When I think about this film, all the adjectives that come to my mind refer to the physical assessment of the world. Texture, smell, color, I think that this film should be evaluated in terms. See the rich golden tones surrounding a young concubine sleeping by the fireplace or a hot Turkish bath, and let it flood the senses with the sensations of spices, rough fabric, smooth skin, fragrant oils, flickering flames, satin rustling. Do not look back and listen or be absorbed, let the narrator's buzzing voice hypnotize you.
