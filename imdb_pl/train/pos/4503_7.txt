This crazy and funny shortcut from 1916 - a time in which Charlie Chaplin and Fatty Arbuckle were great comedy names - presents young Oliver Hardy as ne'er-do-well, who must quickly impress his rich uncle, producing a wife and darling for his visit. <br /> <br /> Of course it does not go smoothly and soon there are more wives and children to deal with; plus mandatory chases and misunderstandings that are the hallmark of the early movie slapstick. <br /> <br /> A well restored film can be viewed as part of Oliver Hardy's Early Films and is now available on DVD, a great addition to the available body of your favorite comedy duet on the big screen.
