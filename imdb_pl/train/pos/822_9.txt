The last film in Lucas's saga is sumptuous, spectacular production. Often this is considered an ugly duckling of the original trilogy, but I think that this is a section above the IV section (and only a section below sections III and V). In fact, I think this is the third best movie in the six-part saga. As for me, it is still an extremely funny movie. This is not a film with a beginning, culmination and ending; the film's mechanism works only for one purpose: to bring it to the close in the universe of Lucas. The whole combines the finality, which makes the film a bit too sentimental, but emotionally satisfying. Besides, it's great fun. New characters are being introduced, and the old are facing new, unexpected challenges. C3PO and R2D2 provide (as usual) great comic relief. Leia and Solo are a great romantic duo, and Luke is still a great character that you can identify with. Again, the internal conflict between Luke (and Vader) gives her sheath her spine. Lucas' aggressive imagination is still very visible, and the motives of loyalty, hope and redemption in the film strongly resonate. I am glad that Lucas finally resigned from the episodes VII, VIII and IX, because this movie is a great book for a long, fascinating and captivating saga. This is not the perfect movie, but the fun in the best matin√©e style.
