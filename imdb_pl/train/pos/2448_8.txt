Yes, this is more than that, yes, it's a bit banal and yes, Constance Marie is a total love and worth seeing again and again! Jokes and gags can become old and repetitive after a while, but the program is still cool to watch. Because it is a family program, humor is subdued, and the authors have introduced family values ​​and ideals between gags. <br /> <br /> George Lopez is funny. Do not take it seriously, and the program is the winner. I'm sure he did not want his character to be serious or the pattern of virtue. His bursts and cheers are fun ... <br /> <br /> I must say that Benny is one big, dark, bitter place. I hate the character ... so much so that every time it's turned on for more than 30 seconds, I mute the TV so I do not have to hear it. There is nothing funny about her dialogue or jokes. As a mother, she must be the worst, and I'm just shocked and surprised that George, as a character, would stand for such a deplorable person for so long. <br /> <br /> Even if I'm ticking at any moment At the sight of Benny, I think: seeing her is much better than watching Bill Engvall's show. Now he is a bad sitcom ...
