I have seen this film many times and it will never tire it. It's a classic in every sense of the word. The film is hysterically funny and at the same time quite touching. For those of you who are not fans of "subtitles" or generally foreign film, open your mind. This is a great movie for a "beginner" because the story is so funny. Do not get me wrong, it's 100% Japanese (and that makes it work), but everyone will get something out of it (even if it's a great laughter of one of the main characters, Mr. Aoki - one of the funniest characters I've ever seen !) <br /> <br /> I can not even think about this movie without a smile !! I love it ... and I think most people will do it too.
