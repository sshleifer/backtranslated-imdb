Bettie Page was an icon of the repressed 1950s when she represented sexual freedom, which was just a decade ago, but high in the hopes and dreams of many teenagers and young adults. Gretchen Mol is doing a great job presenting a scandalous Bettie, a girl from a small town with an acting ambition and a great body. Her acting career never went anywhere, but her body led her to the height of fame in the margins. Photographed in black and white with colorful interludes, when he emerges from the world of exploitation in New York, this film made for television (HBO) has good production values ​​and a very reliable cast. The problem is that it is emotionally flat. It is difficult to get attached to the character because Bettie is portrayed as quite shallow and naïve, considering the interest in which she found herself. Self-assessing government investigations have a lot of time on the screen, which slows down the movie at the end. But it is definitely worth seeing the history of this time and seeing the heavy government repression that was characteristic of the 1950s. 7/10
