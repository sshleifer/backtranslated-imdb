Michelle Rodrigez was created for this movie when I first saw her in "Fast and the Furious." You could say she was a tough woman. Thanks to this film she proved not only her acting, but also does not show fear and is hard, as it should be in this film. She is a bad girl and I like her in it. This film is about a restless girl who lives like a boy and has constant problems with school and family. When she is interested that her brothers are training a boxer, he decides to go for his love to fight and asks his brother's trainer to train her. Even if they do not think they have the potential, it turns out that they are proven to be wrong. <br /> <br /> I think this movie was a bit slow at the end, but it was well done. It shows that people can do anything, even if they do not think you have potential. I recommend that you see it.
