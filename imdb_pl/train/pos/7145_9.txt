This movie had a great group of adult actors along with a cast of young actors who will be in the movies for a long time if there is any justice. The direction and editing were great. I can check the book from which it was adapted, it had to be great. (I liked it.) Sigourney Weaver, Jon Voight and Tim Blake Nelson were impressed! Henry Winkler and Nathan Davis were not seen enough, but they were funny when they were on the screen. Children in the camp could not be better. (as I said, I liked it!)
