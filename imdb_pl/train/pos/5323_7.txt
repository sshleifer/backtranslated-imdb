There are many things that are not correct, although it is not very important, because what happened to who and when is still in dispute. The most blatant liberty with the facts I think when they start playing Kaiserkeller Bruno Koschmidder when they actually played in Indra and moved to Kaiserkeller later. <br /> <br /> I agree with Semprinni20 that the film was biased in favor of the Pete Best version, but if it is a story consultant, I think it's called shots. I also agree with Semprinni that Pete Best recordings are playing the last word about why he was fired. <br /> <br /> Although the movie is not as sumptuous as the later movie "Backbeat", I prefer this movie because it is more accurate and because it has a better script with deeper characteristics. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of significant movies in the movie - like Brian Epstein trying to hide the fact that he was a "freak" just to find out that the band knew he was Gay all the time. Small accents, such as a team entering the cafe and ordering "Corn-Flakes mit Milch". My favorite scene, which in fact has some frames, is that at the audition Stuart Sutcliffe just bought his bass guitar, but he can not play it, so he stands with his back to the impresario and tries to pretend to be caught. It's rock 'n' roll. <br /> <br /> It's worth watching.
