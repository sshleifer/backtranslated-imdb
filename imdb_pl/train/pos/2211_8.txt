I do not watch a lot of television, with the exception of The Office, Weeds, Entourage and E! 'S Soup. I think I keep this concert in good company. <br /> <br /> I love the scathing review of pop culture that gives this program. The soup also helps me keep up to date with what people in the office say about Sanjaya or Heidi Montag (sp?). <br /> <br /> The best thing is that Soup shows the clips of these most important concerts, which are usually the funniest or most controversial moments (come on, most people get into watching American Idol because of the freaks show that are auditions), which is why most people say they watch. This means that I do not have to suffer from the remaining 98% of these mind-boggling minds of talk shows or "reality" programs, because one nugget is "funny" or "shocking". The only reason why Soup does not get 10, in my opinion, is the time that sketches are not so funny, and even in rare cases, the comment is not always on par. But not everyone can be at home, if so, Soup would not be on E! <br /> <br /> A quick joke by Joel and a team of Soup writers (including McHale) are a great show. I happen to enjoy the laughter and comments of the crew who are out of the camera. Even if they are clearly blatant, giving occasional courtesies, they laugh because it is forced. Apparently they are ironic. And that's part of what makes this series fun.
