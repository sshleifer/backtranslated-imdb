question: how to steal the scene from expert experts stealing scenes Walther Mathau in full, angry and genius mode Grumpy Old Man? answer: quiet, unceremoniously and with perfect timing, as George Burns does. <br /> <br /> I do not know anything about Vaudeville, but it remains a favorite movie, the two leads are fun, the script funny, the direction and the pace very well. Richard Benjamin is very funny as an ordinary man - he tries to get to Burns through the window, etc. Even small parts are great. <br /> <br /> There are so many funny scenes, Mathau destroys the advertisement, Burns repeats his answers like starcze ... <br /> <br /> Delight. <br /> <br /> Enterrrrrr!
