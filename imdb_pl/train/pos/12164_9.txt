In a year of pretentious mud, such as "Synecdoche, New York", a film born of Charlie Kaufman's self-indulgence, a film appears that is equally difficult to watch, but about three times more important. "Frownland" is a work of love of the crew, actors and filmmaker, shot through years by friends. He follows a man who can not communicate through his completely authentic, TRUE world of Brooklyn. The people you see are one step beyond the stylization of the "mumblecore" movement. They are real people, painfully trapped in their own independent neuroses, reluctant to change, unable. The real world is for them a set of delusions, and because it is a film about people who are so deeply absent, it is very difficult to see them. This is 16 mm filming without the right light, money or any other factor that would make the film "slippery", but its sincerity can not be understated, which would make a room full of people reject it and for Richard Linklater to award him a prize, as in SXSW. This is similar to films like "Nagi" or the best "mumblecore". It is a movie that is not for everyone, but which provokes watching and growing up, the longer you think about it.
