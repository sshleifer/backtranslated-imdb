"Inspirational" stories about the "triumph of the human spirit" are usually a big failure for me. The most surprising thing about MEN OF HONOR is how much I liked it despite me. The film is as predictable and as covered as possible, but it works. A lot of merit for the joyful performances of both leaders. This is an excellent role for Cuba Gooding, Jr., who is wonderfully restrained here. We expect a lot from De Niro and it does not disappoint. He creates a darkly funny portrait. Director George Tillman, Jr. he set out to make an old-fashioned movie and wins.
