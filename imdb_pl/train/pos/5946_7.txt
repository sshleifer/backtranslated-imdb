"World Finest" is a unique project. This is the trailer of the Superman / Batman crossover movie that does not exist and will never exist, at least not in this form, with these characters, actors and plot. <br /> <br /> So the movie is one big malice, even more than the standard everyday movie trailers. The trailer will arouse anxiety in you. In this respect, I really did not like this short project. When you watch this trailer, you are hungry and excited all the more, and sad at the same time - and you may even feel cheated later, when it turns out that the full-length feature film of this trailer will never exist. In a sense, you are wondering why this project was made in the first place. Certainly boast about the skills of Sandy Collor, but could not do it with a short movie, such as his earlier movie "Batman: Dead End." <br /> <br /> But when you need to judge this shortcut, it's purely what it is, so from a technical point of view the movie is really great. It looks great and is much more professional than you would expect at the beginning, although people who have already seen "Batman: Dead End" will already know better than expect a short one with cardboard sets, cheap home costumes and third rate actors. The short is not impressive and of course the budget was not high, but most of it is very impressive and professional looking, with nice costumes, sets, special effects, cinematography and lighting. <br /> <br /> Short has a good, fast and typical way of building trailers, with perhaps too many shots that are completely convincing, but hey, it works well in the style of a trailer. He has several impressive shots, but also some lame, mostly flying superman sequences. It was obvious that the guy was just in a moving car with a camera aimed at him from below. I even thought it was a funny thing. But really better and more spectacular moments really compensate. <br /> <br /> Michael O'Hearn seemed pretty good Superman / Clark Kent, although apparently he is not the greatest talented actor. Clark Bartram again returns to the role of Batman, and Kurt Carley seemed like an amazing Lex Luthor. The rest of the cast has also served its purpose well. <br /> <br /> It is particularly interesting to watch this shortly after the latest new contemporary reinterpretations of the two main superheroes of this film, in the films "Batman Begins" and "Superman returns". It is interesting to compare the style and way of treating these films with this one. It's amazing and fun to hear how much Kurt Carley sounds like Kevin Spacey, the actor who played Lex Luthor in "Superman Returns". <br /> <br /> It's a good looking and well-made trailer that will make you hungry anymore, even if you know there will not be more. What happened to Waner Bros. are planning to create a real Superman / Batman movie on the occasion? I thought that a few years ago work on this project was underway, but since then nothing was heard about it. Instead, two new separate Batman and Superman films were created; "Batman Begins" and "Superman Returns". <br /> <br /> 7/10
