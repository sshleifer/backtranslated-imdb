When I watch a low-budget movie, I know what to expect. I expect the game will not be as good (for budgetary reasons), I expect the lighting will not be as good (for budgetary reasons). Stop judging these low-budget movies like a big budget movie !!! I am a filmmaker myself, so I understand the budget constraints associated with low-budget film. The theft of locations, photos, etc. ... the list goes on. I do not want to say that all the acting was bad. Jose Rosete, Chris Angelo, Victor Zaragoza are good. Raul Martinez is natural. Not yet sold on Carl Washington. He must understand that each line is not important, some are ejection lines. I say that if the movie makes you want to see what happens next, it's a good movie. I liked the movie. I gave it to him. 8. I wanted to see what would happen next. Great job Brothers Quiroz!
