A few days ago I realized that the creators of this movie put a word game in the title. This film is not primarily about the act of "horse giants", but above all about people who are sport giants, RIDING giants, to change the pressure. <br /> <br /> At the age of several years I lived in a block of wedge, one of the most difficult and the best places for bodysurfing in the world. I was in the surf from 15 to 18 feet, I rode and was repeatedly hit by waves of 10 and 12 feet. This experience makes me delighted with the surfers of this film. The idea that Jeff Clark, it seems, a normal mortal, could have escaped thanks to Maverick BY HIMSELF for over ten years, is out of my reach. The first safety principle in any water sport is "Never surf / swim / swim alone". He went where healthy people did not want and lived to tell about it. I would not go there if the water was 75 degrees and the sharks left. <br /> <br /> In the world of hot water: the first wave shot on Jaws always makes the skin crush my whole body. These are not just scary waves, but uncontrolled waves of bowel evacuation. When we see that Laird Hamilton not only experiences waves of 40 to 60 feet (I can hardly write these numbers), but in fact I work on faces like a fun day in Rincon, I'm amazed. In large-scale occupations, there is dedication and focus that is comparable to everyone in the world. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie. I gave him only 9 instead of 10, because it is not mentioned that in the world beyond the Hamilton / Kalama team there are great players of the great wave and I think that they deserve mention. Splice at Ken Bradshaw outside Log Cabins and 10 is!
