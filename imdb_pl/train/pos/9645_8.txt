"Presque rien" is a story of two young boys in love during a summer stay by the sea. I do not want to tell the story, because it's not the most important thing in this movie (but you can be sure it's interesting and original). The best part of this movie is cinematography. The visual side of "Presque rien" is so amazing that it deserves the highest rating. It leaves you captivated by the beauty. <br /> <br /> As for the story, it is shown in an uneven, rather complicated way. There is no simple chronology or an answer to all the questions the film brings. But that makes "Presque rien" even more interesting. I recommend this film to all people for whom the artistic side of the films is very important and will not be disappointed.
