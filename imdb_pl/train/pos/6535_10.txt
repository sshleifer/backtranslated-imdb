It was a great movie! Even though there were only 15 people there, including myself, it was great! My friend and I laughed a lot. My mother liked it. There were two middle-aged women and she was about 20 years old. I love the part where Corky and Ned like both Nancy and her lovely lol. And when he gets his roadster and Ned. Yes, it was a great movie, even if people did not appreciate it. Go See that I bet you'll like it !! I really enjoyed it, as did my friend. <br /> <br /> People have been so difficult in this movie and have not seen it. I bet that next time they will give the film and actresses a chance. In my opinion, everyone did a great job. But if you have young children, it is still appropriate. I will probably take my 7-year-old niece as well.
