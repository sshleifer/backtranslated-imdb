Time is the future and for many unaware this day is now. In the last film for the legendary actor Edward G. Robinson, "Solent Green" becomes a breakthrough classic. Many film lovers and ecologists believe that this is our final story. The film comes from the novel "Make room, make room", but the working title was changed to "Solent Green". The story is about the Earth, which is evolving into the future, and global environmental problems are becoming catastrophic. The planet's natural resources have been exhausted, and the basic food has been reduced to simple articles. They come in a variety of colors, such as Solent Yellow, Solent Red, and now "Solent Green". However, there are those who know the "real" component of Solent Green and are cringing at their own fault and are afraid of the divine punishment. The first is Food Director William R. Simonson (Joseph Cotton). After his death, dedicated police detective Robert Thorn (Charleston Heston) is looking for the truth behind his apparent suicide. Although corruption comes to the very beginning, it begins with the bodyguard of Simonsons, Tada Fielding (Chuck Connors) and the head of security Donnovana (Roy Jenson) who attacks Thorn on the Waste Factory. Chief Thorn, Lieutenant Hatcher (Brock Peters), believes in his suspicions, but warns him of those "taller and hot" who want to close the case, but Thorn does not risk his "work" for easy exit. What Thorn discovers means death, but like the movie, he is waiting for the last warning. ****
