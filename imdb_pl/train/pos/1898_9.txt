The father of alcoholic drummer Who, Keith Moon, was named Arthur. In this movie, I found many similarities between Dudley Moore and Keith Moon. Liza Minelli, who usually OVERACTS, did quite a good job in this role, and was able to turn Dudley Moore's cheek every turn. Yes, I agree, Sir John stole absolutely every scene. It was a very "different" movie, allowing the viewer to look at another life. We often try to catch a replay of this movie on a satellite. God, rest Dudley Moore; it was such a nice movie. A lot of satire and thumbs to rich and snobbish / prosperous. The close friendship between Moore and Sir John is rather endearing.
