This film was a disaster in the Box Office, and the reason for this is the innocence of the film, the sweetness of history. The music was good, the story is very simple and old, but the presentation of such a story is very good, the director tried his best. Abhay is exquisite and impressive, and he shines in his role again, doing what he could in a comedy or emotional scene. Soha looks so sweet in the movie. The star-resting crew was just right. Music and all songs are good, Himesh impresses here as a singer. Do not miss this movie, its a great movie and feel good to us. Abhay works best to this day. Dam 9/10 Ahista Ahista.
