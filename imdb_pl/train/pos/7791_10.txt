Another of those movies that you hear from your friends (... or read about IMDb). Few notes about this. I saw almost everything that is happening in reality with a young girl escaping from a blind town in Tennessee, Florida, with all her earthly possessions in an old beaten car. Ruby, makes them start fake, but learns from them. I wondered why, why she did not bend down a bit more on Mike's shoulder, but ... she has her reasons, as it turns out. <br /> <br /> Just a great movie. I think the only thing that I do not like is the title.
