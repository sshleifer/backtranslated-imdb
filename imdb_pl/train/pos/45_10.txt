Home Room was a great movie if you've ever had a drama in your life. It makes you want to see more. Wondering what secret Alice is hiding. I think I watched the movie six times in a row and I never lost interest. Besides, I do not usually cry over movies, but he cried every time. I would like to find more such films. All in all, I thought it was a great movie. The more you observe, the more you become part of it. The end is the part that really caught me when she cried when she received her diploma because she had her daughter's name on it. My heart felt like it just crashed. And as her new friend came to cheer her up when she did not get her. I liked it very much.
