First of all, I will be the first to admit that the scarecrow itself is a bit exaggerated. The subdued scarecrow, which may be less acrobatic, would make the movie less shoddy. But in general, I think it's one of the better B movies. Tiffany Shepis is absolutely wonderful, not to mention incredibly beautiful. Although the film lacks an important naked factor, there are a few other videos where you can watch it. But here he gets all the fever of evil, especially towards the end, when he leaves the scarecrow. Richard Elfman also does a great job as a sheriff and as a drunk boy. Yes, it's a low-budget B movie. But of all I've seen, it's definitely one of my favorites.
