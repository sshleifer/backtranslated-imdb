Eric Valette is of course a talented filmmaker, as are the two guys who wrote the script. That's why Mal√©fique is a great movie, made with just a few bucks, but also with tons of imagination. Well, I'm exaggerating a bit, but I'm honest, nevertheless. So if you like dark, bloody movies, go and see it. Really worth.
