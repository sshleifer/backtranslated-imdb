Very nice action with an interwoven story that is actually not good for nothing. Interesting that it is worth watching, and not jumping over to get to good parts. Having Jenny Jameson and Asia Carrere also helps to revive. Jenna in this sweater and these sunglasses is simply amazing! It's worth getting up just to see her!
