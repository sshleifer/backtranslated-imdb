In fact, this movie has stupid moments, both claymation parts, as well as Joe Pesci and children's parts, and is much worse than other MJ movies, such as "The Wiz", "Captain Eo" and "Ghosts". But as a die-hard fan of Michael Jackson for almost eleven years (yes, that's half my life, guys!), I can not complain about it too much. Just seeing this charming guy and listening to his great music is a trip to Heaven for me. But as a movie it's not good at all and I'm afraid that it will get a much lower rating for me if my beloved Mike was not in the lead role. But since no one except Mike is a lunatic moonwalker, he needs to get 7 out of 10 from me.
