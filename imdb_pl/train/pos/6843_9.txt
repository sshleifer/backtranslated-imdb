Screenwriter-director Brian De Palma is best known for his series of films that have been called, somewhat unjustly, "Hitchcock imitations." Contrary to popular belief, De Palma does not break Hitchcock; borrows elements of history or characters that could be seen in the Hitchcock movie, and then expands them in a more brutal, modern way. Like Hitchcock, De Palma is famous for mixing bloody death with gruesome humor. <br /> <br /> "Dressed to Kill", released in 1980, is probably the most famous Hitchcock De Palma movie, and it's probably his best. The story is about a serial killer who haunts both a burnt housewife (played by Angie Dickinson) and a prostitute from the street (played by Nancy Allen). <br /> <br /> Yes, it will clearly remind you of "Psycho", but De Palma's move is equally ingenious technically and darkly creative. The museum sequence is particularly well evaluated and edited; The scene of the elevator quarrel is also one of the most unique murders shot on the film. "Dressed to Kill" may not be a complete original, but I would say it is definitely worth your time. R evaluated 105 minutes. 9 out of 10.
