I literally prepared to hate this movie, so believe me when I say that this movie is worth seeing. In general, history and gags are invented, but the film has the charm and finesse to distract them. This gag, in which Jason Lee thinks he has crabs, and tries to prevent his boss / future father-in-law and co-workers from seeing him scratching, is not terribly intelligent, but he caused me to laugh. Not many gags from the movie are at the helm, but they made me laugh. As I said, the movie has charm and charm can go a long way. <br /> <br /> The heroes are also nice. I must say that I would like to see more of James Brolin's character because he was in the very few scenes in which he was. Plus, I admire every romantic comedy that has the courage to not make a wife (which serves as an obstacle on the plot) a total witch. Selma Blair's character is unlikely, and she never has a scene where I thought, "Why did he want to marry her at all?" The ending is Hollywood, but it could have been much better. <br /> <br /> The cast is talented. I did not have a favorable opinion on the majority of mainstream Jason Lee. I just loved him so much in Kevin Smith's films that I could not resist disappointment seeing him in these moronic roles. And it never looks comfortable in these silly roles. Even in this movie it does not look perfectly comfortable, but it brings its two cents and effectively copes with every scene. But I still miss his work in independent films. Julia Stiles proves again why she is so damn nice. Of course she is a very beautiful girl with a radiant smile that makes me want to pass out, but she also has a special charm and seems to have a good personality. In other words, her beauty shows the inside and outside. I do not know the name of actresses, but a woman who plays drunk grandma is hilarious. Julie Hagerty also has a small role, and her watching is always pleasant, which makes me want her to have better roles. I loved her so much in "Airplane" and "Lost in America" ​​that I wish I had the same opportunity to show off my skills. <br /> <br /> Do not be discouraged by horrible trailers and even more horrible box records. It's a funny, cute movie. Romantic comedies are now so predictable that it seems that the genre itself is ready to flush in the toilet, so it's always good among all those bad apples. <br /> <br /> My result: 7 (out of 10)
