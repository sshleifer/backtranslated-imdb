OK, I saw it in cinemas when it came out and I do not know why. I have not seen him since then, but I came to this site because I was thinking about this movie - I do not know why again. But the fact that I remember it says a lot. <br /> <br /> Comedy is difficult - much harder than any drama. Doing it well makes it seem easy, but doing it wrong ... is there anything worse than a bad comedy? Steve Martin, pay attention, for some reason you will be in this category again. <br /> <br /> Elvira Mistress Of The Dark had to do it well so I would remember this movie fondly. Made at a fast pace, with a pinch of salt and knowing that this is not the story of Philedelphia, he plays from beginning to end. Brain Donors is another that fits this category (without the majority of free boob jokes). <br /> <br /> One point of dispute - the ending. It seems that the screenwriters / director had no idea how to finish the comedy. The ending attempts to be a love story, somewhat undermining the bizarre quick dialogue up to this point. Then there is the "tassle" scene. While you have to see it (man's opinion), it's so over and out of place, it's like a shock. You needed one more recipe to finish. <br /> <br /> This is not a comedy genius, like Spinal Tap, The Producers or The Holy Grail. But if you do not try to analyze it and just let the play of words and pleasant fun come to you, you'll laugh, I guarantee it.
