It's a beautiful movie. A real story about the relationship between father and son. This is definitely Tom Hanks at its best. Tom Hanks is really absent in this movie. Usually, he has a nice role for a guy. However, in this film he appears in this film as a bit rough, but he still appears smelling like a rose, even to the last scene, the murder of his character. The cast of this film was well prepared. I also love the part when there is total silence when the character of Tom Hanks shoots and kills all men in Mr Rooney's group. There's something chilling in your veins, yet deep about the lack of sound in this scene, just emotions. I love the look of John Rooney, the face of the character of Paul Newman, when he realizes before he even saw him that he was the revenge of Tom Hanks and knew that his fate had come. When I first saw this movie, I was amazed and knew that I had to go out and download the movie, and since then I have added it to my collection of my favorite movies. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks is my favorite actor, so this movie has a special place for me.
