A friend lent me a DVD, which I think he received from the director at the festival. I warned that some technical aspects of the film are a bit uncertain and that the writing is good, but not great. So maybe this has colored my judgment, but I must admit that I liked the movie. <br /> <br /> Performances in which the actors. Youssef Kerkor was really good, like Ernie, the main character, a little pathetic in a nice way. Adam Jones (who also directed) and Justin Lane were excellent roommates who drive Ernie crazy. Bill's character (Justin Lane), who spends a lot of a movie dressed as a panda, was my favorite; It seemed the least one-dimensional and reminded me of an old college roommate so much that I called the guy after seeing the DVD. Really nice and very funny. Some other acts were good, some were so, but nothing was bad. I also loved the Vigilante duo. Funny and fun. <br /> <br /> It gives me high marks, although it has some problems, because you can see when you see that these people were worried about it, and decided to make your movie in their own way. Well done to Adam Jones and the crew.
