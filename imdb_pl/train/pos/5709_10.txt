This foreign film made in 1931 should be watched and enjoyed more often. <br /> <br /> We are opening ourselves in a quiet, small French village, scanning the roofs of sleeping citizens. Then we hear something that sounds like a party. After examining the hustle and bustle, two neighboring men tell the story of two men, allegedly friends, who chose two numbers for the lottery. <br /> <br /> Our star in the picture has his number and his friend is his. When he asks his friend if he shares half of the cake, if his ticket is a winning number, his friend will immediately say no. In fact H.E. double hockey sticks no! it's the way it works. <br /> <br /> So when our man discovers that he has a winning ticket and that he has been lost, not by fault of his own, he is insane. Everyone is looking for this ticket, something like the precursor of the "Great Race". Although all of this is a flashback, I was knotted all the time and I was so nervous about every little thing in this movie show-me-the-money. Watch Le Million today!
