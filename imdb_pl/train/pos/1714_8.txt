Watching the movie was in a very light mood, and this movie is light, but the end of the movie is just unexpected, which leaves long memories in mind. <br /> <br /> the film begins with Abhay and his profession of being a witness during the marriage of the registrar. Soha comes to get married, and his boyfriend does not, leaving Soha alone on the street, to which he can not go home and there is nothing to live in, in this situation Abahy turns out to be a helper for her, this is the basis of the story. <br /> <br /> The rest is just watching, and the end of the story is the bitter sweetness that Abhay has to face, which keeps you on the edge of the seat. <br /> <br /> Dialogues and music are good songs that are fine. The direction is good, and as a scenario you feel that the movie is slow, but looking at the demand for history, everything is fine. <br /> <br /> Really viewable, especially in a light mood, I liked it at home with coke and peanuts. my rating is 8/10
