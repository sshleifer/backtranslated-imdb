This film describes the life of someone who grew up in the worst circumstances, but unlike many people, he has grown into a respected person. What's more, this is a real story. <br /> <br /> Antwone Fisher is so innocent, and yet he was abused just because he was not white. Antwone Fisher has been married to the same women for ten years and has never fooled with women, coke, cigars, weeds, alcohol or other things that are very popular in the places where he grew up. <br /> <br /> There is not much else to say about this movie, it's perfect. The only rating I can give is 10/10.
