"Enter the Fat Dragon" is one of the funniest movies about martial arts that I had the opportunity to see. Sammo Hung introduces a Chinese boy from a farm who comes to visit a friend of the city. Like Tang Lung "Way of the Dragon". Wherever Sammo goes, trouble starts, so he has to rely on his martial arts skills to solve the differences. Fortunately, Sammo learns martial arts by imitating and imitating his idol, Bruce Lee. He even strokes his nose with the thumb exactly as Bruce Lee does, and he lets out screams. He also uses nunchucks in the scene. It was like watching a fat Bruce Lee. At the end of the movie is a great game in which foreign warriors take part. Sammo must meet each opponent one by one. As if "The Game of Death", where each player has a different martial art discipline from each other. <br /> <br /> This is one of the movies that I really enjoyed watching, and the first Sammo Hung movies I saw. Excellent fighting scenes and lots of laughter. A rare classic movie Sammo Hung. I highly recommend all fans of martial arts. 8.5 / 10!
