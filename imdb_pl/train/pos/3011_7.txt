One of the better films of Vance is more interested in an interesting plot and an ingenious direction than Michael Curtiz. This time around the hated financier, he was found dead - shot in his head - in his locked and bolted upstairs bedroom. Philo Vance, hearing about the situation that will soon leave for Italy, decides to end the holiday and try to solve what he thinks is a murder, and what everyone thinks about suicide. William Powell is as kind as Philo Vance. It never seems to push and it is always very smooth in what it says and does. Powell is helped by many talented actors - some of the first-class actors and actresses like Mary Astor as a niece who hated her uncle, Ralph Morgan as the secretary of the deceased, Paul Cavanaugh as a dog rival, Arthur Hohl as a mysterious butler, Helen Vinson as a neighbor, she kept blonde and two James Lee's really good performances as a Chinese cook and nimbly Eugene Palette as a wise police detective. Add the wonderful comedy phrase Etienne Girardot to the mix as a public coroner who always lacks a meal. It is this depth of suspects and the story has many threads that make The Kennel Murder Case a fast moving, funny secret.
