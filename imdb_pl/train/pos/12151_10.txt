It's simply the epitome of what a TV movie should be. It was a lazy Sunday afternoon when my wife and I were in college that we came across. Trashy acting. Badly written scenario. Good boys. A funny, but somehow obvious, banal and banal assumption. Driving lorries with a lifted wife's corpse. He has it all. <br /> <br /> You will meet familiar characters: hooligan, stupid rich boy who wants to do it alone, friends who know better, Dad who knows better but drives son. And the wife's corpse. Supported. In a pick-up. <br /> <br /> Wow: and the title. A few things in our lives have been "Texas Tragedies" since watching this beauty. Everyone involved in his creation deserves a medal.
