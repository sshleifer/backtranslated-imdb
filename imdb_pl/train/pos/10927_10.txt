This is one of my favorite kung fu movies and is considered one of Shaw's most popular brothers from the late 70's. The plot is interesting and winding, the characters are cool in their style - toad, snake, lizard etc. The action is limited compared to other Chang Cheh / Venoms movies, but what is there is interesting with different kung fu styles to display from different characters. I recommend this movie to those who think that all Shaw Brothers films, especially Chen Cheh movies, are the same, most of his films usually focus on 10 tigers and Shaolin vs. Manchurian conflicts. This film is a breath of fresh air in comparison.
