This is a strange film about an archaeologist studying the culture of ancient Hohokam Indians. He takes a mummy (really a fake) from the burial cave and brings her home to study her. Well, he's starting to behave strangely and talk to that mommy. Shortly thereafter her son is possessed by the spirit of the mummy. Even stranger events take place when the ghost tries to destroy the woman's family. In fact, it is REALLY HOPE and will make you fall asleep several times when you try to watch it. But if you stick to it, you can just get to the end. <br /> <br /> Ahah! What is the secret of the mummy? Is the spirit of the mummy angry that he was removed from the cave? You may not be able to determine the motivation of the spirit, but if you like ghostly shenanigans on low-budget (and 70's hairstyles!), It will have a comforting appeal. the story described is much brighter than the confused, boring way in which the film presents history. Can a boring movie be really fascinating? Well ... somehow it does. Maybe it's a good movie in the heart, but made in a rather awkward way. I do not know, however, I know I liked it a little, despite its dullness. <br /> <br /> Fans of "Spider Baby" will be interested in the fact that this song uses a few musical tips from this movie (including the instrumental version of the theme song). <br /> <br /> Contains one scary and quite well-made sequence showing the possessed boulders and rocks rolling around and eventually attacking some people in the caravan. Other scenes in the film are only horrible or bizarre; but this one scene is really quite scary. <br /> <br /> Check it out! It's weird and worth your time. You can even want one on your shelf.
