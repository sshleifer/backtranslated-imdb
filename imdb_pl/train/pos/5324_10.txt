Just having seen this movie again after showing the VH-1 in 1998, I just had to comment. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie on TV for the first time, it was around 1981 and I remember how I recorded my mother's betamaks. For some reason, it was recorded in black and white, which gave it a stylish look that I liked. <br /> <br /> I remember very clearly the movie that began with the song "My Bonnie" as the camera moved on the Liverpool stage. I also remember the opening scene in which Paul gestures to some girls and says, "Look, talent!" So I got very irritated with my recorded version from 1998 and "remembered" that the film starts with "She Loves You" instead of "My Bonnie." When you see how slowly the camera moves in relation to the speed of music, you see that "She loves you" simply does not fit. Also in this "later" version, when Paul sees the girls, he says: "Look, GIRLS!" And somehow remembering the earlier version, the word simply did not fit. Why they thought they must Americanize this film for the American audience, they are beyond me. Personally, if I intend to watch a movie about a British band, I want all British colloquia and those that would be part of their speech, manners, etc. <br /> <br /> Another irritation was how "intermittent" editing was for television. Shortly after Stu is beaten, for example, the movie breaks the advertisement - LOTS of 'em. Yes, I know it depends on the network, but it really damages the effect of the movie to separate it, as we all know. What some people may consider irrelevant in terms of dialogue (and hence in order to edit) may actually explain a particular action or scene that follows. <br /> <br /> I mean the "best" version of this movie was probably an earlier version that I recorded from 1981, and it so happened that I turned on the "Shake, Rattle & Roll" scene, which my version from 1998 it did not contain. I began to suppose that two different versions had to be created for television, and looking at the "alternative versions" of this film proved that I was right. The fact that the American version had shorter / cut / different scenes and / or dialogue is a huge disappointment for me and something worth mentioning if you care about such things. Imo, it's best to try to get the European version of the movie if possible, and (probably even less possible), the version without editing. Unfortunately, I had to refuse my old European version of betamax because I did not know how to convert it. <br /> <br /> Besides, I think that this movie is probably one of the best films about the history of the "birth of the Beatles". Being well aware of the fact that in films and television often uses artistic and creative licenses when presenting events in history, I did not allow any discrepancies to engulf my film. Sure, you see that the Beatles perform songs in Cavern, which makes me wonder, "Did they even write it then? I do not think so, but nevertheless I thought it was a great movie and performances, great. <br /> <br /> The real distinguishing feature for me was the actor who played John, Stephen MacKenna. I just fell in love with him. His appearance, manners, personality and talking voice seemed to be in place. It looked like young John, that at the end of the movie I will make a double rehearsal when you see the Beatles performing for the first time at Ed Sullivan. Actually, I was wondering if this was the actual Beatles material until I saw other actors on stage. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a dead exact story of life and the beginnings of The Beatles, you can not be better than "The Beatles' Anthology," as it was "written" by the boys themselves. However, if you are looking for interesting pictures of their days before Beatlemania leading to their arrival in America and leaving critical assessments at the door, you can not go wrong with the "Beatles' birth" - MUST be for every "real" or casual Beatles fan.
