It's a decent little move in Michigan, about a guy haunted by his past, with his offensive stepfather (Gunnar Hansen) and grew up not so well adapted. In fact, he is absolutely hopeless, but he tries not to be too obvious. He also has his own entourage, his little demon and an angel who follows him. The demon never says a word, but it really does not have to, and he is Max Schreck - terrifying. Let's just say that the angel almost turns his wheels around because Eric is busy doing things that make him feel better, like "freeing" the people he needs, mostly beautiful young women. It's a decent show of madness, and at some point you're alone in order to find out what's going on, but overall, I watched it from the beginning to the very end focused on the movie, because I was definitely interested in it. A bit lacking in some areas, but nothing that I can really rely on. A decent effort and worth seeing if you like a serial killer cinema.
