Those of the horror age "Instant gratification" will no doubt complain about the pace of this film and the lack of free effects and number of bodies. The fact is that "The Empty Acre" is a good example of how independent horror films should be made. <br /> <br /> If you avoid indie-racks, because you are tired of annoying teenagers or twenty people killed by some evil hero, whose story could come down from the box of Count Chocula, "The Empty Acre" is a movie for you. <br /> <br /> Situated in the decaying remnants of a rural American dream, "The Empty Acre" is a story of a young couple struggling with the disappearance of a six-month-old child. When the weak bond of the pair breaks down, a larger story unfolds in the background. At night, a shapeless dark mass seethes from the sun of a burned barren acre on their farm and apparently devours everything in its path, leaving no trace of ever being there. <br /> <br /> The film is full of mysterious characters and visual clues about what's going on and ends with a well-made ending that resonates with enough of the questions left to confirm the writer's / director's faith in the intellectual audience. <br /> <br /> It seems that there is a sub-text about the death of an American dream, but I would hardly call this film an allegory. Riveting, well-preserved and technically penetrating "The Empty Acre" are fantastic little indies that thinking horror fans should love.
