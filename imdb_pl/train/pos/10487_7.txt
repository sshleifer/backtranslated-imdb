Saving Grace is a good movie with a heart in the right place. Grace is recently widowed and realizes that her late husband left her with many debts. She could lose her beautiful home and see no other solution to her misery than to start growing marijuana. He lives in a beautiful village where most of the viewers would like to live, and the villagers are wonderful people that most viewers would like to have as neighbors. There is only one thing with this image and it is the way in which it portrays the effect that marijuana exerts on its user. It is obvious that none of the actors or writers of this film have ever smoked this material. The way in which the villagers behave after smoking the joints is ridiculous and only supposedly funny. It is in these scenes that the joke is replaced with an English slapstick, which is a pity in the film, which is however very pleasant.
