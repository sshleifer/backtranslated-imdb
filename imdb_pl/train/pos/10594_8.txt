Passport to Pimlico is a real treat for all fans of British cinema. This is not only a pleasant and addictive comedy, but it's a cinematic retrospection to a bygone era, with attitudes and scenarios unfortunately only a memory in British life. <br /> <br /> Stanley Holloway plays Pimlico resident Arthur Pemberton, who, after an accidental explosion of an non-explosive bomb, discovers the richness of the medieval treasure belonging to the 14th-century Duke of Burgundy, who has been buried deeply under their little suburban street for the last 600 years. <br /> <br /> The accompanying treasure is an ancient legal decree signed by the King of England Edward IV (which has never been officially annulled) to conclude that this particular street in London was considered a land in Burgandy, which means that In the eyes of international law Pemberton and other residents are no longer British subjects, but residents of Burgundy and their tiny street an independent country in their own name and right in themselves. <br /> <br /> It puts a decayed war and poverty disappears in good positions, because they consider themselves outside of English law and jurisdiction, so in the act of drunken resistance they burn their food cards, destroy and ignore clothing coupons, grossly disregard British laws licensing, etc., declaring to be completely independent of Britain. <br /> <br /> However, what is happening at the time is always going on, the black market trader and dishonest crook follow this example and cross the border with Burgundy as a shelter against the law and post-war restrictions to sell his suspicious goods and half the consumers in London he follows them to avoid being right, making them a quiet, happy little haven, a thieves' cave, and quite crowded. <br /> <br /> By appealing to Whitehall for help, they are saying that due to development this is "now a matter of foreign policy in which the government of His Majesty is reluctant to get involved", which leaves the inhabitants high and dry. However, they define the area as a legal boundary and as such form a fully-equipped customs office at the end of the road, mainly to monitor smuggling, than to ensure the safety of Pimlico residents. <br /> <br /> In the end, the border is completely closed, starting a serious siege, and the inhabitants of Bugundian slowly end up with water and food, but the more they fight in true British style. As one of the Bugundian residents quotes: "We are English and we have always been English, and that's because we're English people, we're fighting so hard to be Bugundians" <br /> <br /> The mood that soon reverberates throughout the capital, as when the rest of London learns about the fate of the poor Bugunners, everyone feels compelled to break in and help them, throwing food and supplies to barricades with barbed wire. <br /> <br /> Will Whitehall, who fought so invaders over the centuries, can be brought to their knees by a new group of foreigners, especially since they are English !!!! <br /> <br /> A great story and great fun. It can not be bypassed.
