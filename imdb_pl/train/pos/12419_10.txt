I love this movie like no other. Another time I will try to explain its advantages to the uninitiated, but for now let me quote a few fragments of an extraordinary dialogue, which, please remember, is all on the cheek. Aussies and Poms will understand, everyone else - okay? <br /> <br /> (the title song is lyrical) "he can sink beer, he can choose a bizarre one, in his latest two-row Bondi equipment." <br> <br /> (another song) "All pommies are bastards, rascals or worse, and England is the ** e-hole of the universe. "<br /> <br /> (during the TV interview for the" artistic program "): Mr. Mackenzie, what artists have made the biggest impression on you since you're in England? (Barry's answer) Flamin "bull-artists! <br /> <br /> (during a conversation with a naive young girl from pom): Mr. Mackenzie, I suppose you have hordes of Aborigines back in Australia? (Barry's answer) Abos? I have never seen Abo in my life. Mum does most of the solid yacki (ie Hard work) around our place. <br /> <br /> It's just the taste of the comic farce of this better Aussie flick. If you can get a copy, watch and enjoy.
