I introduced the first commentary on this film almost five years ago. Then the ideas presented in the film still seemed mostly fictitious, if they could even appear at all. Not any more. Now politics, society and the media in The Running Man really seem to be very close to home. <br /> <br /> Consider the following factors, which were mostly absent in 1987 (The Year in which The Running Man came out), which are to be presented today: <br /> <br /> Concern about, as he put it it's Richard Damson, the character of Damon Killian, "traditional morality." KONTROLA <br /> <br /> Entertainment in the form of extreme reality, including the pain, fear and discomfort of the players. CHECK <br /> <br /> Cameras everywhere. KONTROLA <br /> <br /> Limited travel for citizens with the government's desire, controlled by a centralized computer system with passports with a bar code ("the journey passes" in the film) and sanctioned under the guise of national security. VERIFY <br /> <br /> Increased interference, bordering on incestuous, government and media. CHECK <br /> <br /> Computer generated graphics that are advanced enough to manipulate real movie materials (such as "digital matting" of Ben Richards' image on a double stunt picture). CHECK <br /> <br /> Prison of those refusing military service or critics of the current administration. KONTROLA <br /> <br /> The flagging economy further widens the gap between the rich and not so wealthy; the growing number of marginal groups responding to the tightening loop of a large government; social unrest arising just under the surface of almost every large public event, regardless of its origin or intention. CHECK, CHECK, CHECK <br /> <br /> On the other hand, maybe it's just a movie based on Stephen King's novella. But to be safe, I move to Switzerland.
