I saw this movie the day it appeared last year. Funny, I thought. Well, now he's on the video and I saw it again. I love that movie! The things they do are sometimes stupid, but it makes me my third favorite movie of all time. The special effects are fine, but the witty dialog will make you roll. I am a person who will say that I am inspired by this film, so if you like drama and other things, avoid it. But enjoy all others! Acting is great. Hank Azaria is the best (he is neither a comedian nor a fruit), and Ben Stiller behind him (uh, do not correct me. It disgusts me), and then William H. Macy provides his best performance (dim fargo), praised everyone from Macia after garafalo, but I think Kel Mitchell was pretty good as Invisible Boy. Two problems: The most boring part of the movie is the affair of romance between Stiller and Claire Forlani and the interrogation on Casanova's conditional release. Some scenes absolutely do not shift history in any way, but are explosive. Kinka, especially writers, tend to drag scenes until all the hilarity disappears, but they change and you're ready for more. I swear, seeing this, you'll be tired of the explosive climax (which I think is pretty cool). The camera is also quite cool, moving in a fury with the actors. In addition, Tom Waits provides excellent performance (it has a cool cool for the evil hero) and, as someone else said, the best parts are when the heroes show them some humanity. Captain Amazing is quite funny (especially his speech to Casanova about his perfect plan - I was rolling) and the rush is pretty cool like Casanova. One beef: the funniest comedian ever (eddie izzard) is almost wasted, but his heart is in the right place. So all in all a great movie. I give him twenty stars and I hope that one day everyone will see the brilliance in the best parody of the movie, Six Million Dollar Man. Laughing now, as I think about it. 20/10
