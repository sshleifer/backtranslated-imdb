Deeply emotional. It can not leave you neutral. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's a love story between 2 18-year-old boys. But this is just the body of this movie. And it was removed. You feel only what happened to these boys. You feel the soul of the movie. Of course with some action, sex, but it's not pornography, too many feelings. <br /> <br /> It was just a "summer story" and it became, for love of hatred, almost the death of the most important time of their lives. I loved it, you will be, regardless of your feelings.
