In 74, Eric Monte showed the classic performance of T.V Good Times. JJ has always been my favorite and I love watching Rerun on Earth T.V. Jimmie Walker always seemed like a star, not Esther Rolle. John Amos most of the time felt a bit jealous of Jimmy Walker's popularity, gaining millions of fans who could sit and watch the Good Times. The performance would be dead if JJ were not there to save him, always keeping Kool Aid's attitude. Drinking KOOL AID was like his favorite thing in the show. When I was finished, I was 3 years old and when I was 8 years old. Instead of 1974-1979 it should be longer, as in the 1980s, when I was growing up.
