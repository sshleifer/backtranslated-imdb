Because I'm so interested in monsters from the lake, I really dug this movie. This film is worth seeing. If you like such horrible things, these are good types of movies. The effects are really good, just think of "Land of the Lost". Originally, I watched this movie in the early 90s, maybe more like 89/90 at a local show of monsters called "Morgus Presents". I was not scared, but I was 8 years old and whatever B was feeling more like A. Years later I saw him on DVD at the local Circuit City and bought it immediately, so I can give him 9 because he has a personal place in my heart with The Monster Squad and Gremlins. Good fun with movie B for all ages.
