In no way is this a masterpiece, and far from the best Errol Flynn, Istanbul still has much to do. Locations and beautiful technical photos, bring us back to the times long gone. Errol Flynn shows the moments of its former glory and is fine as Jim Brennan, the pilot who returns to persecute him. The picture is actually a remake of the Singapore singles from 1947, and the story seems terribly imaginary and banal "according to today's standards. Also, many of the cast seems to just "browse the movements" in this photo. Many people have likened him to one of the best of all times, CASABLANCA. While watching the movie, I saw many similarities, but hey, Casablanca inspired countless followers, so take it for what's worth it. Finally, if you're a Flynn fan or an old-fashioned love story, you may want to look at this movie. Otherwise, I would recommend Casablanca or the Maltese Falcon as a good introduction to some of the Hollywood classics ....
