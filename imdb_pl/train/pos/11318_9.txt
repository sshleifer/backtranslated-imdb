This is a haunting, powerful Italian adaptation of the novel by James M. Cain, The Postman Always Rings Twice, directed by the great Luchino Visconti. What is so interesting about the film is that in every respect it goes beyond the source material to become something bolder and more original (interestingly Camus ascribes Cain's novel as the key inspiration for his groundbreaking novel Stranger). The film has more power and intensity than the novel, because Visconti is able to create a movie equivalent to the narrative structure of Cain, but offers a more complex exploration of gender. Cain's very American novel is also uncritically fascinated by the construction of white (Cora's main character obsessively fears being identified as Mexican and embarrassed that she married a Greek immigrant), which is not relevant to the Italian rural context of Visconti it is class antagonisms to occupy a central position and dance among the fervent passionate, doomed romances of the two main heroes. This film is a complex, full of tension, satisfying experience.
