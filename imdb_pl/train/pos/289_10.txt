I love all the movies of Michael Landon Jr. And Dale Midkiff's cast of Michael Landon Jr. as "Clark Davis" could not have been better. Dale Midkiff has ways to eliminate this character. <br /> <br /> This movie made me start to feel enchanted from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> The death of Missie & Willies during the Clarks visit was only God's time. How they dealt with death and how Clark helped them do it is the love of their fathers. <br /> <br /> Although there are 3 movies before the film [Love comes quietly, loves a lasting promise and loves a long journey], I feel that you can see this movie and easily understand it. But go away and I want to see the previous 3 movies because of the story behind all characters. <br /> <br /> Michael Landon Jr. is a great director <br /> <br /> I am looking forward to seeing many more films from him in the future.
