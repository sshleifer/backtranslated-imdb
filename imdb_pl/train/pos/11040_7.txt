I watched the French horror yesterday and he liked it. The whole film takes place in a prison cell with three prisoners who find a handwritten journal in the wall of a serial killer who escaped from prison 20 years earlier without leaving his cell. When they look through the diary, they discover that it delves into the black art and commands that can be their way out of the cell and freedom. They learn that it is something completely different and at least scary. I like low-budget horrors that deliver goods in a fairly qualitative way and tell a good story. This movie does just that, although it takes some time to get started. The result and horror that they trigger are very interesting to me and I enjoyed riding. Not too much gore, but it would not fit the story, although it's pretty good.
