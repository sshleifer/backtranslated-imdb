A clean family movie. I was laughing, I was crying ... I loved it. I was worried that I would not be able to see Steve Carrell as a stupid Michael from the Bureau. Boy, I was wrong. He should win an Oscar for his role. I will definitely buy it on DVD when it comes out. My husband liked it and it is not in films of this type. I saw it with two other couples in the 30 year range and we all agreed that it was the best movie we saw in a LONG time and certainly the cleanest. Only 1 word cuss! I do not even know why it was PG13. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes comedy, drama, romance and much more!
