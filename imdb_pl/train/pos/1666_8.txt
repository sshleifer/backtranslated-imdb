It is a film about seventeenth-century Italian artists, in particular about one artist, a woman Artemisia, who at that time was an unprecedented profession for women, and dared to paint a masculine nudity describing his unique musculature. <br /> <br /> Working with the camera is mainly in the rooms where the artists mainly worked. There are some great photos. Zooming in with the light of candles suggests the beautiful work of classical painters and it is fascinating to see how painters and their students are supported by sophisticated scaffolds brushed in the details of religious frescoes. No wonder that the artistic elements of the film (costumes, faces, makeup) are very authentic, because Italian churches have preserved all these details on their frescos for ages. Beautiful Artemisia is encouraged by his father to study under the guidance of the great Florentine artist Tassi, who became an expert in the art of perspective and landscape painting (something very new), but unsuspecting Artemisia is introduced to new painting techniques. After posing for her, Tassi violently rapes her. Her father is indignant. Court proceedings take place. <br /> <br /> This romantic drama has a fairly simple story with an unsatisfactory ending. The unique feature of the film is its artistic presentation and attention to detail. Scenes such as women running across the field with the wind billowing in their large clothes add great effects. <br /> <br /> Artemisia says he paints to please himself; her father paints to please others. When it comes to this movie, I think I'll like it the most.
