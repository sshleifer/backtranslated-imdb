It is difficult to watch this movie without thinking about a TV program that would become, especially if you like TV program more like me. But for the source there is a lot to say. <br /> <br /> Oscar Madison (Walter Matthau) is a leading sports writer in New York, who lives alone in an eight-room flat, a victim of divorce and his own stubbornly scruffy way of thinking. Go to his friend Felix Ungar (Jack Lemmon), who needs a place to live after his wife threw him away for a stubborn way of thinking. The result is the wreck of the train and one of the most beloved film adaptations of Neil Simon. <br /> <br /> First thing: I love this apartment! A poker table, an innovative dartboard, crooked pictures of baseball players, empty bottles of alcohol and beer, and even a pair of Roman columns. This is a place where men can be boys. Simon and director Gene Saks do a great job opening a single stage set, an Oscar salon, moving action to the bedroom and kitchen, and increasing the tension between Oscar and Felix to jump back. <br /> <br /> The well-known result of Neal Hefti was heard on the television program, but he was never as planned as here, in several different arrangements that make the action on the screen glide as soon as it is played. Working in the actual location and nighttime photos of Manhattan give the film energy common for films shot in this place and time ("Buddwing", "World of Henry Orient", "North cowboy", "Manchurian candidate", "Rosemary child", etc. ) <br /> <br /> Are Lemmon and Matthau too heavy compared to Tony Randall and Jacek Klugman? To be honest, the movie is to be a more serious matter, dealing with the unusual state of divorce in the middle of life and the frustration associated with the inability to establish relationships. Simon means more than just entering Felix and Oscar in the game "Password" or the fight of reason with Howard Cosell. But I do not know ... <br/> <br/> Both Lemmon and Matthau were great comedians I like to see especially in the middle of this movie, as I often do in their separate films, but I never understood why they were considered a great comedy band. Here, in their best known partnership, they seem to work in two different films; Lemmon in comedy drama and Matthau in farce. Matthau is great at the beginning, enchanting us with his teddy bear behavior around the poker table, but at the end of the movie he revolves like Jack Torrance in the "Glittering" reaction to Felix cleaning his apartment and serving tasty food to his friends in a way that completely disturbs the delicate balance of guilt. <br /> <br /> Although ending me worries, the part that many see as the most shocking, beginning, works well, as I see it. Watching Felix stumble, trying to kill himself is not a great comedy, no, but it's a good way to get into a great comedy, exposing us to some real pain before bringing in heat and laughter. (Plus has some great shots in more scattered parts of the city.) In the middle of the movie this scene would be wrong, but it works as a way to establish Felix's torment and a sense of sharp relief when we see that Oscar and his friends are fighting and fighting. <br /> <br /> This is the place where Simon's lines are so great. They are the basic strength of the film. He gets the joke exactly and truly, and still makes it funny. - It does not bother me that you speak, Felix. You have something to say. What frightens me, I start to listen. The TV show showed how wrong it is to assume that the movie is always better, in fact the television program once had a good opinion about "setting up" anything, but the film is a solid foundation and a joy in itself.
