The Gray Gardens were fascinating and crazy, and you just can not look away. It was so weird and funny, sad and sick and ?????? ... they can not really describe words. The Gray Gardens movement is bizarre. I learned about this film, which I read in Uncle John's Great Bathroom Reader, at the Bath Reader Institute, and it was worth renting it and being on the top of my watch queue. This movie is about the craziest, most eccentric people ever to be filmed. You should watch them in your favorite Edie costumes, which certainly include curtains. When I get older, I almost want to be like Big Edie, my thumb in the normality and society.
