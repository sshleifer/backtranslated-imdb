The online database contains a list of television programs. And yes, it was the MTV series shown in the "Oddities" program, after "The Head" and before "Aeon Flux", if I remember correctly. But the version I watched this time was a VHS cassette with all episodes running together into a movie without annoying credits between or waiting a week for the next fifteen minutes. <br /> <br /> You have a story about Maxx, Julie Winters, Sarah and Mr. Gone. Maxx is a super hero or vagabond, Julie a social worker or a queen of leopards, Sarah a girl who should listen less to The Smiths and Mr. Gone, a guy who does not seem to hold his head. And then there are other strange creatures ... <br /> <br /> I use "or" with Maxx and Julie, because part of the fun is to try to determine which parts of the story are real and which are dreams. Maybe all are real or dreams. Maybe one of the characters does not exist. Maybe only one exists and dreams about others. You will have to wait and find out. <br /> <br /> I had comics before the concert and it was one of my favorites. The graphics were spectacular and the story was original - unlike anything you find in Superman or Batman. It will bend your mind and have a strong excitement of adults without being obscene or offensive. And the program used basically the same exact graphics (only now moving) and the same story ... guaranteeing that the beauty, which in the comic book is inherently reproduced, will be faithfully recreated. It was the best concert that appeared on Oddities, no doubt. <br /> <br /> If you like darker comics or need a good journey, this is a program to check. This is "Donnie Darko" before something like that happened. <br /> <br /> The most amazing thing is that it has never become another movie or TV series, but I'm not saying this with disappointment. Keeping it simple, they locked the film in gold and kept it free from defects caused by successive failures.
