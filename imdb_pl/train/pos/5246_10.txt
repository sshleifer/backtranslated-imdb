This movie deserves 10 for a brilliant representation of the world he has experienced in the mind of a playboy. Although I think that the world is morally repulsive, the film best dealt with telling stories, and that leads us through experience that we would never have gone through otherwise. Tim Meadows convincingly portrays Leon Phelps, and this story drew me into the reckless world of Leon, that I temporarily forgot that I was watching the parody of the playboy world and felt compelled to rebel against him. This is the lost film, because its great and bold achievement in telling history has its price. Understanding that the vast majority of moviegoers will only answer the story of this film, which lies on the surface, and will reject this story, I hesitate to be misunderstood by them and admit that I liked it. I loved it not only for the fascinating look at the illusory mind of the playboy, not only for his funny presentation of the idiocy of the human sex drive, but also for the courage of fearlessly discovering what is in the shadow of heterosexuality. Besides, it's just ridiculous.
