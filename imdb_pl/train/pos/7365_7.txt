I find it very moving, because Spike and Heaton remain together throughout this movie, not to mention that there are not a few betrayals along the way. I thought the pursuit was put aside, I think the relationship between them was in the foreground. I guessed that Heaton had homosexual intentions. My favorite scene must have been where Heaton and Spike were stuck in the swamp, and Spike is running away. In general, I thought Spike would not come back. I must say that if it was not for our film studies teacher who was watching us, I probably would never have seen it. In general, I thought that this movie is quite good and I recommend it to every person who is a fan of British films.
