I would like to give Kolchak a higher mark, but the show quickly turned from a terrifying / uncertain to a stupid one. Wines ABC. They moved the show to Friday nights at 8:00 PM, and then they called it "family time". First of all, it should never be on Fridays. I was a second year high school student and I loved the early episodes! This was the first meeting with the police woman at NBC. ABC had huge problems with Friday nights. Bad season for them, until Barney Miller, Baretta and SWAT made their debut in January '75. Kolczak should be a hit. Darren McGavin begged to withdraw from the contract to end the show. It is a pity that the writing was not consistent with Richard Matheson in the original television movies. Nevertheless, McGavin has made Kolchak his own, how actors can do it. They recall Jackie Gleason as Ralph Kramden and Caroll O'Connor as Archie Bunker. This INS kit with hand-held typewriters and teletypes today seems peculiar and ancient, but that was part of the appeal. They were lucky that Simon Oakland repeated "Vincenzo" from television films.
