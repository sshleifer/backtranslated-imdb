With "Twelve Monkeys" you have to pay attention, but if you do, you'll probably find much to appreciate. I know yes. History is interesting and concerns travel in time. The virus killed many people in 1997, and a guy named Cole (Bruce Willis) is sent back to 1990 and 1996 to find a cure for the virus. In 1990 he was arrested and placed in a psychiatric hospital. There he meets Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt), who probably has something to do with the virus. He also meets with a psychiatrist, Dr. Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe), who does not believe him in 1990. When Cole disappears from the psychiatric hospital when she is chained and locked in the room and reappears in 1996, Kathryn begins to believe in Cole's stories. br /> <br /> The movie is constantly playing with time. Cole calls and leaves a message in 1996, gets picked up in the future and "they" send someone. For Cole, someone only appears a few seconds after a phone call. These things happen throughout the movie and that's why you should pay attention to it. You can ask a few questions, but if you can not find the answer yourself, it's better to agree with the movie. <br /> <br /> "Twelve Monkeys" works like science fiction, with some great images and a dark atmosphere, and works like a thriller. You're never sure what will happen next and it will help the movie. It may have some drawbacks in history, but because it's about fiction, like traveling in time, you should accept what the movie tells us and just try to enjoy it. It was an easy part for me.
