Some spoilers If you're a huge fan of horror movies, then you know that Halloween has paved the way for many movies. Often imitated, never reproduced, this movie is a true classic horror film and is definitely one of the scariest movies ever made, if not MOST. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie after seeing the rest of the series (do not ask me why). I honestly saw the other 7 films before I saw this movie, it just came out. But I would have to say that he rejects all the others. It's really scary, and seeing Michael jumping out from behind the bush or walking in the dark causes cold in the spine. My favorite part of the movie was when Michael stabbed the guy and bowed his head to the side. This is one of the greatest images in the history of the film. <br /> <br /> Later slashes, such as the Friday films from the 13th, were more fun and less intense than the movie. I like the F13 series better than the Halloween series, but the movie itself is better than all F13 films. Michael Myers is such a terrible villain because it is realistic, you can imagine a crazy guy like him who kills people. I admit that this movie gave me nightmares after seeing it for several nights. <br /> <br /> The great thing about this movie is that it's not about gore or humor to entertain the audience. It is simply pure terror. It is a pity that the later films in this series were rocking it, because it is a good example of a spectacular slash movie.
