This film is about a fictional soap opera. It is very fast and funny. To say that anything else would ruin the movie. There are several threads and sub-threads in the video. This movie has a cast with today's hottest stars. They all give the best results. This movie is my favorite movie from 1991. Soapdish is perfect for fans of the daily soap opera / soap opera in prime time!
