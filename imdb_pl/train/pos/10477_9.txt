A walk on the line between comedy and drama is one of the most difficult acts in the cinema. How do you laugh at the misery of other people and do not you feel bad when it happens too long? <br /> <br /> Well, this surprising little jewel of the film will provide great, big laughs, beautiful landscapes and quite good humming. I particularly like the idea that the history trick has made alcohol become legal, because white Europeans liked it, and marijuana is illegal because "these other races" used it ... undoubtedly true and put the racial side at risk marijuana laws so openly supported by populations around the world. <br /> <br /> An extraordinary commentary "DVD Extra" ... in fact two ... goes through the whole movie with the actors and then with the writers. In the first movie I always saw things that I was not sure about, but I realized how easy it is to miss most of the subtle comedy on the first shot. What a hoot! Do not miss it! 9/10 stars
