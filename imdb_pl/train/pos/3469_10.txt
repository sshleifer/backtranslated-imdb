This is one of the few films published on the "what if" situation that made me think. It was amazing to hear them talking to each other and mentioning all the wonderful (and not so great) things that happened between them. Actually, I think that there is a very good possibility that it happened as the movie suggests, and they actually made peace with each other. These are good memories for any fan who can hold on and ask what happened between them, it would be selfish. What an amazing movie it was. The comedy aspects of the movie were great. Thinking that they are together to patch things in such a way is a comforting thought for people who want them to have the chance to purify the air with someone they have not seen. To see John as such a caring, relaxed character, he refreshed himself hearing all the garbage that was said of him ...
