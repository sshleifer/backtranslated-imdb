I honestly think that it was the best version of the world war I saw. it was fun, but it was also educational I learned a lot of film and if I could do it. My favorite part was killing the soldiers on the robot, and the other just behind him. in the last movie war in the world I think that it should be more similar to the first one and it would be better. but in any way I give this film 2 thumbs up. <br /> <br /> and if they can make such a movie, I will definitely watch it. <br /> <br /> thank you
