Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) is the manager of the longest running dice game in New York and needs $ 1,000 to secure the new location. Confident of his chances, he places the highest in the city, Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando), that he can not deal with the restless missionary Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons). "Guys and Dolls (1955)" is a great musical because it deftly combines contrasting styles of film and scene. During the dazzling opening sequence, the crowds of passers-by move in rhythm, stopping and starting, as if reacting to the backstage. Even the walking movements are stylized and angular, halfway between walking and dancing. Mankiewicz's New York City is a brilliant avalanche of colors and movements in the Art Deco style, a fantasy world so completely detached from the reality that even the business of underground gambling and criminal banditry seems perfectly brilliant. <br /> <br /> When I write this review, I just received a message saying that Jean Simmons left, at the age of 80. This, unbelievably, was the first time I saw her in the movie, but she dazzled me from the beginning. Her idealistic and sexually repressed Sarah emerges from the shell after an alcoholic drink in Havana, freeing herself with a generously funny performance of "If I Was a Bell". Although both Simmons and Brando were not singers, the producer Sam Goldwyn decided not to dub his vocals, claiming that "maybe you do not sound so good, but at least it's you." Despite self-confidence Goldwyn, they both deal with transferring the music numbers themselves. Simmons suggests the same vitality that Audrey Hepburn could bring to this role, and Brando emanates such self-confidence and charisma that it does not matter that his voice is not entirely present.
