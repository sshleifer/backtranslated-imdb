Ah, real memories. I lived in the Netherlands then and I was impatiently looking at it every Sunday evening and later on Tuesdays. I saw it during my 14-16. It is very suitable for my (at school time) English because Dutch TV offers subtitles for other languages, except for children's shows nowadays. You will hear original voices and language. - The best series were the first three, and then after the third series, a great character, Nazi Von Gelb, who was such a dangerous enemy, disappeared from the series (I do not think they ever really caught him, he always fled, leaving room for it to appear again in the next story), because of course the series has also been sent to Germany, and the Nazi enemy will not go very well! It is a pity, because Geoffrey Toone did such a wonderful, convincing work, presenting an intelligent Nazi aristocrat who had this constant obsession with revenge on England. It was a real joy to see this kind of high-quality performances in the youth series, but Ronald Leigh-Hunt was a good equivalent and the youth was so normal. At that time, they were very credible to me and as a child I could imagine that I was part of those young people who were four years older than me. It was a very exciting series for me, standing out in my memory for those times as a special show from "The Prisoner". I hope they will release a good quality DVD series, which would be great. Even bad copies are still pleasant to watch. The later series were not as good, watered down and just not as fun as the first three. I hope that other series from Von Gelb will be placed on DVD. Greetings from Canada.
