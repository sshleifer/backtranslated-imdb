As for many here, I can not resist the praises of the cast that Talespin created, and others they created during my childhood, because everyone who has commented on here, I really like the quality of not only the animation, but the quality of the story lines and characters. <br /> <br /> To qualify this work as a "cartoon", you can never bring it to justice. In fact, it is an insult to classify it as a "cartoon", Talespin is an animation and nothing less, it is apparently the greatest work of genius that could have been produced in Disney so far. When Disney "pulled" him out of the air, they did not realize what they had done, and I'm sure their souls have been tortured since then. br /> <br /> I will take a moment to explain: From the first, which is ducktales to the last one, which I think is Darkwing Duck, Disney was plagued by defeats due to political correctness and took Quantum Leap back from, They prefer now quantity than quality not to mention a room full of monkeys, the story could not make my children watch the stunning "caricatures" that they are now throwing out for fear that everyone will prove homers in the future with the Simpsons, and that 50% of the blame rests on me for permission to see them, I could not allow it, that's why I have ALL programs on hard disk from the end of the 80s till the mid 90's, so one day my kids could not be spoiled by the "Cartoon Crap" today and enjoy the last piece of childhood that I have and to keep all this, I owe it to Talespin. <br /> <br /> Talespin is undoubtedly the best animation ever made in the world due to the depth, charm, wit, compassion, emotions and lack of true bad quality and story, many of whom today, Do you see any from this content in the words "Ed, Edd and Eddie, or anything else you think about?" The garbage produced today can be compared to the non-downloadable Hyroglyph from 3 years ago. Picasso presentation. <br /> <br /> The next time you watch episode e Talespin; look at the woodgrain on any wooden object or building, such as Higher for Hire and drool over the quality of workmanship and effort put into this Animation, even one background photo was taken as if it were used again, The Buildings look at the Art Deco movement, which was popular in the period shown, Even the vehicles are faithful to life, OK, not ALL episodes were fantastic in the animation, but the lower-class scenes were covered by better scenes, so overall at the end of the episode it leveled it all and you probably would never even notice if you were not focused and did not pay attention to details. <br /> <br /> The only thing I love about it is what I like to call "Intentional Mistakes" or "Intentional Mistakes" in each episode, and some have two, for example in deep sheepskins, where Rebecca says, "You are something Baloo," and Baloo replies, "Who, me! as innocent as a student "look into Rebecca's eyes, I won" to spoil the rest of the Balooper, but keep your eye the next time. <br /> <br /> Each elses comment is hit and is 100% correct, I have nothing else to add that others have not said anything here, Disney, Wake up and smell the coffee, you've been sleeping for over a decade, stop producing garbage and restore quality in animations and stop producing "fairy tales", we have seen evidence of what you can do, and we want it back as soon as possible.
