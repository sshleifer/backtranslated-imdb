Personally, I watched it to see material from the 60's and 70's. It was fascinating to learn how the drug movement essentially began and became pop culture and the ultimate uncompromising force in life. Interviews of classic rock stars are exciting and fun. You feel that you are secret and you are nodding ... because it is so good and familiar. I loved it, all segments from the 60th today. I highly recommend this for all aspects, including rock music, hyper-movement, politics and good history. I check the checked box that contains the spoiler, just because I have no idea what some might consider a spoiler or not, because I discussed what in all 4 segments, so I just wanted to be safe.
