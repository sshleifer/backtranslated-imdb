This move made me jump out of the chair waiting for what the actors would do! The actress was the best, Farrah should get an Oscar for being fantastic. James Russo was so good that I hated him that he was a villain and he played it wonderfully. There are not many movies that caught me that way. The cast was a great Alfie looking shocked by the big eyes that Farrah looked like a victim, and you survived her horror when she was going through it. Farrah made you feel as if you were there and feeling the same anger that she felt you wanted to hurt him, and at the same time you knew it was wrong. In the movie you took a roller coaster ride and went up and down with each stage.
