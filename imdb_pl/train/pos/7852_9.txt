The curiosity of Władysław Starewicz with insects and cinema is combined into a short film about a love triangle between Mr. Garbus, an artistic grasshopper and Mrs. Beetle. Quite a simple story about a couple with adulterers who is looking for stimulation outside of marriage, is similar to Biograph or Vitagraph in a short time. Starwicz's fight in the story consists of using embalmed beetles with wires straightening the legs in an animation frame by frame. The story is built when Mr. Beetle is unknowingly caught by the camera using a Dragonfly from a local nightclub by a jealous grasshopper. When Mr. Beetle returns home to find a wife in the arms of his artistic friend, he pursues her with anger, but finally forgives her and takes her to the movie. However, Mrs. Beetle quickly learns about her husband's infidelity because the movie they are watching is a jealous grasshopper showing Mr. Beetle and a dragonfly together. Mrs. Beetle throws Mr. Beetle with an umbrella, Mr. Beetle jumps over the screen and they both go to jail after the projector that destroys it will come on fire. Insects are placed in a humanized environment, such as a home or a nightclub, and receive human qualities of jealousy, anger, lust and revenge. Insects carry briefcases, drive cars, and even wear shoes, and at the same time twist their antennas and open and close their jaws, as real insects do. The novelty of the story does not wear out, even after many reviews, but as smooth as movements, the film moves slowly. The action happens with complex details, but the speed and speed of filming are lost in the process. Despite the pace, the film is a great example of Starewicz's early puppetry and is highly recommended.
