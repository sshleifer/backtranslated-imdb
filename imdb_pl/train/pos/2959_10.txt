It was a Saturday night, and the movie called BASEketball was on TV. I always wanted to watch it, but I never looked back when it was in the cinema. Boy, I was wrong. Words can not describe how funny this movie is, with the participation of South Park creators who share natural chemistry on the screen when they are funny. I recorded the replay the next day and exactly a week after seeing it for the first time, I saw it 7 times !!. I'm obsessed with it and I know that anyone who appreciates working with songs and mats will appreciate this film. MUST SEE, THIS IS MY # 1 COMEDY OF THE WHOLE TIME
