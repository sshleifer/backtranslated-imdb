Orson Welles manages to knock my ass with every photo I see. The Lady of Shanghai is on the same level as his other masterpieces, The Magnificent Ambersons, Touch of Evil, The Trial and Chimes at Midnight. The plot is sometimes misleading, and sometimes it seems that it moves a little too fast (about an hour was assembled when the test demonstrations went wrong). However, this does not matter. You can not watch Welles' films and concentrate too much on the story. His direction determines what is the great direction. Almost every scene in this movie can deal with any other stage he directed. Check the courtroom scene. Usually, these are scenes that I can not stand. For example, try to sit down by Welles' speech at the end of compulsion. In "The Lady of Shanghai", pay attention to the level of detail of this court scene. Follow this juror who always sneezes and interrupts the proceedings. Or just look at the lighting in this scene. I know it's just ordinary Venetian blindness, and that it was constantly used in the noir movies and crime movies of the era, but Welles gives her beauty. Dialogue is also unusual. Welles had this skill, a skill no one else seemed to have had to make a crime movie with examples of the greatest poetry. Regardless of whether he was telling Shakespeare or spat out hard lines, he had the power to move the soul. 10/10
