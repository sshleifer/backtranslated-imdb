In one of the bugs of the Bugs Bunny, the famous leper * works in the showcase in the store, when the owner Gildersleeve decides to push it. Of course, it turns out to be almost impossible, because Bugs apparently knows the store better than Gildersleeve (and knows when to dress). As always, everything goes at maximum speed, so you have to think about how funny this cartoon had to look like when it debuted for the first time! Among other things, "Hare Conditioned" is a great example of how Looney Tunes looked in the '40s, before the crowd of Termite Terrace refined them. But do not get me wrong, fairy tales were still really good after sophisticated forms appeared. <br /> <br /> In any case, it's great. <br /> <br /> * Leporids are rabbits and hares.
