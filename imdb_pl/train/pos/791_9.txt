Not knowing this movie before watching it on the Rialto channel, I found it pleasant, poignant and enriching the film. <br /> <br /> Casting was perfect. I loved all the characters, they were a bit exaggerated in places (but this is a movie). The way he looked and the pleasant, dizzying ride that the main character took, until he turned away badly, how he can and does real life. Yes, I thought Andy MacDowell is great. I was particularly interested in watching this movie after it started, because people often joke about their acting abilities (I find it quite strange because I think it is always a solid actress). <br /> <br /> I loved this piece the end in which Andy's character said "sometimes I feel he was never here" etc., it was as complete as it really is in this situation (with which I can personally to identify), then it was this wonderful classic piece "Nocturne" I think Chopin, which was a beautiful way to end (the end of a light comedy at the end, which was probably unnecessary). <br /> <br /> I say "well done" to filmmakers - I've seen 1000 s of worse films!
