I first saw the first feature film by Buster Keaton and I must admit that I liked it very much and I just wanted it to be years ago. Blurb Rohauer first warns that a single imprint of nitrate of the Three Ages was rediscovered and saved in 1954. Just in time before burning, and many frames that seemed hopelessly glued together, were separated. So it is rocky watching in places, but I've seen and survived a lot worse. <br /> <br /> It would be OK as 3 short films, but as a party Intolerance is ingenious and fun from the beginning to the finish: in the Stone Age with the evil Wallace Beera riding on the elephant and a delicious Busterem rides on the brontosaurus; In the Roman age bustery driving on a chariot with wheel locks and adapted for tobogganing, no parking signs in Latin; In this technological Age of Speed ​​Need and Greed his car is beautifully falling into pieces in the first hump. Both he and Beera are a girl for ages, an endless fight. Favorite piece: as a caveman, it is turned back over the edge of the cliff, but it still blows into the camera - an amazing second or two! <br /> <br /> Great things, confirming my love for silent movie comedy.
