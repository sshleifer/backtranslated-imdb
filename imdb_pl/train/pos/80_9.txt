I really enjoyed the meeting! I would rate it at 10 if they had "Hassie" and "Little Luke". There was not even a mention of where they are today or why they did not attend the meeting. They were very popular characters and I think that it was not a mistake to explain their lack of appearance. <br /> <br /> In any case, I was happy that TNN was again leading the series! I have been looking for episodes for years and what a joy to be able to record the whole series (I could miss a few episodes). Jenny Hanahan
