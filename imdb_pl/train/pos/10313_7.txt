China O'Brien (1990) was an attempt to make Cynthia Rothrock a star in the United States. This production of Golden Harvet was directed by veteran director Robert Clouse. Unfortunately, he was lucky with Enter the Dragon or lost touch because he is not so great with the director. The only reason to watch this movie is to see Mrs. Rothrock's and Richard Norton's fighting skills. If this film was directed by Corey Yuen or Hoi Meng, it could have been a classic action instead of a bad action "straight to the film". He has problems with the local crowd and needs her help. He returns home and brings order back (with the help of two unlikely people). But will they be enough to overthrow Mister Big and his bad buddies? <br /> <br /> If you're a big fan of Cynthia Rothrock, this movie is for you. I liked the fighting scenes only, everything else is rubbish. Why did not Raymond Chow spend a few shekels and hire the best action director? <br /> <br /> Recommended.
