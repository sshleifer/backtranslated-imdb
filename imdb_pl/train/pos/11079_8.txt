I always like watching movies that make you think, and not only boils with answers for your audience. "Revolver" is one of those films and although many reviewers have said that it is difficult to follow, with a bit of concentration and an open mind, I have it. First time. It is true that there is no comparison with other hunters, such as "The Usual Suspects" or "Memento", but in itself is an intelligent and inspiring to think film. <br /> <br /> Another thing that I really liked about this movie is how damn beautiful it is. Every scene, every angle of the camera seems to be thought over for centuries. If you see it, you'll know what I mean. <br /> <br /> So, to conclude ... look at it with an open mind and you can enjoy it. If not, well, no one has ever said "Revolver" is for everyone. And this is my 2 cents.
