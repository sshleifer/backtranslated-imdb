This movie has a special way of telling stories, initially I thought it was quite strange because it jumped over time and I had no idea what was going on. <br /> <br /> In any case, the plot was simple but still very real and moving. You met someone for the first time, you fell in love completely, but in the end you broke up and promoted lethal agony. Who has not passed it? but we will never forget this kind of pain in our lives. <br /> <br /> I would say that I am rather moved because two actors showed a great performance showing the love between the characters. I just want this story to be a happy ending.
