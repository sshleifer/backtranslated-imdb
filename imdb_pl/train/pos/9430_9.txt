I am a member of a canoe club and I can tell you that Liberation is a synonym of peace and quiet of this experience. When we put our boats into the water, the banjoes echo in the depths of the conscious mind. This film is timeless because it emphasizes the philosophical place of man in nature and the influence of technology on the relationship between man and nature. We see it in fishing. We see it in a home tent. There is also contempt for man and a sense of superiority to the village forester "cracker". The fact that the banker from Atlanta (Ned Beatty) has "bad teeth" aims to put him on the same level as lumberjacks who also have bad teeth. Ultimately, the struggle for life and death replaces the worshipers of a "civilized man" on the subject of "Law." This canoe trip ends too early for the viewer, but unfortunately soon for the character.
