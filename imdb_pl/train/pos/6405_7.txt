I thought that racism and prejudices against Carl Brashear were grossly exaggerated because of the Hollywood effect. I do not believe that the US Navy is so openly racist. I can not imagine a full captain, a commanding officer who would ever tell his boss to deliberately disappear. He certainly does not risk his life. And there was never a chief non-commissioned officer as shameless prejudice against everyone, but WASP as a DeNiro character. No leader, as sloppy and drunk as he was played, would ever rise to the Master. Cuba Gooding wrote a badly made movie.
