It shows best what I think Jesus really was. most of the films show Jesus as effeminate, lobotomized or tortured. this Jesus laughed, played and was serious when it was necessary. this is the kind of Jesus we can attract to, not the Hollywood version. <br /> <br /> the movie gained some liberties, trying to "fill empty spaces". but fillers did not seem impossible or even unlikely. One thing I could argue was that it never really explained what the Romans had against Jesus (the film showed that the Romans were the main driver of Jesus' death, not that the Jewish authorities were against this idea). <br /> <br /> it seemed that the film was well researched. one example was the unwilling comment on a teenage boy who was called a "brand." it is believed that the sign (or John's mark) was the boy referred to in the garden of Getsemane, whose cloak was removed and escaped naked (sign 14:51). I have the impression that they tried to make the film as accurate (even in the spirit) as possible.
