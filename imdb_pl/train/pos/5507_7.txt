I would not be surprised if Soderbergh was forced to avoid a situation in which the pre-revolutionary Cuba was so corrupt graphically. Just reciting a few statistics will not make you with a younger crowd. Nevertheless, the first part, almost entirely filmed in the jungle, reflects the atmosphere of this place, especially when traveling through the mountainous areas of Cuba. I liked the interpretation of the personality of Che Guevara by Del Toro. And the actor who plays Castro, Bichir, did a great job, against all odds. Of course Soderbergh does not look down on these people, but it is also clear that he will not refer to the "yanquis" far from the recent past. Some of the more important historical aspects contradict what I have read. To my knowledge, Castro did not judge the Soviet Union until all attempts to obtain acceptance from the United States were exhausted. But in other respects he is right, especially when it comes to plundering by expatriates, when the island underwent a different control of the rebels. The country's treasury was left empty.
