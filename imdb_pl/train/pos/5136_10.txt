Maybe the greatest movie about jazz. <br /> <br /> IT IS JUDGE. <br /> <br /> The opening shot still haunts my reverie. <br /> <br /> is wonderful and out of this world. <br /> <br /> Jo Jones is always delighted (see also The Sound of Jazz). <br /> <br /> If you can, find the music; is available on CD. <br /> <br /> All fans of jazz and film noir should study this huge jewel. <br /> <br /> What shadows and light - what music - what hat!
