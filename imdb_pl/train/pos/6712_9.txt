I love Sabrina! This is one of my favorite shows !! My favorite episodes are; the one in which he turns Libby into a maniac, the first episode, the real love episode and most of the rest of the first series. I think the college episodes were not as good as those from high school, but they were better than the last series, which was awful. Valerie was a good character because she was more rounded than Jenny, but Jenny was in great sections. Hilda and Zelda were amazing, and it seemed that there was no explanation of where they were going! Libby was also a good character. I never liked Morgan or Roxy, they just were not as good as her other friends.
