Surprisingly well done in the independent film "Insomniac's Nightmare" presents a surprising picture of what it would be like to suffer from insomnia. Wonderfully written and directed, it creates a dream atmosphere when the viewer is taken away for one night in the life of insomnia. <br /> <br /> In the role of Dominik Monaghan as Jacek, we see everything that sees how long hours of lonely night go on. The narrative is almost hypnotic, and the opening lines can not be reversed. Fascinating and somewhat disturbing, it shows how one deals with the lack of sleep, balancing on the border between mental health and madness. <br /> <br /> With bouncing and cornering in every corner, the nightmarish Insomniac is provocative and addictive. This is very recommended.
