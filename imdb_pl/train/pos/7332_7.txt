I have watched fragments from this childhood, but when I bought the Blue Underground set immediately because of its limited edition, it was only now that I placed it in my watch schedule - mainly because an American POP Bakshi (1981) appeared on the Italian night television (see my Review of this video below)! <br /> <br /> In any case, I thought this movie was a pretty good animated epic with a sword and magic with particularly impressive background (the rather awkward figures with the rotoscope were, albeit less important) with a thrilling, albeit derivative result. The story again was not exactly original, but it turned out to be undeniably engaging at the juvenile level, and the leading figures have developed well - the nefarious Lord of Ice Nekron and the mysterious Darkwolf warrior are particularly interesting; the protagonist and heroine are rather bland stereotypes - but it's hard to complain when Bakshi and Frazetta show a girl as well-equipped (her bra can be torn off for a second) and half-naked to the shoe (her tiny panties are forever disappearing in her ass)! Nevertheless, it is certainly an action-oriented action and certainly provides it on this front (especially in the case of Darkwolf); The final game, although short, is also well treated and sees our heroes astride the pterodactyls attacking the den of the villains in the cave. <br /> <br /> In the long run, in addition to the previously mentioned Frazett scenes, the main appeal of this film for me is now a nostalgia factor, because it brought me back to childhood when watching not only films such as CONAN THE BARBARIAN (1982) and THE BEASTMASTER (1982), but also animated television series such as BLACKSTAR (1981-82) and HE-MAN and MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSITY (1983-85). <br /> <br /> Regarding the accompanying "OGIEÅƒ I LOD" (TV) (Mark Bakshi, 1982) ** 1/2: <br /> <br /> A vintage feature film in an animated film about swords and spells that are only available through the washed VHS print that is owned by Ralph Bakshi himself! It goes into details about the rotoscopic technique, and also shows some examples of live performances (in the studio) of the scenario segments - which would then be tracked, combined with the background and filmed. Still, watching a few behind-the-scenes scenarios about the art of animation (for example in the Disney Tins and Looney Tunes sets), this is not a very attractive piece ...
