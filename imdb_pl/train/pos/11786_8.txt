It's almost a typical Lynch. However, what makes this film a bit unusual for Lynch is the fact that it looks very strict, almost amateurish. But I believe that Lynch does it on purpose to give a greater sense of realism, which serves to increase the intensity of surreal moments. <br /> <br /> However, many of Lynch's common themes are present, such as: floating camera work; haunting music; long (tearing) breaks; hanging curtains; darkened lights getting darker in a slow (almost imperceptible) pace; extreme close-ups; topics of women in trouble; exaggerated, uncompromising, all known characters confronting characters who are desperate, temporarily unaware, in the dark and so on ... <br /> <br /> The performances are great, and short - provocative. As always, Lynch leaves everything to be interpreted. Many questions remain unanswered, and this stimulates the imagination. <br /> <br /> Another Lynch's brilliant effort. I only hope that he will do a few short shorts, more like in Sony Playstation 2 commercials. They have been inspired.
