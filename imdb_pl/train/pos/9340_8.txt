** Possible Spoiler *** Adam Sandler is usually a typemast in comedy, but in "Reign" gives a deeply moving performance. Although there are people who showed courage after September 11, 2001, Sandler plays Fineman, a widower who is lonely and "lost in his own world." Johnson (Cheadle), a practicing dentist, meets his former college friend (Sandler) and wants to catch up in "Old Times". We see how in Rain Man (Dustin Hoffman) Fineman gets emotionally involved in stressful situations and withdraws. The music of older people seems to be a convenience and a "psychological" stilettos on which to resist. <br /> <br /> Johnson is looking for some pleasure in Fineman, which is missing in his Family.He also feels unhappy and unhappy at his job. At the same time, he also wants to make sure that his friend will not fall into the "social cracks". I came from this film with a different look and more sympathetic compassion for saddened families.
