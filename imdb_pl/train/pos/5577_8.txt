I really did not laugh at the movie for a long time. The garbage that recently released Hollywood is bringing me to the wall! This one was definitely fresh and witty. If you look at the demographics for ratings, only a few women voted! I do not want to ruin the movie for you, but I'm sure every guy who saw it ran to his computers to rate it and gave him a poor assessment of why? Because the film puts people in their place, that's why. If more women vote for this movie because of the actual value of humor, and not because it is harmful to men ... it can be a movie with a rating of "7"!
