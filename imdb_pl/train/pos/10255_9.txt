This film is the first of the six infamous guinea pig films and is one of the best. At the same time, it looks realistically and unrealistically, knowing only that the film is fake. The story tells the story of a woman who has been captured and tortured in many different ways. The man at the beginning of the story receives a letter without a return address, which contains a manga video showing torture. People who catch her, check the boundaries of a man before they die. Some scenes are shocking, such as the eyeball scene, and others are not shocking, just like a girl is punched 100 times because you see blows in each movie. This movie has a lot of gore, so I recommend it to people aged 17 or older. <br /> <br /> 9/10
