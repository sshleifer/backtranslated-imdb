Of course, Titanic was a good movie when you saw it for the first time, but you really should see it a second time and your opinion about the movie will definitely change. When you see a movie for the first time, you will see a hidden love story and you will think: ooh, how romantic. The second time (and I'm not the only one who thinks about it) is just annoying and you just sit there watching the movie thinking: When is this ship d ** n flowing? And even this is not so impressive when you see them several times. Acting in this movie is not bad, but it's definitely not great either. Did I feel that DiCaprio did not win an Oscar for this film, I mean who he is, Anthony Hopkins or Denzel Washington? He makes 1 half-good movie and will not make the film for less than 20 million dollars. And then everyone is surprised that there are hardly any films in it. But, in my eyes, the worst character of the film. On the other hand, Kate Winslet's performance was great. I also say that the director is very talented to combine a film of this size together. There is one lesson that you can learn about this film: there are too many love stories, filmmakers should not try to add a sad romance to every movie !!! With 100% possible, I give this film only 71%.
