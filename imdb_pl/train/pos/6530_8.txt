I last read Nancy Drew's book about 20 years ago, so most of my memory about a fictional character is probably flawed. From what I collected, the books were introduced to me in an era in which teens were popular among children growing up at that time (in my case, in the 1980s and early 90s), with Hardy Boys, Famous Five and, of course, , Nancy Drew Carolyn Keene among the most famous. I still remember these hardcover books with very dated cover illustrations, usually quite heavy (for a kid) to wear, and the thickness of the book can be attributed to the fact that the words are printed in large fonts. <br /> <br /> Well, the character received some updates along the way, because I recall that my sister Nancy Drew's next books become less thick, soft-coated, with an updated and more elegant Nancy illustrated on the cover. I do not remember if these stories were the same as old hardback books, but I think these books, written spiritually, have their share in updating themselves on time. <br /> <br /> In this issue of Warner Brothers Nancy Drew, the heroine will undoubtedly get her update to fit the times, but somehow the authors Andrew Fleming and Tiffany Paulsen have retained the sensitivity to a 50-year-old small city, retaining in this a certain charm and taste that would be appreciated by erm, like me. Her sense of fashion, her primitiveness, even the bizarre, small features of behavior that make her, Nancy Drew. <br /> <br /> Her family background remains more or less the same, living with a single parenting father, Carson Drew (Tate Donovan), who moves her daughter and herself to a big city for a better opportunity to work, and put away her daughter from sleep in the city of River Heights. Mum is just a distant memory, and the maid creates a cameo. But what made Nancy Drew work was the cast of Emma Roberts in the lead role. The niece of her famous aunt Julia also has this lively attitude, this unique red hair and this megawatt smile. Her Nancy Drew, while at first you think it is going wrong, it will actually grow up on you. And in almost what I thought could be a rejected scene from Pretty Woman, the characters entered an elegant store with almost opposite reactions. <br /> <br /> While dad Carson Drew is trying to get Nancy out of his dream environment and assimilate the normal life of teenagers, trust Nancy to be in a home whose owner, a Hollywood type, was found murdered in suspicious circumstances. Solving mysteries is her consolation when she discovers that she is the outcast of the local community, and soon we are with her on her big screen adventure. <br /> <br /> There's nothing too black about Dahlia about crime and mystery, and instead it's quite a simple piece to solve Nancy, between making friends with Corky (Josh Flitter), a plump friend from school and calming down a jealous boyfriend Neda (Max Thieriot), hiding the truth about her extra classes from her dad's teaching program. The story is filled with cheap play and old-fashioned sentimentality, which captivates, and together becomes a little like a scooby-doo. With minimal violence and no shootings or explosions, this is a serious species that is clearly marked by the chick chick alarm. <br /> <br /> I think that the film will generate a new generation of fans, revive memories of the old, and probably, probably, can trigger a new trend in fashion for sports loafers.
