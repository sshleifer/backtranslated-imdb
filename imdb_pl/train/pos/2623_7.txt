Actually, I like the original, and this movie has its ups and downs. Here are just a few: <br /> <br /> Oops: most of the original voice has returned. <br /> <br /> Downs: I did not like Ma Timon's voice. I know she did voice in The Simpsons, but the show is simply stupid. <br /> <br /> Oops: We see Simba as a "teenager". <br /> <br /> Downs: They destroyed him in the fight against Timon and Simba. <br /> <br /> Ups: To Rafiki told Timon about "Hakuna Matata." <br /> <br /> Downs: How did Pumba learn about it? <br /> <br /> Oops: Again songs. (some of the original songs were there, but they were just music.) <br /> <br /> Downs: But stupid songs. (a.k.a. Solo Timona.) <br /> <br /> In general, it's a pretty good movie. I recommend it to the fans of the original. But if you do not like the original, you probably will not like this one. <br /> <br /> My result: 7/10
