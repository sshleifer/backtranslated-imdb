When I was six years old, I learned about a series called "Los Campeones" and even if I was just a kid, I did everything I needed to convince my parents to let me watch "The Champions" and "the Avengers" once a week . I think it was the Golden Age of the English series ... (I already have the full cycle "The Prisoner"!), But lasted a few years later "The Tomorrow People", "The Worst Witch" (I'm alone, or it's "Harry Potter "in a girl, of course, before I want" The Campions "to be in Zone 1 or Zone 4, I'm also waiting for" Dr Who "(pack the whole series in a set, uhm, maybe 300 DVDs, please, I could not spend more on that, 8), "People of tomorrow" and a few other "low budgets", but great stories available in my zones, speak and speak English, but not all of my relatives do, including my parents who introduced me to these wonderful stories ... . Dubbing or subtitles, but in the same format as I saw them. Remember that zone 1 or 4 is fine on my TV!
