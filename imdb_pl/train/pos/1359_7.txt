I work in the library and I expected that this movie will appeal to me when it appeared 5 years ago. Well, I really liked Parker Posey (she's a great actress), and Omar Townsend was really cute like her boyfriend (he could not play, but when you look like him, who cares?), But the movie was bad. It was not funny nor sweet or anything. Posey kept the film on the surface thanks to her energy. But she has learned the decimal system Dewey OVERNIGHT, and then puts off a lot of books to the rhythm of music? !!!! ??? Come on! I also had a problem with the way she looked when she became a full-fledged librarian at the end - hair in a bun, glasses, lack of sense of humor - can we let this stereotype work? It's worth seeing for Posey and Townsend, but that's all. The television series was much better.
