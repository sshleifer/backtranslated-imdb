This is the second short video of Baby Burlesk, which will be released and probably the most popular, is a parody of a silent movie from 1926. What Price Glory. <br /> <br /> I watched this and I do not understand child porn, it is claimed. It's just a sweet little movie. I saw family shows that I grew up watching in the 80's and 90's, where little girls dressed more provocatively in a "mature way". It was more provocative because they did not wear diapers. There is nothing provocative in a diaper unless you have one of these fetishes. (only a joke) I read this description of the film and where it states that only a pedophile would like to watch it. This is sick. For me, if you watch it and bother you, then maybe you need to look at your own psyche and try to understand why it bothers you. It's an innocent movie that was made as a parody of another movie. All B.B. films they were parodies, nothing more. Today's parodies / falsifications are graphic and have almost sexually explicit scenes and quite vile language. Is not that more frightening? I can watch these without a problem, but sometimes they take stories for children and turn them into dirt on these parodies. That's what should get under your skin. Not that they would love (and not the word, I know) an adult film from 1926, because we know how PORNOGRAPHIC was these silent films, huh? Not to mention the "forbidden films from the era in front of Hollywood," which are so vile and dirty. They would NEVER do such dirt today? (pay attention to sarcasm)
