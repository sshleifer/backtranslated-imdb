mahatma Gandhi, the father of the nation in pursuit of the struggle for freedom of India, ignored his own family and son, this film concerns his son Hiralal, who feels neglected because of Gandhi's mahatma service to society. The film begins in South Africa, where Mahatma Gandhi works as an advocate and fights the cause of freedom of India against the British. Hirarala arrives in South Africa to help his dad, who is an advocate, because Gandhi was involved in the fight for freedom, he wanted his wife and children also to join in as a service to society, and as a result the hirarlal has no chance to graduate from education and did not pass exams, he married his love (bhoomika Chawla) against his father's wishes. Hiralal has ambitions to travel to England and become an advocate, just like his father, but his own father refuses to give him a scholarship offered to a family by a businessman, and instead gives him to another person, saying that the scholarship should not be limited to his family and should be open to the most deserving student living in the colony. This anger hiralal and the gap between father and son increases, hirarlal hates his father for neglecting him and blames him for being uneducated and unemployed. Hiralal is struggling to make ends meet and land on the streets through unsuccessful business trials and huge debt, he loses his wife and children. Akshaye Khanna gave a stellar performance as Hiralal Gandhi ... all Kudos for him, the direction and scenario are fantastic, the imaging is excellent. overall an excellent movie and must see. I give it 10/10
