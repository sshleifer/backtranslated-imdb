With all "Adult" productions in today's family movies, it's nice to see one where you do not have to worry about it and you can just sit back and enjoy the family with children. Yes, this video may have some curses (there is a time when Knox swears, but it does not allow you to hear the full words), but most of the movie is really clean and the way it appeared (including movies back in the day). What's more, it is very pleasant, one of my favorites and just a great clean and funny movie to watch with your family. <br /> <br /> The only thing I have against this movie is that it is too short and I would like there to be more memorable parts in it, I will not mention them because I do not want any spoilers here. <br /> <br /> In total, nicely done and a great movie to watch; so go out and take the kids, make cookies and watch this movie!
