I did not expect much when I saw the DVD cover for the first time. I mean, Pierce Brosnan as a Gray Owl ?? I was surprised and delighted with this (in fact) true story. I wanted to read more about this fascinating character, which means that the director has achieved his goal and the film has been successful!
