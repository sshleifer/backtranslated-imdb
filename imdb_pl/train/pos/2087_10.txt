This movie was released in the year in which I was born and I will be, like me, in 2007. In 2007, I watched it again last night, not seeing it since high school. Though he was full of sentiment for 30 years and acting was a bit stereotypical, it was great. The story of Pearl S. Buck came to life thanks to the magic of chemistry Luise Rainer and Paul Muni. The novel that brought Miss Buck a Nobel Prize for literature comes alive under the baton of Sydney Franklin, which along with the excellent script tells the story of farmer Wang Lung, whose father receives for him a bride, a slave from the kitchen of the local owner. In the story of Buck, Wang's success confirms his readiness to listen to his wife most of the time and love for the earth. In the end, he realizes that his wife, like the earth, is the source of his wealth, happiness and immortality. Buck's stories have always had strong women thrown in a critical place to influence the outcome of events in the pre-conflict world. Luise Rainer, born in Germany, enlivens a timid, but determined peasant woman, playing the character of Olan. Muni also gives a naive but honorable Wang, eventually caught between two worlds rich and peasant. Other classic characters include Charlie Grapewin, Kansan's uncle Henry Dorothy Gale of the Wizard of Oz, Walter Connelly as the meowing, uncle uncle and Keye Luke as the number one son - but not Charlie Chan this time. <br /> <br /> A classic can be defined as a movie that you can watch repeatedly and never get tired. If it really is, this film is a classic, no doubt.
