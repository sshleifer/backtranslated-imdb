This film is not morbid or depressing. It is sad because Aids was sad in the early 90s. But his true message is love and perseverance. <br /> <br /> Mark and Tom were in a long-term, loving relationship. Their devotion to each other is visible immediately, and because the destruction of AIDS intensifies and becomes the focal point of their lives, you see strength and commitment that are truly cordial. <br /> <br /> When "Silverlake Life" was originally released, I was deeply involved in education about HIV / AIDS and healthcare as a volunteer as an advisor in the HIV / AIDS clinic. The film spoke to me like no other AIDS movie that day, because Mark and Tom were real people, experiencing the experiences I saw in real life every day. I knew from first-hand experience what it is like to watch AIDS formerly eating living, young, healthy people; seeing how it happened with Mark and Tom in the movie, I was very reminded of how my real friends are getting worse. It touched me in a way that, even all these years, still influences me.
