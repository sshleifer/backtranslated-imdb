PUT THE CAMERA ON ME is a deceptively sweet movie. In fact, it is a complex look at children's psychology and offers an interesting perspective on the development of adults and artists. At first glance, it is a nostalgic look at some home movies made in the '80s by a group of children from a higher class neighborhood. One of the movie directors, Darren Stein, had access to a video camera and quickly took over the role of the artistic leader of all films. Sure, these are just some cute children playing. But that is also much more. It is a look at some moments at a time when children are struggling with many confusing problems that we all have in life - fear, sexual awakening, unrequited love, loneliness and simply trying to understand the adult world that seems to explode around us. As we age, we forget how the realities of life were exaggerated when we were small. <br /> <br /> What makes the film even more important is watching the young Darren Stein in a small general filmmaker. It is clear that Darren runs the program, and these small films are his vision, but everyone is informed by friends, their problems, interpersonal dynamics and the general confusion associated with the horrors of adult life. Many children make home movies, but I have never heard children create "small" films about the holocaust, homosexuality, nuclear war and inability to match and make friends. These children are dealing with heavy things! <br /> <br /> The power of this movie is the way Stein and Shell combine different scenes so closely with conducting interviews with children --- now all adults and all friends. It adds a new angle to the film. How many of us have been in touch with our childhood friends? These guys have. And many of the problems they faced are still between them two decades later. <br /> <br /> Among the conflicts - the confession denies that the heart is still broken, very normal childhood sexual experience is still a "sticky" topic between two men, lasting injuries due to the dynamics of the relationship and is still a member of this team who remains very responsible and is the center of attention! Which makes sense when you see progress in home movies over several years. Darren Stein is a director. There is no doubt. <br /> <br /> Stein and Shell talk to each other from time to time and you can not imagine the awkwardness that allows us to look into the young life of these people. This is especially true for Stein, who has been a great success in the entertainment industry as a film producer, screenwriter and director. From the first moment PUT THE CAMERA ON ME, we see the appearance of a gay boy trying to understand all this. We also see pages of artistic mind and personality that are not always "nice" or "caring" --- and this is a bold step for any artist who shares with the audience. <br /> <br /> There are so many revealing moments, but the most disturbing and complex moments include a movie in which we see a victim of a Jewish concentration camp tortured and murdered by the Nazi. We discover interviews and narratives that the Nazi plays a Jewish child, and part of the victim is played by a gentile child. This is a painfully disturbing moment that penetrates the dark side of fear and the way in which children work in the horrors of the adult world, which are beyond adult understanding much less than a child. <br /> <br /> It's much more than some home movies. This film documents the pain, beauty, joy and sadness of growing up. Powerful things --- and worth seeing! <br /> <br />:
