I am glad that other people liked this movie because I know that it does not have the greatest reputation and did not earn money at the box office. I thought it was great and there are several reasons why Bogdanovich manages the lightest accents, the cast (especially Coleen Camp) is perfect, and Big Bad Apple has never looked better on the movie. You've seen worse movies!
