History and music (George Gershwin!) They are wonderful, like Levant, Guetary, Foch and of course Kelly. One thing is missing, and this thing is a good leading lady. I'm sorry, Leslie Caron worries me. In any case, despite her, the plot moves nicely with the famous (and deservedly) Ballet. Oh colors, dazzling reds, blues, greens and yellows. Do not forget about beigas. ; ) I love the contrast between Beaux Arts Ball (completely black and white costumes) and always such a brilliant Ballet. <br /> <br /> I suppose that what I am trying to say is: please, look at it at all costs and enjoy it, because although it is not the best, it is WONDERFUL. But do not forget about another Gene Kelly musical with a 20-year-old girl who was catapulted to fame soon after.
