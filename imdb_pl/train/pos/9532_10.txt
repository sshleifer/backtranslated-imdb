I really enjoyed this movie ... time devoted to the development of heroes, attention to detail, great performances, great lighting and photos, great soundtrack ... <br /> <br /> combined intensity and lightness of touch, which will not work for anyone who wants a typical fast traffic. If we lived in Elizabethan times, I would say that this movie is a bit like Shakespeare's tragedy. But if we do not do it, let's say it's more of a drama movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple, but the story is complex. The film is intelligent in the way relationships and problems are studied. Much of the story is shown, not told, which in my opinion makes it more subtle and moving - and which works well with a story based on a comic (or graphic novel). Sometimes I felt that I was there in the thirties, part of this story - it was such a realistic, but dreamlike quality in the style of her story. <br /> <br /> I do not prefer movies than the books on which they were based, but in this case I do. (Although I liked this book, too.) I bought a DVD, which is great because it has some great deleted scenes and insightful comments. <br /> <br /> (I also took my little cousin who is a bit younger than the boy in the movie to see him after I saw him for the first time because he has problems at home and I wanted to use it as a way to start discussions about father's and son's problems - and discussion.)
