Well, before I saw this movie, I was not sure if it would be my cup of tea ... how wrong I was! I thought it was one of the best films I've watched for a long time, a real family classic. This story of a young evacuee and his new "adoptive" dad meets all the requirements. I have not read the book (maybe this is a good thing and meant that I liked the movie more), but when it comes to history, I really can not think of any bad points, so I scored 10 out of 10 (and I almost thought that whatever highest notes!). Before William announced, "WE CAN RIDE MY BICYCLE, Dad!" I was sobbing my heart (everyone who saw it, understood, I'm sure). I really hot and definitely recommend it.
