It should be illegal to not experience this extremely entertaining show with Eddie Murphy. I've never seen anything like it. <br /> <br /> Murphy takes almost 70 minutes about dicks, pussies, tits and many other famous people, including his own "family". The people who got it are: Elvis, Mr.T, Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, Mick Jagger, Luther Vandross and James Brown. I have never really laughed so hard with my whole life. I mean, when someone does not know who Mr. T is, but he still laughs so much about Murphy as Mr. T, there's something about it. At the time I saw the program, I did not remember who T. was, but he still laughed. Now I know who he is and it makes him so much more fun. Because that's what Eddie does - he can make these impressions so good that it does not matter who the hell tries to do it is still fun. In addition, we find out that Murphy is really a very good singer. Please look ...
