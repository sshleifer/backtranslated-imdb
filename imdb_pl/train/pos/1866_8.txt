A great story, based on a true story about the young Negro and all the difficulties on the road. Since this is the first movie of Denzel Washington, which he himself had to direct, I must admit that I was a bit skeptical, but who would not be ...? But on the other hand, he is a great actor with many years of experience, and the end result turned out to be great. The story is told in a great way, making you had difficulties in childhood, and young adulthood, see yourself in these situations. So he hits you hard, letting you know that you're not the only one who goes through hell. In summary, a moving story about a young man who is trying to do it in this crazy world. (The story is based on the life of Antwone Fisher, born on August 3, 1959, Cleveland, Ohio, USA, who was also the author of the movie). 8/10
