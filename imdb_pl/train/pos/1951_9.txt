A single mother (Diane Keaton) discovers that she works on several positions with minimum wages. When she is released, she discovers that she is unable to support her sons (Michael Seater and Colin Roberts), the latter of which has asthma. Then she goes to her friend and starts selling drugs. He soon becomes addicted to the drugs he sells. Her life falls, especially when her children, namely her eldest son, learn the truth and threaten her with leaving her. Then he fights for redemption with the help of his children, but can he protect his family from the drug lords she worked for? <br /> <br /> Wow! This movie from life has one of the best actors I've ever seen! Diane Keaton is very worried and her character is crazy, but she was extremely persuasive. It is much better suited to drama than comedy. However, the best performance in the film comes from Michael Seater, who plays his eldest son. He is perfect as a responsible son who is still young but tries to be an adult in the family. His acting was especially great in the scenes in which he confronts his mother with drugs. Colin Roberts, who plays the younger son, also does a great job. <br /> <br /> A movie worth watching, especially due to the acting of Michael Seater and Diane Keaton!
