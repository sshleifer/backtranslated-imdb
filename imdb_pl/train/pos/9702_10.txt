the city of Royston Vasey is a strange but wonderful place. Characters would simply be bad and too disturbing, but fantastically brilliant writing means it works and works very well. Most people will meet others with a bit of character, but hopefully no one knows people with extreme personalities such as Tubbs and Edward, weirdly hated owners of a local store or obsessively drunk Paulina who treats "scumbags" with great contempt. These are just a few strange inhabitants. TV works consist of three series and a Christmas exception. There are references to many horror movies, such as a wicker man. A new addition to the scope of works is the movie, the league of gentlemen of the apocalypse, which I will not say much about, but I highly recommend it. In summary, the gentlemen's league is a fun comedy program with a brilliant handwriting and brilliant characters. I would definitely say it's worth watching because you will not regret it!
