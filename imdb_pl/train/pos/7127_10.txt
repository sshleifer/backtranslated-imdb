A wonderful film that once again coped with the trials and suffering of the First World War in England. What makes this film so good is touching the human element. This film is definitely in the tradition of such British classics as "Mrs. Miniver "and" Hope and Glory ". As with this film, we see the desperation of people during the war. <br /> <br /> The performances here are excellent, especially because of the embittered John Thawe, who was assigned a child who was evacuated from the London attack. <br /> <br /> Soon we see why this child is wetting the bed. He comes from a crazy mother who has abused him terribly. <br /> <br /> An old man takes a child and brings happiness to his sad life. When the child returns to his mother, the old man goes to London and looks for him only to find a tragedy. He literally kidnaps the boy and is able to convince the superior that the child is better with him than at the boy's home. <br /> <br /> The picture is so good because it concerns and is based on engaging relations.
