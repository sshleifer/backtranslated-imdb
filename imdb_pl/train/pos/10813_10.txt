I turned it on to see the amazing Ethel Waters whose autobiography I read now. I admit that my jaw dropped when pork chops and watermelon started to appear, but people can not look at this film as a stereotypical or racist song. It's a short film made by blacks, for blacks in times when the entertainment industry was quite segregated, and stereotypes for people were jokes from their time, old trends exaggerated with humor. We see modern black movies doing the same, but with new trends (stereotypes), "ho" and "hoodie" and so on. I think if you look back on eighty years, you'll find that today's films will look just as racist. What the viewers should appreciate in this film is the talents of Waters and the mug of Sammy Davis Jr., who records his contemporary Shirley Temple and looks very much the same as in adult life. Everyone involved in this movie had a great time creating it. Why not enjoy what it is instead of what you think it should be?
