It is a drama based on a real character and story on a level that shakes most of what we see on television. <br /> <br /> I was impressed from the very beginning. Do not be discouraged if you are not a sci fi fanatic (like me ...) It can happen on Earth, and the fact that it is in another galaxy makes the show more interesting. there are no spacecraft or laser guns (In any case not yet) So far I have seen to s01 e04 and I am calm and I wonder what will happen next, because there are so many possibilities. <br /> <br /> The cast has roles with the pasion there. Eric Stoltz is particularly strong. <br /> <br /> This show really stands alone, it does not matter if you watched BSG or not, in fact they are quite different. I read some negative reviews from sci fi freaks who expected less drama and more aliens and ray guns etc. But I would say ignore them. <br /> <br /> This is a really positive beginning of the series. Let's hope that they will not succeed after 1 or 2 seasons, as is usually the case with good performances.
