Several summer campers were accidentally sent into space by a robot. And the oxygen on the ship was short. They had to send someone to a space station to get gas tanks, etc. <br /> <br /> First of all, the plot of this film is not possible in real life. But it gives you a warm feeling of everything that is possible if you turn on your heart. <br /> <br /> It's amazing to see these young actors who still look the same after all these years. (I saw this movie for the first time in 2000, it was filmed in 1986). There are a lot of people in the film who are still working in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The view was great with space. It does not look unreal. It takes about 2 hours, works so fast that you will not even notice. You know that this is not real, but you just drag them to the end. <br /> <br /> Generally it's a good family movie. <br /> <br />
