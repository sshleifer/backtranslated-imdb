I definitely needed some work in season 2. Such as the virus between Max and Logan and Ames White along with his ancient, super cult. However, in the second season, the only thing that watched me was to see if Max and Logan ever get rid of the nasty virus infecting Max. Very good drama in the second season. But of course, like all TV shows, if there's something wrong with it, the broadcast company picks up. I was seriously hoping for the third and last season. Season 2 leaves you suspended, unless you read the books of Max Allan Collins, then you will know what will happen. <br /> <br /> The Dark Angel should be drawn back for one season, even if it can only cost you to get all the original actors back. since Jessica Alba's concert heaven shot out after the concert. If so, then there should be a movie to complete it. like the Firefly show, which of course was also canceled by FOX.
