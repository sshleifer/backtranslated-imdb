Do not be fooled by anyone. It's a wonderfully scary movie. It was a work project for the scriptwriter / director, JT Petty. He did a great job with me on the edge of my seat. I never knew what to expect, and for the bored viewer of horror is Nirvana! The film concerns an elderly man who lives in an isolated hut in the forest. One day, looking for your cat in the forest, is a witness to the murder of a child, or maybe? The rest of the movie is tormenting about it. The most unusual in this film is that there is no dialogue here for the last few scenes. I found it intriguing. The writer manages to capture his senses and gives them continuous jerking. Give this movie away, you will not be disappointed.
