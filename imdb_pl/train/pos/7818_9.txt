I think the context of this story was discussed by other posters, so I would like to write about the influence that this movie had on me. <br /> <br /> For the first time I saw this movie in the year of its release around 1987. My school organized a trip to the cinema to see, I think, the RE project. Of course, we all got excited because we were on a school trip to the cinema! We did not know what we would be going through. To this day, I remember the feelings he caused in me and I remember how much I cried, as did most of my friends. I think that in the century in which we were, it turned out to be shocking and quiet, justly outraged by our youthful way. It had such an impact on me that I joined the Anti Apartheid movement in the same year. it served in my case.
