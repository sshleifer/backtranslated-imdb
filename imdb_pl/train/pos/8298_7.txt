INVITATION TO HELL is better than the typical TV movie "CALL TO HELL" (Urich, Lucci, Cassidy, McCarthy, pre-Murphy Brown Joe Regalbuto, Soleil Moon-Frye) and the high concept of the famous Faustian story. Urich is always likeable, and Lucci is especially attractive and devilish in the mother of all femme fatale roles. Like the hybrid version of STEPFORD WIVES and THEY LIVE, the film engages very early in the apocalyptic Miltonesque, and fans of horror movies probably will not have many discomforts until sappy, maudlin denoument. 7/10
