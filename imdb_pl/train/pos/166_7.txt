It was the first movie Joan Crawford and Clark Gable did together and did a few more. Crawford plays the role of a young, rich girl whose father is killed during the stock market crash and nothing has left her or her brother. They've never worked before, and Brother William Bakewell gets a job at Gable, who's a gangster, and Bakewell thinks it's going to be an easy job, but it's coming down fast. Crawford becomes a reporter in the newspaper, but he wants to work on big stories, but he gets worthless things to do. It's a massacre that killed several of Gable's men, and Crawford witnessed the whole thing. It's a good movie, but not the best.
