The first series of Lost began with a bang ... literally and slowly reduced the pace. This could have turned off some viewers, and people who started watching in the middle would be bored or simply confused. <br /> <br /> I would advise new people in the world of Lost just to watch from the beginning and not detach from the slower episodes. Acting is excellent, but why are there 5 series planned ... WHY ?? All this means that there will be no answer for at least 4 years, well, I will watch if he will maintain tension and dialogue will flow.
