I saw this movie some time ago, after ordering it for my friend who is a huge fan of Dominic Monaghan. The film itself was very interesting, although it had its positive side, which for me was a kind of "wtf?" Donna Darko. factor after the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Of course with positive negative points. For me, the young girl in the movie was incredibly good, and Dominic Monaghan did a good job. Unfortunately, I do not have an opinion about Daniel Burke, who played Lonnie. It may be me and I'm not saying that I'm a serious critic in a way I'm not qualified enough, but he just did not seem convincing as an actor. But maybe it's even more striking, because although I'm not a critic, it draws my attention. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I think it is definitely a movie that is worth watching. It's interesting, confusing, and you should see it.
