California appeared in 1993, just like three of the four main characters achieved the level of fame they now have in 2006. It is a nice psycho-thriller, which should appeal to all fans of David Duchovny because of his dry and intelligent narratives that go to his work, like most of his episodes of X-Files, Playing God and Red Shoe Diaries. <br /> <br /> People who were discouraged by Brad Pitt's heavy southern accent and Juliette Lewis's characters apparently never spent much time in the south. For every "Brian and Carrie" in the south is "Adele and Early", and in 2006 it is a real horror of the film. <br /> <br /> Besides, I think that the movie was written with the cult movie intention - as in the case of Carrie's photography, it is not suitable for mass consumption. But if you have a copy of it in your personal library, I think it says something positive about your preferences for bizarre movies.
