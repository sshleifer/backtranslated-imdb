It's an amazing movie and all actors and actresses and very good! Although some actors and actresses were not very popular in show business, it seemed that they had been playing since the first year of their life! It was fun, disgusting and just a very good movie. In most cases, I just did not know what would happen next! I was as I think it will happen, wait, I think it will happen. All age groups will love this movie! In some parts I could not stop laughing, it was so funny, but in some parts I was totally disgusting and I could not believe what I saw! I will definitely see this movie again! This is one of those movies where you can not get bored. Every time you see it is so uncertain. I definitely recommend watching this movie !!
