This is a very clever idea for the entire movie from the 1960s. Humor is quite mild, but it grew much more than I expected. The cast is first-rate and it seems that they are having a great time. Ustinov wanders through the movie, muttering some funny things under his breath, and it's all very unimportant; I will buy a movie as soon as it appears on DVD. The plot lies in the fact that Ustinov was an offender who was released from prison in the form of a computer savage and misappropriated money to an American company based in London. Maggie Smith is his secretary for a while, and watching her release from many different professions is part of the fun. Bob Newhart is his usual death personality, and Karl Malden is enjoying himself as a dense and poor executive director of an office in London. The ending is fun and nicely cynical.
