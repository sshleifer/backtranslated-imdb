This film is really authentic and casual. It's really hard to find such movies in bundles of movies now in Hollywood. I really like watching this movie, I bought his DVD on Tuesday this week and watched it 4 times. I love the spangled accent of Paz, it's just sweet like her. And her acting and Morgana are so funny and natural. <br /> <br /> My movie taste can be really different from others, but I must say that I really love this movie, this simple one is the best! <br /> <br /> I learned something more about the life of this film (well, at least life in the US) ... life is really random ... Sometimes you meet someone, pass your life and are accidentally your friends, and you do not spend too much time with them, maybe only for a moment, but enjoy them "while" "and then you and they will never meet again, but the time you are together is truly unforgettable. Just keep those moments in mind as grateful and nice memories ... <br /> <br /> This movie can be cheap, but its meaning is not completely cheap. I rarely learn something from movies, but this is an exception.
