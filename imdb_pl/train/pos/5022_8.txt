Frailty - 8/10 - This is not a sensational title and heading "Bill Paxton Directs", it is quite a good old-fashioned thriller of biblical horror. Ultimately, this may be just an inbred Southern Gothic cousin from Kubrick's The Shining --- but hey, it's a pretty fucking funny concept. It also has a good story ... and a very suggestive moral message. It is a kind of film that in a few years people will catch late at night on a basic cable and will scare the bee out of watching them. It is a pity that director Bill Paxton had to rent himself to play the stars ... well ... he is still the devil of a good rent.
