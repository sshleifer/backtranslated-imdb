I loved "Dan in real life". A great story to travel to love, like You've Got Mail or While You Were Sleeping, but not ridiculously full of sight of gags and primitive jokes, and not so romantic that makes you want to quit. <br /> <br /> Dan Burns (Steven Carrell) is a popular columnist who seems to be giving him nothing in life. Until one day, during a family meeting / trip, he meets and instantly connects with Marie (always beautiful Juliette Binoche) a radiant specimen of a woman who seems to be bound in a foggy filter, returning to the stars in a classic cinema. Chemistry happens with a cup of tea and muffins, but Marie must be excluded from the previous commitment and must part. <br /> <br /> Later we are treated to Dan's close-knit, loving relatives who not only eat large breakfasts together, but also enjoy using smart and sweet Dan as a backside of many bachelor jokes. I liked it so much that although family characteristics can be seen as disgusting to some, I thought it was a great portrait of a large family that does not go into a parody or a severe exaggeration. The Burns family is simply a close, loving group of people who are really interested in what's best for Dan. There are wonderfully awkward family moments that are not unrealistic. The family is nosy, but it is never malicious or gossip; bizarre, but never bizarre. <br /> <br /> And then Dan falls in love with his brother's girlfriend, whom he brought to a family gathering. And so begins the roller coaster of restrained longing and funny love budding. <br /> <br /> I could continue, but I thought that this movie was just amazing. He is not particularly "hip" or "smart", he is never too expressive and is obsessed with dry humor or biting wit, like many comedies in contemporary cinema. There is a balance between telling a story and a funny but real dialogue. in fact, at the beginning of the movie, the initial spark of love begins with a capricious discussion in a classic Hollywood-style conversation in which the characters speak what they think aloud. <br /> <br /> So I probably wandered and repeated myself, but I highly recommend "Dan in real life". It's a great dating movie, believe me, you'll laugh and only if you're a geek like me, you'll have some tears. Filled with fun and magical love "Dan in Real Life" will not disappoint. <br /> <br /> =================== 3.5 of 4 Stars Rating: A
