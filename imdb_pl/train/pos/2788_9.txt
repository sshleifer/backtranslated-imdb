These are so-called "well-being" films, but in some way I was sad. Why? Because I had talent, but my parents did not let me study in the sports academy, and also the fact that at the age of 12 I decided to quit football. <br /> <br /> And football is the red line in this movie. Together with the struggle of the young with the expectations of parents. Anglo-Indian girl and her parents, with their traditions and strong family ties, and on the other hand, an English family with a daughter who dresses like a boy and plays football ... a connection that worries mother! This film also shows the lives of ordinary people, as well as the Indian community in England. It's about believing in your dreams and living your life (where we've heard it before). <br /> <br /> Paraminder Nagra (beautiful woman!) Plays Yasminda, a girl who is not interested in boys, new clothes, makeup and typical 17-year-old girls. Unlike her sister Pinky, complete the contrasts of Yasminda. <br /> <br /> The real thing is to see how a young beautiful girl struggles with the traditions of her parents and finally finds happiness. With great music from Blondie, Curtis Mayfield, Texas, Melanie C, and also Indian hits. <br /> <br /> Pleasant to watch, but if you, like me, played football and never got to the top, then this movie will make you melachonem.
