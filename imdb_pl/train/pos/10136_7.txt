This is one of the best episodes from the second MOH season. I think Mick Garris has a problem with women ... He killed them all, they are often victims (Screwfly, Pro-life solution, Valerie on the stairs, I do not remember the Argento season in season 1, of course, Imprint). I think she likes to watch women smoked, tortured, maimed and I do not know. At least "Right to die" is one of the best, with good turns and graphic scenes and tension (especially with pictures from the mobile scene, wonderful). Acting is like a whole series, regular could be the worst as "Pro-life" or "We scream for Ice cream". I also think that the story could be shot on a film, not just an episode. The ideology of this series is horrible, killing and killing women, mutilating animals and further ... in the first season it was better than in the second with episodes such as "Cigarrette burns", "Homecoming", "Imprint "(Really shocking).
