A sweet young mountain man with a sad past (Henry Thomas) runs into an abandoned daughter in the forest and falls in love with her immediately. Older cities generally support him in maintaining the child, although the local temptress (Cara Seymour) thinks little about the new family. A determined little girl on a long walk and a sinister salesman (David Strathairn at his creep) have parallel stories that coincide in a terrible way. This is a charming piece of life in Ozarks in the same style as "Where The Lillies Bloom" and "The Dollmaker". All three have been filmed on these beautiful hills and include the lives of simple-minded - but not simple - American people. A minimum of strong language and short but sharp violence make watching the family safe.
