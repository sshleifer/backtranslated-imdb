First of all, I will not praise the short IÃ±arritu movie, I am even Mexican and I am proud of its success in the mainstream Hollywood. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I see that most reviews focus on their favorite (and not so) short films; but we forget that there is a subtle bottom line that circles the entire compilation and maybe it will not be as pleasant for Americans. (Even if it was not the main purpose of the producers) <br /> <br /> I am saying that most short films do not show the suffering that WASP people went through, because the terrorist attack in September 11, but the suffering of other people. <br /> <br /> Do you need proof of what I say? In a short film in Bosnia, the message is: "You are crying because of people who died in towers, but we (Others = Europeans from the East) cry long ago for the crimes committed against our women and no one pays attention to us, just like the whole world he did. " <br /> <br /> Even if the story of Burkina Fasso is more comedic, the same idea is: "You are angry because Osama Bin Laden has hit you in a bad way, but we (Others = Africans) should be more angry because our people are dying of hunger, poverty and AIDS a long time ago and nobody pays attention to us, just as the whole world did to you. " <br /> <br /> Now look at Sean Penn's shortcut: The fall of Twin Towers makes a lonely (and alienated) man happy. So the message is that Power and Greed (symbolized by the Towers) must fall so that people can see the rising sun and the flowers bloom? It is unusual that this terrible result was proposed by an American. There is so much irony in this short film that it is close to overturning. <br /> <br /> Well, Ken Loach (very famous because his ideology of anti-capitalism) is much more clear and shameless, going straight to the point: "You are angry because your country has been attacked by evil forces, but we (Others = Latin Americans) we suffered at the worst in a similar time and no one remembers our sorrow, how the whole world has done to you. " <br /> <br /> It's like the creator of this project wanted to tell the Americans: "You see, America now? You are not the only victims of violence in the world, you are not alone in your pain, and by the way, we (Others = Americans) have been suffering a lot more than you for a long time, so we solidarise with you in your pain ... By the way, I'm sorry because you had some taste of your own medicine. "Only Mexican and French short films showed compassion and compassion for the American people; the others are like a slap on the American state that is not equal to the American people.
