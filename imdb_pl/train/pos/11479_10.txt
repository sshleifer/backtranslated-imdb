This movie was perfect, a little scary, but perfect in it. For those who have heard about Colombia and know the story, it gives an idea of ​​what and why these children did what they did. You know deep inside that people think about these things, but you never realize how bad it is, and this movie makes you aware. It's really good. It also makes you think twice before you make fun of someone who is for sure. I read a book about the colombian massacre and made me think that this movie makes me worried and scares me to death. On the other hand, it's like killing someone for serial killers. I recently received a threat and I could not do it, but after this movie I think that you should take everything seriously. Some people are crazy and you never really know who they are, so take it seriously and underestimate someone.
