This drama is different from sex and the city, where women drink a few drinks and share their sexual encounters. It is much more personal and people can refer to it. It is much more immersive and emotional at a new level than other dramas focusing on women and their lives, such as "Seks w mieście, Dżungla Szminka ...." <br /> <br /> Katie Roden, a psychologist with a dark secret, seems to be much more depressed and guilty than the rest of her 3 friends. He is dealing with the death of his ex-lover, who was her patient when he fought with his son's courtship. Her dark clothes and empty and cold house reflect her emotions very well. <br /> <br /> Trudi Malloy, widow, fights with the "release" of his deceased husband on September 11. And when handsome stranger Richard turns out to be interested in her, she suddenly becomes forced to check reality by her friends who suggest that she is returning to a dating company. The funny and embarrassing scenes connecting Richard and Trudi are absolutely fun! The interesting thing is that Richard asks her on the day she got millions from the board 9/11 for her husband's death ... he sees his intentions. <br /> <br /> Siobhan Dillon, the lawyer has enough about her love tactics husband who only relate to "doing a child" (because they have trouble conceiving) and quickly falls into a friend who is too eager to give him his "services" and does not hesitate long! I wonder if she'll continue affair with her husband (played by Raze Jeffrey) Jessica, a real estate woman, is lonely and simple until she's got a lesbian wedding and she's having an affair with one of them. Her character is shown as a brave and provocative woman who, before her lesbian encounter, has sex with a "married man", her colleague. Let's see where her character goes ... <br /> <br /> The beauty of this drama is that we were shown 4 completely different women with different scenarios whose ambitions and inhibitions are shown. It's good that drama reveals the fact that sometimes friends lie to each other to be "safe"!
