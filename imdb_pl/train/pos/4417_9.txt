This film is a lyrical-romantic memory told through the eyes of an eleven-year-old boy living in a rural Cuban city in the year of the Castro revolution. This is, of course, a true and dignified work of love. <br /> <br /> The names CUBA LIBRE and CUBAN BLOOD are only attempts to mislead this on the market as an action movie. DREAM JULIA has a lot more sense. It has more to do with European cinema than with RAMBO, and the revolution is just an inconvenience to everyday life and people's activities. This fact alone makes the film more honest than most of the works devoted to this period in the history of Cuba. <br /> <br /> Excessive narrative narrator undermines the story, but the movie makes up for it with unqualified Hollywood movie clips that speak a lot more visually than a narrator could. <br /> <br /> Comparing with CINEMA PARADISO and being a fair game, because the movie waxes melancholy about movies, but there is fear of losing a lifestyle that exceeds lost love. <br /> <br /> The revolution, like the JULIE movie, never ends.
