(You'll find out what I mean after you saw Red Eye ...) <br /> <br /> In general, the Red Eye was a better-than-expected thriller. It starts slowly and slowly builds up. But before it's over, it's a thumper! <br /> <br /> It's difficult to determine exactly what makes this thriller ... exciting as I found it. It's just that the director just did a reliable job, pulling you into action that would otherwise be a simple storyline. I'd rather forget that I was watching a movie. That says a lot. <br /> <br /> I think other factors are the "closeness" of the victim and the evil ... and that in time you really start to refer to the victim. A small 8 out of 10, more like 7.5 ... but that's pretty good!
