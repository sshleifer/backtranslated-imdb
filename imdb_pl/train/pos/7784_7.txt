It was great! Photography, editing, photos, music merged to transfer us to the dangerous side of the tourist destination. It was a pleasure to "slumming" without going through danger. We were there! Dream sequences and flashback sequences were fresh. He talked to me. Keep it up! Another of this species is the City of God. Also - do not laugh! - comedy Desperately Seeking Susan. Nice types of bands, with excellent performances of all. Unfortunately, I think Training Day also suits this genre with fantastic band performances. I had to switch the channel to some raw sequences, but all in all a great movie!
