John Garfield plays Marine, who is blinded by a grenade during a fight at Guadalcanal and who must learn to live with his disability. He has all the stereotypical ideas about blindness and is sure that he will be a burden for everyone. The hospital staff and his wounded Marines can not reach it. His girlfriend can not return to the house played by Eleanor Parker. He is stubborn and blinded by his own fears, self-pity and prejudices. This is a complex role that Garfield perfectly remembers in a great performance that makes him watch despite the ever-present syrupy melodrama. The best scenes are on Guadalcanal, where he is in the machine gun slot, trying to repulse the pushing Japanese soldiers in a hellish-looking night battle, and later a sequence of dreams in the hospital, where he sees himself walking on the platform with a white stick, dark glasses and a tin cup all the time his girlfriend walks away from the camera.
