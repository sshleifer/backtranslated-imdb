Let me start by saying that I am very happy with this climax of the Bourne trilogy. Please, oh, please do not ruin this by doing a sequel of years from now or prequel. Just leave it alone. Actually ... still. As talented and versatile as Matt Damon ... it looks like he just had to play Jason Bourne. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of the first two Bourne movies, you will not be disappointed with the third part. He keeps what works and adds a little more. I was very pleased to see how well all the information obtained in "Identity" and "Supremacy" is visible in the "Ultimatum", and finally paint a full picture of Jason Bourne's turbulent past. The action sequences are quick and keep you on the edge of the seat. The battles between Bourne and the killers are always pleasant to watch. I've always been a fan of movies surrounding CIA agents and how the CIA collects its Intel, and this movie is on the same street, making it even more exciting. <br /> <br /> If you decide to watch The Bourne Ultimatum without watching the previous 2 parts. You will still enjoy the movie, but I would still recommend that you watch it first. It will allow you to fully understand the character of Jason Bourne and become part of his world. This allows you to appreciate and enjoy the movie even more. I'm not sure which one is better from the first 2, but I personally think that the "Ultimatum" can, just CAN, have an advantage when comparing the trilogy.
