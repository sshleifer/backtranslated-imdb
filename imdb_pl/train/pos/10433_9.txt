The American boy Jesse took a train to Vienna to get on a plane to the USA. On the train he met Celine, a French girl. Although they met for the first time, they talked like good friends. When the train stopped in Vienna, Jesse begged Celine to accompany him on a tour of Vienna. Then a romantic story developed. <br /> <br /> They were initially cautious. The funniest scene was their listening to a CD in a music store. They glanced at each other, though their eyes did not touch. After a thorough conversation, the relationship became close. Then I saw the most romantic scene they pretended to call their friends. Their deep love for each other was expressed entirely by words. <br /> <br /> Love is a strange thing. When you really want it, it will not come as you want. Love needs mutual understanding. Without this, love will not last long. Spiritual harmony is the most important thing for love. <br /> <br /> The excellent script and performance have resulted in a huge film success. <br /> <br /> One of the best romance movies. 9/10
