I've seen this movie at least 4 times since year 84 and it's still great every time I see it. This is a very addictive version of the Carmen opera, with an amazing flamenco dance, sets of naked bones and, of course, great music. <br /> <br /> This story about Carmen is a story in history, with each other parallel to a double tragic ending. The film with a low budget in Spanish includes the dance of some of the leading flamenco dancers in Spain. The combination of soaring opera music and the sound of dancers' shoes on a wooden stage makes story telling even more powerful. <br /> <br /> It's independent creation of films at its best and probably my favorite foreign movie.
