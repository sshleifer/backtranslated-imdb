"Kaabee" depicts a woman's difficulties before and during World War II, bringing up her children alone after her husband's imprisonment for "a mental crime". This film was directed by Yamada Youji and as expected the atmosphere of this movie is really great. Although the historical correctness of some scenes, especially the beach scene, is suspect. <br /> <br /> Acting in this movie is absolutely amazing. I am amazed at how they managed to collect this star cast for the 2008 movie. Yoshinaga Sayuri, probably the most decorated still active actress in Japan, will undoubtedly win more individual prizes for her performance in this film. Shoufukutei Tsurube in the supporting role was also really nice. However, Asano Tadanobu presented the most impressive performance, perfectly showing the cunningness of his character and the difficult situation in which he was. <br /> <br /> Films with pre-war scenery are not my thing, but thanks to great direction and acting, I was totally absorbed in history. In addition, it was not far-reaching nonsense, such as "Yuunagi no Machi, Sakura no Kuni", and analyzes the controversial and delicate issue of government oppression and brainwashing that took place in Japan during this period. A great movie, recommended to all viewers.
