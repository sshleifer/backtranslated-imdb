I am from "The Christopher Reeve Generation". It's safe to say that he was the best actor who played Superman yet, but that does not stop me from enjoying other actors in the role, and George Reeves makes a pretty good deal on knocking Chris upfront, although he's barely falling. It does not stop me from enjoying this movie, it has a lot to do. It has everything you need a movie, a story with a beginning, middle and end, and all of these parts are intelligently written. The film is edgy in terms of both acting and story, something like a noir movie, but with pantyhose. The story is both exciting and meaningful, it is a movie with a message that is not very informative. I'm still amazed that it was filmed in 12 days, oh, the days of Hollywood glory, when we did not have to wait 5 years to see if the film would fall into the development of hell ... The film is polished and expertly made, Directed by: Lee "Roll 'em' Sholem, best known for its direction with speed and performance. It never lets the limitations of technology slow down, in fact there are some creative things created to create a flying effect, including placing the camera on a boom on a truck and shooting high and fast travels to make it look like it's seen from Superman's point of view as well as several close-ups of George in the work on the process, as well as a long series of animated Superman. <br /> <br /> This is now available on DVD as an additional feature in the first season of the George Reeves Television series. A DVD worth having in itself, including the film as its original whole, is the icing on the cake. <br /> <br /> Give blood today God bless you!
