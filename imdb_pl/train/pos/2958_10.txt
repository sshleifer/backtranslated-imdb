A comedy about ridiculous proportions from the guys who brought you South Park and most of the boys from Orgazmo. This vulgar, obscene movie has completely disgusting, egotizing and satirical content. It depicts the extremely cruel treatment of people and animals. I LOVE IT!!!!! It's funny things. Really funny. Two lost friends create a game in the driveway that explodes into a national sensation. Corruption, greed and blackmail turn sports into acidity, and its improvement improves. You'll laugh on the way. Much. That's all. Enjoy!!!!
