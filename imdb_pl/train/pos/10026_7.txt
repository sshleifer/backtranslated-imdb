Without Kirsten Miller, this project did not have to be completed. However, with the inspiring beauty and talent that is Miss Miller, I definitely recommend it. It seemed that other actors only play for her strong performance. Wagner's miserable attempt to honor the film was a bit disappointing, but his few scenes did not diminish entertainment. Mostly my criticism is about the writing line and storyline, a group of gathered talents has done a heroic job of saving what should be a catastrophe. Miller's charismatic delivery and time were immaculate and reliable. Playing on a thin line between assertiveness and apodyktÄ…, but never offensive, in fact is a structural engineer, which is considered. It is a pity that I did not see it on the big screen, but unfortunately I was lucky enough to rent it before it was lost.
