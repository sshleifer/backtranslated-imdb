A funny musical in which Nathan Detroit needs $ 1,000.00 to rise into a fluent game, he encourages Sky Masterson to try to get a girl from the army of salvation, played by Jean Simmons, with Masterson to Havana. <br /> <br /> 5 years later, Simmons will be in the missionary again in the fantastic "Elmer Gantry". There she was sister Sharon and here is sister Sara. Same temperament, different story. <br /> <br /> Frank Sinatra is a devil Nathan Detroit. He was engaged to Vivian Blaine for 14 years and hates his habit of gambling. <br /> <br /> In a real change of pace, Sky Masterson played Marlon Brando, who actually sang here! > <br /> The film is recorded in a superlative choreography. These dances and songs are great. They are especially implemented by Stubby Kaye as Nicely Nicely (Johnson). <br /> <br /> In total, it is a very nice production.
