It's a very good Spanish movie, but I'm afraid many will feel lost because a lot of people around the world have no idea what the Spanish Civil War is about or when they fought. As a history teacher, I had a big advantage, but I could easily see how the movie can be misleading until you put together all the songs. I doubt if it would be a big problem in Spain, where the movie was made, but for other viewers it may be a bit confused for a later film. <br /> <br /> The film begins with 12-year-old Carol and her mother returns to her mother's hometown. It's been years and you are gathering to come to Spain from New York. Despite the strangeness, Carol speaks quite well in Spanish, and a large part of the film tells how it adapts. As to why she and her mother are lonely, I will spill this now for those who do not notice the fact that Father Carol fights in the war on the part of the Republicans (who ultimately lost in this very bloody conflict). <br /> <br /> The film gains exceptional ratings for beautiful work with the camera and music. A fairly slow and unbridled pace is not bad if you're a person who can accept movies in this way. I have seen a few other Spanish films about this war and they quite like it - no better or worse - just a decent piece of film about the lives of those who have been left behind, and also a nice maturation. <Br /> <br /> PS - If you do not know which side is, the Republicans were mostly socialists and supported by the Soviet Union and Mexico as well as volunteers from many countries (including the US). The nationalists were led by Franco and supported by Portugal and the fascist states of Germany and Italy.
