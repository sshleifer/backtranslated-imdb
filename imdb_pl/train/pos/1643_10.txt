It's a movie everyone should see if you want to see great acting. Mr. Torn and Mrs. Farrel do a great job. I think they should have it on TV again so that the new audience can enjoy it. Great performances. <br /> <br /> It gives you a true picture of what the pioneers had to go through both physically and emotionally. Incredible movie. <br /> <br /> It was done when Mrs. Farrel was very young. I've always considered her a comedian, but it's definitely not a comedy and it's just wonderful. There are very few dialog boxes, but that just makes them seem more real. Mr. Torn as always is a great presence and only his breath has a great feeling. I need to see the movie.
