I watched the movie without knowing anything about it and I found it to be similar to Billy Elliott (2000). Both films are based on a difficult father-son relationship. In both films, the son does not want to follow his father through the mines and dream of a better life away from his hometown. Both sons are mocked by their classmates and they both have a strong female student who teaches them. <br /> <br /> The main difference between the films was that October Sky was an infinitely more interesting and touching film. Laura Dern sets in motion, and Chris Cooper deals very well with the disapproval of his father, who played in American Beauty (1999). Joe Johnston surprised me with his subtle director, very different from other directors, such as Jumanji (1995) and Jurassic Park III (2001). <br /> <br />
