When we started watching this series on the cable, I had no idea how addictive it would be. Even if you hate characters, you hold back because they are so beautifully developed, you can almost understand why they react to frustration, fear, greed or temptation in the way they do it. It's almost as if the viewer was experiencing one of Christopher's learning curves. <br /> <br /> I can not understand why Adriana endured Christopher's abuse of her, verbally, physically and emotionally, but I just have to read the newspaper to see how many women can tolerate such behavior. Carmella has a dream home, an endless supply of expensive things, but I'm sure she would give him up for a loving and faithful husband - maybe not. That's why I watch. <br /> <br /> It does not matter how many times you watch the episode, you can find something you missed five times. We even watch episodes out of order (watch the season 1 late in the evening with commercials, but the entire language, A & E with censored language, replays in the film network) - when they are turned on, we are there. We are now completely corrupted. <br /> <br /> I also love Malaprop. "Albakora on my neck" is my favorite with Johnny Boy. When these jewels come into our family vocabulary, it is a sign that I should get a life. I will be when the series ends and I have collected all the DVDs and placed the collection in my will.
