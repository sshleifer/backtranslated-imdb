Yes, it's one of the best music movies I've grown up with such great artists as Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly, not to mention the fine and wonderful voice of Kathryn Grayson. Music and dance are great. I understand that Frank took lessons from Kelly; and there is Kelly dancing with Jerry Mouse, which is quite special for now. Betty Garrett is playing a waitress who falls in love with Sinatra. He is one of the underestimated Hollywood stars. I saw it again on A & E television and also in old VCR tapes. Never tire of these old musicals. What happened to Hollywood?
