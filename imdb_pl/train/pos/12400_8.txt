This is the second abbreviation Animatrix and the first one that can be called "artistic". It contains many references, metaphors and symbols in a dense amount of material, especially for a duration of 9 minutes. I have heard some complaints that this is "anti-human" or is trying to direct hatred towards man, for "sins against the machine". I do not think it's true; it uses only robots to show us that as humans we are not particularly accepted or open to anyone other than ourselves. I would say it is a great job. The story is good ... it plays the role of a historical documentary, telling about what led to one of the main conflicts in the trilogy. In this way, it stores clips from fictitious information reports and the like. A voice game is very good if it is not there. Animation is pleasant, and the use of color, despite the usually realistic style of drawing, makes it more open to smooth transitions and other surreal images. It has several pieces of strong violence and disturbing visual effects, as well as some nudity. The CD contains a commentary, not in English but with subtitles and worth listening / reading. There is also well-made and informative creation, based on both parts, so I would advise you to watch them after watching the next one. I recommend it to anyone who likes the Matrix universe and / or science fiction in general. 8/10
