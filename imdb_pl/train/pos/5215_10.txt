All I can say is the first movie this season that drew my attention. I chose him because of the actors, Gere and Claire, and the story looked promising. I just watched it and I can say - I'm overwhelmed. There are shocking scenes, true ... but it makes it more realistic. We should not run away from our reality, these things are happening right now. There are also experts who try to change things and improve the situation, as well as make fun of their involvement in the case. Actually, I do not think that you feel the "Hollywood touch" in the movie ... and that's what makes it better. Both Claire and Richard have done great roles and deserve 10 from me.
