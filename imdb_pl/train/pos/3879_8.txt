A typical Clausen movie, but again unusual. Clausen writes, directs and plays one of the main roles. It's a really great movie about normal people who live a normal life, trying to get the most out of it. The four main actors were fantastic. <br /> <br /> Fritz Helmut was convincing. You think he is really sick. <br /> <br /> Sonja Richter plays a nurse who is really an actress, but she turns out to be the best nurse who looks after an old man. <br /> <br /> Everyone has problems, and those in whom nobody believes, end up with happiness. But nothing good comes easy, they have to fight for life and love.
