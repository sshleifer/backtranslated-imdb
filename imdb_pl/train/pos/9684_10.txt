This movie brought tears to my eyes; John Roberts really knew how to reach the hearts of viewers, guided by this wonderful image in which life is perceived by Pauli's mind and heart. From time to time, we discover, with the help of sensitive and talented directors like John, that even small creatures like Paulie have a heart. I just could not hold back tears even though the movie has a happy ending. It's wonderful, after thousands of movies that I've seen all my life, "Paulie" really touched me deeply. This is, after the "ugly duckling", the second photo that really turned me upside down.
