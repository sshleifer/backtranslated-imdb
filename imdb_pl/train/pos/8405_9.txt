I am proud to say that I am the owner of the un-cut copy of this piece of the comedy "Crown International Drive-in" from the 1970s on DVD. It is a really silly and pleasantly irrelevant movie with a nice, airy climate of 70 years. This is to honestly say that true love and friendship are more important in life than a nice set of wheels and a quick piece of tail. Sure, this is basically a glaring picture of the male fantasy of teenagers - the main character of the teenagers, Bobby Hamilton, arouses in girls the respect of their friends and the chance to show off to the local rascal - but it is too stupid and good-natured to hate. Stuart Getz as our clumsy hero makes the lead engaging, Deborah White as the main object of Getz's feelings is a decisive cutie. eternal film) is wonderfully hateful like the brutal Dugan Hicks. Above all, the celebrity Danny DeVito is an absolute riot like Andy, the brash head of the Getz car wash owner, a nice waiter who wears very ugly loud Hawaiian shirts and suffers from a heavy gambling habit. I particularly like the scene in which the two bandits brutally beat Danny - one holds his hands behind his back and the other holds Danny's chest! And the tricky catchy Sammy Johns theme song will bounce around your skull for at least a week. In short, it's great retro-70 fun!
