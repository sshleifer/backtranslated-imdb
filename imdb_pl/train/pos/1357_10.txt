Wow, what an episode! After the last week's meeting with Mellisa, scenes of friendship between Anna and Brandia were constantly shot. But that was nothing until I saw Mellis' tirade after being released. Seeing her hobble around her cast spewing obscenities and screaming for someone to take her purse from her, was absolutely the most fun thing in reality TV history. She was still screaming at people who were supposed to wear "everyone", like someone else, would wear one of their hideous costumes. Are you Mellis about 40 years old and you're still throwing tantrums? Then Joan starts calling Anna and Brandie in the book, gets up and leaves the show! Both Rivers are pampered brats that remained on the show only long enough to maintain the ranking. Mellisa is crying and refusing to conduct an outgoing interview, she only proves to America what everyone thinks you are a spoiled child. WAH WAH I can not go! I love how Annie told the cameras that she could manipulate Mellisa, think about it, and then do exactly that. Mellisa is by far the smartest player and apparently deserves to win throughout the game.
