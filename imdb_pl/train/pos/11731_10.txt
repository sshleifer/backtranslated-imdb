I think this movie is very funny and frightening. I love Elvira and I like this movie. It is a pity that the second part of this amazing film was not a success because it is very funny as the first part. I also regret that in addition to this film, I have not seen Cassandra Peterson in other films. I think she is an amazing actress with big ... potential. I hope to see her in the future in the third part of Elvira's adventures. Cassandra Peterson is one of my favorite comedian actresses. Cassandra, if you read this, know that you are the best and that my heart will be with you. You can count on me. What can I add more? This is a cool and classic movie!
