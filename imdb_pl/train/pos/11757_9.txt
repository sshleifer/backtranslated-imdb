Robin Williams and Kurt Russell play guys in their thirties who put their marraiges at risk by deciding (Russell somewhat reluctantly) to repeat their painful tie with rival Bakersfield many years after the fact. Williams is okay, but Russell is great as the legendary quarterback Taft Remo Hightower. Holly Palance makes a nice and attractive phrase as wife of Williams who could live without this rematch. The movie is worth a look to see the famous Remo in action. Highly recommended.
