I consider this to be the most enjoyable Muppets movie, because I felt it was the lightest one and it had the best cartoon delivery on most of its lines. The Muppets try to go on Broadway to sell the original musical they wrote, but they encounter ordinary problems along the way, including the loss of Kermit's memory. Although there are not as many great episodes here as in the original "Muppets Movie", there are Joan Rivers and Dabney Coleman among them. Just the time and delivery of so many lines is great, and the situations in which Muppets are located are fun. The original songs are also good here and the ending is satisfying. There is nothing more to say about the film, but Muppet fans should see it for sure. This is the funniest Muppet movie and you will love everything. <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 of ****
