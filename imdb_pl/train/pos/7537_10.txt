Unlike those who hate Christianity, the 700 Club provides real answers and inspiration. It also provides reliable news, logical commentary and a different look than what ABC, CBS, NBC and PBS think is best. Unlike other programs that provide social and faith-related comments, those behind the Club 700 provide help to the needy, such as feeding hungry Blessing Operations, providing medical assistance to people living in poor communities, and giving hope to those who need hope . This is not hateful at all. If the 700 Club offends you, I suggest reaching for the remote control and twisting the TV channel. I do the same when I find CNN Headline News or in this case programs that I consider to be biased or offensive. What I consider to be offensive is the way the ABC family puts a reservation that Club 700's views do not reflect the views of the ABC family.
