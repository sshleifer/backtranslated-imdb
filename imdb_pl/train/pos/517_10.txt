Pressburger and the biggest Powell movie. David Niven plays the RAF bomber pilot who misses his own death, but receives a second chance in life when the heavens notice that he is SLOW and sends an angel to explore. The scene in which young soldiers, men and women, black and white, all killed in action, come to heaven to be transformed into eternal life, is unbearably moving. Also watch out for Roger Livesey, a deeply underestimated actor, and Kim Hunter as interested in love (later, of course, Zira in Planet of the Apes). Incidentally, Steven Spielberg cast the actress who played the main angel (Kathleen Byron) as the older private title singer in Saving Private Ryan half a century later, an act that speaks for his cinematography.
