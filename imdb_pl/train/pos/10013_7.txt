As one of the previous commentators said, this had the foundation of a great movie, but something happened on the way to delivery. Such a waste, because Collette's performance was amazing and Williams was credible. I just waited for him to improve. I do not think it's a bad editing or a different director is needed, it could have been a movie. It was a Canadian film, similar to the first few seasons of X files. Not cheap, just hokey. In addition, he needed a little more tension. Something that makes you jump off the seat. The film reached this moment, then disappeared; a bit like a false climax. I see how too much uncertainty would detach from the "reality" of this story, but I thought that this part was achieved when Gabriel was in the hospital and was looking for a boy. This movie must have a director cut out that tries to solve these problems.
