I have watched this movie twice and think that it is pretty good for the limited equipment used to create this movie. (filmed in 1947) Dr. Heyerdahl explains his theory about the migration of South American pre-Columbian Indians to the islands of Polynesia when the raft fell from large balsa trees. This document follows Dr. Heyerdahl and his team as they choose battles in Equidor and sail with them down the river to the Pacific to gather in Peru. They start a 101-day sea adventure, testing the strength of their primitive rafts, which survived only thanks to the resources available to the natives of that era. See for yourself, a real adventure!
