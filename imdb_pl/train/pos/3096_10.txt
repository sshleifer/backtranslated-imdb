Six degrees sucked me in. I was eagerly anticipating that he would come and be completely disappointed when Men in Trees replaced the place on time. I thought it was just a break and would come back in early 2007. What happened? All my friends were really surprised that it was over. We could refer to characters who had real problems. We talked about every episode and we had our favorite characters. There was no one in the show that I did not like and I felt that acting was great. I always like watching programs recorded in cities where local areas can be identified. I would like to protest against the cancellation of this program and ask you to bring it and give it another chance. Give him a good time, do not move him from that day to this day and announce him so that people will know that he is on.
