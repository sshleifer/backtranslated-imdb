If you are not privy to the world of Gundam, this is a good place to start. If you're burned to Star Wars or Star Trek, here's a fascinating, realistic science-fiction series that you can immerse yourself in. This is not a simple story about a boy who saves the world in a gigantic job that you might expect, but rather a complex, exciting drama of a cosmic war in which the line between "good" and "bad" guys is definitely less than clear. <br /> <br /> Gundam 0080 focuses on the story of Al Izuruha, a young, na√Øve boy living in a neutral space colony. He spends his days dreaming about Mobile Suits and playing war with his friends. During this series, Al befriends the "enemy" soldier Bernie Wiseman. At the end, little Al learns hard lessons about the reality of war and the required suffering and sacrifice. <br /> <br /> I loved this series of OAV, with its cool mecha projects, with the participation of history and nice characters. I recommend this series to anyone who likes realistic SF anime, or those who consider anime a silly or sexy entertainment.
