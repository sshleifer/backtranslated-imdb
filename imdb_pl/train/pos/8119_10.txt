I think the first 20 minutes of this movie is probably one of the most exciting movies, with a brilliant musical score that creates tension to the shattering climax. What the cinema viewers did in the 1930s, I can only imagine. "Times" said then: "The miracle came on the screen." Watch and admire it.
