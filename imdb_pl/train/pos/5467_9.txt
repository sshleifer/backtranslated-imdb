In my opinion, it must be one of the best performances by Barbara Stanwyck. She was one of a handful of actors, now and now, who could say more with just one look than the whole side of dialogue. I was lucky to see the original and uncensored movie with an additional 4 minutes of additional material. It is a pity that the film is so short. Lily is a young woman who barely keeps her together, working for her father in his illegal play. Her only link to everything is her good friend, Chico, wonderfully played by Theresa Harris. Although Chico is an African American (and having a white woman is the best friend with a black woman in the 1930s, he was as controversial as the subject of this film), and Lily does not have a special bond. And it is not sexual. Only two women were stuck or pushed into a situation that they could not influence. After Lily's death, and she does not know what she will do, she was told she had the power to go out and get what she wanted. Yes, it's immoral, but this is the whole point of this movie. Then "they" had to leave and ruin the last few minutes. So the last few minutes of the movie is a great movie and it's worth watching. The "lesson" of the film is just as valid today as it was then, and certainly in 100 years. Women, it's terrible what Lily is doing to get what she wants, but it works. Men, notice.
