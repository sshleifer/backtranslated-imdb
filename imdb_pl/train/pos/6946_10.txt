24 must be the best spy / adventure series ever airing. The whole idea of ​​telling stories in 24-hour real time is dazzling. The style of filming and stimulation makes us watch it. And Jack Bauer is one of the greatest characters in the television series for a long time. I rate this, along with The Simpsons and The X-Files, my three of the most-loved TV series. <br /> <br /> This first episode begins with a plot to murder the American senator David Palmer, who is also running for president. Bauer is called to his office to find out who is behind it, and at the same time measure his daughter's path to unkwown after escaping from her bedroom. So the adventure begins in the best political style and, best of all, always takes place in real time, which makes this series a real work of originality at a time when almost every program on television seems to show us the same in over and over again.
