2054. Paris is an illustration of Escher with people and vehicles rushing at various levels, in tribute to the Metropolitan Fritz Lang. Paris is both ultra-modern and falling apart. And in the blink of an eye, between supervisory sweeps, a pretty young medical researcher is kidnapped right after leaving her sister in a dingy nightclub. There is a tough police captain. Shown in raw black and white, with dark corridors, shady alleys and lighting of one source characteristic of the most difficult film noir, comparisons to Sin City are inevitable. But history owes more to Masamune Shirow and William Gibson than to Frank Miller because advanced surveillance, almost invisible spacesuits and ruthless super-corporations are just as much part of the landscape as pistols and cars. The film never generates the annihilation of Gibson's cyberpunk vision, and its powerful marginal characters collide with the industrial types of corporations that seem to have their own Ministry of Fear, but the viewer definitely has the feeling that Paris is no utopia and future science is no less than benign . As the police take place in a procedural plot, we move into darker recesses of individual ambitions under the shining veneer of the cultivated image of the Avalon corporation. The motion capture process used here creates an appearance somewhere between black and white comics and a new generation rotoscopy and is captivating or intrusive depending on taste. Nevertheless, a great visual sense is visible here, and the future Paris is filled with small details, giving the painting a unique look, which in turn is both Spartan and Baroque. Worth seeing.
