Henry Fool surprised me. I did not expect it to be fun and fun, or as much as it did. Fay Grim is still surprising that it provides a solid continuation of a story that does not seem to need it. However, when the viewer watches the first 20 minutes of the movie, he becomes blindingly aware that this is one of the best sequels of the best indie movie. At least as good as Ginger Snaps Back, if not better. <br /> <br /> I'm a little disappointed that part of Jeff Goldblum is so small, but I'm glad he's part of this short run. He is convincing and delightful as Agent Fulbright. I also enjoy Liam Aiken, who quite accurately portrays Ned Grim, son of Fay and Henry. <br /> <br /> This movie is a pleasure for many reasons. I am looking forward to discovering, for example, that Henry is not really a loser, as he seems (towards the end of the Fool), and to further discover that he is actually a genius ... well, it really is a beautiful stroke with a pen. <br /> <br /> I hope they will make a third ... like the end of the trilogy. Missing. They should give him Ned Fool Grim and Liam should look for his father to confirm the amazing change in his mother, and the sense of a close genius that he feels in himself. Assuming, of course, that Fay still holds back many of the most important facts from his son regarding his father. It seems that you have to do it. I would buy it. <br /> <br /> Even with a larger action, this is not yet a move. It's more dramatic and intriguing ... a mystery. I often watch it. <br /> <br /> Approximately 8,3 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fienda :.
