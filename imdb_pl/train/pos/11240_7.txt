The low-budget British pop melodrama focuses on the girl who wants to be a star, becomes one, and then finds it all too much. A good cast and sense of time and place can not hide the fact that we've all been here before. A few scenes are a bit hysterical, and O'Connor's voice sounds very similar to Mini Mouse! She disappeared soon after making this movie - so life can imitate art! You must see if you want to see the punk version of Star Is Born.
