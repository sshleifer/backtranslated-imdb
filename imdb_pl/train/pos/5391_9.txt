Life begins - and ends - in a typical obstetric and educational facility for 1930, where we watch the 48 hours of life of several high risk pregnant women played by Loreta Young, Glenda Farrel, Clara Blandick (Aunt Em ???), Vivienne Osborne, Dorothy Tree and Gloria Shea, because they are waiting for childbirth. While the feature films appear in the film, which seem very far-fetched today, when maternity wards are much more controlled and limited, it gives us an insight into what is born in a typical city hospital in 1932, as for our grandmothers and wonderful grandmothers. The film was fascinating and exceptionally touching for me. <br /> <br /> Oddly, the most outstanding performance in this film comes from the male cast member, young Eric Linden as Jed Sutton, her husband Grace (Loretta Young). What an actor! As the first father, Jed is distraught and anxious about the hospital staff, who seems to relegate his worries about his wife, because they can brush the crumbs off the table. I felt his every care. I would like to see more of this actor's work. He had a very emotional voice that was used for an unforgettable effect in Gone With The Wind. In this movie, Eric played a young soldier whose leg was amputated without anesthesia, which shouted, "Do not cut! Do not cut! "As Scarlett escaped from the hospital in horror. Cooling! Another great performance is Aline MacMahon, who plays Miss Bowers, a nurse. Her character is a terrestrial type of salt, a type of nurse that we all hope to gain for our hospital stays, which breaks the hospital's rules constantly to show the more human side of the medical profession. <br /> <br /> Loretta Young also performed another wonderful acting job, a very authentic and deeply perceptible role of Grace. She is great in these precursors, I really appreciate her as an actress for the last few months. <br /> <br /> Glenda Farrell played her piercing, unmarried mother, a bit too much for my taste (did not anyone in 1932 know that drinking a brand of hot water bottle could be dangerous to the health of unborn babies?), but her character he finally buys back. <br /> <br /> Also in the cast was an unchanged Gilbert Roland, a silent movie star, as a pathetic Italian husband. His time on the screen was short but remarkable. <br /> <br /> Life Begins is a mandatory code, try to catch it on TCM, but remember to bring up some hankies. 9 out of 10.
