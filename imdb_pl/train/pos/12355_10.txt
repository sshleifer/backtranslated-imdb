I can understand those who do not like this movie because of lack of knowledge. <br /> <br /> First of all, these girls are not Geisha, they are brothel tenants, and the one who does not know the difference will not understand half of the movie, and certainly not the end. It is a complete work of art about the life and needs of women in this era. Everything is important, and certainly the way you dress in the whole movie means more than words. To those who thought it was a boring geisha film, I suggest that you read a little about this society before drawing a conclusion that is beyond the reach of reality. This work by Kurosawa is life and I am sure that the director understood the silent meaning of Kurosawa's work to the proper intellectual scope.
