Miriam Hopkins is "Lady with red hair" in the biography of Mrs. Leslie Carter from 1940. In which there are also Claude Rains as David Belasco, Richard Ainley as Lou Payne and an excellent cast of helpers, including Laura Hope Crews and Victor Jory. <br /> <br /> Miriam Hopkins and Claude Rains give great performances. Hopkins was a beautiful actress who really makes us feel like Mrs. Carter. Rains is great as an extravagant, egoistic producer / writer / actor / impresario David Belasco, one of the big names in the theater. <br /> <br /> Although Mrs. Carter's second husband, Lou Payne, was an adviser to the film, it is a poor representation of real life events of Mrs. Carter. It is true that the divorce was very publicized and bitter, and undoubtedly it was perceived as a scandalous figure and for being an actress. However, she took care of her son Dudley, so there was no fight for care. When she broke up with Belasco, she did not return to him, she actually started working in vaudeville and at the end of her life she made several films. She actually married Lou, and he became her leading man in many productions. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Karter's driving force at the beginning of this movie is to regain her son's care, but he finally realizes that, far from him, he is totally connected to his father. In the film (and I'm not sure if it's true in real life) she traveled with her mother and lived in a theatrical guesthouse, which gives the film an interesting atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Not a bad movie, probably not an image of Carter or Belasco. One of the most famous moments of Mrs. Carter was The Heart of Maryland, where she wore a wig with six-foot braids. Outside the stage, the fans would blow her hair when she hung 35 feet above the stage, holding the middle of the bell so he would not ring. Quite visual.
