I read that it was not good, that history is not solid, that Volckman feels that he failed in some way. <br /> <br /> I do not agree. First of all, it's well made. Volckman is good at not only trying out a new technique, but with an emphasis that is worth thinking about: will immortality diminish the value of life? Big question ... <br /> <br /> I see that he is trying to build a feeling, and he does not compromise. This is applause. I'm sure that building a character in this form was an interesting exercise. I've seen artists reduce their form to an absolute minimum to build the intensity of the moment. I identify this movie with this one. <br /> <br /> In addition, it is much more interesting than Richard Linklater's roto-scoping, and Volckman's story has more meaning than Linklater's later stories of wasted drug life. Old messages. Everyone knows about it, but nobody does anything about it. The Renaissance has more to offer, something new to think about. And there are many other stories with lots of holes in those that do a lot better. <br /> <br /> Bravo, Volckman. A really nice job.
