It is t.v. should. And Pushing Daisies meets these expectations. A beautifully made and well designed program Pushing Daisies is one of the few programs that have remained in prime time, which have integrity, are good for the whole family and stimulate the imagination. It is not about normal activities, sex, money or angles of murders in any other show on t.v. This is a series that makes you think and laugh, but although the basic story may seem impossible, the concepts are true for us. Do you want something you can not have, hoping for someone who wants us, escaping from the past and looking for a family, even in the most unlikely places, etc ... <br /> <br /> I realize that ABC has basically I canceled this wonderful show at the moment and most likely I will replace it with some show beyond the integrity point. I suppose everything returns to the money ... it is a pity that there are no other programs in ABC that really make you feel good after seeing.
