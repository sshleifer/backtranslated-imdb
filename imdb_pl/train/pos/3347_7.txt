Robert Mitchum plays Clint Tollinger in this short but difficult Western: Man With The Gun. Tollinger is a professional city conqueror - as in a city where the city needs someone to save himself; he is the one who was brought to this. Tollinger's latest concert appears as an accident: strolling around the city in search of his old escape, he came across a city played like a puppet by a local western gangster. But many of the city's residents begin to regret the day they hired Tollinger because his way of cleaning the city becomes very vulnerable (suddenly, the High Horse Rider seems less original). <br /> <br /> A man with a gun starts as an average western movie with a hard guy, but it starts to get more and more surprising as the film progresses. What begins with oblivion and the run-of-the-mill ends with a dark and focused on character. The whole film is very well filmed and the cast is very pleasant. Mitchum is his great character in Man With The Gun - this is not one of his best performances, Mitchum still has his classic and effective presence on the high screen and knocks full of action, significant and shocking scenes movie straight from the park. Man With The Gun is a nice western Mitchum, which is easy to gain on time.
