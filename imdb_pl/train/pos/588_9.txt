I saw all movies directed by Robert Redford and I appreciated his love for the American people and the country. In the river runs through it, Redford displays the lyrical romanticism and visual glow of the high Rocky Mountains in Montana, as if it were a nineteenth-century landscape painter similar to Thomas Moran or Albert Bierstadt. This film loves visual and word with the text of the author Norman Maclean and the stunning work with the camera Phillippe Rousselot (Serpent's Kiss, Reigne Margot). <br /> <br /> The Redford cast is perfect. Tom Skerritt is Fr. MacLean, a man whose methods of upbringing include fly fishing and the Bible, Brenda Blythen, mother and his sons, Craig Schaffer and Brad Pitt form a family whose interactions reflect the same problems that all growing teenage sons meet, and later complex young men . Both Schaffer and Pitt are completely credible as brothers whose love for fly fishing and for each other binds them forever. It is the relationships between men, father and sons, brothers and their women from the outside world that make the river run through it towards a story that is missing in many Hollywood films made in recent years. <br /> <br /> However, what makes these relationships special is the attention Redford devotes to the language used in dialogue. It is a literate script, beautiful to listen to and unforgettable in combination with the stunning rivers and mountains of Montana. The words and setting are equal to the performances of the cast, which rises to their material. Although the idea of ​​fly fishing may seem like a strange tool to center the story, it is not so unlikely in Redford's directing hands. Taking into account the material, Redford's ode to a simpler time and life is worth revisiting.
