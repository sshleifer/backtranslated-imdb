Although it was a better movie than 101 Dalmatia (live action, not an animated version), I think it still fell slightly below what Disney could do. The film was well filmed, the music suited the action better and the effects were better (compared to 101). Acting was probably better, but then the human figures got much more appropriate roles in this sequel, and Glenn Close really can not be missed as in the first movie. She makes it shine. Her poor valet and furious helpers of furriers are wonderful characters to play and add to the spectacle that Disney gave us. This is a great family movie, with little or no objectionable material, and yet it remains fun and interesting for both adults and children. It will certainly be a classic, like many Disney movies. Here's the hope that the third one will be even better because you know you probably want to create it. ;)
