It's a very exciting and romantic movie. I've seen it several times and I'm never bored. Everything is realistic and it is a good plot. The actors are excellent Liam Neeson, Jessica Lange, Tim Roth and Brian Cox. <br /> <br /> I actually prefer this movie from Braveheart because Braveheart contains so many historical mistakes. There are many exciting scenes - watch out for the bridge scene and the last fencing scene. These are really good and surprising scenes. <br /> <br /> Music is beautiful ... it really fits the movie. The setting is amazing.
