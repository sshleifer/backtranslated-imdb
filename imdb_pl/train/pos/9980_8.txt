Every movie that shows the federal PGI (people in government) as threats of madmen that are in real life has a lot to say to me. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the supervision of the script, and even, sometimes the director is defective, so there will be people who discredit the whole movie and ignore the good moments. <br /> <br /> I saw the original way back when he was new and hated it, despised him, he hated it. I thought it was a terrible, irrational piece of rubbish. <br /> <br /> Now, however, I do not remember why. <br /> <br /> I do not think they should be compared or even combined. <br /> <br /> Look out for two different videos. <br /> <br /> Rate them as two different videos. <br /> <br /> This "vanishing point" provides space for a rally, a banner for people who want to encourage individualism who believe in human rights, who recognize the threat to freedom, the government can and does exist, especially the federal government. <br /> <br /> "Voice" wears a hat with the New Hampshire state motto: "Live Free or Die". At some point it would be the motto of most Americans. <br /> <br /> Despite the obvious flaws, "Vanishing Point" is a film to cheer on.
