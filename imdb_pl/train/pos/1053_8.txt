Sisters In Law is created by the same directors as the strangely fascinating "Divorce, Iranian style" which was exactly as it stated, because we saw the divorce court in Iran. Now they have turned their attention to the court system in Cameroon, Africa. It is wonderful in this court that two judges are women, which is unusual in a country like this. In any case, there are many men accustomed to moving around women, but this film is unusual because it seems that women have made great progress in society because divorce is legal and women's rights are recognized. Judges often punish men for behavior in a primitive way in these times. This does not mean that women who appear in court receive milder treatment. One of the main goals of the film is the case of aunt's child being hurt. Judges do not waste time raging at a woman. And who said that justice is gone? With those 2 behind the bench. They often make maximum punishments! Yes! You come girl!
