I do not have much to add to my summary, this movie ranks at the top of the Top Gun list as one of the funniest movies ever made, but it did not try to be. On the one hand, I do not think that this should be taken seriously, because it is very pleasant. <br /> <br /> I do not think this will bring down the reputation of Christopher Walken because his reputation has already deteriorated. Pulp Fiction needed to wake him from the dream he was in. As for Michael Ironside, he played some great games, not trying to be serious movies. Total Recall, Top Gun. What I think is amazing is the budget that this movie had. Scenes, actors and explosions, etc. They are quite amazing, so of course someone liked it and was willing to risk a lot of money. Whoever he was, I like them because I love this movie! <br /> <br /> If someone is reading this, looking for information about McBain (and I seriously doubt that there will be too many of them), just know it's a funny movie and it should be viewed with a smile on your face!
