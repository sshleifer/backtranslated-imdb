It was a really great movie. I loved Dennis Quaid and the entire baseball team. Jay Hernandez is also a very nice actor who is very pleasant to watch. The chemistry that the band had when everything worked together was spectacular, it simply shows what can be achieved when the minds unite for one purpose. This team has come back from the edge, having many losing seasons to win almost everything. I love such movies because they are really inspirational. <br /> <br /> In addition, the character of Dennis Quaid takes the place in the main leagues. You can not do anything but root for this guy. It seems that when someone has to do something, he will do it. Everything just goes together and makes everything click. <br /> <br /> Based on real story, this movie really makes you think about "nothing is impossible".
