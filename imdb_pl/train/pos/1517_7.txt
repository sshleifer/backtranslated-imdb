From the mind of Robert Bloch, the fame of "Psycho", there are four tales of tortuous horror in this anthological film by Amicus, who, although not as funny or frightening as I would like, still provides decent entertainment to the genre. <br /> <br /> Is connected by a story about a very skeptical detective Scotland Yard (John Bennett), who examines the disappearance of an outstanding actor; he advised that this case is related to several others by the house in which they all took place, and our movie is off and running. <br /> <br /> "Method for Murder" has the author Charles Hillyer (always delighting Denholm Elliott) haunted by his latest fictional creation, which apparently came alive. This sequence has several good, surreal and quite uncertain moments and is limited by fairly funny revelation and denunciation. <br /> <br /> Wax star horror icon Peter Cushing as a retired stockbroker Philip Grayson who, along with an old friend Neville Rogers (Joss Ackland), is obsessed with the image of a beautiful woman found in a museum of macabre waxes. The most effective in this episode is the sequence of dreams, although it is always great to watch Cushing. The final images presented to us in this story are quite shocking. <br /> <br /> "Sweets to the Sweet" contains another beloved horror star, Christopher Lee, as John Reid, who does not treat the charming moppet Jane (Chloe Franks) with too much kindness and to the new companion / teacher Ann Norton ( Nyree Dawn Porter) you should find out why. The secret of this particular episode is perfectly treated; film makers wisely do not tilt their hands, so it is a real shock when we get the full truth about this unfortunate family. The "dying" moments are particularly frightening. <br /> <br /> "The Cloak" has the most obvious comedy out of four; Jon Pertwee, one of the many actors who played the role of Dr Who for years, is great fun as a vain, temperamental horror movie star (in fact it is the main attraction of this story), who enrages the lack of quality in his latest low-budget film, goes out and buys his own coat . The mantle has strange powers that I dare not reveal here. Sexy Ingrid Pitt is a welcome presence as a companion of Pertwees; One of the wonderful examples of humor is a familiar blow aimed at anyone other than Christopher Lee! <br /> <br /> The recapitulation narrative ends in a predictable but effective way in which Detective Inspector Holloway learns that he should have taken all the warnings given him more seriously. <br /> <br /> Emphasized by the unusual, striking and amazing result of Michael Dress, "Home that dripped blood" is a fun mix of stories; although I do not like it as much as, say, "Tales from the Crypt", it's still fun. Directed by Peter Duffell, he moves slowly but surely towards each of his chilling conclusions and is certainly a good movie of its kind. <br /> <br /> 7/10
