Good working times with the Quiroz brothers and the whole cast of this project as "Guy on the bench". I was amazed at how well they were able to capture all the identifiable features of a true "B" horror movie. I hope that in the future I will have the opportunity to work with the Pumpkin Patch Pictures team. I moved to Detroit shortly after graduation and from the time of the premiere I was publicly recognized. One time, he was in the video store, and the damned girl lost consciousness. It was quite fun and it was my first real moment with an autograph when I signed the bill. One day I asked a girl in Blockbuster if the movie is often rented, and she confirmed, looking at the computer. At that time, more than Ring2 was rented, which was also a new release at the time ... The title really attracts immediate interest in more urban markets. She also noticed many times that the client did not return the film, which led me to believe that the film is so good that people do not want to give it away ... Watch out for ZoMbIeS when they have a hood like that! Jaysun Barr (Guy on the Bench-2005)
