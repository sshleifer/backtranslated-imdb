A pretty good picture of a man being in the wrong place at the wrong time. If the murderer wanted to hit you, why not just get out of it and let the police try to come up with something weird? It's dangerous to engage all these characters in the story, not to mention all the lips that you would have to worry about remaining closed. Why did the depressed lady go to the bar when she could barely sit in a chair or say a word? Are there really cops who are wise cracks, pop-up gums, grinning monkeys that approach the suspect in such a polite manner? Probably it was played much earlier, before the wheel was invented, but today it is so trivial and unbelievable. Catch the manic break for Elish Cook's drum; his crazy hammering never matched the recording. His frantic facial expressions made up for the delayed synchronization of the sticks.
