Esther Williams gets his first role in the main role of MGM and starts <br /> <br /> for a good start. This movie is a great working suspense <br /> <br /> with a mature motif that will be repeated a million times more in the future. <br /> <br /> - an innocent girl persecuted a terrifying woman. Esther <br /> <br /> looks great and if she wanted to, she could probably go on <br /> <br /> to make more and better movies, but according to her autobiography <br /> <br /> he almost quit his job for the marriage. Either way it is so <br /> <br /> nice and addictive, that her fun is to see her in a completely different role <br /> <br /> beyond the "musical swimming". Universal was fantastic thanks to <br /> <br /> shooting movies with former MGM stars after the studio started to leave his biggest names when it started to slide down. Gwiazda <br /> <br /> like Lana Turner, June Allyson and others had to create high quality <br /> <br /> videos at Universal, because they apparently still had the power of attraction <br /> <br /> checkout. I would like Esther to do more, but because she did not do it, <br /> <br /> makes it even more special.
