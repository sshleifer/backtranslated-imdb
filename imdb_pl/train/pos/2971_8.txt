I find this movie very funny, I loved how it is made up of the politics of modern sport. This movie is not as much fun as South Park, but it's quite funny. And because I'm a sports fan, I loved the way they played funny things in sport. This movie is also great for sports enthusiasts, probably better for them because they have to go through life, wondering why people are following the sport so close when there are so many crazy rules and complexities in sport and the fact that it means absolutely nothing. I also found an interesting game in which they found themselves, resembling a horse with bases and a psyche out (for a shooting person). In general I highly recommend seeing this movie and believe that you love this movie. However, if this style of comedy is not your favorite, you probably will not like it. (but this is with every comedy movie)
