I thought that this movie was very pleasant. I watched this movie with my wife BEFORE my first child. That's why I did not just watch it as a family entertainment and I still liked it a lot. It seems that many reviews indicate that this film is not shocking to the ground, there were no unexpected changes to the plot and that the film was predictable and boring. If these people were watching this movie, expecting to make it a religious experience, then of course they will be disappointed. This is just an animated film; nothing more. If you want to see this movie just sit back and let yourself be entertained, you will not be disappointed. Finally, it's definitely not the best movie Disney has made, but he's funny and I do not understand the bad reputation he got.
