Carmen was there from the beginning of the show. She was one of the best characters. Why did they get rid of her ?! The show is not the same as before. It is worse. <br /> <br /> The best episodes were with Carmen in them. You can not replace someone from the beginning! This is like South Park without Kyle or Child's Play without Chucky! This is not right! The niece who replaced her is simply! Horrible. It does not fit the story at all. She was one of the main characters, and the niece can not replace her. She was an amazing actress. Better than niece. Recover it because you will lose TON viewers.
