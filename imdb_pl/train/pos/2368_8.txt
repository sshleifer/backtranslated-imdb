Plot: Kurt Harris (Jeff Wincott), a bitter, former policeman, is hidden in the "Conciliation" after his friend is killed by the leader. There he discovers that the woman wants to apply for the mayor and will do everything to achieve this goal, even murder. The cast is good (Jeff Wincott is a good martial artist and a good actor) ... Brigitte Nielsen plays a sexy antagonist together another bad guy plays Matthias Hues also his good war artist. The direction is good (battle scenes also). The rest is fine, with Tony Burton, who plays Kurt's friend killed with Nilsen, and Cyndi Pass plays the bad girl. From producers of another action / martial art film (Bounty Tracker from Lorenzo Lamas) is a good action movie. The best film from the "Martial law" series.
