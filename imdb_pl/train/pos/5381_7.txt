It was really good for a movie with a low budget. I put this much above the average action movie B. Sean and Corinne provided in this movie and did not seem shy. Watch out for scenes from Jeanne and Jared. I did not think that the producers would consider it, but the second place deserves so much. <br /> <br /> I look forward to Sean and Corinne's commitment to the entertainment industry. Sean's character seemed very original, and Corinne's sexy figure was quite hard and spotty. It combined well with the action sequences and was done with confidence. It was a great idea to fill Billy Zane as a wise and witty villain. His charisma on screen is always fun. The chemistry between Zane and Sean was pretty good. The action sequences were not tacky and seemed to combine throughout the movie. Of course, there were disadvantages, but this applies to the territory. <br /> <br /> In general, it was a good movie considering the budget and the fact that it was created for television. Sean and Corinne did a good job considering they are new to the game. I hope Jeanne, Jared and the rest of the Next Action Star cast will have the chance to join their stars in the entertainment success. <br /> <br /> Last Judgment: *** / ****
