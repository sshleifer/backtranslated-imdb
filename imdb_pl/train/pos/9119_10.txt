An interesting way of looking at how we humans behave so often is sometimes blinded by our desire to achieve perfection that sometimes destroys the foundation of what we are trying to achieve. He also deals with the question of how we ignore those of us who are not so honest and can lose a great opportunity. The comedy shot also makes watching the movie a pleasant experience. It must be for everyone who is interested in a reflective but comical view of life. I am looking forward to your next product. I hope that you will continue to provide us with high-quality entertainment. Excellent job ...... Joanne
