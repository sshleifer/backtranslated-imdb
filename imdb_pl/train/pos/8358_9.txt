Not so many people like Bertrand Blier's films just because they do not understand them. Simply because they are different kinds of people. <br /> <br /> If you have not lived in deep desperation entwined with great personal hope, you may find it difficult to enjoy the humorous show shown here. <br /> <br /> And Blier's movie can not easily be classified as black-comedy, cult etc., like those of cellulose fiction etc. Because it is a delicacy that the North American audience often underestimates. <br /> <br /> When I looked at the two "hooligans" who ate at Jeanne moreau in a seaside restaurant, I felt that they were more gentle than any other gentleman. <br /> <br /> The desire to love each other wildly as it is a normal reaction that we feel under the unbearable pressure of meaningless being-symbolized by camion suddenly appears in Carrefour. <br /> <br /> So, les valseuses is a much better name than going places. To dance a waltz, you must be elegant, but you go to places you do not have.
