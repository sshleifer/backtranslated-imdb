The children I took on this movie loved it (four children, aged 9 to 12 years, would give him 10 stars). Emma Roberts was charming in the title role. (Expect you'll see more of the next generation of Roberts in the future.) After being exposed to Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton, it was refreshing to see a girl who did not look like she was running the streets. He also liked to see the cast that included Tate Donovan, Rachel Leigh Cook, Barry Bostwick and Monica Parker (with the episode role of Bruce Willis). Final Takeaway: Lovely movie. <br /> <br /> (Note: I have not read a series of books, so my comments are based on the merits of the movie itself).
