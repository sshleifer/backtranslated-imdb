I am always waiting for this movie on TV. I think I have to get a DVD. The range of different types of people is great. He tells me that anyone can be a dancer if he tries hard enough. My favorite character must be Mr. Aoki. He is so bizarre, but full of emotions. It's an excellent movie with a great dance. Unfortunately, we never have the opportunity to see them in Blackpool. If they had, it would be the perfect sequel. But I think it leaves your imagination to what might have happened. <br /> <br /> A very simple and innocent story. He remains faithful to his wife and daughter. <br /> <br /> I have not seen the remake of Hollywood. I'm not sure if I want to. I do not like Jennifer Lopez. I think Richard Gere fits the original more than Lopez. I have the impression that the remake is not so simple and innocent.
