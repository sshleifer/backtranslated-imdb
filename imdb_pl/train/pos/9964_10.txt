But no doubt ... all Santa Claus Satan's corner is so slim that STRANGE made the movie a hit at the time, and the cult movie when home video really started. Jak dobrze / wrong / dziwnie / this is it? I saw TRAILER as a child and I remembered it for almost 30 years. There was no question in Murray's voice.
