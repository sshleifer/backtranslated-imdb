A young man named Court is loved by everyone. His painful blood death brings everyone closer. You can find other symbols and allusions throughout the movie. Whether predictable or not, and irrespective of church beliefs, it is a moving story full of environment and sensuality. <br /> <br /> One more thing, someone mentioned that his fate was so fast that he did not seem credible. But the elements for this are subtly arranged. Note what his mother says about taking lunch to the field. Notice how he holds the steering wheel and gloves. He is sweaty and operates dangerous equipment. Until today, tractors are quite dangerous.
