As an amateur historian from the Second World War / Nazi Germany, I could not wait for him to come out on a DVD. I missed him when he was the first time in 2003. I do not want to repeat what has already been said on the previous 8 pages of comments on historical inaccuracies. A better job could be done by presenting the "charming" Hitler. I also had a small problem with some choices, not so much because of their actions, but because of their appearance. Peter Stormare does not look like Rohm, why did not they make Babson as Hess in the wig? And my biggest complaint ... so much was always done with Hitler's striking blue eyes, why did not they force Carlyle to wear blue contacts? On the plus side, I thought that the actors who played in Goring and Drexler looked pretty good. Again, as long as people watching this understand that it's supposed to be entertainment 1., story 2. I do not think much damage is done.
