It's just the funniest and brightest movie comedy of all time ... it's definitely on my top ten list. This one also receives a solid vote on the voting scale. Millionaire's heir, Arthur Bach (Moore), is a middle-aged 'kid' who refuses to follow a mature path of life and avoids all duties required. He also refuses to leave the bottle. One day, he and his personal valet, Hobson (Gielgud), go shopping to Bergdorf Goodman and run into a small larcenist, Linda (Minnelli). Chemistry Arthur and Linda adds electricity to the rest of the movie. There are many funny pieces. In one of these scenes Arthur (drunk for most of history) knocks on the wrong door of the apartment and receives shaky threats from the human "siren" ("My husband has a gun !!!!). The performances of all involved should be duly recorded: Geraldine Fitzgerald plays the loving but ruthless grandmother of Arthur, Sir John Gielgud almost steals the entire program with his sour droll (he took the Oscar home for it), and Christopher Cross provides the main song (Oscar winner "Best That You" Can Do "). It is a pity that Dudley Moore died last month (March 2002).
