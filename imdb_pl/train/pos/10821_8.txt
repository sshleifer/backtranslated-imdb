I also saw it after it was released in '56 and since then it hit its last scene. If this is the answer to the "high noon", it is a valid and accurate answer. The view that, as the series "The City Connects" says, is a much stronger message than the lonely personal heroism of the "High South." In this topic, "Concho" is a phenomenal precursor to one of my favorite all-time, "The Magnificent Seven." Both Sinatra and Conrad give impressive and convincing performances, especially Sinatra's transformation from mistreatment of his brother to the liberation of the city's savior. I can only hope that at some point, all friends and family, for whom I have been asking my feelings for this film over the years, will have the opportunity to experience it for myself.
