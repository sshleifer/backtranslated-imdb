Playwright Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine) made a series of flops after the great hit. He receives a play written by his student Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve), which is fantastic. It's so good that Sidney says he'll kill for it. If he? <br /> <br /> Thriller of a thinking man. Originally it was a game ... and shows. It is mainly one set and the whole conversation, but I have never been bored. It is very well written with lots of twists and good casts working full-time. Caine is just as wonderful as Bruhl - another of his great performances. Reeve is surprisingly very good. I never thought of him as an actor, but he is really good at it. Dyan Cannon works wonders with the unsatisfied role of Bruhls' wife. Irene Worth is also good (and quite funny) as Helga this Drop, medium. However, her accent took on nerves. Director Sidney Lumet copes well with his one set. The camera is always in motion and keeps your attention. <br /> <br /> EXTREME SPOILER WRINKLED !!!!! My only complaint is that the two gay characters in this movie are raging sociopaths, and it also contains one of the most unromantic kisses I've ever seen - but these are mild complaints. <br /> <br /> A very good thriller. Critics hate this movie (for some reason) and it seems that it disappeared completely because it premiered in 1982. It is a pity - it deserves more.
