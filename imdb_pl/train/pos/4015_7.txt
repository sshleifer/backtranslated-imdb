Johnny Yuma, one of the more satisfying western all'italian, has the freshness of many WAIs created in the heyday of the genre and is highly recommended for fans of genre or offbeat, intelligent cinema. <br /> <br /> Johnny Yuma is not terribly original in many ways, but it does not really matter. The success of the film genre depends on how well it meets the expectations of the audience, and also provides surprising variations on these expected elements. Previously pleasant experiences are played, but with a subtle (or serious) twist that provides continuous interest. The quality of workmanship is of course also important. Tired tread will be less effective than honest attempt to entertain or move the audience. <br /> <br /> Given these criteria, Johnny Yuma is successful. There are many repetitions of elements from earlier movies. It is a brutal, twisted half feudal twilight of the world shared by many of the best westerns from the "gothic family" from 1964-1968, such as Tempo di massacre (1966). The plot is a combination of the basic story Fistful of Dollars (1964) and Ringo's films, which is not surprising, because screenwriter Fendiando di Leo was involved in both. Di Leo was one of the best screenwriters in the popular cinema coming out of Cinecitta in the 1960s and 1970s, and his work helped ensure the thematic continuity and consistency of the genre (along with several other personalities in several different circles actors, directors and screenwriters). On the FOD plot, the protagonist arrives in the city, stirs up the tense situation, and then passes close to death, followed by the resurrection (in some films, such as Quella sporca storia nel west (1968), it is literally a crucifixion). The Catholic accent on narrative and symbolism is intriguing, especially considering the hidden populist / explicit socialist tendencies of filmmakers and their films. The Ringo story, prepared more fully by the writer Ernest Gastaldi in a series of films with Guliano Gemma, a selfish hero, chooses the interests of the community over its own through a relationship with a member of this community (with uncertainty and ironic madness). <br /> <br /> The relationship between Carradine and Johnny is clearly based on Manco / Mortimer's relationship with Fistful of Dollar (1965). Two gun belt replacement scenes ensure wise dialogue and understanding between them. Numerous films, including Da uomo uomo (1968) or even El Chuncho, qui√©n sabe? (1967), use this relationship between older and younger men (father / son, elder / younger brother, Anglo adviser / opponent and peasant revolutionary) as the main dynamics of the story. <br /> <br /> Additionally, there he focuses on deception and misguidance, labyrinths and mirrors that repeat in the best early WAI. Almerian's canons and settlements become literal mazes, through which the hero and antagonist play variable games of cats and mice. <br /> <br /> What distinguishes Johnny Yuma from other WAI's is the quality of the visual / psychological space that the director of Romolo uses together with an intelligent arrangement of the scenario to convey the story. Dialogue has never been very important to WAI and often absurdly unintelligible (it was thought there were exceptions, such as cynical comments in Django (1966) or Faccia a faccia (1967). <br /> <br /> The psychological depth of character is almost created completely, thanks to the iconic images, their collections and description of the overall narrative situation. See how the presence of deadly Samantha in the scene of beating is seen from the roof or background of the action Samantha and Pedro about their safety and trust in their power thanks to stealth raids on the ranch, a hotel or even a bedroom (this is again the subject of the FOD). Next, pay attention to how it focuses on searching for information, many elements borrowed from the FOD, which was ultimately based on the hard novel of the mysterious "Red Harvest", through accidental contacts, posters sought after, overheard conversations, glances through the windows, watches left on the dusu t, or wrong identities and movements through the fa le created by Pedro and Samantha in this surreal and absurd reality that the narrative moves forward. <br /> <br /> The movie was noteworthy at that time they were seen as excesses in violence. Of course, these films were not more brutal than many American westerns. The psychological intensity of violence and the reasons for which it was assigned was different, it means that it is not violence, but its meaning has changed. Johnny Yuma is clear and interesting in using and presenting violence, and this is another interesting aspect of the film. <br /> <br /> What interests me most in most of this genre is a link that provides anonymous, unnamed viewers in Italy and Spain, to whom these repeated narratives had some meaning and interest. An artifact may not have value in itself? some flint debit from a prehistoric place, a fragment of ceramic cruse or forming a piece of leather and rusty metal? but it is a reference to some unnamed presence, a life that was meaningful only because it existed. While Johnny Yuma has an inherent value, much of his interest in me stems from this combination and mystery. <br /> <br /> The best western spaghetti list http://imdb.com/mymovies/list?l=21849907 <br /> <br /> Average SWs http://imdb.com/mymovies/list?l = 21849889 <br /> <br /> Only for fanatics (bottom of the barrel) http://imdb.com/mymovies/list ll = 21849890
