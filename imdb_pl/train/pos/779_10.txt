In north-eastern Brazil, the father of twelve-year-old illiterate Maria (Fernanda Carvalho) sells her daughter to the middle of prostitution, Tadeu (Chico Dias), to be employed as a maid and have a better life. However, the girl is resold to the farmer Lourenço (Otávio Augusto), who destroys her, and he gives the ill-treated son of his son-son, so that he can survive the first sexual experience. Then she is sent to a brothel on a golden field in Amazonas and has examined its owner, the wicked Sarahiva (Antonio Calloni). When Maria escapes to Rio de Janeiro, expecting a better life, she is discovered by Cáften Vera (Darlene Glória). <br /> <br /> "Anjos do Sol" reveals the sad and shameful reality of child prostitution in Brazil through the fate of Maria's girlfriend. Last year I saw "Lilja 4-ever", which tells an identical story in the former Soviet Union; that's why this problem exists in Third World countries. Director and screenwriter Rudi Lagemann presents a great movie showing reality, but never showing nakedness or explicit sexual scenes. This is the debut of the promising Fernanda Carvalho, who has great performances as a frightened child struggling to survive. Most prostitutes are amateurish and it is impossible to recognize the famous Darlene Glória so different than after many plastic surgery. The bitter and hopeless end of history is also very realistic. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Anjos do Sol" ("Angels of the sun")
