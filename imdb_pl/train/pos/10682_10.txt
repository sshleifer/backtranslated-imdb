A few years ago U.K satellite channel Gold promoted the repetitions of "Men behave badly" with the hype: "Here is the original flat sitcom!". It was actually not true. "Man About The House" was also a sitcom shared and operated from 1973-76. <br /> <br /> It was the work of Johnnie Mortimer and Brian Cooke, creators of the popular series "Father Dear Father." When it was over, they decided that they wanted to do something more in harmony with time. <br /> <br /> In the first episode of Chrissy (Paul Wilcox) and Jo (Sally Thomsett), they clean their apartment in Myddleton Terrace after a wild party, when they find a man in a bathtub. He is Robin Tripp (Richard O'Sullivan), a cooking student in Southampton with no permanent residence. When his clothes dry, he puts on a woman's bathrobe and prepares a meal for them. They are so impressed with his culinary skills that they invite him to stay. But it can not be a bad business. So Robin must pretend to be geja ... <br /> <br /> In "I Love 1973" B.B.C.-2, shown in 2000, Julie Burchill claimed that "House" showed her a way of life which she envied. She was not alone. One of the most characteristic (for me and so) images of British television from the 70s was Sally Thomsett coming out of the London subway, carrying an umbrella, and a "blind" man making a double test when its stupid bottom is swinging. <br /> <br /> A man living with two girls has been a topic for a while, but Mrs. Mary Whitehouse did not have to warm up under the collar, it was innocent, good-natured fun. The scenarios of Mortimer and Cooke drew closer to the edge, unable to cross it. <br /> <br /> Richard O'Sullivan continued to play "Bingham" in "Doctor In Charge" I.T.V., when it began. In fact, the second run of "In Charge" overlapped the first of the "House". He was born to play the sexual madman Robin. "Chrissy" Paula Wilcox was more street than "Beryl", her character played in "The Lovers", while "Jo" Sally Thomsett was a lovely, stunning blonde. As time passed, he became almost like an older brother to them. <br /> <br /> For many viewers Brian Murphy and Yootha Joyce stole the show as a fighting Ropers. George lost interest in sex, but Mildred did not. They went on their own program - aptly titled "George & Mildred." The late Doug Fisher had a good value, as did Larry, a friend of Robert from Broadboy. He worked so well that he became regular. <br /> <br /> During the year since the debut there was an inevitable spin-off film. I'm not a big fan of the movie "Man About The House" because I think it has been stretched to fit the big screen. Most of his characters have never appeared in the series. <br /> <br /> The format was sold to America, where it became a long-standing "Three's Company" with the participation of the late John Ritter and Suzanne Somers. It was much more suggestive than the British original, and Somers was often seen in sexy clothes. <br /> <br /> After six seasons, "House" ended with Chrissy marrying his older brother Robin, Norman (Norman Eshley). Fans were devastated to see that Robin had failed to get the girl he loved, but there was some consolation in that he also landed on his own show - "Robin's Nest".
