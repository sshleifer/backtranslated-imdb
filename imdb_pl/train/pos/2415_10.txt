I am totally addicted to this series. I can not wait for a week to see the next show. is a great story and has the best actors and actresses in the series. I tune in every week to watch, even if I'm not at home, I always have a cassette tape for Monarch Cove tape. Simon Rex is the best actor in the series. it is full of tension and exciting. I think that this program should stay in the air and I believe that everyone should tune in to view it. I saw the first episode and actually did not intend to watch it, but one day I watched my whole life and decided to watch it because it was on and absolutely love it, and now it's my favorite program. I really mean it.
