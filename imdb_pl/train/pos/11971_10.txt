I think the comments about this series are a bit exaggerated. When someone comes to watch a TV program, what does he pay attention to? He is glad that he is watching the program, unless he is a critic or a person who analyzes history. But most of us are not like that and watch shows to relax and enjoy. FULL HOUSE is the perfect program to watch after a hard day at the office / school. It makes you laugh and it's not just humor. <br /> <br /> Yes, the Tanner family is an ideal family, a perfectly hypothetical family. If such a family existed in the real world, it would be a role model for us. But this is a television program, not a real family, and there is nothing wrong with presenting a hypothetical family on television. The mere fact that the show can run so long shows us that people liked to watch it, regardless of what the comments would be later. <br /> <br /> Another good point of the program is that every person of all ages will not only enjoy watching this, but would receive a message that would be childish. These conversations between Jesse and Michelle are extremely touching if they are not considered childish. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would say that after seeing every Full House performance, there is something in your heart that is rarely present after many other shows.
