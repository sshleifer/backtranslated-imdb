"How to Lose Friends and Alienate People" is not based on Tiger Woods' infidelity. This is an average romantic comedy based on the book by Toby Young about his experience with the work of a journalist embracing the stars. The film features Simon Pegg as Sidney Young, a British journalist who works for a famous magazine in New York. Young is anxious when he falls into the trap of all kinds of shenanigans to alienate him around him, hence the title of the film. He is screaming, bold and moronic. Nevertheless, for some very strange reason, he is somewhat sympathetic. Sidney makes friends with a fellow journalist, composed by Alison Olsen, played with admiration by Kirsten Dunst. However, Sidney misses primarily the sex-act actress Sophie Maes played by Fantastic Mrs. Megan Fox. This foxtrot has a short duration of action, but has a high level of "sweetness". Sidney falls into all kinds of fun, to promote the journalistic ladder in the warehouse. These are the comedy moments of the film. I think, however, that director Robert Weide and screenwriter Peter Straughan can lose some viewers and alienate the real Rom-com material by developing an improbable romantic storyline between Sidney and Alison; even though Team Weidstraughan formulated a funny narration in a different way. Pegg made his character with a funny performance as Sidney Young. Jeff Bridges rebuilt the "The Dude" bridges and his enigmatic supporting job was Clayton Harding. But the rest of the movie was not worthy enough to present it here. "How to Lose Friends and Alienate People" should not be completely alienated, but you may lose some of your movie friends if you publish them as a great romantic comedy. *** Average
