This is one of the funniest series in history! I laughed until my sides parted and fell on the floor. If only someone would free himself in America. Region 0 or 1 - not applicable to PAL. <br /> <br /> I know it's released in the UK, but it's also Region 2 and PAL! Let's give this series a decent shock. America must know this series. Moffat is a genius. I loved the bizarre, stupid role of Tracie Bennett. Of course I liked Fiona Gillies! But Tracie was a treasure! <br /> <br /> Publish this concert in America! or Show again at PBS stations. I have to laugh and laugh again! Please, let us, please! Please! <br /> <br /> Thank you for reading.
