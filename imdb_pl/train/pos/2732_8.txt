Herbert Clutter, wife Bonnie and their teenage children Kenyon and Nancy were very liked and respected in the small town of Holcomb in Kansas - but in the early hours of November 14, 1959, all four were brutally murdered. Rather unexpectedly, the crime made an impression on the author Truman Capote, who threw himself on the stage and followed the course of the case to its conclusion. As a result, the IN COLD BLOOD book was created. Controversial, shocking and exceptionally well-written, he has become an international bestseller and remains the cornerstone for criminal writers to this day. <br /> <br /> The film version of Capote's work is almost as unusual as the book itself. Shot in black and white in many real places, it has a somewhat documentary quality, icy and detached - and the overall cast is unique. It's a movie that builds the reputation of Robert Blake as an actor and deserves it. As the killer of Perry Smith, Blake intercepts you between deep distaste and the shock of unexpected sympathy; is a masterful performance from the beginning to the end. Like Richard Hickock, Scott Wilson is not okay. <br /> <br /> Like Capote, the film begins with Smith and Hickock as they travel to Kansas and bring them to Clutter's home - just to blink the crime next to investigate the investigation that finally led to their arrest and conviction. The most important element of the film has always been the moment when we finally saw what happened at Clutter's house; properly filmed in the Clutter house itself, it is a moving, frightening and deeply disturbing sequence. <br /> <br /> Director and screenwriter Richard Brooks leads a film with a very strong sense of meditation, wandering only in the sense that it allows the film to be slightly proclaimed. However, taking into account the overall power of the film, it becomes a trivial irritation. Strong things - and recommended. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
