I work with children from 0? 6 years and everyone loves Doodlebops. Doodlebops are vigorous, lively and attractive. When they start singing, "We are Doodlebops, we are Doodlebops, we are Doodlebops, Oh yeah, come and join in the fun, because we laugh and sing all day." in the song Doodlebops takes the viewer into a world of colors and fun. Every show is an adventure, Doodlebops do not try to change the world using the messages they hear, everything they do is fun, solving everyday challenges that a small child Doodlebops is a refreshing alternative to ordinary television programs for children.
