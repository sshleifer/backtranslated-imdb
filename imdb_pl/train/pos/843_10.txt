Not to mention the fact that it's best to beat Brosnon. Of course, Greg Kinnear is always great. Really, when was he really angry? I think this movie is incredibly underestimated! The use of colors in this film is something completely different in today's film world, where every other movie has a blue Payback filter. I also love the way they used the song Asia. Proving that even what was once thought to be something tacky can be really well placed correctly. <br /> <br /> I did my first movie when it came out. Because my film was a hit movie, I had to check everything in the released genre. After seeing this, I'm sure it had some influence on me throughout the whole process. It was pretty cool when my movie got into IMDb, that it would recommend the movie if I liked it. As I refer to others, I have no idea, creating an even more interesting coincidence. <br /> <br /> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1337580/
