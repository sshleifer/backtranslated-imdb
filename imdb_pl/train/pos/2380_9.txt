I did not mind the whole walk. People really walked then. He borrowed the authenticity of this period and perspective on Martian technology. I was also disappointed with the effects, in particular the "Thunderchild" scene, which I consider to be one of the most exciting in the book. I can not, however, praise this film for his faithfulness to Wells' story! Just in time. The actors are friendly and the performances are charming. Also, this movie is very worth seeing to hear the really great musical score of Jamie Hall. It was interesting to see how the same actor plays both the writer and brother in London.
