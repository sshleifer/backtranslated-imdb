For all of you who do not speak Swedish: the Swedish [original] title of this film; "RÃ¥narna" translates into something like "The Robbers". This fact is the main problem I have with this movie, because it's not about thieves at all. It's about a young woman working for a Swedish police investigating robberies. Regular work on a desk that you could think of, but this girl will soon go out into the field, taking matters into her own hands, as history says, even firing at one of the robbers ... Exactly: We've seen it before. The fact that there is a rather interesting twist in the middle of the road does not help, because the ending is just as trivial as the first two-thirds of the movie. <br /> <br /> What saves you from being just another mainstream movie is the fact that it's masterfully performed in all ways, that the actors are as great as they are and do not care, and the director really manages to keep him like that exciting, like in most stories. <br /> <br /> One of the things that I really love about this movie is the fact that his music sets the right mood when it's needed, but it's absent the rest of the time, which gives a nice sense of reality in shooting and car chases they spread all over the movie. A nice touch! The fact that Michael Persbrandt is one of the few Swedish actors who often tend to bet, unfortunately, hurts the movie, because you know that he does not intend to just play the heroine boyfriend and be a supportive figure in the background, but that's something that <br /> <br /> In all, it's a funny movie that steals more money on the story than the time from you. 7/10
