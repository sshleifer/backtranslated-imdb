This movie miracle is one of those movies that have a lasting, long-term impact on you. I have read a review or two from angry people who, I think, are republicans or children beaters, and their extreme comments speak of the power of movies to confront people with their darkest secrets. No such work of art has ever connected me with laughter and tears and this is the miracle of the film. The realism of the film and its performance of Bret Carr can not be missed. The very nature of this almost interactive effect will cause people to leave the theater or be liberated, or question their identity. Bravo at the next level of cinema.
