Browsing the Internet in search of previous sale prices, I came across these comments. Why are everyone so serious? It's just a movie and it's not pornographic. I bought this short film from my parents 30 years ago and I was always very happy with it. I showed it to many of my friends and everyone loved it too. I feel honored to have this original silent white Shirley film from 1932 with a diameter of 8 mm before it became popular or known. After reading the other comments, I agree that the film is "racist". Great thing! It is a pity that it was no longer. It seems that I must be the only person who owns one of these originals, at least for sale, so I wonder how much it is worth?
