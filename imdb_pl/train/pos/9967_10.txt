There are some things that I will never understand; why underwear appears in the packets of three when it is insufficient. Similarly, I will never understand this movie and it is brilliant. If you approach this movie expecting a real movie, you might as well go to satan waiting for a hug; though it may be possible if you greet the satanic characters of this movie. Take, for example, the pitch; the most ineffective, devilish, devilish portrait of the devil since Freddy Mercury and Wayne Sleep joined forces to create a Satan costume for ten feet with red paint and condom-covered horns. However, it creates some of the most fun moments in any movie. Seriously, this is not very well said. The same can be applied to any other character, forbidding a girl who behaves so innocently that she probably overcompensates for the serious crime she is part of. On the other hand, if the interstellar reconstruction station of Saint Nicholas is real, she has no chance of avoiding him for so long. Put simply, if you have not seen this movie, you can not consider yourself a serious buff. The painfully entertaining characteristics, acting, concept and almost racist almost racist make it necessary to see it over every previous movie (if you are after pure laughter).
