It's one great movie! I played all Nancy Drew games and read books, and never expected the movie to be so exciting and fun! If you've never heard of Nancy Drew, read the first book (Secret of the Old Clock) so that you can get used to Nancy, you can watch the movie because the movie does not really portray the name quickly. ;) My whole family liked it, and the plot was extremely interesting. This is the final comeback from Nancy Drew's previous films, which actor Nancy Drew did not fit. This movie is very similar to Alex Rider: Stormbreaker. It's so cool! Nancy Drew lovers, you must see it!
