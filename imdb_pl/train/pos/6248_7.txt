Being an Austrian, it was a simple knock on the face. Fortunately, I do not live anywhere near the place where the movie takes place, but unfortunately it presents everything that the rest of Austria hates Viennese people (or people near this region). And it is very easy to read that this is exactly the intention of the directors: let your head sink into your hands and say "Oh my God, how is it possible!". No, not with me, (in my opinion) completely exaggerated uncensored swinger club scene is not necessary, I watch porn, of course, but in this context I was rather disgusted than in the right context. <br /> <br /> This movie is about how people who are introduced because of lack of education or bad company try to survive and live in a world of unnecessary and boring horizons. A girl who is treated like a whore by her super-jealous boy (and keeps coming back), a teacher who discovers her masochism, putting the life of her super-cruel "mistress" on the line, an older couple who has an almost daily mathematical cycle (she is "The official deputy" of his ex-wife), a couple who just got divorced and whether the ex-husband suffered from the actions of his ex-wife who apparently has a relationship with his masseuse and finally a crazy hitchhiker who asks his drivers the most unusual questions and stretches his nerves just being very annoying. <br /> <br /> After seeing this, you feel almost nothing. You are not even shocked, sad, depressed or willing to do anything ... Maybe that's why I gave him 7 points, that made me react in a way I had never reacted before. If it's good or bad, it's up to you!
