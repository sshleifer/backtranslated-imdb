For the first time, I saw this movie as a teenager, about the age at which children start thinking about their identity. I was very much touched by the scene of the man and children she raised as her own. The eldest boy has been mocked that his mother is a prostitute, and none of his siblings have the same biological father (which Kurosawa makes plain with children who do not look like themselves). The man is still convincing the boy that he is their father according to the only definition that matters. A man is considered a father by all children, with the exception of one who still prefers his brother. <br /> <br /> Each vignette is also convincing for their own stories and conclusions. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie, even if it's not the best Kurosawa movie.
