I'm disappointed that Reiser (who wrote this movie) felt the need to use so many vulgarisms for no reason. Maybe it's his idea for "movies for adults", a lot of unpleasant words with humor dropped into the bathroom? I thought about him better and think less of him about this film. <br /> <br /> Falk's acting and some moments of humor, as well as some important topics, made me give him such a high score. > <br /> It can be a good movie for adult children to watch and laugh at their own people and their weaknesses. But the lack of consideration for viewers' families seriously damages what could have been a family movie, but it fails. It is definitely not worth spending money, although it may be worth watching for free on TV.
