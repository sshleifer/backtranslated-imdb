The classic biographical Hollywood is the best sense of the genre. Gooding and DeNiro present spectacularly cordial performances in two major roles, and the supporting cast is equally excellent, with exceptional performances by Carl Lumbly and Michael Rapoport. <br /> <br /> The only "rivet" that I can choose is that Theron's role was unnecessary and distracting (not her performance, which was fine, just the movie seemed to add two unnecessary scenes to adapt to her role). <br /> <br /> Besides, the characteristics, dynamics and action of a true story are fascinating and unforgettable. The evolution of the main characters and the way they experience the evolution of their beings are characteristic of exceptional artists. Despite the extreme length of the film, the tempo remains intact. The result is also great. <br /> <br /> Is this predictable Hollywood movie? You bet. So addicts from Mike Leigh should take away the star, but everyone should be happy.
