I agree with the previous commentary on naming the content of the film "everyday madness," but I would like to specify that: "Dog Days" refers to how women are treated in the (male) society. The episodes we see here show some differences in the daily discrimination of women, mostly divided into age groups. There is an older man who makes his new partner look and behave like his dead wife, treating her like a doll that behaves "worthy to wear" the dress of the first. There is a middle-aged couple in whose relationship he is almost a slave, and he (brutal) master. Next, we find a slightly younger man who does not communicate with his friend / wife and instead of being really jealous of his affairs, he even befriends his competitor. A young adult man explaining to his friend - a girl who is really worried that he is beautiful enough for him - that he must be a jewelry at his side and adhere to his narrow, viewed label principles. In the end, there is a man at the age of fifty who, calculating his advantage, provides a crude hitchhike to a woman to a furious customer who - taking her blame for scratching his car - naturally beats her. To supplement the examples, we find a man's buddy in the "slave master" - a couple - after massively abusing her - threatening and humiliating the former "in her name" because he will get rid of his partner and take him as his new "master". All this time, the inhabitants of the newly built district in which the action takes place, rest under the scorching summer sun - absolutely motionless (sic!). Unfortunately, I have not seen the last minutes of this shocking and authentic illustration of the archaic structures that still prevail in the relations between men and women, but what I saw convincingly analyzed the repertoire of discrimination. Probably a helpful tool in teaching even a less sensitive viewer what is wrong - thanks to good visualization.
