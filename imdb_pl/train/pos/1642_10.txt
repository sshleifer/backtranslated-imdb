I have not seen the movie since the first release, but it was unforgettable. The performances of Rip Torn and Conchata Farrell were outstanding, excellent photography, moving story and everything else was at the highest level. However, it seems that you have forgotten about it <br /> <br /> Maybe because the UK is a strange market, but I have not seen a movie on TV or video, which is sad. Was he more successful in the United States, where it is right to consider him a rather accurate historical drama? <br /> <br /> Always think that 50% of a good movie is music and although I'm not sure, I think the title theme was a simple but moving clarinet solo "What a friend we have in Jesus". The film then toppled it! Am I right or not?
