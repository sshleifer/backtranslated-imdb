I thought that this movie was very well prepared. Also the teachers were great. I liked how everyone overcame their conflicts and achieved their goals. I recommend this movie to everyone. It was certainly worth spending time and money to watch it. Atlantis has a few comic scenes that made me laugh. Other scenes have saddened me. And others enjoyed me. This is a movie in which every age can enjoy. From the moment when Milo is a crazy "professor" or until he gathers the crew for a fantastic journey under the sea. After watching the movie, I read the book. It was also good, but the movie puts better pictures in your mind. It's like a book. But go and watch this movie!
