I know it's really trivial at times ... But the acting is amazing, and Melissa Joan Hart is as sweet as a button. I really like this program and I am almost embarrassed that I am doing a b / c show. for being really simple, but it makes me feel good. My only problem is that sometimes it can be quite low budget - sometimes the actors change and you just have to deal with it ... Like Sabrina's father is 2 different guys in the middle of the movie ... I mean, they could not just say he was an uncle or something? Still, I can not resist admiring this show. Harvey and Sabrina make a really cute couple, and Salem is absolutely funny. I definitely recommend it if you are looking for a light and fun entertainment ... My favorite episode is "Pancake Madness" ... HILARIOUS episode. The best season is probably 3 ... I'm not a fan of some phrases from the seventh season ... When you get to college, Morgan joins the group, and her dialogue is painful and very poorly preserved ... Plus she is ugly, so jokes about how she survived her good looks were lost to me ... but I think it was set for a really good eighth season and I was very sad to see that one of my favorite programs has been canceled!
