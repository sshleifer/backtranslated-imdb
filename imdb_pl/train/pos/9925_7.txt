When I rented Domino, I expected it to be very stupid. I hate movies that have really brilliant assembly and photos, and Domino also has very bad reviews. The only reason I watched this is that I liked Keira Knightley, Mickey Rourke, Christopher Walken and Tony Scott on other occasions. I just like telling adventure stories. Yes, the editing and the pictures were crazy, the story was weak, and the acting was mediocre, but I still loved this movie for some strange reason. Domino was very, very funny and often very funny. It was terribly underestimated when it was released, I think everyone wanted a more emotional journey, like the last Scotts Man on Fire movie, and instead got great entertainment. I actually understand why everyone hated Domino so much, even though I loved him and recommended him.
