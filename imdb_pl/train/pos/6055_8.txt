I did not expect much after this film, but I was very pleasantly surprised because it is light, funny and very well watched. The central trio of dead cyclists was surprisingly nice when they staggered and fooled their way to the center of Wales. Humor was gentle and subtle, just like the three characters (they are witnesses of the sympathetic treatment of a small old shop lady). The atmosphere of rural Wales has been perfectly captured and the soundtrack has been very well chosen. Cleverly and carefully written, with great attention to detail - I have never seen such a realistic representation of an alternative culture - I felt that I was with them. Very light to the touch and full of fun - not what you can expect from a film about motorcyclists and drugs. Pleasure on all fronts and difficult to criticize, though I thought the last two scenes were a bit bad - the movie should end when they left Wales. But in general, the film's unexpected treasure.
