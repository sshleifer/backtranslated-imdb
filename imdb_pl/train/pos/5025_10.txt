Man, some of you have to relax. This film was an artistic genius. Instead of looking for reasoning or messages justifying it in your reality, why do not you understand that this is a work of fiction? History. Entertainment, for God's sake (without words). It seems to me that too many people here try to be film critics - and they do not do it well. I am so impressed with the film and work of Bill Paxton that I intend to contact him personally. You know, if you did not try to analyze what's happening in the story, you can just enjoy the movie. Me and all my friends did it!
