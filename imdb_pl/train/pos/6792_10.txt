I remember this game. He always lay alone on the shelves, until one day I decided to try something new for a change and I got this game. I looked at it with admiration, because it was the first PS1 game I had and which had 4 discs. When I played it, I could not seriously lower the controller's level. <br /> <br /> The plot of this game is so good and twisted that it is almost as good as the plot of Final Fantasy VII, and it is difficult to achieve. When you play this game, you get so involved in the characters that it's unbelievable that it's just a PS1 game because it feels like a movie. And I believe that it should be a movie. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that this game is very unheard of in the game and hardly anyone has played or disliked it, because it is one of those games on which the ends of shelves sit, with a 50% discount on him, trying to sell. Well, I'm one of those people who always look at those at the end and try them, and most of them turn out to be really good. Heck, yes I got to Final Fantasy VII, looking in the directory and finding it. But this is different than Final Fantasy. <br /> <br /> Legend of Dragoon is the only game or RPG that is better than most Square Enix games, which is surprising. I would not be surprised if it was made by Square Enix, but it is not. Almost no game I play is better than the Final Fantasy series or the Dragon Quest series, but it is. But what really worries me is why it is very little known and it is not praised what it should be. <br /> <br /> The graphics are quite good for the PS1 game, but what can you expect from it? It is a PS1 man, produced in 1999. The story, which I have already mentioned, is amazing, almost beats VII. The characters are amazing, you are so involved in them and their actions. <br /> <br /> A decisive 10 out of 10. Definitely deserves more praise and a very well done RPG by a company other than Square Enix.
