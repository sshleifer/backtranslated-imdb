De Vierde Man (The Fourth Man) by Paul Verhoeven is one of the most thrilling thrillers I've ever seen. It was a really nice surprise. The story is about Gerardo the double-sex writer (Jeroen Krabbe), who is lured in connection with the beautiful hairdresser Christine (Ren√©e Soutendijk), but in Gerard's twisted mind the story may be something more. Verhoeven and operator Jan De Bont create a beautiful and dense atmosphere full of surreal and disgusting sexual images, it really draws you into history, you do not want to watch, but you can not turn around. This is definitely the best Verhoeven movie (maybe only after Robocop). True The Fourth Man is not for everyone, some sex scenes are pretty free (just ignore them, but believe me, if you watch for at least ten minutes, you'll be hooked.) It's one of those movies you need to know how it ends, a real crime story in the Hitchcock tradition, convincing, controversial and exciting, I even like the metaphor of a spider. <br /> <br /> 8/10
