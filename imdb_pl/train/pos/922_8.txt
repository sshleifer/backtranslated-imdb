At least half an hour a week. I have not been interested in anything in large 3 networks (ABC / CBS / NBC) for years. All lions are interesting, although Larry can sometimes get upset. I really like the action figure from Middle Earth they bring with Hunter. Most other characters are also interesting. Siegfried and Roy's fairytales are also fun. The animation is at the highest level and by far the best CG that was made in the weekly television program. Usually, when they employ big names to play in the series, they try to hide a bad script or characters. However, this is not entirely true in this performance. There are a few forms weak and improved by voice acting, but in general characters stand alone. <br /> <br /> It's definitely for 16 and more years. There is nothing here, which most children have not heard before, and most of the jokes will probably go through their heads. It's definitely not as primitive and nervous as South Park, but it brings a bit of the same "Bash to everyone". One example is that he simultaneously laughs with both Dick Cheney and Barbara Streisand in one episode. <br /> <br /> Father Pride and other Dreamworks productions, such as Shrek, also feel the spiritual successors of Animaniacs, Pinky and the Brain and Freakazoid. It's the same kind of growing up humor. Maybe it's not as witty as the classic Spielberg TV series, but it's still good. <br /> <br /> I hope that it will end well this season and will be renewed for the next seasons. Otherwise, I can never find a reason to re-watch the big 3.
