When I saw this movie for the first time in the early 1970s, I was delighted with the film. Visually, it was stunning, and campus events in Europe and the US made you refer to what Antonioni was trying to say so visually in the last 15 minutes of the movie: blowing up "tyranny" outlets and big business interests. Multiple blowing up a beautiful home in the middle of the desert, a leading female figure enjoying a natural stream of cold water, painting a plane in psychedelic designs (even staid British Airways did a few years ago) are some of the images copied by the advertising staff around world for decades. Even Pink Floyd increased his fan after the film was released. <br /> <br /> You see this movie about 30 years later and you start to wonder why the same movie has lost its charm. Today, anti-establishment films have more content - facts, documentation, great performances and great scenarios. Antonioni seems to be outdated; faulty genius. Even watching Antonioni's "Blow Up" today gives a similar feeling that he is passe. <br /> <br /> "Zabriski Point" must be evaluated for what it was when it was released. It was a great movie if you saw it on Panavision's wide screen, unlike the Dwarven TV screens. Visual and sound charm (Mick Jagger, Kieth Richards, Pink Floyd, et al.) Still remains. The leading couple were not great actors, but they were lovely and natural. One of them (Mark Frechette) died in prison in the USA, expanding the reality of nonconformist values ​​he personified in the film. <br /> <br /> Today, Antonioni does not seem to be "synchronized". But watch carefully and you will appreciate the quiet sounds of ordinary actors - Roda Taylor, G.D. Spradling, ladies by the pool, policemen in the airstrip. Real sounds contrast with nonconformists. Antonioni was important 30 years ago, but his mastery of the medium can not be questioned even today. He knew what he was doing.
