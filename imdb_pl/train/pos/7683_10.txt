I loved the good times with the rest of many of you. I love to read INTELLIGENT and GREAT comment. Writers in this series were fantastic, and the Actors were out of TALENTED. To answer Strawberry22 (the nicest commentary to the second positive and positive commentary) ... What happened that James died in an accident (I think I remember it was a car accident or a car accident) and it was the saddest episode (when it was the first time it was aired, and I was a small thing ... it was so sad for me ...). <br /> <br /> Florida and children are really leaving projects and EVEN become neighbors with Willona (Wilnona) and that's how the last show ended. <br /> <br /> ALL children have achieved their dreams and found an opportunity in each of their dreams. It was a great ending and I cried because I was happy with them, and the program seemed so realistic that I really believed in their fate. I hope this kind of ending is true for many. <br /> <br /> A great performance and many other great performances, including Benson and The Jeffersons. It was an amazing time for African American television, and the best writers were amazing then. TV LAND is amazing because of the memories, and I just LOVE, because I can not STILL the trash we are watching today. EVER ... let's quickly bring back the seventies and eighties ... your intelligent viewers are a dying race here and we need better material. <br /> <br /> Love, TV LAND original comic from the 70's and 80's (as they sing in "ALL in the Family" ... these were the days ...
