I felt compelled to write a review for Space Cobra, because it obtained a good score of 7.3 stars, but only a few reviews at the time of writing this text was particularly positive. Strange situation and I hope that my positive review will show people this old and most-forgotten movie about Anime. Space Cobra is a funky tale of a smuggler and villain who engages in the three sisters of the ancient and dead planet and the forces of evil who want to use the powers of the planets. This is an old movie and animation shows, but what is lacking in modern refinement, makes up for the abundance of charm. Space Cobra is very adapted to the western public and very easy to watch. There are few, if any, references to specific Japanese culture and great for novices from Anime to watch and enjoy. Space Cobra is witty and pleasant. I can not tell you how much of it comes from the English dub or intentions of the creator, but this is one of the few Japanese comedy characters that I think is really fun. The style is very characteristic of Barbarells from the sixties and the fantastic soundtrack of Yello. The style is colorful and resourceful, and continuous activities are aimed at transferring history. The most bizarre aspect of this movie is how it starts out as a comedy and ends with a very dramatic note. I can not come up with another anime movie or a general movie that would be able to do it so smoothly and convincingly. You barely realize that this is happening, but it's done subtly and it seems completely natural. You really feel that the characters have gone on a journey and their lives have been changed by the whole experience. Check if you can.
