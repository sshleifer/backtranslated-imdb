This movie is cool to watch. If you liked "Dave" with Kevin Klein, you'll have a chance. Think that "Dave" left South America when Dreyfus plays Jack Noah, the actor between the works, who was chosen by the head of the island country of the Parador secret police to replace the drunken drunk dictator Alfons Simms with a heart attack and died. Noah struggles with him, helping him as the mistress of the former dictator, trying to foil Raul Julia's plans. Jonathan Winters also appears as a rich American emigrant who turns out to be a CIA. Also with Polly Holiday and Fernando Rey. <br /> <br /> There are some absurd moments, such as the fact that the body of the old dictator is frozen for a year, and the last scene in which Sonia Braga, who has a bee circulates in the bloody, crazy Dreyfus body, is seen moments later everything in virgin white, with no streak on it. But all in all, it's great fun.
