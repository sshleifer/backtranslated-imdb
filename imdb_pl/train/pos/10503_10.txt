When I first got N64 when I was five or six, I fell in love with him and my first game was Super Mario 64. I loved it! The graphics were great for their time, good storyline, great odds and above everything, the best music I heard in Nintendo. <br /> <br /> I do not remember the whole story, but I think Princess Peach was kidnapped by Bowser, and Mario must save her. The game consists of capturing 120 stars from the curses in the castle. Each of them had about five or six challenges to get the stars. There are parts of the castle where you can get more stars. But of course you defeated Bowser. * I think there are three levels to overcome Bowser * Let's start with the character. Mario is the main character and gets helpful advice from Toad, so he's basically one of your only alliances. I heard that Luigi and Yoshi are in the game at the end. The main villain is Bowser, and there are several other characters, such as Boo and Goomba. The characters are really great. <br /> <br /> Go ahead, what do you say on the graphics? People say gameplay is more important than graphics, and I totally agree with that. But with its great story are great graphics. Especially on time. I have a lot of other Nintendo games, such as 007 and their graphics compare with Super Mario.Bright colors, great effects and amazing sound effects. The graphics on water courses are very good. Beside the worlds Bowser has the best graphics in the game. <br /> <br /> Now music. This is my favorite part of the game. Growing up, when I was playing at an early age, I was happy to leave the game all night, so the music fell asleep. Especially music from Jolly Roger Bay, which was calm and wonderful. There are also others who are also great, especially in the worlds with Bowser, the ones that hold on to me the most and are my favorites. <br /> <br /> This game was my favorite time as a developing player and I love it. This game gets 10/10 or ***** (5) / ***** (5) GO PLAY THE GAME!
