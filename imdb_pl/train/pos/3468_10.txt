I love this movie! At first I hesitated whether I would look at him because I thought it would be too painful. I remember how hard it was when John was shot. However, watching "Two of us" brought me back a happier time when he was still alive and there was hope and possibility. I think the writer has done an amazing job of presenting what could have been. Aidan Quinn was delighted like Paul and he faced the challenge. I was impressed by his accent and manners. Jared Harris is also very talented and was quite credible as John. My favorite parts were the park scene and the roof stage - which was so poignant. The film left me sad and reassuring, given the circumstances.
