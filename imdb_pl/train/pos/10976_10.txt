That's why I love this site so much! I saw this movie in 1980 on British television. Over the years I wanted to know more, because he stayed with me as one of the most amazing things I've ever seen in my life. With a few key words to remember, I've followed the movie here and a lot of information, including the fact that it will soon become an off-Broadway musical! <br /> <br /> Interestingly, in contrast to the previous creator of comments, I do not remember that I found this movie sad or exploitative. On the contrary, the extraordinary relationship between mother and daughter is in the mind as a testimony to great strength, honor and dignity. You may think ironically, given the misery of their lives. Maybe because I live in Great Britain, where declining grandeur has a fixed language in the life of old money, where misery is often tolerated as proof of good breeding; I saw it as a rare and unique portrait of a huge spirit, deep and deep humor, whose completely delicate and delicately balanced material gave it control and respect. In a sense, I was sorry that it was discussed as a "cult". Over the years, when it disappeared in my mind, it shone the brightest, most of all as the only wonderful and excellent television experience. It was such a very private show, it seems strange to think that it becomes so public that it is a New York musical. But maybe somewhere, the daughter will be amused by this result. She may have the last laugh ... (They made a musical in front of you Jackie O ')
