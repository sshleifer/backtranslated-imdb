Late in the night, on an empty road, in an empty salon, Martin Sheen spins a shot for Robert Carradine of Hopalong Cassidy and friends following a group of murderous cows who killed several men and kidnapped Cassidy's girlfriend. br /> Writer / director Christopher Coppola He could have caused the wrath of the purists of William Boyd, daring to create a modern low-budget movie with their beloved Hoppy, but I'm glad he did! No character should be so attached to the actor that no one else will be able to play it again! <br /> <br /> I thought it was fun and an interesting update of the classic programmers of the thirties and forties. Although he is guilty of doing something bad, it's serious enough and unpretentious, which makes it hard to dislike me. <br /> <br /> The whole production, however, is a bit strange, but I really liked the scenes between Sheen and Carridine. The fact that we watch the story in the story makes strangeness and exaggerations more pleasant.
