The narrative confirms the classic picture of good versus evil in the form of a brother and brother's fight. The main character, Lin Macadam, played by James Stewart, represents justice and righteousness. His brother, who works under the leadership of the Dutch Henry Brown, played by Stephen McNally, means a classical stage trainer robbing a Western outlaw, chased by his brother for killing their father. The world in which history takes place is a classic dystopian west, in which the only way to prevent its inhabitants from killing each other is to take side arms as soon as they enter the city, and the man responsible for maintaining this law and order is a classic western lawyer Wyat Earp. <br /> <br /> There are also such flat characters typical of the West, such as a murderous Indian warrior, a beleaguered cavalryman and a lady in a hat wearing a hat. <br /> <br /> Another important archetype in this film that gives the film a name is a custom-made Winchester rifle. Weapons can be seen as an allegory of prizes awarded to those who do things honorably. When it is stolen from the rightful owner, it brings tragedy to anyone who has contact with it. In this sense, it resembles other icons such as the Holy Grail in the Searchers of the Lost Ark and the blood-stained letter in Saving Private Ryan. This gives the film an element of surrealism that is usually lacking in westerns, a genre unknown from esoteric themes and symbols. <br /> <br /> Being essentially a film of revenge, he shares this element with many other examples of the genre, such as the No-name on the ball of Jacek Arnold and Unforgiven by Clint Eastwood. <br /> <br /> There is also a silent topic of rape at Winchester '73. Waco Johnny Dean, one of the villains of the film played very effectively by Dan Duryea, kidnaps a woman after killing her husband. An unstable cowboy plays affectionately with her husband and sends him like a caricature of a cat playing with an insect to bite his head off. Waco Johnny Dean finally gets what comes to him after getting in touch with the ominous Winchester rifle. <br /> <br /> The main story of Winchester '73 recalls the mythological story of Jason and his quest for a golden fleece, as Argonautica told Apollonius. Both stories concern the acquisition of a sacred object that has some immaterial quality. Like Jason, Stewart's character jumps from one adventure to another in search of a one-of-a-kind reward. Another topic in Winchester '73, similar to the mythical story, is the fight between brothers. A few stories about antiquity deal with this issue, such as the Hebrew Bible story about Cain and Abel, and the story of the vulgar Romulus and Remus. <br /> <br /> Regarding the subject of kidnapping and rape present in Anthony Mann's film, he is present in many mythological works, such as rape on Europe, as Ovid told in his Metamorphoses. <br /> <br /> Winchester '73 is a great example of the western genre and acts as a target for many classic American western and ancient mythological themes.
