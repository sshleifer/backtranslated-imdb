I saw the Lady with Red Hair come back when she appeared, and I did not remember it was nice. The truth is that despite its base in true history, its screen is stupid and unbelievable. The real advantage of the photo is cast. The constellation of some of the best supporting players of the 1930s and 1940s is the background for the delicate, intelligent work of the always underestimated Miriam Hopkins and the wonderful, spectacular performance of Claude Rains, who, as usual, is the best thing in a photo. What an actor! He never won an Oscar, but he is in good company with Chaplin, Garbo and Hitchcock. Perhaps Lady with Red Hair contains his best work in movies. See it and enjoy it. <br /> <br />
