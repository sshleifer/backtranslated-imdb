Do not believe all the negative reviews that this film receives. Yes, it is cheap. Yes, the blood is funny. And yes, acting is below the norm. However, this is a textbook example of an early slass, and if it is your "thing" (its mine!), You'll like this one. There are enough good aspects to this film to compensate for the disadvantages. First of all, the result of the then unknown Christopher Young is very frightening and perfectly accentuates violence. The ending is a welcome break from the predictable optimistic endings of most films. And last but not least, what the movie did for me. The creators of this film could do a much better "dress up" set to make it more credible as a dorm. However, if you can overlook this disadvantage, the setting is great. Four colleagues, all alone in a huge, abandoned, condemned building, waiting only for the destruction ... it is possible. While watching, let your imagination do some work and you can enjoy the movie just like me.
