This is, by all categories, the best movie I've ever seen. Forget Hollywood - their films are always sucked - it's art! The story of Moon Child begins with Kei - a Japanese vampire who hates what he has become and lives in denial. His wish for the final death leads him to Mallepy, where the refugees from several Asian countries live. Here he meets Sho, an orphan who lives on the street. <br /> <br /> Since then, the film is an intense experience that is based on the visual and emotional part of the film. He has everything; you laugh, you cry, you get nervous, you're excited, sad, happy ... Never a movie touched me that way. And the actors are amazing - I've never heard anyone speak so many languages ​​without sounding strange. Great praise for the editor for creating this masterpiece ... <br /> <br /> The last commentary to this genius movie is that it is Gackt (former singer Malice Mizer) and Hyde (vocalist L'Arc ~ en ~ ciel) in the perfect roles of Sho and Kei. I am amazed at how Gackt can change his way of speaking and acting depending on the age in which he behaves. <br /> <br /> This is a must see. If you never see any movies, see Moon Child, Crow (Brandon Lee) and the newly released Final Fantasy VII - Advent Children. Of course in original languages!
