I would like the "70's show" to be back on television. It was the biggest concert ever !!! They should create episodes between other episodes, but of course it would be confusing. But I would like him to come back and do more episodes. Please, come back ... The show was totally funny. You can not laugh without seeing the episode. Each episode is really a fun part, and the show was much better when Hyde and Jackie went out with each other. These were the best episodes. "This 70's show is the best." It will always be the best show ever. It was really sad when the concert ended. They should create new episodes.
