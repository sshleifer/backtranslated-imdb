Most of Kong Kong's martial arts movies from the '70s (and' 80s) barely function as films; There are usually a few well-planned combat sequences, but the plot is quite thin to fill the gaps between these nodes - really, like porn movies. <br /> <br /> But this one does a few things well. Apparently there is a direction and choreography that limits every fighter to "style" - it is really based on the acrobatics of the Chinese circus and comedy theater, but the effect works. <br /> <br /> Second, there is a camera language that uses several impressive techniques (even by today's measurements), changing the speed of the real-time projection to the released, and from unfiltered to filtered views to show the direction of the story towards past or future. <br /> <br /> The least obvious, but the most powerful and unexpected, is the design. The winner of this competition is determined to "develop" the story. Master (writer) creates a game in which the main character does not know whom he is looking for, which is the same situation in which we see. One by one, he discovers who is who, at the same pace in which we find who is who. All this follows after tragedii / noir arc. The ending aims at irony, and la "The Sting". Much more clever things than what usually comes from this genre. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​"five venoms" is a template of "deadly viper killers" Tarantino from the "Kill Bill" volumes.
