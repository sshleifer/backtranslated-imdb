This last Dutch Verhooven movie made me laugh. As a film lover, looking for every little detail and references in every movie, etc. I can provide everyone interested in film art with the fact that this piece entertains all the senses. I have not read Gerard Reves' book on which the film is based, but I still believe that we get a frank image of a somewhat conceited poet / writer who gets him (in a sense - he does not break down here). Anty-Hero surrounded by characters who have their ambiguous intentions, just like him. All in a perfectly packed cinematography, Paul Verhopven manages to transform quite a rather charming "gesellich (?)" Dutch locations into a full of tension film scenery, impressive work!
