All right, it was a fairly delicate number, but I can not stop thinking that I've seen it before. It reminds me of another VCA movie that I saw in Poitier, titled "OTHER DAYS RUBY RAE". He also had fragments of "Welcome to the Dollhouse" and "Ratcatcher" and Lynne Ramsay in his performance. It does not mean that they are not tasteful references ... only that they feel very modern and very fashionable ... which makes me feel that this is closer to advertising (as an approach in style and history) than the original work and an authentic author. <br /> <br /> The pictures are just ... too perfect for my taste. Too much coral filter (or charcoal) for my preferences ... too framed 12mm. Therefore, the whole impression left me a bit distant - watch out for art that announces too easily! The French (they are a conservative group) seemed to buy the same as the jury ... but the choice of the short film in Cannes is notoriously conservative compared to the choice of function, although I wonder what has happened in recent years.
