I saw it in the theater during its first release and it was disturbing because I am sure it will continue. It was the first part of the '68 and it was still circulating in cities all over America, and recently in my hometown there was a mass murder, in which I saw a man raging in a shooting. The freshness of this close-to-home event combined with this dramatic story created a very disturbing theatrical experience. It really revived the great game of Robert Blake and Scott Wilson. I knew a novel based on the real Truman Capote event, and the script and direction of Richard Brooks turned this event and Truman's interpretation into a fascinating, film adaptation. Quincy Jones's music effectively gives it a story. I've only seen it a few times since. It was too real. Almost like being a witness to the crime itself and driving with killers. I would give it 9.0 possible 10. Society today is so anesthetized by violence and crime that it probably seems slow and tame and can be seen with less effect, but for anyone who is over 50, it will be a characteristic feature of the criminal's test Psyche.
