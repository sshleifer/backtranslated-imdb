Although I like Kurt Vonnegut, I'm not particularly interested in spying stories and I did not know it. The only reason I watched this was Nick Nolte, who is one of my favorite actors since I saw "Breakfast of Champions" and "Hotel Rwanda". But the movie brought me a pleasant surprise. Of course, Nolte was great, but also the plot. There were relatively few political intrigues and more focused on the moral question: reading his anti-Semitic radio comments with hidden secret messages for Americans, he actually contributed to the general attitude of the Germans (and, as it turns out, the Americans) towards Jews or Hitler. Who has more weight, his service to his country or his unconscious contribution to anti-Semitism? This dilemma is even more visible because these words are never spoken, even as a narrative. Howard Campbell Jr. (Nolte) is a person who has learned to hide his feelings so perfectly that he does not open himself, even in his memories. The internal conflict of such a character is almost impossible to present - but thanks to perfect acting and photography, this film works. <br /> <br /> There are other points, such as the humor or ironic use of romantic film (eg White Christmas song), which makes it really different than average American movies. I recommend to all those who are bored with Hollywood spy movies.
