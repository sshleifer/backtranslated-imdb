Perhaps the best book of Isabel Allende, House of the Spirits, describes an alternative Chilean history, this full of magic, a mystical veil and some pervasive sadness. This film gathers a great cast and a great artistic direction, with a script that can not contain the entire quality of this book. It is remarkable that an almost unknown country, such as Chile, is as well represented as it is in this film, which perhaps is the only sin to aim too high and thus leave the illiterate audience a bit worried, mainly because they did not understand much .
