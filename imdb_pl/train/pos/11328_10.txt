This movie is great. If you like watching Class B movies, I mean. This is a classic school movie from the 80's, in which one song is played throughout the entire soundtrack. A scary movie, but it's worth renting to make fun of it, or just watching old people pop out of the kettles with knives. Funny if you ask me.
