This Chinese film made me feel a lot of similarities with members of the culture, to which I do not belong and to which I am not far away. In Buddhist law, the film helps to make contact with every character and happiness from routine activities. <br /> <br /> All actors are brilliant, and Xu Hzu emanates kindness and wisdom, but also sensitive and mean. Er Min, the late brother, shows us that intelligence and wisdom are not equal and that wisdom comes to and from the most diverse people in this universe. Other China is far from Chinese realism, but it has a lot of humanity and realism of a different kind. <br /> <br /> Get it. You will not be dissapointed.
