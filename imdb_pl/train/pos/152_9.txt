I saw "El Mar" yesterday and thought it was a great movie. It starts with an episode from childhood in the life of three main characters: Ramallo, Manuel Tur and Francisco. Then we jump to the hospital for 10 years, where 3 friends meet. <br /> <br /> Religion, illness, love, violence and sexuality go wild in the film and an intense and tense film. <Br /> <br /> I see people complain that the movie is too bloody and I think they missed the sense of the story. It's a violent, intense and sad story. People are expected to suffer. Cry. Get hurt. Bleed. And I think that what the film shows is not done for a pure shock value or presented in a tasteless way. I know that some people like their films "clean", even those with violence. But sometimes the movie has to make you feel uncomfortable at work. This is one of those movies. And this is a great movie. <br /> <br /> The only disadvantage I found was that there were 3 or 4 moments when some details of the story were not 100% clear and only after reflecting on them at the end of the movie, it all made sense. But that did not matter much to the whole story, so I'm still giving it to 9.
