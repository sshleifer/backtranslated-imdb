"MacArthur" begins and ends with Gen. Douglas MacArthur's, Gregory Peck, Alma Mata at the US Military Academy of West Point on the Hudson. We see a weak, 82-year-old Gen.MacArthur, who gives a speech to the graduating class in 1962. On what a great honor it is to serve the country. The film then goes into a nearly two-hour retrospective on Gen. MacArthur's brilliant and controversial career, which begins in the darkest hours of World War II on the beleaguered island of Corregidor in the Philippines in the early spring of 1942. <br /> <Br /> He said to leave the island for Australia before the Japanese army would attack her Gen. MacArthur, for the first time in his military career, hardly disagrees with the direct orders of his president, US President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Dan O 'Herlihy. Feeling that he would leave his people in their greatest need, MacArthur reluctantly, along with his wife and young son, did what he was told only to persecute him to commemorate the war. It is for this reason that his escape under fire because of the death or Japanese captivity that forced General MacArthur to use all his influence so that FDR two years later began a serious invasion of the Philippians, instead of the island of Formosa, to support the promise made both to the Philippines and thousands of American prisoners of war. That he would come back and come back with the power of the American army and the navy to support his commitment! <br /> <br /> In two years to invade the Philippine Islands, General MacArther crushed the Japanese forces in South Pafific in a series of brilliantly invented island battles that isolated and starved hundreds of thousands of Japanese soldiers. The general suffered from much smaller US military losses than any other allied commander in the Pacific War! <br /> <br /> It was in the Korean War of 1950/51, when General MacArthur won the greatest victory and his worst military defeat. After winging the progressing North Korean army in brilliant and perfectly executed, with the invasion of US marines suffering less than 100 deaths, invasion of the back door or left hooks on Inchon Gen. MacArther feeling invincible sent US / UN forces under his command to the very border along the communist Yalu river red China. Told by his subordinates that he was facing the threat of mass ground attack by Communist Chinese troops, General MacArthur, he pressed until the attack materialized US and UN forces on ribbons. The unstoppable wave following the attack of the Red Chinese soldiers forced US / UN forces to retreat in the "Big Bug" of 1950. Along with their lives, leaving all their equipment abroad, across the North Korean border, even abandoning the capital of South Korea Seoul! It turned out that it was one of the largest military disasters in US history, when US forces lost record, in the Korean War, 1000 lives on the first day-November. 29/30 1950-invasion of Chinese communists! <br /> <br /> Shaken and humiliated by what he allowed, mainly because of his own arrogance, that MacArthur would go on the offensive not against the progressing communist Chinese and Koreans, but his own commander and chieftain Pres. Harry S. Truman, Ed Flanders, in that there is no courage or courage to do what it needs: Start an invasion of communist China using nuclear weapons if it is necessary to stop its troops from mastering the Korean Peninsula! For Pres. Truman, who had just picked up so much trash from General MacArthur, that he had escaped publicly from his mouth, how he had wasted war, without going out, as MacArthur wanted, against the Red Chinese, it was the last straw! On April 11, 1951, Pres. Truman unceremoniously survived General MacArthur from the command of the Supreme Commander of the United States / UN forces in Korea! Presses. Truman's brave but very unpopular decision also, without going hand in hand with MacArthur's war strategy, prevented the outbreak of the Third World War with the ally of the Soviet-Communist Union of China, which at that time had a nuclear bomb in the US! Presumption Truman's controversial decision to shed the very popular General MacArthur also cost him his reelection in 1952. With such a low number of polls - in the mid-1920s - he withdrew - in March this year - from the presidential campaign of the United States! <br /> <br /> In the misfortune of Gen. MacArthur there was an absence, when the political and military climate in the world changed in the way of future wars. In the face of the horrors of nuclear war, in 1950/51, it would be a reality to commit suicide to go outside, as General MacArthur wanted, against the Red Chinese, with a possible detachment from the nuclear holocaust that would not only affect the USSR and Red China, but the whole world! This was the important reality of a future war that General MacArthur had never been taught, because A and H bombs had not yet been invented at West Point. <br /> <br /> Until 1962, we can now see that Gen. MacArthur, after completing his speech at West Point, became both an older and wiser soldier, and, since his retirement from the US military, the elder a statesman with a sense of war and total vanity. One of the things that General MacArthur was taught at a young age, from his father general of civil war Douglas MacArthur Sr, who held him for his whole life, was that for a soldier like him he should be the last in the first place in the settlement problems between nations. There are soldiers in this who must fight and die in it. It's been a lifetime, with the advent of the nuclear age, for General MacArthur, to finally understand how right and wise his father was, the winner of the Congress Medal of Honor!
