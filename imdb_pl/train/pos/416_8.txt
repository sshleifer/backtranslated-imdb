The Plainsman is a funny western, undoubtedly a classic that is current even today. Gary Cooper is Wild Bill Hickok, perfect for this role, along with John Wayne and James Stewart, they were the best actors who played western heroes in their generation. Jean Arthur is as great as Calamity Jane, no one I know, he did it better than she did. Even if it is not historically accurate, the film manages to capture the most important information about Hickoku and the time it takes place. Sometimes you have to sacrifice History to emphasize your point of view and this is what DeMille is doing here. Hickok's friendship with Buffalo Bill, the sale of rifles to Indians by a great producer to compensate for the losses that would end due to the end of civil war, Custer and Little Big Horn, restless relations between Buffalo Bill's wife, a religious woman with Hickoko, who killed many people, and an unusual romance between Hickok and Calamita, which makes "The Plainsman" an unconventional and interesting movie. Anthony Quinn has a very short look that already shows what a great actor he was to become. Much attention was devoted to showing the original departments from those times.
