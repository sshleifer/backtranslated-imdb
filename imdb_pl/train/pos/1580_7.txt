This is not another burning glance at the Holocaust, but rather an intimate story about events that took place on a small street in Berlin and some people involved. This film begins today in New York, where Ruth Weinstein (Jutta Lampe) mourns the death of her husband, and family members gathered at her side. Ruth's daughter, Hannah (Maria Schrader), slowly learns that her mother was brought up by an Aryan woman named Lena Fischer (Doris Schade), so she travels to Germany and locates a 90-year-old woman who tells her about the events at Rosenstrasse. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** <br /> <br /> Lena talks about Berlin in 1943, when the Gestapo would keep all Jewish spouses in the building at ul. have immunity for a marriage with the Aryans, and for nine days a group of women waited outside and shouted for their release. 8-year-old Ruth (Svea Lohde) waits for her mother to come out and has nowhere else to go, but meets 33-year-old Lena (Katja Riemann), who takes her. Lena's husband, Fabian (Martin Feifel) is also inside and eventually tries to meet Nazi officers to get them to do something. <br /> <br /> The film was directed by Margarethe von Trotta, who creates his first feature film for almost 10 years after working on television, and this is obviously not one of her more provocative efforts to remain one of the most respected directors in Europe. This is not one of those Nazi films in which we see terrible acts of inhumanity against Jews, although we see that some harsh treatment has been given, but instead it is rather a story about a small event that meant life and death of committed people. This film does not try to shock anyone or open the door to debates about the circumstances, but what he wants to do is simply shed light on a small but real life event that took place in the historical period. Part of the film power comes from the actors and there are some good performances that shine especially on Riemann and young Lohde and it's always good to see Schrader (Aimee and Jaguar) in a key role. This is not a great movie or something that will change your perspective on World War II, but given that innocent life has been condemned to death because of the events that have occurred, I think that the reason alone is important enough to be repeated this real story.
