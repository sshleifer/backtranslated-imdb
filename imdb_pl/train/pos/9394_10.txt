"Red Rock West" was one of the best 90's suspense thrillers with an excellent script (by John and Rick Dahl) that kept you in tune with the whole place on most of the movie. The film was superbly directed by John Dahl and included a great cast, including Nicolas Cage, Dennis Hopper, Lara Flynn Boyle, and especially J. T. Walsh (in an unforgettable performance), making it a thrilling and captivating thriller that can not be missed. The film never got too big publicity (it was the first time I caught up with it on TV) and that's why it's one of those special little gems you have to look for, but this unique movie slowly gains a cult after <br /> <br /> Nicolas Cage is Michael Williams who is broke and out of work when in the small town of Red Rock. Erroneously treated as a contract killer, Lyle of Dallas is shocked that he was offered $ 10,000 to murder the wife of the owner of Bar Wayne Brown (excellent J. T. Walsh). The game along with the plan and decides that he should go and warn his wife Brown, Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle), but then the story gets crowded and there are so many twists, turns and surprises - and double transactions - that the Cage is thrown from one crisis to the other and is trapped in a terrible situation from which he can not get out! Then, to make matters even more complicated, the real Lyle appears to perform a contract murder (played by favorite heavy Dennis Hopper). When Hopper discovers what happened, he goes to Cage, but no one could have anticipated the surprising events that follow him. <br /> <br /> Some of his favorite lines from the movie: <br /> <br /> Nicolas Cage (to Lara Flynn Boyle): "I hate to watch an innocent woman get hurt, but it's really a lot of money." <br /> <br /> J. T. Walsh (to Cage): "Michael Williams. Well, Michael, you will spend some time with us until we get to the bottom of it. " <br /> <br /> Boyle (to Cage): "You're not a killer?" Cage: "That's right, no. But the guy I'm supposed to be just got into the city, so you have to get out of here. " <br /> <br /> Boyle (to Cage): "OK, how are you going to explain the impersonation of a rented killer and take $ 10,000 from my husband? ". <br /> <br /> Extremely funny little thriller (only 98 minutes) with a story that never gives up and powerful acting according to all directors. Each film with the participation of J. T. Walsh is O.K. in my book "Red Rock West" was one of his best. How sad it was that the career of this exceptional actor was tragically shortened by a heart attack in 1998. The most prolific period for the "noir movie" was undoubtedly the forties, but "Red Rock West" is a good contemporary example of the genre and jumped into my list of "Top Ten" favorite movies. I am looking forward to more information from director John Dahl. 10/10 Clive Roberts. <br /> <br />
