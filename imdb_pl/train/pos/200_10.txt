Updated from previous comment. The marvelous and underestimated Marion Davies shows his comedy tracks in this late (1928) quiet comedy, which also shows the wonderful William Haines. Davies plays hick from Georgia, who breaks Hollywood with the help of Haines, a small player in raw comedies. They appear together in cheap comedies, until Marion is "discovered" and becomes a great dramatic star. <br /> <br /> A big hurray about Hollywood and its grudges. Davies and Haines are a great team and guests from such stars as Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, John Gilbert, Elinor Glyn, Norma Talmadge, Mae Murray, Rod LaRocque, Leatrice Joy, Dorothy Sebastian, Estelle Taylor, Louella Parsons, Renee Adoree, Aileen Pringle and Marion Davies (you must see this) are hoot. A must for any serious movie lover or for anyone who is interested in the still nasty Marion Davies! Dell Henderson plays his father. Polly Moran is a maid. Paul Ralli is a slimy guide. <br /> <br /> It is said that PEOPLE have used Gloria Swanson's career as a model (I think Mae Murray is closer). Davies and Swanson were friends. But the story of this movie coincides with Swanson's rise from one reel comedy Mack Sennett with Charlie Chaplin to STAR in Cecil B. DeMille's late teens and early 20s. <br /> <br /> Davies and Haines were huge MGM stars and friends . Strange that MGM never connected them to talkie. They are wonderful together! A sweet romance and a delightful trick of early Hollywood. There is mention of Greg Garbo and Bebe Daniels, but they do not appear.
