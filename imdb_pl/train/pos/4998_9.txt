Shannon Lee, daughter of Bruce Lee, in action in an exciting film from Hong Kong provides high martial arts action, which proves that, like her dead brother Brandon, is a real shard of the old block. At this fast pace you can die through stunt techniques, and the creators of Bond films should check if they want to spice up the stock quotient in the next adventure 007, because there are many innovative things with a bit of freshness and the original second unit works to strengthen already high the content of the action "AND NOW, YOU ARE DEATH". When you watch a movie at a fast pace and entertainment, you start to wonder how the cinema itself survived before the genre of martial arts emerged. I honestly believe that movies in general, and action movies in particular, were only sometimes the first to debut kung fu movies. Bruce Lee was the father of a modern action movie, and his legitimate surviving offspring Shannon did not release the family name here. Although there are a few nice performances in this film (Michel Wong by one), Shannon Lee will really remember Mandy's spectacular performance as a supreme girl.Hell, you can go away whistling her fights!
