This movie was absolutely wonderful. Time and culture in front of the partition have been beautifully recreated. Urmila gave another great performance. What I really admire in this film is the fact that it does not resort to fighting Pakistan, which is crazy in movies like Gadar and LOC. With the partition as a background, the film does not address political issues or focus on violence or what is good or bad. The film always focuses on the tragic life story of Urmila. Her fragile relationship with Manoj Bajpai has been perfectly presented. The film shows how people, both Hindus and Muslims, suffered from this division. The theme in which there is only one religion is really widespread in this film.
