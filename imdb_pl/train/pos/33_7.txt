This interesting Giallo strengthens a typical, but still thrilling plot and a really sadistic killer who apparently likes to hunt down his victims before murdering them in a bloody way. <br /> <br /> Directed by Emilio P. Miraglia, who a year earlier I also made a very interesting "La Notte che Evelyn Usci della Tomba" (see also my comment on this topic), the movie starts a bit slow, but all in all you waste time on unnecessary hints or sequences. <br /> <br /> This film is a German-Italian co-production, but it was released in Germany on video only in the 15-minute version of the story under the stupid title of "Horror House". At least the murder scenes that please every gorehound are completely intact, and the viewer is still given the killer motive at the end. But the Italian version containing all the material is of course the one to look for, of course. <br /> <br /> Convincing Giallo with obligatory turns and red herrings, "La Dama Rossa Uccide Sette Volte" is a highly recommended Giallo fan and a bit better than the above mentioned Mirraglia thriller.
