As a longtime Red Sox fan, I just had to see a movie. It was great! While there is never enough live material from the wonderful season of Red Sox 2004, there were great pictures of some of my favorite Red Sox players. While the movie is definitely a chick, he has enough baseball material from the amazing Red Sox return of 2004 to become one of my top 10 films of all time. I especially liked the Red Sox fans who were part of Ben's baseball family. The scene in which Ben meets his buddies on a working day to determine who will get tickets for certain games is fun! You need to check if you are looking for a healthy movie to watch with your spouse, date or other significant ... especially if you are a baseball fan ... or even more so if you are a fan of Red Sox !!!
