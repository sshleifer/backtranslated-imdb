as a habit I always like to read reviews of the "hated" movie. especially one that I would like to comment on. and this is not something like a point contract; I just like to see what people say on the back. <br /> <br /> However, I want to take care of one thing. many people who hated him called it "beautiful, but shallow", some even went so far as to say that the desire for norms, and also the inability to help a brother, was, at best, an ordinary conspiracy. <br /> <br /> I would like to disagree. <br /> <br /> as a brother of a sibling who has a similar dysfunction, I can relate. you see every day how they abuse themselves, knowing only that their current path will inevitably lead them to self-destruction. and it's not about the specifics of what they did when; how or why Paul decided to gamble and deal with dubious people; it is really more like they are connected. on the one hand they are real geniuses and on the other hand they are painfully self-destructive (it's like people like Howard Hughes - the same forces that drive them, the same forces that break them) and all the time you see it, you know it, and what's worse, you realize that you can not do anything about it. <br /> <br /> for norman maclean, the river flows through this probably way to find the answer to the question tragedy had to happen, and who was to blame. in the end no one is and often no reason. but you really need a lot of personal anguish to really come to this realization. sometimes it lasts a lifetime. and sometimes it never comes.
