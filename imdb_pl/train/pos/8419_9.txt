The Last Command (1928) is a silent film directed by Josef von Sternberg. He shows us the Tsarist General, the Grand Duke of Sergius Alexander (Emil Jannings) in his time of glory. In 1917 he had all the power, but after the revolution and the fall of Imperial Russia there is nothing. He also had the love of a woman, Natalie Dabrove (Evelyn Brent). About ten years later, he plays a small role in the film about the revolution. His old enemy, Lev Andreev (William Powell), is a director who decides whether to hire him as an extra movie or not. Last Command is a very good mute drama. Emil Jannings has unforgettable roles in running. Evelyn Brent is a wonderful leading woman. William Powell is great as There are always many scenes to remember in this movie. Like many scenes with Jannings and Brent. And then there is the ending with Powell and Jannings. It's a film that touches many parts.
