So I do not destroy it for you, I will be very short. There are some great acting and fun lines in the attractive cast. A young Harvard Med School graduate (Brian White) learns that he does not know as much as he thinks about people. She goes to a small Florida hospital for an internship because the girl (Mya) left him as a television producer. His senior resident (Wood Harris), greatly helped by his "creative co-worker" (Zoe Saldana), speeds up his pace. They help protect his career and show him the wider possibilities of being a compassionate doctor, not a player who wants to earn money (which seems to be true for many of my friends with the media).
