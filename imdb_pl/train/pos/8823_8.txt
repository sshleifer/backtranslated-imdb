Good film. It tells the boy's fantasy story, telling us how we are trapped in social situations and what extreme measures must be taken to behave differently. Or at least a feeling: you have to break every rule if you want to break one. If you would like to express love for someone you do not know, how would you do it without creating an urgent social situation? It is also about fascism deciding about the cultural life of others, about what kind of culture are tightening in our throats. What gives Disney or FOX or a suicide bomber the right to decide on our choice. Is it forbidden to drink the morning coffee by one person. Do we have to listen to NRJ's shout, see stupid tabloid headlines and street ads before we have our morning coffee?
