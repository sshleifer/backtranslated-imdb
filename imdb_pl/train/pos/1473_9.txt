Remember that every movie (let alone a documentary film) that provides all truth will evoke a negative and proportional level of cynicism, from those to whom all suggestions and quest for truths are no longer relevant, those of you who are already masters of psychology, the film and the captains of the soul undoubtedly consider this film superfluous, because you know everything you need to know. Congratulations. <br /> <br /> For those of us in the minority, such as myself, I found "The Perverts Guide To Cinmea" ... mostly brilliant and worth watching for people interested in films, psychology and modern philosophy. <br /> <br /> A bit like Scott Mclouds' Understanding Comics, director Sophie Fiennes, combines Slovenian philosopher, psychologist and social critic Slavoj Zizka with many films and scenes he discusses. The cover is a painting from The Birds (Zizek takes the boat to play the shot). <br /> <br /> Lacan's psychoanalysis, not necessarily screaming, an evening of fun ... but it is! If you like movies that are ... The knowledge of Lacan's psychoanalysis helps (symbolic, real and imaginary) are terms that start loosely at first, but the scenes that Zizek chooses and analyzes are extremely clear, which has always been very abstract to me topic. It is probably better to know the films he discusses than with the terminology he uses, which becomes clearer as the film unfolds. <br /> <br /> Why I love this film not because it chooses great movies to analyze or reveal the great truths about Lacan, but shows in a very practical and clever way where the film and psychology meet (and default philosophy). <br /> <br /> Why "The Sound of Music" in a sense fascist, why "Short cuts" are more than just a class and alienation, why birds attack in "Birds", what can you learn about the mind of "Resurrection of Aliens" "What is the" Solaris "planet I want, what" Psycho "and" Marx Brothers "have in common, and what the hell is David Lynch in the film after the movie ... well Zizek has some ideas. <br /> <br /> The role of the voice both in "The Excorcist" and "Star Wars: Revenge Of The Sith", is perhaps the strongest and the most clear moment in movies, when I fall into female sexuality subjectivity begins to wonder. .. at some point Zizek admits that he feels that the flowers are a kind of decorative vaginal dentistry that are disgusting and should be hidden from children (playfully, it seems, but ...). <br /> <br /> In any case, it's a fascinating documentary that anyone who has ever seen a movie, and thought it meant more than it was literally said, should try to see. <br /> <br /> And everyone interested in Slavoj Zizek, it must also, much less dry than "Reality Of The Virtual", and more direct than "Zizek!", Two other pseudo-docs, about "Elvis of contemporary cultural critique "Because he is dubbed in the English-speaking world. <br /> <br /> "The Perverts Guide to Cinema" does NOT concern the role of sex in the cinema. Zizek claims that cinema is the ultimate perverse art because it teaches "how to desire, not what to desire", and that it is the only form of contemporary art that can allow the articulation of these desires. This is not a movie about finding reality in cinema, it's about finding cinema in reality and how important and exciting it can be. It's hard to find and take a long time, but it's worth it, one of the most "stimulating" movie watching experiences I've ever had.
