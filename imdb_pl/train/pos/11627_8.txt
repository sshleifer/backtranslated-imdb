Lisa is the hotel manager or owner and gets a flight to Miami. Finally, he sits next to an assassin named Jackson, who tells her that he must change the family room or her father will die. The reason he needs to change the room is because Jackson wants to blow up. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie about suspense because Lisa is trying several ways to escape the trick that Jackson set up. The whole story is great and I thought that they could spend some more time on the plane. The plane may have more, but otherwise the whole movie was quite good. <br /> <br /> I especially liked the ending because it was a terrifying heart. I did not know what was going to happen and I was surprised. For me, this movie has just taken off.
