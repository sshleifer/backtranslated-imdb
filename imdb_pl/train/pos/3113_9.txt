Bourne's Ultimatum - Jason Bourne (Matt Damon in his best role), the latest spy kid on the block, is coming to the end of his mission because he is trying to finish the latest CIA "Blackbriar" program to make super killers like himself. <br /> <br /> I was so excited to see his predecessors yesterday and today. The identity was as brilliant as I remember, and Supremacy remains a weak (but still pleasant) link in the chain for the weakest storyline and, in addition to the car chase, which racing in the movie easily ends with a slight lack of action and tension. <br /> <br /> Hoo boy, does the Ultimatum have tension! Even if you know that Bourne will run away from the authorities (and the boy makes movies that underestimate the police), he's still genially watching how he does it. It is amazing to think that two guys with guns and mopeds can create 10 times more tension than anything that Transformers did giant $ 150 million robots. <br /> <br /> Sign this to Paul Greengrass who has this idiosyncratic style of shooting a documentary, even though he's filming characters far from the usual, in places like the CIA headquarters, where no one has access to the camera from a distance of 10 miles. It seemed that he listened to my various complaints with Supremacy, because the action in Ultimatum is no less than inspiring, with various tools used as a candlestick, a hardback book (I will never look again in the same way) and an electric fan ( do not ask). The music also helped generate a lot of tension, and there was hardly ever time to bite your nails. <br /> <br /> Acting is good, and the evolution of the character of Julia Stiles "Nicky" has changed her situation a new, highly compassionate light. Damon plays his characteristic role with reserve, but he has competence (which sounds slightly, but it looks authentic that Matt Damon can avoid the CIA and Interpol), but noticeable moments of emotion when he is still trying to find his humanity. This longing for real life could be boring, and almost in Supremacy, but it just works better in Ultimatum (better script). <br /> <br /> I am reminded of the scene in the movie "Goldeneye" (the only good film by Pierce Brosnan Bond), in which the character Sean Bean asks James if the martini will ever silence the screams of all killed men. Bourne regrets all the people he killed and he considers (or at least forced me to consider) the importance of acting aimlessly, meaningless life and how the government turned people into resources. Although the resources that Krav Maga knows and are able to snatch weapons out of nothing. <br /> <br /> Sidenote: I have always been bothered by the fact that, despite the fact that he is superspy and pursued by the CIA, Interpol and police, almost ANY place, that Bourne never thought to at least try to hide his characteristics or forge new passports. Maybe sunglasses? <br /> <br /> If you have pulsating and love action movies, then Bourne Ultimatum is for you. Shit, this is probably the best action movie that will come out this year. Of course, you would be a fool if you saw it without looking at others. It attracts a bit at the end, but I almost feel tempted to overlook it. This is the first movie "3" this summer, which at least fits if it does not exceed, the original and says something. <br /> <br /> A-
