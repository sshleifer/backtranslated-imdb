As a longtime fan of Peter O'Donnell's greatest work, I watched the movie on DVD without great hopes of pleasure; in fact, I expected that within fifteen minutes I would get disgusted with the pilot. But instead, I really enjoyed the production and I especially liked how the producers and directors managed to tell the story of the Tale of Blaise. They managed to avoid the trap of creating a (bad) film version of books, all of which we are so familiar with, choosing instead to focus on the life of Modesty, referred to in the novels. <br /> <br /> As for the value of production (and I am not a student of cinematography!): yes, the film was filmed in a tight financial and time budget, or maybe it shows ... but does it spoil the viewer's pleasure? In this case, I do not think so. Instead, we get to know one of the world's greatest literary heroes and get to know its possibilities. <br /> <br /> When it comes to casting: because in the unknown territory, the only people who really have meaning are Modesty and (perhaps) Professor Lob. For me, they were completely reliable. Alexandra Staden, described by some as wooden, and too thin to be the protagonist of the action, brought Modesty's mastery and coolness to the screen; her technique (when martial arts were needed), but above all she embodied the integrity that is the core of the Modesta Blaise canon. <br /> <br /> OK, so we all know that this movie was produced to cover the Miramax claim to the modest character Blaise, it was made quickly and cheaply, BUT ... I can not wait to see another production in this series by these producers - as long as they adhere to the basic values ​​and characteristics of the original story!
