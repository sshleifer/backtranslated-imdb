Greetings from the dark again. The expected, twisted comedy of the writer and director Richard Shepard is an event for Pierce Brosnan. This Bond guy has disappeared. This new guy is something completely different !! I read that Shepard thought that Brosnan was too handsome a boy for this plum role, but Brosnan turns out to be a perfect Julian Noble, "Facilitator" ... and it's not beautiful! Do not underestimate how humor is twisted. If you go, look forward to the point and sight of all kinds of sex, killing, religion, sport, business and everything that you think is politically incorrect. Brosnan takes an excellent script to a different level thanks to his wonderful facial gestures and physical movements. Even sitting on a hotel bed (with or without a sombrero) is a real joy. <br /> <br /> Greg Kinnear is a simple guy in Brosnan's comic and has a lot of depth and comical timing to make this partnership possible. Hope Davis has a small but subtly effective supporting role as Kinnear's wife (what is her name "Bean"?), Which happens to be a little excited when she has a facilitator in her salon. <br /> <br /> visuals and settings are perfect - including bullfighting, racetrack and suburb of Denver. And how often do we get The Killers and Xavier Cugat on the same soundtrack? This is certainly not for everyone, but if your sense of humor is a bit out of the center and you like risky film making, it may be for you.
