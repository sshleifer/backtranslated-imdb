Anyone who has lived through the centuries of Vengeance Nerd and Girlpower will appreciate this film. This is one of those movies that provide everything you want in the "spring movie" PLUS, which makes fun of the student movie genre. It's funny, it's cast (Amy Pohler! Rachel Dratch !, Sophie Monk !, Parker Posey! Jane Lynch! Amber Tamblyn! Missi Pyle!) And guarantees that you'll laugh out loud. Writer / actor Rachel Dratch is a comical genius, and Sophie Monk is such a wonderful villain. Wilson Phillips! OH MY GOD! (I'm just repeating now ...) I will live with girls who like Miranda Lipiec, but they want to eat ice cream and pretend to be stupid.
