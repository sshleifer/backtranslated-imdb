This film, recently chosen as the audience favorite at the Palm Springs International Film Festival in 2005, is inspiring and moving. The famous conductor, forced to retire due to illness, returns to the small village in which he was born, to become the leader of the church choir and finally find fulfillment in his music. Based on the Swedish characteristics of preserving things in itself and the island character of a small Swedish village, this film develops well each of its characters. wonderfully directed, played and sang, he brought tears to many eyes and smiles at everyone. I hope he finds a distribution in the United States. <br /> <br /> If you can, check it out!
