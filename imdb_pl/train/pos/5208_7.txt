If you want your vision of Chaplin to be limited to a delightful tramp, and your stomach laughed at pathos, look at something else. However, if you love the slapstick comedy performed by one of the best, watch this one. <br /> <br /> The picture depicts a tramp who can not really get a girl. He sees another couple kissing on a park bench and has an explosion, destroying their fun. <br /> <br /> This is one of Chaplin's "park comedies," shot in Mack Sennett Park, with pickpockets, policemen and pairs. These shorts work because the format allows Chaplin to shine when it rolls through embarrassing situations. <br /> <br /> I checked this box because it can be considered a spoiler, but it's not if you've seen these movies. Everyone goes to the pond except for Chaplin. He gets a girl who in this case played Minta Durfee, a.k.a. Mrs. Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle.
