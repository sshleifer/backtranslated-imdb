Winter day, December 28, 1986, two bored 14-year-olds rent a movie. "Hmmmm, Police Story, looks interesting", "Who is this Jackie Chan?", "I've never heard of him." Two hours later, after watching the movie, in a daze, we wanted to learn more. 16 years later (and unfortunately it has nothing to do with collecting JC movies!) The film still grabs me. Ok, maybe I have a weakness for this because it was my "first" (Cannonball Run does not count !!) JC movie, but it's a great movie. It has all the classic elements of JC, Action, Humor, Action, Heart and ACTION! Some comments say it is outdated, it was made in 1985, of course it is outdated! But this must be Jaws, Casablanca, Singin 'in the Rain and The Godfather !!!!!! No movies like Police Story, where would the Hollywood action be? PS standards, many scenes have been stolen for use in other movies. To really appreciate it, you have to see it on a wide screen, otherwise you will miss so much of the movie (yes, it really falls off the bus going around the corner!). If you have not done it yet, SEE THIS FILM NOW !!!! <br /> <br />
