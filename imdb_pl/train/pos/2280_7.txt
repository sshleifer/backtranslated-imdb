It's difficult to categorize a movie - maybe it's a spy thriller? Mother Night is a very good novel by Vonnegut, and certainly one of his easiest novels to adapt to a full-length film. The adaptation of the film is very faithful to the original book. The "indie" approach to how this movie was made is probably more effective than having a large Hollywood studio that finances it. These days I doubt that an intelligent novel, such as Mother Night, will get the green light from the big Hollywood grindhouses. This is usually bad, but not in this case. Mother Night has a tight direction and solid cast. Nick Nolte, who seems to have better and better roles as he grows older, still has this "everman personality" that allows him to take on different characters. Sheryl Lee is beautiful and as always great. I always thought that she deserved something better than she came from the entertainment industry. It seems to me that debut as a dead girl (Twin Peaks) with a small air time is not the best choice, even if the television program is a minor phenomenon. In any case, this movie is completely enjoyable and you do not have to read the book to understand the movie. In fact, given today's geopolitical realities, the message of the novel may seem outdated, and some younger viewers with little history will be completely confused by the events that are developing (I'm talking to you, Americans who are students and get the lowest results of the industrialized world in geography, history and ruler knows what other topics!).
