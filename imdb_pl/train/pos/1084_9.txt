Musings: Pure delight from beginning to end. Not laughter, but more subtle, sophisticated humor. What a gold mine of great scenes and actors, including Reginald Denny, Nestor Paiva, Ian Wolfe, Harry Shannon and Jason Robards. at the moment in the frame. A young carpenter, played by future Tarzan Lex Barker, asks him if he wants his "madness to be robbed" or something that only a carpenter would know. Grant, not wanting to be ignorant, answers in the affirmative. At this moment Barker yells to his colleagues: "OK boys, he wants them to get mad, so ... YANK 'EM OUT!" A second later you hear the tearing and tearing sounds of about 20 large nails stretched out from various boards. Anything Grant can do is moan. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie is outdated. You would never notice that many carpenters working simultaneously in a single-family house and such a place in Connecticut in all places would probably run several million dollars. <br /> <br /> A classic movie that is really a treasure.
