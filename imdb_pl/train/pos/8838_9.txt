Finally, a movie in which the audience guesses to the end what will happen. Well, we all know that the lives of Andy brothers (played by Hoffman) and Hank (played by Hawke) will go down in the direction of destruction, because elsewhere is to go down, but we do not know how and when until the end of the movie. Hoffman is wonderful, as usual, and even Hawke was decent as a younger brother who basically does what he was told because he can not really think for himself. Hawke might have been a bit out of his element, but he played that role well. Add to this mix Andy's wife, perfectly played by Marisa Tomei, betraying Hanka; Andy's distortion from company funds to pay for drug addiction and sex; and a father who finally discovers what exactly happened on the day of the attack. This movie will make you think.
