In the case of films such as "Anchors Aweigh", few have received many Academy Awards in a happy hour warm-up. Either the year 1945 was a beleaguered year for a good movie, or they still suffered a shock from Billy Wilder's "Lost Weekend", who wrote anything starting with A on election cards to get the best picture to satisfy the still musical image of the loyal audience . Since Gene Kelly was nominated for the show, not for the part in Singin in the Rain, there must have been something wrong with the MGM rigging systems. Of course, the studio behaves best during this highly praised concert tour of great studies and Hollywood itself, useful for those who are stuck on the other side of the world. <br /> <br /> Still a sailor suit with music, the brilliant talents of Gene and Frank Sinatra are certainly a pleasant farce, despite the need for more people to yawn on the musical announcements, so that today's audience will not be slapped by unnecessary work time. Before, there were many longer pieces, but in this case all the charming scenes of Kathryn Grayson could have been eliminated. Until watching the movie "Kiss Me Kate," it may be necessary for opera enthusiasts to not watch any of her films with a remote control in hand. <br /> <br /> If you had to practice collecting women for "On the Town" from 1949, maybe the shore left happy mariners not to promise interrogations with Jose Iturbi and strike the piano with the interpretation of "Susie" with all my heart. Few are lucky to get a screen test in the golden MGM studies. Then few are even happier. She does not regret the successful screen tests of Susan Abbot or Kathryn Grayson, but she makes a continuous non-opera enthusiast hoping that a possible pink slip will be passed on to both. <br /> <br /> But for all, the talents of the stars are in good shape and the above-average score thrown with the light but amusing history of the navy intertwines with the young ambitious boys of the navy well suited for the late outbursts of war morale, makes "Anchors" at least does not question the choice of the wrong MGM movie. The direction is maintained when the cast carries a story in beautiful colorful cinematography. When someone explodes the music or song, the movie makes a joyous occasion. <br /> <br /> The natural attraction of the movie are the adventures of Gene Kelly's cartoons in the land of fantasy, culminating in a brilliant dance with Jerry's mouse. This is a well-deserved number of masterpieces in Kelly's career, and it's nice to know that he thought about it before Fred Astaire started dancing on the walls and ceilings. <br /> <br /> It's not exactly triple flavor, rainbow sprinkled, chocolate wafer, cream and cherry and banana ice cream, but it's a square, solid lump of sugar that eventually melts in your mouth and despite guilty, it is still a pleasant feeling. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7/10
