Okay, first of all I got this movie as a Christmas present, so it was FREE! FIRST - This movie was supposed to be in stereoscopic 3D. This is for the most part, but whenever the main character is in his car, the movie falls on 2D! What!!?!?! Filming a car is not so difficult !!! SECOND - History is not very good. There are many mistakes in this. <br /> <br /> THIRD - Why they show all deaths at the beginning of the movie! It made the movie suck when only some were to be killed !!! Watch it to laugh, but do not waste time buying it. Just download it or something cheap.
