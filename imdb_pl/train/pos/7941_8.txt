This little-watched movie is a lazy and laid-back giallo. It goes away from some stereotypes of the genre and adopts a looser approach. It's about a woman looking for a missing lover; a psychiatrist who suddenly disappeared for no apparent reason. Her search leads her to a villa inhabited by a group of eccentric people. In true giallo style, murder is never far away. <br /> <br /> The cast is really good. We have Aldofo Cell (Thunderball), Alida Valli (Suspiria), Horst Frank (Cat o 'Nine Tails) and a very young Sybil Danning (queen of the 80s screams). The main actress is Rosemary Dexter and although I am not familiar with her, she does a good job in managing the image. <br /> <br /> One of the most important features of Eye in the Labyrinth is her music. Unusual for giallo includes the jazz-rock fusion soundtrack. This score, composed by Roberto Nicolosi, reminds Miles Davis, especially his work on In A Silent Way. It's a great soundtrack and really gives this movie a different character than most gialli. The fusion phase emphasizes the lazy atmosphere and complements the sunny sea scenery that the film consists of. <br /> <br /> This is giallo, so we really need to talk about pieces of murder. Well, this movie is a bit short in this respect. He is certainly not deprived of them, but there are few of them. The initial murder of dreams is probably the best offer, as well as an unforgettable sequence of a burning car. But it really is not a particularly brutal movie. Still, I do not think that it should disappoint too many experienced fans of this genre. The mystery is quite fascinating and has quite an eccentric character (idiot boy Sarah and THIS disturbingly unsuitable baptized accent?) And bizarre moments to fulfill; while the sleaze factor is sustained by a little nudity throughout the text. <br /> <br /> The eye in the Labyrinth plays like a giallo version of the mystery of Agatha Christie, because it contains a group of unpleasant characters in the villa, all on the charge of murder; we have compulsory flashbacks describing their connections to the last hours (highly unpleasant) of the murder victim. Although this is not an example of a genre, it is certainly attractive because it does not borrow much from other sub-genre films. For giallo enthusiasts, I give it a thumbs up and I hope that one day I will receive a nice DVD transfer. Certainly deserves treatment.
