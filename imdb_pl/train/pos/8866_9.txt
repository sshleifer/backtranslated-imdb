"COSBY", in my opinion, is a CBS hit! I'm not sure I've never seen each episode, but I still liked it. It's hard to say which one is my favorite. I also really liked the theme. If you asked me, though I liked everyone, it would be nice if Madeline Kahn did not leave during the race. Since then, I've always wondered what it would look like. Everyone always gave a good performance, the spectacle was spectacular, the costumes were well designed, and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, even if you can now see it on TBS, I definitely recommend catching it in case it disappears from the air for good
