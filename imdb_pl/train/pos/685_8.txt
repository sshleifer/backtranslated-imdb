Ghost Story (The New House) is a great horror story. It comes from the series of Circle Of Fear and Ghost Story from the early seventies. Sebastian Cabot talks about the beginning and the end of each story. Do you remember him from the early Family Affair family series in the 1960s? This particular story has Barbara Parkins and David Birney as the main actors, and as the main characters of this story. I saw it lately and I was so scared! If you're alone, I do not recommend watching. he's gorgeous, he has no words or curses, but he's very scary. Barbara Parkins played a young bride. David Birney played his husband. Both actors were very good in their parts. If you like scary, funny, scary stories about ghosts, you'll love this little gem. I gave it a high grade. I highly recommend this story.
