Disney (and great people, of course, in PIXAR) offer a nice, humorous story combined with the best computer animation. I admit that perhaps the "faces" of errors were a bit more static than in "Antz" and had only four legs (in "Antz" six ...). But the backgrounds were great and the animation was breathtaking. But let it be a lesson: it was not a computer that was so successful: it was the man behind the machine who added the nice little bends that I missed in "Antz". Some of the most important events are obviously "bleeding" at the end (so watch at the end, it's worth it!), Which were very funny and original. The line "Filmed completely on location" was intended for a more attentive viewer.
