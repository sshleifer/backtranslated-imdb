The planning episodes were a bit boring, but when they reached the desert it was nice to watch. The reason I call it the most realistic reality show is that to my surprise Charley fell out of the race relatively early. When his hands ached, I expected normal stress and then a miraculous solution, but instead he actually gave up the race. The most restless moment of the show was the moment when Max got stuck in the desert almost without water or food! The ending was great and I was very happy to see that at least one member of the team did it. In general, not as good as the Long Way Round, but definitely an interesting watch that allows you to take a look at the most demanding race in the world.
