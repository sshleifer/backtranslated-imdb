Probably the two main meanings of "Elmer's Pet Rabbit" are that the crazed leper described in "A Wild Hare" now has a name and that he says his famous "Of course you realize it's war!" For the first time. Mostly, the Termite Terrace crowd was still trying to find out what actually had to do with that ear-splitting bastard. It is certainly a must for hard-core fans of this genre, but others will probably have no reason to be interested in them. <br /> <br /> But do not make a mistake, it's pretty fun what Bugs Bunny does with the ever-credulous Elmer Fudd. The bright shades of things that will come will abound in the cartoon. I recommend it.
