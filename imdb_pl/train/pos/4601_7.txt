Police Story is a stunning series of sets in which Jackie Chan shows his unique talents and courage. Some acrobatics here belong to the best and most dangerous final of the fight in the mall is probably the largest sequence of Jackie's single fight, more brutal and less comical than let's say Project A or Drunken Master at the end of the fight you can almost feel the pain impact. <br /> <br /> But unfortunately the rest of the movie can not stand this quality, because it is quite a formal thriller of policemen with elements of comedy. I always prefer JC in films such as Project A, which show its natural comic talents. In severe restrictions on some elements, Police Story simply does not work for me. Although it is still in the best Jackies movies because of amazing stunt work and pure performance. <br /> <br /> As usual in movies in Hong Kong, avoid the English version of the dubbed DVD, because it is a really horrible stick inscriptions. <br /> <br /> Great stunts, OK movie a great starting point, if you have not seen JC before and it's worth watching for every 7/10 movie fan
