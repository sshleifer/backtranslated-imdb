Does anyone know what were 2 sports cars? I think that Robert Stack could have been a character of Masseratti. Father Hudson told his father that he was taking a job in Iraq, is it not on time? I had Dorthy Malone in my bank spanking for most of my life, maybe it was a movie that impressed me. Loren Bacall certainly had a few chops in this movie and probably played Malone, but part of Malonesa made a more sensational impact, so she got Oscar for the best supporting role. Part of Lorena was considered the main role - the figure of the older Hadley was probably a fairly common image of the giants of his era, because he was an ordinary guy who made him big in the growing industry, but in building the whole city forgot about their children, that their wife raised them. At the time when he was widowed, he realized that it was all he really had, and were spoiled rotten, seeking attention, so instead of trying to relate to his children, he blew his head away. A tale of ancient morality. But seriously, what were these sports cars?
