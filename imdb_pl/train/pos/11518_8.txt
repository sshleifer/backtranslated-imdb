You can do a lot with a small amount of cash. Blair Witch proved it. This movie supports it. It is only sitcom in length and complexity. But because John Cleese is Sherlock Holmes, he can be funny even in a budget that he could not afford to buy. The highlight of this movie is Arthur Lowe as an honest, inept Watson, his depression and slowness frustrate Cleese's quick temper. If you ever come across a movie, look at it with a weird laugh or two.
