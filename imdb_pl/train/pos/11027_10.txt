Ever since I saw it in the theater for the first time, it was my favorite. Since then I've seen it countless times and I never get tired of it. The setting has a lot in common (Colorado, which I know, would be jealous), but the plot is original and I liked how she used highland towns as heroes. There was no movie that I could compare. John Lithgow plays a wise villain, but I love the fact that he is completely out of his element - he has to follow Tucker and that makes him interesting. This is an action movie at BEST. I do not think I will see something so funny. <br /> <br /> You do not need 50,000 rounds fired to qualify as an action movie. It just has to enslave you, not shock you.
