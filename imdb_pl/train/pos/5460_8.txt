Lily Powers works in the bar until her father dies. Then he goes to New York to work in an office building. He notes that if he wants to get to a higher level, he has to give men what they want. she ... well, you know. Alfred E. Green's Baby Face (1933) is a movie with high sexual content. In any case for a movie from that era. It was one of the last pre-code movies. Stanwyck gives a very sexy performance as Lily. Other actors in the film include George Brent (Courtland Trenholm), Donald Cook (Ned Stevens), Alphonse Ethier (Adolf Cragg), Henry Kolker (JPCarter), Margaret Lindsay (Ann Carter) and Theresa Harris (Chico). Young John Wayne is seen as Jimmy McCoy Jr. This film deals with a bold theme and does it well. The child's face is a historically significant film and that's why it's good to watch it.
