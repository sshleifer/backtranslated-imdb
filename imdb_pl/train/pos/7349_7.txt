Of course, if you are reading my review, you have already seen this movie. "Raja Babu" is one of my favorite characters. I love the concept of a spoiled brat with a 24 * 7 servant on a motorcycle. Watch movies and imitate characters, etc. I love the scene where the stone breaks in Kader's mouth while eating. Also where Shakti Kapoor talks about the banal case history of Raja Babu on the table, and Govinda in the "dharam-veer" uniform, he makes sentimental remarks. This is my favorite movie scene. The scene of "Achcha Pitaji To Main Chalta Hoon" is simply a chemistry between two great Indian actors who make a comic scene without dialogues. It's great. This is a movie for cats. Just look at how these actors help each other and still take the scene. His total entertainment. If you like chemistry of Govinda and Kadera Khan, it is necessary. I think RB is 6 on my list of David Dhawan. "Deewana Mastana", "Ankhein", "Shola or Shabnam", "Swarg", "Coolie no 1" precedes this jewel of the film. 7/10.
