I think this film would be more pleasant if everyone would consider it a colonial picture of Africa in the 1950s and 1960s, not a story. Because there is no real story here. Just one vignette on top, like small points of light that mean little, until you have enough to paint the picture. When I first saw Chocolat, I did not really "get" it until I thought about it for several days. Then I realized that there are many things that you can "get", including the end of colonialism, which was only around the corner, simply the lack of plot. In any case, it's one of my favorite movies. The scene at the airport with a short shower and beautiful music was pure poetry. If you like "exciting" movies, do not watch it - you will be bored with tears. But for some of you ... you can thank me later for recommending it to you.
