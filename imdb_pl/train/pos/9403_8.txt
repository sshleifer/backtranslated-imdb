"Man in a white suit" is another pen in the cap of well-known Scottish director Alexander Mackendrick (Whiskey Galore !, Sweet Smell of Success). The star of the film is Alec Guinness (whose comedies are Kind Hearts and Coronets and The Lavender Hill Mob). Guiness brings his usual class to the movie and makes him more than a typical comedy. <br /> <br /> In fact, the comedy is not completely public. At the end of the photo it is almost a complete drama. This is a kind of Ealing studio comedy that is calculated not to make you laugh, but a sense of general amusement, like the best British comedy of those times. <br /> <br /> The whole idea of ​​a suit is not very original, but the way is done. The film is very original and recommended to any Guinness fan or Britsh comedy. <br /> <br /> 7.6 out of 10
