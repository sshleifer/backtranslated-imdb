Simply, Oliver! is one of the greatest musicals of all time. It is filled with unforgettable songs - "Food Glorious Food", "Oliver!", "Consider Yourself" and "Oom-Pah-Pah", to name a few - and equally unforgettable characters. <br /> <br /> the film is a musical adaptation of the classic novel by Charles Dickens and, like the story of Oliver Twist, it is an ideal family movie. There are some terrifying moments - the villain Bill Sykes played by Oliver Reed is terrifying enough in itself - but in general, the film will appeal to children of all ages, as well as adults. <br /> <br /> History - which almost everyone is certainly familiar with - revolves around a small orphan boy named Oliver and his life growing up in London. Initially, he lives in a home with the rest of his orphans, but after ridiculing the interrogation of Mr. Bumble, the overseer, he is sold to the family as a servant. <br /> <br /> After a series of unfortunate accidents and a close shave, he meets Artful Dodger - a great young Jack Wild plays, who gives his all in this role - and by him a greedy Fagin (Ron Moody) who trains young boys to choosing treasures that he keeps for himself. <br /> <br /> The film was shot only in the studios and sound stages at Shepperton Film Studios, but it does not translate into filming at all. Sets perfectly replicate Victorian London, as well as the costumes worn by the heroes. The winner of many Oscars and enormous success in the release, Oliver! is a worthy rival for the best musical all the time and will delight anyone who loves the movie.
