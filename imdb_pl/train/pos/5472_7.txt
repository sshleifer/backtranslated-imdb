Barbara Stanwyck as a real hard cookie, waitress for working classes (and a prostitute at the hands of her father) who escapes to New York and uses her female sticks to get a job, going to Mortgage and Escrow and later as assistant secretary in the bank. A dramatic study of a female figure who is not afraid to be unfit, for years has not lost its power, and Barbara began a storm (depicts a woman who learns to be a first-rate actress herself). This lady, playing some Nietzschean philosophy in her unfortunate life, crushes the sentiment, but never loses our fascination, our admiration. She is a simple, hard, wide woman, but she is not a bitch, she is not a woman or a woman. This girl is everything to herself, and when we wait and finally learn about real values ​​in life, her journey up and down the ladder of success provides hot, sexy entertainment. John Wayne (with thick black hair and too much eye makeup) is good at an early stage as an assistant in the file office, although all supporting players are quite good. *** with ****
