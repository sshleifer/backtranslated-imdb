Often you can not enjoy this gem, Invisible Ray from 1936. But you can not forget it. The story is elegant. Karloff, severe and embittered in his Carpathian mountain retreat, is Janos Rukh, a genius scientist who reads the ancient rays of light to determine events in the great geological past, especially the collision of a powerful radioactive meteor in Africa. He is always joined by an elegant Lugosi (as a rare hero) who studies "astrochemistry". Frances Drake is a charming, underdeveloped young wife; Frank Lawton romantic temptation; and the divine Violet Kemble Cooper is the Mother of Rukh, in a performance worthy of Maria Ospenskya. <br /> <br /> The story moves quickly in bold episodes, with special effects that are still handsome. It also contains great lines. One Rukh returns his mother's eyes, asks, "Mother, see, see?" "Yes, I see more clearly than ever. And what I see scares me. " Even better when mother Rukh says: "He broke the first law of science." I do not know that for many years I have been wondering exactly what the first law of science is. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely a desert island.
