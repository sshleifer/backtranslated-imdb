"One-Round" Jack Sander is called because he is a carnival boxer who fights every man in the audience. If they can last one round, they win the prize - a popular way to attract customers to travel long time ago. Jack is in love with the ticket girl, Mabel, although her head quickly turns around when Bob Corby enters the ring to try his hand with Jack. No one in the fight knows that Bob is a master, so he can defeat Jack - although it requires some work. As a result, Bob asks Jacek to become his sparring partner and resign from the carnival circulation. Later Jack improves so much that he also becomes an eligible boxer. He will slowly advance in the rankings until he is almost ready to take part in Champ. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Champ and Mabel are starting to run behind Jacek - even though Mabel is now married to Jacek. So when the final battle between Jack and Bob is very personal and Jack is ready to kill him. Is he good enough? Will the justified rage on Bob increase, will he help him stop it? Mood and see. <br /> <br /> This film was directed by Alfred Hitchcock and although today this kind of film seems strange to a director known for films with mysterious tensions, in the 1920s Hitchcock did not have an established genre, which he directed or wrote (he did both for this movie). In fact, in many respects, this film is a more expressive silent Hitchcock style, because a somewhat similar plot appeared in one of his subsequent silences, THE MANXMAN (with Carl Brisson as the injured husband). So, although it seems to be the standard boxing movie of the day, it was not a radical departure for this great director - even with its rather formal ending. <br /> <br /> In general, a bit predictable and Ian Hunter playing the role of boxing champ seems stupid, the movie works well. Though far from perfect silence, it's worth seeing and it's cool.
