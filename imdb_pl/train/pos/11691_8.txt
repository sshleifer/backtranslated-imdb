A great movie when I saw him. I have to say one of my favorite movies of all time. I saw it 8 times in the theater and got a DVD. When I got old and saw it again, I realized that the film is average. Compared with movies known for good comedies, it's nothing. I mean, Rock was funny in the movie, and the whole change with racial material breaks some of the barriers that are great. Also, the thought of how a movie goes is a nice way of thinking. This is how most think about the film, but also a bit of a twist, which is a very nice touch. Overall, I like the movie, so I give it ... <br /> <br /> Still a good 7/10 for me.
