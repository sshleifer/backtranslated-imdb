I'm not a huge fan of martial arts movies, but the video store was almost empty and Jet Li was in Lethal Weapon 4, and I got it for free when I borrowed other movies I borrowed. I liked it very much, my roommate and me (22-year students of Biochemistry and Accounting) spent half an hour after the film making strange sounds of Kung Fu and throwing at the beurate shuriken. I can not explain it (maybe some tequila). I've never liked Bruce Lee, a skinny guy kicking a big guy, punching him, kicking a bigger guy, etc. Ends up with a movie. Think Jackie Chan with a bit less comedy and more action.
