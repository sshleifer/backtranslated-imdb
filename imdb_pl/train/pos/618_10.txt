This movie is wonderful. <br /> <br /> I was "enchanted", I should say, and be amazed at how exceptionally it was done. Cast, sequencing, effects ... everything! Magnificent! It was a love story, yes, but what distinguished her from the rest was that she was told in a fun, healthy way. <br /> <br /> For me it is a representation of a modern fairy tale. It's like a modern peter ... just amazing <br /> <br /> I would certainly buy a copy of it when it hits the market. <br /> <br /> This movie is really double MUST WATCH one ... !!!! 10 stars for it!
