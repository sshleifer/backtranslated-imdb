A stylish, romantic, innovative bath with vengeance. Of course, tacky and sporadically very bad. It reminded me a lot of The Big Heat, because it has a plot of revenge set off by exactly the same event, and the girl comes to the side of a good guy because of the same bad behavior of the evil guy. It's sad that there is no Gloria Grahame, but so fantastic it's Alain Delon, not Glenn Ford. Can anyone be as beautiful as Alain in a cashmere sweater and coat? However, it is completely hard and freezing. No one can touch him now - though someone like Jude Law could try. It's difficult for any girl to look good with him. The music was funky and perfect and there were some excellent car chases (and these are not usually my cups of tea) - especially one who wants not to want in the woods. People also met with their death in a creative and bloody way, for example in a crunchy scrap yard. But apart from cheese, the general atmosphere influenced and expertly retracted. More creativity, excitement and freshness in this "forgotten" movie than most of what I've seen lately.
