What would happen if G.I. plutonium from the Japanese army was sent away in 400 years in the middle of feudal wars that led to the creation of the Tokugawa Shogunate? Great pitch? The film does exactly what it says on the tin. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the writers did not bother with explaining, usually funny in science-fiction movies, the scientific huge time transport. No, how or why. They just did it. However, the timeframe itself is triple as hell and quite beautiful, if not a bit outdated. Not as stupid as you would imagine. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film follows the premise for T. But when he loses a bit of steam with various threads that follow the arrival of the OG into medieval Japan, it rises with a devastating battle sequence. Undoubtedly, this is the main order of the day. The whole concept, and hence the film itself, probably derives from this simple tone: what if G.I. equipped with the latest modern war, will fight with samurai? And the boy ensures it. <br /> <br /> The main sequence of battles, which lasts more than half an hour, is probably one of the best action / war of the 70s in their films. Not only is it unrelenting and exhausting at a pace and length, but it is also a wonderful mish-mash of styles and techniques that only exceptional rooms such as G.I. Samurai can provide. I mean, where else would you have a chance to present tanks, ninja with shuriikenami, helicopter and samurai in one shot? The G.I. a platoon commanded by lieutenant Ila tears literally through hundreds of extras, shooting them down with machine guns, mortars, grenades and tanks. <br /> <br /> This mish-mash of styles has one foot firmly embedded in the vast Jidai geek epic of Kurosawa's Kagemusha or Hiroshi Inagaki's Samurai Banners, while the other is in western action and war movies. There are stylistic touches (such as great shots in slow motion and bloody violence) that resemble Sam Peckinpah or Enzo G. Castellari. Japanese cinema has always been influenced by westerns and other Hollywood works, and vice versa and G.I. Samurai easily transforms this crucible rising west into an exciting movie. <br /> <br /> The creators of the film gratefully take the whole thing seriously and the film benefits greatly from it. It is not that the mentality with a pinch of salt is completely absent, simply because it does not try to reach such bad, good viewers who like to laugh at their films. The budget was probably high, because it can be seen in hundreds of accessories, fancy costumes (very decent for production, which is not a traditional Jidai-geki) and special effects. Working with the camera and editing are at the highest level, almost better than a film without major artistic ambitions. <br /> <br /> Not without flaws, of course. There are many scenes of "songs" in which all kinds of Japanese rock songs, disco and country from the 70's are playing over montages (there is a connecting scene, a love scene, a "war is hell" scene, etc.). The songs themselves are pretty bad and banal, which negatively affects the whole. Although it measures 140 minutes, it flies like a missile. Some scenes, flashbacks and side motifs in the first half could have been cut to get a more effective effect. <br /> <br /> Also noteworthy is the cast, in which there are such famous names as Sonny Chiba, Isao Natsuyagi (Goyokin, Samurai Wolf)), Tsunehiko Watase (The Yakuza Papers) and Hiroyuki Sanada, all get into the right notes .
