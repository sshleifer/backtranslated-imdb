It is an extremely powerful movie based on a true story that can be annoying to watch. I say this because how brutal the press can be for people, in this case an innocent Australian couple accused of killing their child. <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep received a lot of credit for her performance when the movie came out but I thought Sam Neill was just as good. Let's say that both were excellent, but the role of Streep was more difficult because she had to learn the Australian accent. (She learned it so well that I had problems understanding it in part.) <br /> <br /> Not giving anything, I can only say that this movie will emotionally consume you.
