A funny comedy by Neil Simon, which evokes laughter from beginning to end. The late Walter Matthau is a grumpy former comedian who is convinced to connect with his former partner (the late Oscar-winning George Burns) at the final stage slide show. agent and nephew, and the two have the same chemistry as Matthau and Burns. I love the grumpy character of Matthau - he is the same as always, and at the same time very different. <br /> <br /> Burns, as an absent old man, is as entertaining as Matthau. > <br /> Matthau: Do you want some crackers? I have coconut, pineapple and graham. <br /> <br /> Burns: What about a simple cracker? <br /> <br /> Matthau: I do not understand. I have coconut, pineapple and graham. <br /> <br /> Burns: Good <br /> <br /> Matthau: They're in the kitchen cupboard. <br /> <br /> Burns: Maybe later. <br /> <br /> Or what about it: <br /> <br /> Matthau: When I was doing black, the whites knew what I was saying! <br /> <br /> You have to see it in the movie to understand it! <br /> <br /> In summary, a refreshingly comic, sweet, warm, warm, trustworthy comedy with a heart and some of the most memorable quotes of all time. <br /> <br /> They just do not like them anymore! At a time when all the latest comedies are primitive, youthful and stupid, it returns to the heart of what the comedy really is - fun characters, intelligent and fun dialogue and great entertainment. <br /> <br /> best comedy of all time, with "Planes, Trains and Automobiles", "Lethal Weapon" and "The Hard Way". <br /> <br /> You may have difficulty finding this for rental or on TV, but believe me, it will be worth your time! <br /> <br /> 4.5 / 5 stars. <br /> <br /> - John Ulmer
