Often years pass, when we can look back and see the stars that are really stars. Just like a French film critic whose name escapes me, he said: "There is no Garbo. There is no Dietrich. There's only Louise Brooks "; and he is, thank you heaven! Louise Brooks! This is the third part of her European masterpieces. But it is also a unique film for being one, if not the first French talkie, for following the scenario of the famous Ren√© Clair, for supposedly completed (direction, that is) Georg Pabst and for including Edith Piaf's voice before it was well known! So much talent for working on the film, how could it not be a masterpiece ?! And that's how the movie is. It is a pity that Louise Brooks was bombed by Hollywood when she returned to the States - so much talent was thrown so arrogantly on the roadside! In the film, in addition to watching Louise Brooks in action, it's great to see photos from Paris ca. 1930 and hear Piaf's young voice. I am never tired of this movie!
