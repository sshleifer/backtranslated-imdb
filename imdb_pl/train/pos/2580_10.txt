I am saying that the domino rule is an extremely underestimated film. Anyone who has taken the time to investigate our modern conspiracy history; jfk, rfk, mlk, g.wallace and in fact many others can only draw the conclusion that the author of the domino principle really knew what he was talking about. Destroy can be lee harvey oswald or james earl ray or sirhan sirhan or arthur bremer can even john hinkley or timothy mcveigh. it is not really a fiction, but an ominous part of our intricate existential history. Help us, but the domino rule is more a fact than a fantasy. If it causes a small loss of sleep, maybe it should not take my word, explore it yourself.
