Boris and Bela are doing well in this film, regardless of whether they are against each other or rowing the same boat. I saw it in 1972 and I just bought it in Borders this year. This time, watching this with my children, I noticed two things: this drew the attention of children aged 3, 4 and 5; and I caught some things that I did not have when I first saw it. A very fast story with an unpredictable end. Necessarily for movie lovers !!!
