This is one of the most overlooked gems Hollywood has ever produced. - A young British WWII fighter, whose plane is about to break up, has radio contact with a young American who comforts the brave pilot, knowing that in a few minutes he will be dead. For some reason, a man who should definitely be dead leaves the wreckage and eventually learns that he was supposed to report to heaven. When a messenger is sent to ask the pilot to accompany him to heaven, the man refuses and demands that his "day in court" should argue about his case. The man proves that his situation has changed in the last moments of his earthly life, that he fell in love and therefore became another person who deserved a chance of life. <br /> <br /> "Heavenly Judgment" is a movie bliss! "The announcement of a jury of peers" is a clear event. History, as fantastic as it seems, is addictive and will delight you for almost 2 hours of playing time. The final scene is simply beautiful and will require "kleenex treatment" for the majority of viewers. This movie is in my personal favorite top 10, it has my highest recommendation!
