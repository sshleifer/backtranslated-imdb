Screenwriter / director Henry Brommel did a great job with his 2000 film Panic, which also includes cast selection: William H. Macy, Tracy Ullman, John Ritter, Neve Campbell, Donald Sutherland, Barbara Bain, David Dorfman. Brommel has cast Ullman and Ritter in definitely indecent roles, and unusual casting is a welcome change compared to what we normally see. <br /> <br /> "Panic" is the story of the hit Alex (Macy) who actually works for his father (Sutherland). He covers his real profession by doing mailing work; in all respects he and his wife (Ullman) and their son Sammy (Dorfman) are a typical suburban family. Dissatisfied with life Alex is looking for help from a psychiatrist (Ritter), only telling his mother (Bain). In the waiting room, he meets a young woman (Campbell), whom he immediately attracts, which complicates his situation even more. His mother breaks the promise and tells his father about the psychiatrist. When Alex receives another assignment, he discovers that he is about to kill his psychiatrist. <br /> <br /> This is a deep story of a gentle, good man who was murdered by his father's monster, with his mother, knowledge that kills him to please his father, but also can not resist him and give up. His rage is so deeply rooted that he lost his emotional attachment to almost everything and everyone but his son - and finally his son wakes him up with almost lifelong repressions. When it's time for Panic moves, he does it quickly. <br /> <br /> "Panic" does not seem to panic at all. In fact, it moves very slowly. But it moves slowly, not because it is poorly made - slowness is deliberate, reflecting Alex's mind slowly coming out of the fog. Making a decision about Sarah, a character from Campbell and seeing his sign, his own psychiatrist, a living, breathing man, Alex begins to create connections between what he does and who he is - and how not jive. The difference between them can lead to the loss of another psyche, Sammy's. <br /> <br /> William Macy gives another great performance as a loving father, a distant husband and a cold killer, a child of two monsters who never cared about their feelings or desires, a man who finally realizes he must stand on the plate or repeat the cycle. <br /> <br /> This is not the kind of drama that plays well in the cinema. He is too adult, too small, too subtle, too driven by character and too good.
