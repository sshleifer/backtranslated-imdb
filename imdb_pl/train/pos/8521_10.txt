I loved this program. I have watched it since it was broadcast for the first time in the late 90s to the last episode. In my honest opinion it was a great family drama, which is so rare these days. Definitely a show that you can watch with a friend or children. Yes, it has changed a bit in Jo since we last saw her in books, but she's still fascinating with great stories and good lessons. The actress who portrays Jo Bhaer (Michelle Burke) does a great job, as does the actor who plays Nick Riley (Spencer Rochfort). In the series, we see the developing romance of Jo and Nick, as well as everyday stories and lessons children and students learn. I recommend this show to everyone.
