The fierce, shockingly intelligent work of the talented British writer Hanif Kureishi, who wrote "My Beautiful Laundrette" (this is the best thing he has done since then). It's about smart people whose lives do not give much. They squandered what they received and are mostly empty dishes. The only living figure on the screen is the mother of the title, but she feels dead inside, until the rough handyman shows her feelings and does not arouse the joy of sex. He has his own motives, but Kureishi treats him with a lot of compassion. It is a movie in which people and places feel good, where characters exist outside the screen. In some ways it's a bit like "Sunday, Bloody Sunday", but it's definitely a harder job. Director Roger Michell lets you instinctively build scenes. And it is beautifully preserved. <br /> <br /> As the title mother, Anne Reid betrays her wasted life in every gesture. There is no false note in her extremely lively performance, and this wonderful actor Daniel Craig displays shades to his character, even though Kureishi has not joined this one. If the film seems false, it may be the character of a daughter without talent, entangled in a chaotic affair with a man whom his mother seduces (or should be the other way around), and even a more chaotic life, but she still plays Cathryn Bradshaw. The film is also very beautiful to watch (DoP Alwin Kuchler) and must without hesitation be the best British film of the year.
