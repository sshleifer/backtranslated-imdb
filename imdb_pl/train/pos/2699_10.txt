There are other reviews, so I do not have to say how wonderful it is and what's going on ... I mean: I've heard about this movie before it was shown. I do not even remember JAK, I just know it's via the Internet. Distributors survived the fall before it hit! I have turned and complained for months. Remember that this site has a link to purchase this video, and the only highlighted area is VHS at Amazon.com in Germany. You can use Babelfish Alta Vista for translation. I know that it is a PAL format and they have NOT CHANGED the text on the screen into German, and at the beginning there is a little narration, which has also been dubbed in German, but it is so funny and awesome as this movie really makes it more fun! If you want to see this movie and have a place nearby that performs conversions, it's worth it! It took about twenty dollars to get to the US from Germany. Trust me, it may seem that you can spend a lot on the movie, but if you fancy a trivial movie, you'll earn money right and left, getting conversions for your friends!
