Soon, however, he discovers the link between the recent murder in the city and the murder outside the city, which leads him to the trail of the killer of revenge. <br /> <br /> As a post in Dirty Harry Franchise The film begins with very promising moments, including the legendary line "Go forward, make my day", which Eastwood is doing great with clenched teeth and then thwarts the robbery one by one. Very bad and just what fans can expect from him. However, the movie quickly changes gears and focuses on the mysterious killer of revenge. The problem is, this killer is not as mysterious as she is as much as Harry. It really diminishes the presence of the main character who ruled all his previous performances in the film, I apologize for the pun, Magnum Force. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this new story draws some similarities to the unconventional Harry method and gives its hero a dramatic depth that was not there before, but the fans who have been looking for Harry's next adventure will be rather disappointed. However, the taut climax ends the movie on an exciting note, so if you do not mind something else, it's a good movie for fans. --- 7/10 <br /> <br /> Rated R for violence and rape scene
