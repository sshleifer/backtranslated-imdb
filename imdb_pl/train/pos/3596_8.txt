In the end, I sat down and saw this movie all the way and I must say that I was very impressed. Michelle Rodriguez is probably one of my new favorite actresses - it's not just that she * can * act, but she chooses the roles that best suit her, which are more meaningful and important than what you thought. I read a few comments expressing their relief that it was not some horrible feminist thing they thought earlier, but I certainly disagree. Diana is a feminist. He follows his dreams and believes in himself, despite what almost everyone else thinks (except for the caring brother Tina and her trainer and manager, Hector, who turns out to be more a father than her real parent). it's about the word 'feminism'. It's good to watch movies that show the true side of feminism - that they are not a group of losers - but that they have dreams and can do anything. Diana is faithful to herself, she is still a victim of love, and she and Adrian have a more realistic, complicated relationship, and not just something that works magically. Girlfight is a real taste of reality and restored my faith in people. Thanks, Michelle. <br /> <br /> 8/10 - A very important movie that can be attributed not only to young women, but to all who want to go far in their lives.
