Just like the primitive episode "General Hospital" set in a children's department (and one for difficult cases), this fast-moving programmer has a satisfying emotional impact - mainly because Eric Linden, as a desperate young husband in the main plot is so evidently a wreck and it is for this reason. His future wife, Loretta Young, is taken to a detachment at the beginning of a 20-year prison sentence for killing a lecher who was likely to bring him back; Mrs. Young, as usual, does nothing to discourage the sympathy of the audience, and she is a little too beautiful to be true, although of course nice and charming. Her difficult pregnancy and relationships with other girls from the department are the heart of the film, and the result - not quite happy - is right. Aline MacMahon, "one of the few excellent actresses in the cinema", in the right words of the film historian David Thomson, emanates warmth and authority as the main nurse, and Glenda Farrell, as not very willing new mom's twins, reaches to hum a "Frankie and Johnny" as a drunken lullaby . Frank McHugh figures in a different thread, and he shows more coverage than Warners usually let him. It is scaled and modest, and Panic Linden, waiting for panic, stays with you for many days - this kind of part was often played for laughter, but he is a terrified young child in trouble and very persuasive.
