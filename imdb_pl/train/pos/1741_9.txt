Sure, he has some extremes ... but from time to time, real sadness in life surpasses art. It is deeply critical of the goals that we implement and around the entire social structure. The film has a deeper understanding of Greek ways of life, stereotypes and social structure. Unlike most Greek films that have a certain mainstream audience, this one is not directed at anyone in particular, but when you watch it, you feel that someone has put the best possible words and images to describe your feelings.
