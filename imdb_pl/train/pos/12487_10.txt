Dark Remains is a simple and simple homemade run. The film is full of scary visuals and scares that will make the most experienced horror veteran jump out of the blue. Especially the staircase scene, these guests are good. Although they have not worked on a huge budget, everything looks good and the actors come. Dark Remains has one of those interpretative terminations that may be negative for some, but I think it makes you think. Cheri Christian and Greg Thompson are on the spot as a pathetic couple trying to rebuild their lives there, "but some side characters like the Sheriff did not convince me. In any case, they are not so important. I give Dark Remains a perfect result ten times for being ten times more frightening than any recent ghost story in the studio / Japanese remake.
