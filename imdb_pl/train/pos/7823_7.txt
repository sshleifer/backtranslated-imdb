A long but convincing story about the friendship between the civil rights leader Steve Biko and Donald Woods. The first half of the movie is the strongest when we see the bond between two men and the way they help each other, but the other half is not that strong because of the elimination of Biko. It is still a fascinating movie with great performances by Kline and Washington in the film that put it on the map. Washington was also nominated for the best supporting actor for the first time. In general, a well-made film that could be cut slightly. 7/9 .____________________________________
