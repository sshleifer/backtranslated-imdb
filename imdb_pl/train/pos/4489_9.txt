This movie is NOT about fighting with a cat and mouse, as stated in another comment. It's about a cat that used 8 out of 9 lives and now lives in fear of losing the last one. The cat is nervous and scared all the time, hence the name "fraidy cat". The previous life of Fraida Cat haunts him as ghosts from another era and constantly tries to kill him, but is most afraid of the ninth life, which is presented as a number 9 cloud and spits out screw lighting. very old now, but it will still be fun for children if you get a copy. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie almost every day as a child: o)
