I thought the children in the movie were great. I am dealing with children in this age group and I thought that their behaviors were very reliable. I had a problem with reference to private parts made by a 5-year-old. I did not think that the comment was necessary and actually lowered my opinion about the film. <br /> <br /> I think Luke Benward is a star. I would like to see him more on the big screen. I liked his reactions to the situations in which he found himself. Often children in this age group do things without thinking about the consequences. Almost all actors did it throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> I also think that the message of harassment should be studied more in films with this age group. This is a serious problem in today's schools. <br /> <br /> The ending was quite unexpected. Billy's thoughts about whether he won or not won the bet were very surprising. How he dealt with this situation was perfect. Too often, children do not want to compromise. Actors in this film showed that compromise is an important part of life.
