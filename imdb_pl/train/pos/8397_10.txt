This film won each of the ten votes cast by me! Thank you for making a movie worth watching. You showed the world, you can still write, direct, produce and play in a black film without negative stereotypes. Poetry was also amazing, hats off to poets and musicians. <br /> <br /> I watched her last night when I fell in love with my beloved. I will add it to my movie collection today and recommend it to my friends and family. <br /> <br /> Please continue to produce quality, do not worry about the quantity .... <br /> <br /> Thank you again, and best wishes and blessings for you!
