I went to see Vanilla Sky with huge, huge, huge !! ... a fan of Tom Cruise, my extremely cynical brother and my girlfriend ... what can I say ... I was totally amazed with the movie, and especially the performance of TC, I thought it was a very moving movie and it was not what I expected. <br /> <br /> I have read the reviews and decided not to go and see, I am very happy that I was "forced" to see. The strange thing is that I can not say why, all I can say is that I found it totally engaging and I could not stop thinking about it the next day. As for what I felt about this movie, all I can say is: THERE IS NOT A STORY (fantasy, psychodrama, anything) about people and events that shape their lives and how small events like getting into a car they can change everything ...... <br /> <br /> As to what the critics have written, maybe the original was a stunning second movie for Alejandro Amen√°bar, but it was a completely different interpretation of the subject and by no means a narcissistic remake on Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz. <br /> <br /> I can not even consider writing some trivial, glibic sentences to describe the movie, just go and see !!!! <br /> <br /> Yes, I know that this is not a balanced, thoughtful review, but so what. This is not the kind of movie.
