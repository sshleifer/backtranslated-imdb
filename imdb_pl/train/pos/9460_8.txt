I loved this story. Somewhere, the poster said that there are no families like the one shown in this movie. Well, maybe it should be. I thought everyone seemed really human and credible. What a great cast. What great music on the soundtrack. What a nice thing, and it's nice, but above all I will say two words to recommend this film. <br /> <br /> Steve Carell. <br /> <br /> He really showed the nice, subtle depth that touched me. He really commanded as a widower who sacrificed himself maybe a little too much to be a good dad, at the expense of denying his own needs. <br /> <br /> Did he act like a touchy ass? Why, yes, he did. <br /> <br /> And you see, it was perfect in this movie. The actor who played this character made me believe that he FEELS something, and not just ACTED, as if he felt something, and gave me perfectly what he felt and what he felt was refused. <br /> Refusal of happiness. <br /> <br /> Refusal to meet. <br /> <br /> Refusal of love. <br /> <br /> Losing love is unbelievable and many who do it will never feel something like that again. <br /> <br /> Beautiful movie. <br /> <br /> I gave him eight out of ten.
