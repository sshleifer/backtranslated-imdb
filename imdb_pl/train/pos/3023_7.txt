This pleasant little noir can boast the best cast and many unforgettable scenes. The great disregard is total disregard for authentic accents. The Spanish heroes of the film are French (Boyer), Belgian (Francen), Greek (Paxinou) and Hungarian (Lorre)! Besides, Bacall is supposed to be an English aristocrat! Despite these absurdities, all performances are very good - especially in the case of Paxinou and Lorre. But the scene in which Boyer, Paxinou and Lorre meet and speak wildly with different accents is a real hoot! And I think when they see how they were alone, they really should speak Spanish! It seems quite strange that the Warner brothers could not find any actors speaking Spanish in Los Angeles! Of course Hollywood often used the policy of "any old accent" - my second favorite is Greta Garbo (Swede) as Mata Hari (Holland), who falls in love with a Russian soldier played by a Mexican (Ramon Novarro). Maybe they should get Novarro for a "Confidential Agent" - he would be great in the role of Boyer, or at least in the role of Francen (which would save a lot on dark make-up budget).
