Spielberg's first dramatic film is not disappointed. It's a beautifully made film with no flaws in the life of an African-American woman. This also shows that not all films of African-American ethnicity as a center of history must be directed by an African-American director. <br /> <br /> What I love about this film is the ability of Spielberg to be very realistic, even though it was based on a book. What's more, Danny Glover was perfect as a master and usually, he is just himself for most of his films. But at this point it is completely branched out and is something else. However, resistance to the whole film comes from Whoopi Goldberg. She's perfect as Celie. You will never forget these characters after watching this movie. <br /> <br /> I've heard that the music version will also be a movie and I can only say: I hope it is as good as this one because it is a film that can not be missed.
