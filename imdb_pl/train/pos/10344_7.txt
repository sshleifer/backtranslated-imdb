Melvyn Douglas and Joan Blondell interact in "The Amazing Mr. Williams', a mysterious comedy from 1939, which is quite good, though forgotten, probably because of the number of amazing films that appeared in 1939. <br /> <br /> Douglas plays a gifted police detective married with his job while his girlfriend is waiting for a wedding that is still put off. What is happening in this film is no exception - he referred to the scene of murder, just as he is going to go down the hall again. <br /> <br /> Both stars were excellent in comedy, they worked well together (and often), and help in this sex game. Edward Brophy and Donald McBride are on hand to get the perfect support. <br /> <br /> As you can read in other reviews, Melvyn Douglas does not do much of women. <br /> <br /> Funny if little on the long side. <br /> <br /> One of the comments here crashed Melvin Douglas, one of our greatest actors. He literally floated effortlessly through dozens of movies as a second man and best friend, before he entered his films as an old man. He was not a lazy but rather a very hardworking actor (who made him look easy) who had a Broadway career along with his film career. He simply was not cast as a leading man in movies, nor did he have very difficult roles in the studio system. I challenge everyone to see his devastating performances in "Hud" and "I Never Sang for my Father" and call him lazy or refer to his smirk.
