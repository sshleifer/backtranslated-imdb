A comfy comedy Nothing shows us the world we sometimes want to escape: the world of nothing. Anything you do not like, whether it's a stack of bills, bad memory, or even hunger, can disappear at your request. They came to this film very well, and thanks to the nice duet with the stars, in Nothing there were only a few things that I did not like and were not even part of the main movie. <br /> <br /> First, the post-credit scene (and yes, there is one): good for giggles, but what did they want to achieve with this? I was confused and wanted to get back to something after a whole movie of nothing. Instead, we hear a random set of sounds and shout. He tries to create a sequel, in my opinion, and was not necessary or entertaining after the turtle crawled out of the frame. <br /> <br /> Second, the trailer: I saw the trailer on DVD and, like others have already said, it promotes a horror that never came. Well, I think that bad marketing. <br /> <br /> If you see it in your movie rental company, look, because Nothing is a great movie to watch. If you have a big screen, you may want to wear shadows.
