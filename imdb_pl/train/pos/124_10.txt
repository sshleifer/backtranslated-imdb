* Contains spoilers because I have to describe some film techniques, so read at your own risk! * <br /> <br /> I loved this movie. Applying tinting in some scenes makes it look like an old photo coming alive. I also liked the projection of people on the back screen. For example, in one scene, Leopold calls his wife and she is shown behind him instead of on a typical split screen. Her face is huge in the back, and Leo is in the foreground. <br /> <br /> One of the best applications is that young boys kill Ravensteins on the train, a scene shot in the political style of a poster, a close-up face. It reminded me of Battleship Potemkin, this intense, constant style combined with a red spray that carries the tones of horror without much blood. As with the scene where Katharina finds her father dead in the tub ... you only see red water on the side. This is one of the things that I love in Von Trier, his understatement of the horror, which ends in the fact that it makes him even more terrifying. <br /> <br /> The use of the text in the film was exceptional, as when Leo's character was pushed with the word "Werewolf". I've never seen anything like this in a movie. <br /> <br /> The use of black comedy in this movie was well done. Ernst-Hugo Järegård is great as Uncle Leo. It calls the snickers that I got from his role in the Kingdom (Riget). This humor makes the story of the absurd stoppage of conductors conductors on the terrible background of World War II and all chaos easier to accept. It reminds me of Riget, how the hospital administrator tries to maintain normality at the end of the first part, when everything is going crazy. It shows that some people are really unaware of the terrible things that are happening around them. However, some people, like Leo, are fine-tuned, but they do not do anything positive about it. <br /> <br /> A voice well done by Max von Sydow is also fun. It draws you into history and makes you jump into Leo's head, which is sometimes a terrifying place. <br /> <br /> The movie reminds you that someone is a coward if he does not choose the side. I see the same idea used in Dancer in the Dark, in which the character Bjork does not speak for himself and ends with its own destruction. At one point, Von Trier seemed to me anti-woman, creating Breaking the Waves and Dancer, but now I know that his masculine characters are not doing well either! I was in the same place at the end of Dancer, when you seriously want the main character to think about their actions, but of course they never do!
