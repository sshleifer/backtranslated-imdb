It is a beautiful story about a guilty obsession. <br /> <br /> Matiss, during a lonely night walk in Riga (?), passes a woman on the wrong side of the bridge's handrail. He goes without a word. Only splashing in the water, followed by a cry for help, makes it work. And then only too little and too late. <br /> <br /> The film chronicles his efforts to find out more about the woman. He finds his wallet on the troll of local bars. She puts more and more of her life together. His "gaze" changes with the increase of his obsession. He must fix everything. In a miraculously filmed dialogue with a "bastard of a former boy", she forces Alex to face the feeling of guilt that they both feel. <br /> <br /> Haunted long shots, a rough soundtrack that emphasizes guilt, barking dogs. Steps. A beautiful noir movie with a charming accent. Good ending indie.
