This film is perfect for all romantics in the world. John Ritter has never been better and has the best line in the movie! "Sam" gets close to home, is beautiful to look at and play with him. Ben Gazzar was a great cast and it's easy to fall in love with him. I'm sure I met Arthur during my travels. Around, an excellent choice for pick up every evening! :-)
