Although not in the whole film, Andy Griffith plays his role again in this CBS television movie. The plot is easy - Griffith's character dies, and his last will is that his wife and children scatter his ashes in the place he has called (The Mountains Somewhere). Although you will never be able to watch it on TV and it will never be released on video, if you get the chance to see it - DO IT.
