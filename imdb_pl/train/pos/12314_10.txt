Every once in a while there is a film that raises the bar for any other film in its genre. The film of this caliber will affect many films after its release for the coming years. `A Chinese Ghost Story 'belongs to this category. This is probably one of the best horrors created in the eighties; probably one of the best in history. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers created a movie that appeals to every fan of horror films. The story is captivating and original. The villains are dangerous and terrifying. The sets are scary and climatic. There is even some blood and blood to satisfy the fan splashing at home. But do not let the label of "horror" frighten you if you're not a fan of the genre. This movie easily fits in many different categories. <br /> <br /> The writer has successfully combined dramatic, comedic, horror, kung fu and romance genres into a delicious deluxe pizza. "A Chinese Ghost Story" is a beautiful epic love story told fortunately without free nude and / or explicit sex scenes that ruined many Hollywood "love stories". Those who are discouraged by the romantic elements of the story, can sit down and enjoy the fast sword and "wire-fu". If this is not enough, the actors Leslie Cheung and Wu Ma provide enough humorous situations to satisfy the appetite for comedy. This movie offers something for every movie fan. <br /> <br /> Director Siu-Tung Ching and producer Tsui Hark have collected a really amazing cast for this movie. Leslie Cheung proves that he is not only a talented actor, but also a talented singer and charming comedian. I can not think of a performer other than Cheung, who could better present Ling Choi Sin (maybe with the exception of Chow Yun Fat). Joey Wang is charmed as Lit Su Seen, an enslaved ghost who steals the heart of Cheung's character. Her title character is really haunted and unforgettable. Wu Ma is funny as a quarrelsome Taoist who helps young lovers. <br /> <br /> At the technical level, this movie is impressive, even according to today's standards. The direction is great. I regret that today's Hollywood directors are not looking for talented artists such as Siu-Tung Ching, rather retreating to an ordinary MTV video or Pepsi business directors. The photos are great. You have to praise every operator who can make the movie look good when most of his key scenes are in the middle of the night. Special effects makeup is first-class. In fact, most of the effects created in this movie reject the shoddy ghouls and CGI goblins that have become commonplace in modern horror movies. <br /> <br /> Since the release of "A Chinese Ghost Story", two decent sequels were born, full-length animated film and innumerable imitations. However, none of the films that followed or copied after him was able to capture the magic of this classic. This film is required to watch for any fan of horror or just for anyone looking for a great way to spend 95 minutes of their time. 10 out 10. <br /> <br />
