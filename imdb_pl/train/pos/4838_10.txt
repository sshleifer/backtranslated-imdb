This movie reminded me that some old black and white films are definitely worth watching. <br /> <br /> Initially, I had some reservations, but from the beginning of the movie I was fascinated by the end. I was VERY impressed by the mixture of drama, tension and comedy. <br /> <br /> Arthur Askey (Tommy Gander) is HILARIOUS and he was stuck at me all the time. a movie for your movie night for light relief from sometimes depressing and "too" powerful or too "funny" movies today.
