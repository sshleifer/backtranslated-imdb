While "The Kiss of the Spider Woman" cast Juliet Juliet as a political prisoner in an unidentified Latin American country, this time working for a dictator in a fictional Latin American country. In particular, the dictator suddenly loses his life, so Julia replaces el Presidente with an actor on Broadway (Richard Dreyfuss), making a film in the country. From then on, Dreyfuss has to figure out how to be a dictator, constantly balancing his own life. <br /> <br /> Is it appropriate to transform the tense situation in Latin America into a comedy? Well, "Moon Over Parador" is doing great with it. No matter what they do in this movie, they download it. This shows why Richard Dreyfuss is one of the greatest actors of our era and what we lost when Raul Julia died. It's definitely worth seeing. There was also Sonia Braga (who played alongside Raul Julia in "TKOTSW"), Jonathan Winters and Sammy Davis Jr. <br /> <br /> I agree: the first lady is hot.
