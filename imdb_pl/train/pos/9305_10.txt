This is an excellent independent work that is not related to anything before or after. Brother Pack and exclusivity for clubs are not my favorite cakes, but in this world without right they create a tempting atmosphere. The film is full of Our Guys, outstanding actors who distinguish this work through winning performances. Dialogue is a joy. In fact, it is a new mother tongue. One of the few movies that you can watch many times with deepening recognition. <br /> <br /> The most important points include the British loutishness of Billy Idol, Ben London's vulturine vulturine, Kyle's squirmishness and a review of ad hoc philosophy.
