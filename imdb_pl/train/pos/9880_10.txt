This movie was made in 1943, when I think that Judy was at the top (looks wise). In my previous film For me and my Gal, people often say that it looks emaciated. This movie looks perfect. She is beautiful and shows that she has a talent for comedy. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is funny, especially at the beginning when he's trying to arrange a hearing with John Thornway. In my opinion, one of the funniest scenes is the release of Lady Macbeth by Judy and when John is looking for her at the party to give her a spanking (Lol). <br /> <br /> One criticism is that there is a hole in the story when John and Lily fall in love. I mean, she despises her in one moment, and the next one goes out on a date, and then the next time they meet after that date, they are in love. <br /> <br /> Another issue that I did not like was the opening. If I was Lily, I'd be mad at John, but she's not ... it just does not make sense. <br /> <br /> But all in all I would have to give this film 10, because it is just wonderful and almost perfect.
