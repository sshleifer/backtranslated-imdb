In 1985 (my year of birth), Steven Spielberg directed emotionally the strong and unforgettable story of a young African American Celie (debuting role in Whoopi Goldberg), whose life goes on in hard times. The story begins in 1909, when Celie is only 14 years old. She gave birth to two children for her father. Celie has a younger sister, Nettie, with whom she is inseparable. Widower looks at Nettie, but his father gives him Celie. This is the beginning of an era of terrible abuse and constant control. Women are worse than men, and especially African-Americans, their rights are less than zero. Celie's story is a real story of survival. <br /> <br /> "Violet Color" is a masterful and unappreciated film by Spielberg. He should do more drama, which "Violet Color" and "Schindler's List" are a good idea. <br /> <br /> The cast is amazing. Whoopi Goldberg is better known as a madly entertaining comedian, but the introductory role as Celie is an extraordinary word that can really attract a heavy drama. Danny Glover was a surprisingly nasty "Mister". I have never seen him in such a bad role. The talk-show icon Oprah Winfrey is a genius as Sofia's strong will. <br /> <br /> Attention! Prepare to have some tissues while watching this movie. You can really connect with the story of a strong sister. Especially if you have such close relationships with siblings as I do with my sister. <br /> <br /> Big applause for Mr. Spielberg!
