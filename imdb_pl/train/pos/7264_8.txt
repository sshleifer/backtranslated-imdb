I have to agree with Cal-37 is a great movie, especially for the family, Kelly Linch is beautiful, the little girl is really talented and adorable, of course Jim Belushi deserves his stripes! But I would like it to really appeal to a piano song, if you're a musician or you do not watch this movie just for that, you'll know what it is. <br /> <br /> "Nobody loves you" Written by Russ Morgan, Larry Stock and James Cavanaugh <br /> <br /> So, have fun watching <br /> <br /> See you, <br / > <br /> Nelson
