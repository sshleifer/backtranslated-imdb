Eyeliner was worn almost 6000 years ago in Egypt. It's really not a long stretch to be found in the twelfth century. I did not realize that the series hit the flop. Is there no longer airing the second season? It's amazing when the comments are created by those who are misinformed or do not watch the program at all. It is a waste of space on boards and other times. The first performance of the series was maybe a bit painful, because the cast began to be arranged, but this can be expected after each show. The remainder of the first season is excellent. I am looking forward to the start of the second season in the United States.
