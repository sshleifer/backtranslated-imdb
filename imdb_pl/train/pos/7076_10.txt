A very strong movie. Bruce is good, and Brad is also. <br /> <br /> I think the list of receptionists is missing two cities from the list that Bruce remembers. <br /> <br /> This means that the woman was a real insurance and she did her job. <br /> <br /> Well, the property of Novikov seems to me to work in this movie. I believe, however, in Return to the future theory of the multiplicity of worlds. <br /> <br /> So Bruce can save the world, but not his world. <br /> <br /> In the theory of parallel worlds, a man can meet. <br /> <br /> And I believe that there is no problem. Here, I disagree with Dr. Brown from Back ... <br /> <br /> But the story of 12 Monkeys has its beauty. Despite all these theories of one world or many or a continuum, you can believe that he is really crazy, and the doctor - his girlfriend just got lost. <br /> <br /> A series of events that can lead her to believe that he is from the future. Kula - it may be some mistake, some falsification. <br /> <br /> Well, I like this movie - it has to buy a DVD. <br /> <br /> Best.
