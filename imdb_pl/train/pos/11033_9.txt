I think I will never understand hatred for Renny Harlin. "Die Hard 2" was cool and gave the world "Cliffhanger", one of the most amazing action movies. That's right, you little punks, the "Cliffhanger" rules, and we all know that. <br /> <br /> Sly plays Gabe Walker, a former rescue climber who "visits" his old city when he is asked to help a former friend, Hal Tucker (Michael Rooker), helps in saving on a mountain summit. Walker apparently came back at a convenient time, because orphaned people are actually a sophisticated thieves team led by Eric Qualen (John Lithgow). Qualen & co. they lost a lot of money that they stole from the US government somewhere in the Rocky Mountains and would really like to regain it ... <br /> <br /> Essentially, "Cliffhanger" is another clone of "Die Hard". Just trade within the limits of Nakatomi Plaza with the open mountain ranges of the Rocky Mountains, along with scenes created to indicate the weakness of our hero and keep him deadly. Naturally, this configuration is torn to pieces quite quickly, because the Stallone character easily avoids a fairly large number of projectiles and strikes face-to-face with several rock faces with no visible side effects. After all, is this not the case in action movies? <br /> <br /> "Cliffhanger" is one of the most exciting action movies. Presentation of great scenes and stunts. One of the early stunts is one of the best stunts I've ever seen in a movie, and while the rest of the movie is no better than the beginning, it retains its grandeur of action. The main villain of John Lithgow is funny and one bad guy. It is quite possible that this is one of the coolest villains ever. <br /> <br /> "Cliffhanger" is one of Stallone's best efforts, by far the best effort of Renny Harlin and a very exciting action movie - 9/10
