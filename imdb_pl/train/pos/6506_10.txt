Completely brilliant. Powerful and suggestive. The most fascinating documentary series ever made in connection with the war. His tone is a clear contrast to the often gung-ho attitude towards World War II that the media show. Instead of deciding to shout for a terrifying war, let Sir Laurence Olivier's calm voice return to the real images of war: corpses, explosions, terrified citizens and soldiers, broken people, indifferent politicians, mistakes that cost thousands of lives, suffering of the innocent. Above all, it really brings home to which humanity is capable when all normal rules of "politeness" are removed. There is something clearly Hobbesian in a man in the true state of nature, he will return to a more animal form, capable of crimes that will shock and fascinate 60 years later. Perhaps there may be a control series entitled "Age in War", because the 20th century was really a century of horrors. It seems to me a great irony that an event has happened that has caused the death of 50 million people to create such a fascinating and perfect series as this one.
