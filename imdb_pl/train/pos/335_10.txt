I tried to learn about this series for ages! Thank you, IMDb! I saw it as a child and I was never able to get it out of my mind. As a 6-year-old I was obviously particularly impressed by the cyclopean episode, which was absolutely chilling in my veins (I talked about it so much that my older brother did a cyclop from a plastic cave figure that I still have) However, I remember the atmosphere that was unusual from the very beginning - mysterious, raw and extremely authentic. When I read the original many years later, I experienced the same impression. It's very difficult to capture - and probably impossible in Hollywood. Every "Odyssey" I have seen since then was a huge disappointment. The characters in this series seemed real real people - ancient Greeks - and not Hollywood stars in costumes. It's a real masterpiece! But - why is not better known? And why is not it available on VHS or DVD? I would like to have the chance to see it again!
