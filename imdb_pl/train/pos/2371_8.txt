I offered to hire this film to my friend, and he made a commitment because he had seen this movie and said everything was fine. It seemed to me that the title is a little camp, because the version in our store was called "The Fear: Halloween Night". I was expecting this movie to be something like a Halloween break with a wooden killer. But a good scene opened and the assassin murdered two victims immediately and lunged forward twenty years later when his son, who was a witness to his death, killed two people (including his mother), and he was even a witness to the suicide of his fathers in an isolated cabin in the woods with his friends and girlfriend, where he tries to face his fears, until the wooden statue is alive with the spirit of the fathers. Pretty good for a sequel and I never even saw the first one.
