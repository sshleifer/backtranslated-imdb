My heart breaks, that this film is not appreciated as it should be. is very underrated. people have forgotten what films really are, now they only think about boom movies that can be quite fun watching popcorn and friends, like transformers, movies oriented, with a hyper-high budget, like 300 million or even higher, for special effects just silly movies without a storyline. It's the kind of movie that despite the majority. Of course, it's cool to watch CGI, but we do not get anything important from this kind of movie. <br /> <br /> To be honest I think the performance was perfect. Especially Busy Philipps, along with Erika Christensen and Victor Garber (whom I respect) made this film worth the Oscar. The emotional performance of Busy Philipps was amazing, his shame that we will not see the Oscar in her hands that she deserves.
