Roman Pola≈Ñski masters this type of variation on the same subject as Repulsive. I can not imagine that there is one honest filmmaker who can not recognize a good director at Le Locataire, but both parts of dyptiki may not be fully satisfying for most people, including me. <br /> <br /> Polanski is very good at making us feel the inner torture of her characters (Deneuve in Repulsion and myself in Le Locataire), starting with a certain lack of self-confidence, which will soon turn into a psychological anxiety that eventually it will become irreparable physical discomfort. The common gehenna for the heroes and the audience is very different from the horror and tension of the horror movies, because there is no tangible supernatural element here. While the horrors allow for some kind of catharsis (whether cheap or more sophisticated), Polanski saddens us in a sadistic way, and if in his last work the dark humor is permanent, we are mainly on our nerves, not on the edge of our places. <br /> <br /> Suspension, horror, all this is a matter of fun with the expectations of the audience (alternatively their cheating and fulfilling), not literally with human nerves. In my book Rosemary's Baby is a much greater achievement, because pure paranoia and pure rationality are in constant struggle: the story concerns a couple moving in a strange apartment, while we are forced to identify with one figure. What's more, if the fantasy elements are in the hero's mind, the situation is the most uncomfortable, because we, viewers, are forced to judge him, reject him, and we are masterfully enticed ("paint 'n lure") to become him.
