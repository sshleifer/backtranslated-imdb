There is so much rubbish on cable TV channels that I find this gem. From the beginning to the end, it grabbed me and deserves the highest marks. <br /> <br /> The father of two sons hears messages from "God" to kill people who are said to be "demons". <br /> <br /> When the opening credits showed the director that he is one of the actors, he can often be a warning about a bad movie; exceptionally, it is the opposite, because the drama is uninterrupted from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> And there is not a single moment in the film when one is not fully enchanted because there are no unneeded or unnecessary sub-scenarios, and the script is first class. <br /> <br /> All actors give completely convincing performances, especially the main children's actor who is unique. <br /> <br /> This movie is at least as good as "Silence of lambs".
