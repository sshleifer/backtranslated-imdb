People complain about the number of videos about people with intellectual disabilities. I do not consider it an important criticism, no more than complaints about too many films about any kind of people. Jaco van Dormael performs wonderful work with the script and direction. Daniel Auteuil and Pascal Duquenne work together perfectly, and Duquenne basically plays alone. The film covers a surprisingly large area of ​​events and is not simply happy with what you can see in "Rain Man". The ending is rather depressing, but it will not ruin the wonderful story that took place earlier. <br /> <br /> 7.8 out of 10
