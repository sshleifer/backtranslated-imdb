As a company low-budget filmmakers in which they themselves produce and distribute DVDs, perhaps we should not expect too much from the mold in Broken disc. But the most remarkable in all this is reached, the fact that this release is enough extras to shame James Cameron DVD and definitely a great presentation. <br /> <br /> With regard to the latter, the only major drawback is that Broken comes with a non-analogous transfer. Otherwise, we get the film in the original ratio of 1.85: 1, without showing any technical defects and looking almost as expected. Indeed, considering the Ferrari approach to connecting this drive, you can guarantee this fact. <br /> <br /> The same applies to the soundtrack. Here we offer mixes both DD2.0 and DD5.1 ​​and although I'm not sure what should be considered "original", the fact that Ferrari had a part in both measures should not be considered inferior. Indeed, although DD5.1 ​​can offer a more comfortable viewing experience thanks to the way in which uses the result, both are equally good and free of technical defects. <br /> <br /> As for the extras, the CD is positively overwhelmed by them. Look at the sidebar on the right side of the screen, and you'll notice numerous comments, lots of descriptions and various galleries. Indeed, given the way in which everything has been divided into small fragments rather than compiled into a long document, there is really little to discuss. For example, the description "Anatomy of a Stunt" is exactly what it is given for, the same is true for the other parts. Therefore, we get a relationship with almost every aspect of the pre-production, production and post-production of Broken. And although it may be better to find them easier to assimilate the overall "creation" in this way we get easy access to any special function you would like to see. <br /> <br /> From different pieces, so maybe only comments require any discussion. On the other hand, there is also predictable air for each of the chat tracks. This one with the participation of actors is too joking and does not take the film too seriously. The Ferrari pieces are incredibly enthusiastic about the whole thing. And technical are very, very technical. Of course, we also receive crossover with other objects on disk, but in just 19 minutes, none of these works does not exceed their greeting. All in all, a great add-on package.
