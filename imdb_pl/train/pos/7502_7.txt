Although I really did not feel anything for Lance and I felt that his wife could do much better with anyone else. It could be a much stronger movie if they spent more time developing characters, perhaps with Lance - I would like it better. <br /> <br /> But I must completely agree with DoyleLuver when they said "To quote Glenn Quinn, Ben:" I'm a star here, I'm right, I'm talented! "If you watch a movie, just watch it, even when it's in the background ... just its facial expressions, everything in the eyes, you know for sure what motivates Ben, just like he feels about comments, even if it's a quick look behind the character's back. Great action in a fair movie.
