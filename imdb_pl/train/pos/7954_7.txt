Great voices, lots of adventures and clever dialogue make it a very good movie. Adding "characters" to the three leading animals gives tales a lot more depth and meaning, especially the relationship between the older guy, Shadow, and the young hellraiser, Chance. Earlier versions of this movie were not able to give the animals any real personality or theme, which is great here. Sally Field is nice in every way, but in this film she really shines as a proud cat, Sassy. Great contrast between the cat and the dog in life, as well as the right amount of spirit and warm fuzzies to make the plot and resolution perfect. There is even a uplifting result and beautiful mountain scenery. Definitely perfect for the evening alone or with children. Hats off to Disney.
