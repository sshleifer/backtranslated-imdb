It may be the only movie that in fact is approaching the film's grasp of an almost unacceptable world of American university experience from the turn of the 1960s and 1970s. Go ahead, name another movie that even comes close to this: "Getting Straight"? "RPM"? These are caricatures. "Return of the Secaucus Seven" has its moments, but it is a retrospective film about (obsessive) people more than a movie about time and place presented * at * this time and place. "Drive, Said" presents - with subtlety and nuances where he should, and a quick kick in shorts, where it is the only right way - anti-draft movement, ambiguity of the great university sport (especially when there is war with), sexual revolution of that period and general unreality of the day. Believe me, it was like that. <br /> <br /> The whole cast deserves praise (as, of course, the director), but special praise should be reserved for Bruce Dern, as a basketball coach, and Karen Black, the hero is very unusual - beyond that time - interest in love. William Tepper, as a leader, also appraises the real applause both for the perfect grasp of the student-athlete of the period and for actually playing basketball in real college (remember Anthony Perkins in "Tall Story"?) <br /> <br /> In general, the classics - and the last movie that someone in the sixth grade should write comments ("boring", "repulsive" - ​​um, true, sonny, come back to their Arnold movies. Why is this movie not available in imdb?
