The horse is a really good animal. Picturesque images of wild horses and their grace would never be more majestic in animation. <br /> <br /> Animation is simply amazing. Great animation is the backbone of beauty that horses dare to move. More so, when the stallion crosses a diverse area, he jumps through the cliffs and bold waters. <br /> <br /> Also the soundtrack is impressive. Great instrumental music encourages appreciation of the film. <br /> <br /> "They say that the history of the west has been written from the saddle of a horse." Well, the story of a beautiful horse was written from the saddle of the West. <br /> <br /> In total, this movie is apparently on top with the best. he watched. It would be a very good choice for a lonely night. Easy 9/10.
