The director inspired the art of Andy Goldsworthy, his search for closeness to the ground and water, and his sense of proportion - and so gently, so beautifully he breathed back into the film for the rest of us. "Rivers and Tides" loves Goldsworthy's work and joins her as a visual concert of time and human presence in a fluid world, a world that hides his power in sight. Watch this movie!
