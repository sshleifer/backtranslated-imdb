*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** This is undoubtedly the best film that Rainer Werner Fassbinder ever did, and even thanks to the great screenplay the film is wonderfully performed by Hanna Schygulla. The film begins with Maria (Schygulla) and Hermann Braun (Klaus Lowitsch), who just get married when the bombs are still falling, and Hermann is sent in the near days of the war, and now Maria and her mother and sister have to rub against their survival. Maria decides to work as a dancer / prostitute in a club for American soldiers, and she meets a black army soldier named Bill (Greg Eagles) and they start to meet regularly. Maria hears that her husband Hermann died in the war, so she becomes very serious with Bill. But one day, intimately with Bill, they see Hermann by the door. He did not die, and when he enters the room, there is a clash and Maria breaks the bottle on Bill's head and he dies. Hermann takes the blame and is sentenced to a long-term stay in prison, so Maria tells him that something will work and get out. The war is over and the Germans have to rebuild, and one day on the train Maria meets Karl Oswald (Ivan Desny), who is a successful businessman in the textile industry and uses his charms to get a job. Maria is determined to do well and climbs the corporate ladder and becomes Karl's lover. He tells him that he will never marry him, but he is in love with her. Hermann leaves prison, but goes to Canada to try everything that Maria has done since its closure. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** <br /> <br /> One day Karl dies and leaves Maria almost everything in his will, and Maria buys his own home. In the end, Hermann returns home to his wife and they are both ready to marry, even though they have been married for some time. But Maria leaves the gas on the stove, and the house explodes with both still in it. <br /> <br /> In this movie there are so many interesting things that one of these films can be studied and talked about to a great length. As with all Fassbinder films, the use of color is very interesting. When the film begins, the sounds are brown and gray to represent war-torn Germany, but when Maria begins to be successful, they turn into bright, rich colors such as red and white. The reconstruction of Germany with all the sounds of construction is used only as a background, and the film focuses on Maria's exploits. Fassbinder wanted the remake sounds to remind us of what was happening in Germany at the time. Hanna Schygulla has never been better, and her performance is the key to the success of this film. With a smaller actress it would be another interesting film, but Schygulla is so strong that her performance raises this film to an elite status. Schygulla shows Maria as a very determined and clever, but at the same time she uses her beauty and femininity to get what she wants. She is not embarrassed and does not feel guilty about it, and Fassbinder wanted to show Maria as a woman who practically sells her soul to survive. Schygulla was not nominated for an Oscar, but she gave a great performance that would stand the test of time. Sam Fassbinder appears in the film as a peddler, and his mother Lilo Pempeit plays Frau Ehmke. I've heard many things about the end of the movie and it's related to whether Maria deliberately left the gas. Later in the bathroom flows wrist and seems to be sad. It's just speculation and if you think I'm wrong, write to me. I think she was excited about Hermann, who was at home and left it by accident (Do you remember dressing up for a reason?). Then, when she reads her will, she finds out that Hermann and Karl have become friends without her knowledge, and I think that she felt that everything she did was for nothing. This is the reason for the bathroom scene. So when the house explodes by accident. But I think the reason why Fassbinder has such an ending is to show that everyone who sells his soul has no interest in life. Fassbinder was fascinated by the survivors, but he was also extremely passionate. In his opinion, Maria can not have him both ways. Fascinating movie.
