This is a film that my dentist actually recommended to me and I'm glad he did it! A mix of British humor (should I say, Humor?) And the reality of a lost, middle-aged widow trying to maintain her lifestyle was hoot. Add to this a mix of reality what is needed to actually grow in a pot (these plants under the bushes were NOT going to do it without the received TLC), and this is a really fun but moving movie. I laugh every time I feel the vision of all the bar customers sitting on lawns with sunglasses counting down the lights! Maybe it's just my blood in the Mendocino district, but the British definitely have it right !! 10/10
