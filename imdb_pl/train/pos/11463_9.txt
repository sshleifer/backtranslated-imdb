I saw this movie at the Rhode Island International Film Festival and I was totally amazed. The structure and performance of the film were fantastic ... I know not, but it really deserves an Oscar. Cal and Andre were phenomenal, as did two worried classmates. Yes, the movie is very controversial and I see a lot of people who have a lot of problems with him, because he's doing school shooting, and especially makes you identify with the killers. However, despite the harsh and dull theme, Zero Day is worth watching. I can not wait to go out on the video, so I can buy it - it's very, very good. Very strong and intense ... the final sequence of photos leaves you without a word because it is too realistic. Their uncertainty, "recordings", recordings and panic of students, completely indescribable. I really hope that it will attract the attention it deserves. It is performed in the same format as The Blair Witch Project, a handheld camera that looks like a real documentary at home - but God is INFINITE better. Very impressive, hats off to everyone involved. If you have a chance, you really should see it.
