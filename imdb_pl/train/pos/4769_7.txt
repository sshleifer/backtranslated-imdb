I am sure that this is a show that nobody is so familiar with and may not think well about it; in the end it's almost close to Baywatch Hawaii. With cast, location, director's style and her advertising? shows women walking on the beach and so on. No wonder people have a misconception and decide not to watch it. <br /> <br /> They were wrong. Because after I decided to watch the program, in fact more things happen, a real juicy story and conflict, they turn out to be really exciting to watch and almost? addictive. <br /> <br /> The story of hotel officials, the manager, the owner and their complicated love life. Also, come to a hotel visitor and a powerful man who is trying to steal a hotel. It's actually more exciting than it seems here. <br /> <br /> I will not deny that you are sucking, but it is not so bad that you look away. The story is not so coherent, but good enough. The soundtrack fits the script well, and the action is all the time. I took a few episodes before something happens, so be patient. <br /> <br /> Recommendation: I really like to watch it. Zillion Times Better than expected. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7,5 / 10 (Grade: B) <br /> <br /> Please rate my review After reading, Thanks.
