Man, I loved this movie! It really takes me back when I was a kid. These were times when teachers were still showing class videos on reel-to-real, and if you were good, they would scroll the video slowly so you can watch it play back. I still remember one of the first lines ... "Tutazema was his name, and he was an orphan. He lived with his sister, so in the village. " It's a great movie for children and lasting like a red balloon. Finally, other Indian boys from the village attach feathers to Tutazema and become an eagle himself. He can live the way he always wanted. He is rising into the heavens.
