It was a bit weird and bad, and I loved it, the characters in the show were great as well and complemented well. I was sorry to see how it ended. I'd like to see where it could go. You found yourself leaning toward Lucas Buck, the sheriff who had more secrets than anyone else. Lucas was terrifying and attractive. And I would like to see him and his character. However, I will buy the program only to enjoy it, it was great for something else on TV. And Paige Turrco, who was Caleb's cousin, was a big secret, where and what Lucas means. It is a pity he is not around yet ... or he has never been completed, I would like to see what would happen.
