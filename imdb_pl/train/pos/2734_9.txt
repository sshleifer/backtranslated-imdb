Easily one of the ten best films of the 20th century. In Cold Blood he is brilliant in the simplicity and realism of his story and absolutely riveting. <br /> <br /> Robert Blake is leaving the movie. The story seems to be presented almost completely from Perry's point of view, even though Dick is the leader and planner of the pair. The viewer will be perceived by Dick as being more unstable, immature and generally feels that Perry would not be drawn into this nightmare, but for Dick and his need to be someone and get a big result. <br /> <br /> Based on a true story with special attention to accuracy, In Cold Blood presents the story of a brutal and senseless murder on a rural family in Kansas on one cold, windy night, because Dick bought the age-old rural myth of wealthy farmers safe cash at home. As a "prosecutor" (a character who does not have a name in the script), played by Will Geer, so keenly indicates that their lives are bought for only $ 10 a head. Director Richard Brooks wisely decides not to share with us the gruesome details of the murders until the end of the movie, before we only know that this happened and watch the life of Dick and Perry slowly discovered when they try to escape not only being stopped by law enforcement agencies, but Perry's growing sense of well-being. He repeatedly comments: "Nobody ever avoids such a thing" and "I can not stop thinking that we left something that belongs to us." Dick is neither mature nor moral enough to feel convincing guilt about their crimes, just Perry's irritation. Indeed, after they get caught, Dick breaks first and suddenly faints when he finally faces the irrefutable proof that puts two men at the scene of the crime. I felt a little sorry for Perry from the very beginning of the movie, and moreover, as the events progressed, but I hated Dick. <br /> <br /> The genius of the film is the immersive way in which this story is played. For a moment, we do not think that we are watching actors depicting heroes, but that we are watching real participants and events that took place. The story is unrelenting, mocking, working time just over two hours seems more like a few minutes. <br /> <br /> For those who are interested in such things, I've noticed a few "Goofs" mentioned here on the IMDb site for In Cold Blood are incorrect or exaggerated, such as the "reversed" process at the beginning of the movie, when Dick and Perry they go to the Kansas bridge, first of all it's not a process, the camera is actually in the back seat and the picture seen behind the windshield of the car is real.The big truck with the load on the left side of Pontiac Dick creates an optical illusion that they retract because it moves at a higher speed, but a more accurate test reveals that they are really moving forward and this is a shot from a moving vehicle. <br /> <br /> As I mentioned before, this is one of the top ten works of cinema XX age, not recommended for very young because of some language of the course and alleged and inferred violence (no real face on the face a modern movie would resort to this), but a completely perfect movie.
