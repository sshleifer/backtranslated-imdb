The film is very complete in what it is, constantly interested in flashbacks to childhood and growing up with such a bizarre father and intertwining with the tails of serial murder, you just can not go wrong. The plot itself, the story itself and the essence of the film is fun. This is a story with which the director (Bill Paxton) could do so much, in this case he really did a lot of it. <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end you still expect more and more about what is happening and where the film goes, and the creativity behind this story is first class. I felt like this movie was superbly made from beginning to end and one of those rare jewels that seemed to be without boring downtime - the action flows smoothly, quickly and tightly from one scene to another. <br /> <br /> Demonstrates how far people can go: to do such horrible things to their loved ones and to do such evil in the name of "God" when they are disappointed, like in this matter. Sometimes it is also interesting in its "twists and turns" and adopts the concept of morality as a whole. <br /> <br /> In general, it's a kind of movie that's easy to overlook, but I recommend you not to do the same and to check out this movie - it's worth your time.
