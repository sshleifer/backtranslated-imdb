When I was a kid, I totally loved Bill and Ted Movies. Bogus Journey lasted the second night, and because it's been at least 5 years since I last saw her, I decided to tune in. This movie is still fun after all these years. "Excellent adventure" is better, but this one is the same. Sure, some of the perfomances are a bit bad, but hey, this whole movie is bad in a nice way. Additionally, it contains the coolest Death character ever in the movie! In conclusion: Just like a non-fiction movie guest! Excellently! STATION!!!
