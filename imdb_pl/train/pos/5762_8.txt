I must admit that I enjoy bad movies. I love them, I watch them all. Particularly horror. Me and my friends meet after a hard week at school and work, rent crazy tapes, order a pizza and have a great time. This one had a great box, so I expected less than usual. <br /> <br /> The story concerns a residential project built on a nuclear facility, in which the above-ground layers have been pushed and the other underground layers are simply covered. Residents of this neighborhood find a covered object when some children fall into a hole in a cave. It wakes up some zombies. <br /> <br /> From this moment it is a piece of the city. The gore and action effects never end until the end credits are finished. <br /> <br /> OK, this is not a great art, but this one, with joking dialogue and horrifying macabre things, was our favorite evening. Actually, it was one of the best "tape parties" I've ever had the pleasure to see. And you could say that it was done without money, with a group of crazy people. There are hundreds of zombies and the director looks like Brendan Frazer (he has an episodic scene) and it's just a crazy journey.
