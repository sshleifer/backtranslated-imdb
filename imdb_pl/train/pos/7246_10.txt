This movie is totally funny. Not only is the story terrible, but acting is frightening. The special effects are blurred, and the whole film is embedded in a post-apocalyptic desert. However, this is by far the most entertaining film that has ever received a production permit. It's 101 minutes of laughter because of the fact that we know there will be no fuel or El Camino in 3000. There are other aspects that I will not spoil, just because they make movies so idiotic. I highly recommend this movie because of its total idiocy. I have no idea who would watch it, expecting it to be a high quality feature, but if good laughter is what you need, see Exterminators of the Year 3000!
