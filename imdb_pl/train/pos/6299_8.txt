There are good ways to make a movie and bad ways, and that's a lot. This short caper does not require anything other than what it gives to the audience. It presents a simple story, told very clearly, with enough jokes, so you can go on, it just gets better and better. Clooney's pouch is fun and very welcome, but the leaders, including Sam Rockwell and Luiz Guzman, can easily do it themselves. Similar and entertaining, fun, late, Welcome to Collinwood is a welcome addition to the heist genre.
