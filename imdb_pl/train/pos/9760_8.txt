I have very nice memories of this film because I saw him with my younger sisters when he first appeared theatrically in 1977, and I was eight years old. Apparently it was considered a failure - and now practically forgotten (a widescreen video cassette - which never rendered justice to the painting or its ambitious Panavision compositions are currently unavailable). The film is very stylized (shades of YELLOW SUBMARINE) and it is uneven. Some characters and sequences are excellent, while others are slightly younger and not stand out. A sad, rejected blue camel (KÅ‚apouche's shades) and his blue song are really warm. The songs of Joe Raposo are simply beautiful. Definitely interesting curiosity, which probably (unfortunately) will fall into complete oblivion.
