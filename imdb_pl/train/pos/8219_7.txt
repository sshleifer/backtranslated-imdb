The series "Dirty Harry" began with a very lively action of the policeman and was immediately immediately lightened "Magnum Force". By the time The Enforcer turned, Dirty Harry was nothing more than a cop's television show (written only by Tyne Daly). After seven years of break, Dirty Harry finally returned to his roots. Maybe it was not too long at that time. <br /> <br /> Clint Eastwood is doing Harry's first well-directed movie since Don Siegel did the first, which helps a lot. Harry is even a darker figure, not a nice policeman he has become. Once again, he can say something like: "Go ahead, make my day" and it really matters. Sudden Impact is the real sequel to Dirty Harry. "The Enforcer" should never be created. <br /> <br /> 7.2 out of 10
