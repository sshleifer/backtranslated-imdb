Some elements of this movie are of course dated. For example, the whole white male crew. And, like most Science Fiction in front of Star Stars, it's usually too long to be admired. <br /> <br /> But still, no movie captures the Golden Age science fiction taste, just like it used to use "electronic key tones" to provide a musical score. Robbie the Robot personified Asimov robots and was an inspiration for everything that has happened since C3PO to Data. <br /> <br /> Of course, Shakespeare's plot is "Storm." Morbius is Prospero, and the exiled wizard finds his kingdom invaded by intruders ... It was a film that treated Science Fiction as an adult genre, perhaps the first.
