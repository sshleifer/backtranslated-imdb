"Ardh Satya" is one of the best films in the history of Indian cinema. Directed by the great director Govinda Nihalani, this is the most successful Hard Hitting Parallel Cinema, which also turned out to be a commercial success. Even today Ardh Satya is an inspiration for all the leading directors of India. <br /> <br /> The film is about a scenario from a 1970s Mumbai police life. Unlike any other city police in India, the Mumbai police embrace a completely different system. Govind Nihalani creates a very practical Outlay with a real approach to life in the Mumbai Police Environment. <br /> <br /> Among various police officers and colleagues, the film describes the story of Anand Velankar, a young Copa hot blood coming from a poor family. His father is a strict police officer. Anand himself suffers from ideologies and cases of fatherly atrocities on his mother. Ananda's approach to immediate action against crime is the inert desire for self-satisfaction at work. The film is rotated here in a thread in which Ananda's continuous efforts against crime are trampled on by his seniors. This leads to frustration because it can not achieve the desired job satisfaction. Resulting from frustration, his anger is expressed in excessive violence in pre-trial detention centers and bars, also turning him into an alcoholic. <br /> <br /> The spirit is still alive in him because he is constantly fighting the system. He is aware of the metro system, in which police and politicians are absolutely bound with the end. His compromise on unethical practice is negative. Finally, he is suspended. <br /> <br /> The director is a master piece and a completely hard core. One of the best unforgettable scenes is the situation in which Anand breaks at the house of the Underworld gangster Shetta to arrest him, and then there is a short conversation that is fantastic. In many scenes, the film has furry moments. <br /> <br /> Practical Script approach is a serious blow. Alcoholism, corruption, political influence, courage and deception are now an integral part of Mumbai police. These aspects are treated very well. <br /> <br /> Finally, the movies belong to the series One man, Om Puri, in which Anand Velankar perfectly travels all his emotions.
