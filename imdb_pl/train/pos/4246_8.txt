In this movie, which became JUST, because the production code was enforced, Jean Harlow is Eadie, and Patsy Kelly is a wise man chasing Kitty. The Missouri girl starts with the girls getting on the train, and Eadie promises to make money by looking for a millionaire's husband, remaining entirely in the process. You do not have to wait long for a meeting with Frank Cousins ​​(Lewis Stone, a kind Doctor at the Grand Hotel, and Judge Hardy in the movies "Andy Hardy"). But everything is not as it seems. The censors had to LOVE the Harlow line. "The girl could not accept such an expensive gift from a gentleman, unless she was engaged." Then someone says, "You know we've never been alone together," and Eadie replies: "Yes, we will not!" Lionel Barrymore is T.R. Paige, another rich, upper breed that comes to her rescue, when trouble comes, he's looking for Eadie. At some point Paige declares: "You should scratch me from the list - I am not a lady" ... I wonder what this line would be like just a few years before Hayes' code will fall into the city. What did he really say? Carol Tevis seems to be a high "Baby Talker" mentioned in loans on IMDb. It looks like she was in show business from 1931 to 1939, and "Munchkin" in the Wizard of Oz was the last part she played. Funny, how girls are chasing men across the country. Look for Nat Pendleton as the rescuer who was the Olympic wrestler 1920 (silver medalist) who became a movie star (he was in many of Dr Kildares and appeared in four films by Harlow). Incorrect identity, twists, young Franchot Tone, love stories, even Jean Harlow in a bathing suit at "Palm Beach", although the outdoor scenes in the center seem to be the background.
