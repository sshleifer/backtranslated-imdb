This is a strange, but somehow impressive story about love. Personally, I have never experienced such a twisted story in my life. But I can imagine it. <br /> <br /> This is a story that promises to be "sick" from the title. But after seeing it, I did not feel a "disease" that I would certainly have in relation to social principles. It is something beautiful in this film ... something impressive ... which I can not deny using any moral or social principles. <br /> <br /> The film focuses mainly on the relationship between Kiki and Alex. You can see how this relationship begins, evolves and ends. You feel the moment when this love blossoms, the first whispers, touching. You feel the connection. And I have no time when it is immoral. You even hope that he will not break in the end ... he can not break ... it's not right. In the end, you feel pain because of a broken heart ... <br /> <br /> But I must also add a negative spin to this comment ... I do not know if history is somehow * shown * to give a feeling that these relationships they are only sick in form, but not in content. You do not have the whole story, but only fragments. After the film started, the relationship between Kiki and Sandu was already in place. So he has no idea about the nature of relationships. You only feel tension between them ... a struggle between the need for love and the desire to break this relationship. I think that Kiki's line to Sand says it all: "I want to stop ... and if you love me, you will do what I ask of you." <br /> <br /> This film will probably raise some questions about what is love and what is moral ... and where is the boundary between them. I do not know if the idea of ​​this film is "love wins everything ... even social and moral standards" or "love is beautiful ... no matter how or where." But in my opinion this movie is a success for the simple reason that it makes you think ...
