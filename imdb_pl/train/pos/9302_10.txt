Most of the comments were positive, but I would like to add that viewers should also focus on the sets. The set designer has used many beautiful art deco treatments and beautiful buildings, stairs, doors, furniture and so on. It is worth paying attention to this. The film is driven by characteristics and symbolism, which is very rich. All gangster actors were cast - it was like seeing old friends and it was a feast. Dialogue was sometimes funny, but sometimes it was stiff and I suppose it was supposed to be. This is a buff movie. It was created by people for people who love the medium. Do not miss it.
