The quality of production, staffing, premises, authentic premises in New England (Waterbury, CT?) And the lush result of John Williams should result in the position of collectors of 3-4 stars. Unfortunately, everything we got was a satisfactory, two-star "decent" movie, mostly memorable from what he tried to do ......... to introduce the mainstream film in the style of an artistic house. A small town and the history of ordinary people is a genre for itself, and if well done, it will satisfy most adults. Jane Fonda could not hide her intelligence enough to make her character credible. I wondered why he was not doing a PhD at Yale instead of working in a dead end in Waterbury. Robert DiNiro's figure was a bit fancy. An illiterate, nice lost guy who turns out to be, with a little help from Jane, the version of Henry Ford or Thomas Edison from 1990. <br /> <br /> This species has been successfully served by "Nobody's Fool" in the mid-90s and this year (2003) "About Schmidt". I regret that mainstream studies will not try out more things for teenagers and reserve several screens in multi-room complexes for these efforts. <br /> <br /> I'll give him "A" for the effort.
