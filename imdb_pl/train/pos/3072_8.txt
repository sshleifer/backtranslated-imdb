Panic is a crafty little jewel of the movie - you think you managed to figure him out for the first half hour, to be very happy to realize that Henry Bromell is a much better writer / director. <br /> <br /> The film is built slowly, with one quietly destructive stage in succession, and all this is perfectly realized by William H. Macy, Donald Sutherland, Neve Campbell, Tracey Ullman, John Ritter and the most remarkable children's actor I have long been I saw David Dorfman as the son of Macy, who delivers his lines as if they were completely unwritten in thought. A rich and satisfying movie will stay with you long after the loans are developed.
