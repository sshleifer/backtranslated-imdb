In many of his films ("Citizen Kane", "Confidential Report", "The Touch of Evil") Orson Welles gave him the role of disastrous men. In "The Lady of Shanghai" is the only time I see him playing the role of a victim. The role of the culprit Rita Hayworth gave her, probably because he was in love with her. That's why it's an interesting movie. But I also consider this story to be excellent. The direction is brilliant, as usually with Welles: the two scenes are especially brilliant: one in the aquarium and the other with mirrors. This movie is brilliant. (10/10)
