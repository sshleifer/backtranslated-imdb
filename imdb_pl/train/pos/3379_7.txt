In the 1970s, Charlton Heston appeared in science fiction movies of various qualities. "Soylent Green" is one of the better ones. He plays Roberta Thorn, a detective in New York in 2022. In this future, most food is so expensive that everyone needs a product called Soylent Green. But when Thorn finds out about the distasteful truth about this product, he's on the run. <br /> <br /> I guess it's only natural that this movie seems to be dated to us today. Nevertheless, it still raises interesting questions about what will happen to our agriculture. Also starred were Leigh Taylor-Young, Chuck Connors, Brock Peters, Joseph Cotten and Edward G. Robinson (in his last role).
