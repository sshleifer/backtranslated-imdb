Emma Jane Austen is an extremely pleasant story in the worst of times, and this production of this story is the best I have ever seen. Emma Kake Beckinsale is impeccable. Gwyneth Paltrow (with the help of a good script and excellent cinematography) is able to effectively extract a comedy, does not make Emma nice. Paltrow is not helped by the fact that her hairstyles are simply "bad" in this part (and I believe in the era), and she looks positively ill in dresses from the empire line. On the other hand, Kate Beckinsale manages the comedy with no effort and is still able to show what Mr Knightly sees in her (the most romantic heroes of Jane Austen). Mark Strong is a great Mr Knightly with the right mix of handsome looks, the right age, chivalry, compassion and gentleman's behavior. Emma and Mr Knightly are supported by a cast of good actors, and the production as a whole is quite delightful.
