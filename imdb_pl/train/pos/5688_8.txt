Initial loans: great. Music: suitable for this movie. Photos: dingy to a perfect effect. <br /> <br /> Shocking emotions like the wreck of a train. In this way, it can get out of control of some life. "Land of Wonders" depicts wildness caused by drugs (and its consequences) not as an aberration, but shows how it really happens in our society. This is better than the presentation of another wild group - Manson - because all of Manson's films, books, etc. They focus so much on Manson's crazy mind than on the overall picture of cheap fame and randomness that is so ubiquitous nowadays. > If you want to see some of the best "methodical" movies, watch Kilmer in this movie. It shows how "The Method" can draw attention in the right role. <br /> <br /> The creators of the film manage to raise "control" to the level of art, not only because of giving us cheap emotions.
