This film attracts you from the very beginning because it attracts our attention, admitting that this story opens up a banality? funeral. <br /> <br /> In hands other than Judi I would not give him 8, because this material has been repeated many times: a great meeting of once famous, choose one, please, team, army platoon, theater group, singers, band. <br /> <br /> But this movie never bends towards cheap sentimentality, and when you think it will end, it will fall in a different direction. An example is the flowers sent by a devotee to Judi. <br /> <br /> Team members are an interesting group and also ride over stereotypes. One is in prison, one has found religion, the other is an alcove, and one has plunged into dementia. But the joy of life rediscovered by Judi, inspired by the interest of her granddaughter, brings us and makes us omit the simplified nature of the plot. <br /> <br /> The cast is someone who has talent, Leslie Caron, unparalleled jazz player Cleo Laine with her amazing high notes, the last performance of Joan Sims, brava Joan, cute as flirtatious flirtation with Ian Holm and Olympia Dukakis as captivating money divorcee living in the Scottish mountains of Ghillie and her whiskey, The closing scene is a standard event in Hollywoodland, the children's judging turned into fun loving supporters, old lovers joined together, young people sweep the music of old timers. Life should be so simple. But I would watch it again and intend, with my granddaughter. Because in good hands sometimes you just love these brazen old stereotypes. 8 out of 10.
