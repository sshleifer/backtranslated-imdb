A classic western dramatic / action with amazing photos that is ahead of its time (1954). The production is very good and it can be said that it was done with pride and love. The unique look at the American pioneers of NORTHT WEST is very educational and entertaining. This film is very unappreciated because most people do not like to see the reality that many "lawyers" in this particular time and place were very wronged / corrupt, like most developing countries. However, the action sequences may have been more realistic, but still this movie really covers most of the basic things. Not for an audience that wants only pureer type tester westerns for this movie is more for those who have a sense of history and philosophy .......
