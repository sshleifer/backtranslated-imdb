There is no day without a new released animated computer movie, so now we really have a chance to see more than cool effects. After watching Ice Age, I felt that it was not as big influence on me as other movies of this genre. <br /> <br /> But that's because I'm now a Big Guy and I'm pretty sure it's a very nice movie for children (maybe up to 14 years old). The story is quite simple, and the "actors" are funny in a sweet way, without any primitive and complex humor. Even "bad" is a beautiful, fluffy big cat with these funny teeth. And the story has a happy ending, which was a bit of a disappointment for me (knowing that most of the main characters are doomed to a sad extinction), but a great thing for children. Apart from a few fights that no one dies (even when the mammoth hits him several times), which caused a feeling of cardboard. <br /> <br /> Part of computer animation is fun, but nothing special, apart from some really nice scenes with cartoons, when you feel like walking in a nice picture or on the pages of the comic. [But that means a lot of work!] <br /> <br /> There were a few gags that made me smile - I agree, the creators tried to satisfy those adults - but it's hard to notice them and (in my opinion) it was better left unnoticed, because it does not fit the story. <br /> <br /> Generally this is a nice movie, but rather it is a disney phrase of the ideal world and fluffy animals for children. If you do not hate cute animals doing funny things, watch them at least once.
