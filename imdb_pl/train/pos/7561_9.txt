The version that I saw in this movie is Blockbuster rental with a similar title, but a curse in it. <br /> <br /> This movie was funny as hell. This was also true for bones. If you've ever spent time in Hollywood or the neighborhood, you'll understand humor. If not, you can not "get it" at all. <br /> <br /> The story of two people in business struggling to finally reach a critical point is a rare jewel. He says it's a drama, but it's a drama just like Deer Hunter is a comedy. <br /> <br /> Loren Dean is wonderful, as always, as a supporting actor. Jamie Kennedy was able to maintain his own well. His performance is particularly impressive on the stage of a poodle. The only downside was Carmen Electra, but we can not have everything.
