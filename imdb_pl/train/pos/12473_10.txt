A warm, touching film with fantastic quality. <br /> <br /> Ellen Burstyn is as always outstanding. <br /> <br /> Samantha Mathis has given many great performances, but there is only something about it that will haunt your memory. <br /> <br /> First of all, you must see this amazing 5 years. old, Jodelle Ferland. I was so fascinated by her presence that I had to buy a movie so that I could watch it again and again. It is a miracle of God's creation. <br /> <br /> Judging by the high IMDB rating, I'm not the only one who was hypnotized by this young actress.
