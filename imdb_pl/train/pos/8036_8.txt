Some people think that the sniper is not good because of the share of the action that was not good enough. Well, if you consider this to be an action movie, this point of view can be quite real, because part of the action of this movement is not really exciting. I think, however, that this is a psychological drama, not an action. <br /> <br /> The film told us mainly about the interior of two snipers who definitely had different personalities and different experiences. Tomas Beccket, who was a veteran and had 74 confirmed killings, looked like he was cold. However, after Beccket showed his dream about Montana, we can clearly see his softness inside. It was a cruel war and the dedication of the partners that made Beccket a so-called cold heart. <br /> <br /> Millar, on the contrary, was a newcomer, a green hand, and did not even qualify as a sniper. Billy Zane showed quite well the miller's hesitation and fear when he tried for the first time "to hit the ball in the heart" (as Becker said). He was thinking about the suicide mission in fact, because it could be easily accomplished, and then he could safely return and collect the prize. <br /> <br /> These two guys were completely different in their personalities and I think that the film successfully showed the difference and influence they had on each other due to differences in their personalities. These two snipers were arguing, suspecting each other and finally understanding the agreement and what they did to help save others. <br /> <br /> Sniper is not a good action movie, but a good psychological one.
