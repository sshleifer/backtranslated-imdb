Blob is a classic science-fiction movie from the 1950s. You probably know this story: two teenagers (Steve McQueen and Aneta Corsaut) see a meteor hit the ground, and when they go, they run into an old man with a strange ... stain attached to his arm. They take him to the doctor's office, and then they go to find out what happened. From there, the drop spreads, eating everyone in its path. Special effects are bad fun, as is history. There are many great elements, such as a policeman who plays chess on the radio with a policeman in another district. It's not a masterpiece, but it has a special place in its genre. Steve McQueen is very good. 8/10.
