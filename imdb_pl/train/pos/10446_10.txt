I watched this movie 10 years ago. From then on we watched him on average once a year on video. is a kind of movie that is timeless, because the themes are universal, but stories and conversations are so personal. it is also one of the few films that capture you from the frame to the role of subtitles, despite the fact that there are really only two (very engaging) characters. he owes a lot to the engaging actor hawke and delpy, who make us believe that they are actually jesse and celine. it's also the first movie I've seen, reminiscent of reality TV, and now the phenomenon is crazy! I love the way this movie surrounds the audience in its space and makes you think, however tired you are that you are one of those characters. it also made me want to take a train around Europe! I have not met anyone who would not be able to refer to this film. maybe it says about me, about my friends, or just about the genius of this movie.
