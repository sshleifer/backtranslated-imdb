I saw this movie for the first time when I was 13 years old. Then it crashed me and still works in many ways. But I'm less inclined to see it now as an accurate piece of history. Little effort has been put into exploring and interacting with racism - and thus it is not recognized that the strongest anti-racist weapon is to understand it in the heart of those who commit it. Instead, we are dealing with a dichotomy - on the one hand, beko and forests in a panoramic rainbow vision in 3D - on the other hand, two-dimensional figures are presented as mindless, careless evil. <br /> <br /> All this makes a great movie story, but it worries me that people perceive this image as "accurate".
