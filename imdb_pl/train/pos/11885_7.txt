This film created for French television concerns the tragic effect it has on the family. When Leo, the young man in the center of the story, is diagnosed as an AIDS virus, he announces it to his parents, they simply can not believe it. The film is a study of a character about how this family deals with this topic. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to the director, Christophe Honore, for putting this honest account on the screen. Nowhere, but in France this story will not go to movies because of the topic. <br /> <br /> The message has a devastating effect on Marcel, a young brother who hears about what Leo has made, despite the way parents want to protect him from reality. <br /> <br /> Yaniss Lespart and Pierre Mignard do a convincing job of presenting the brothers.
