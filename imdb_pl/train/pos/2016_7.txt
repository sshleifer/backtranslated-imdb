Higher and Higher was one of the smaller Broadway musicals of Rodgers and Hart, who only had 84 appearances on Broadway in 1940. However, he brought one of their major hits It Never Entered My Mind. <br /> <br /> With the exception of one minor song, So Disgustingly Rich, the entire Broadway score was lifted when RKO bought the rights to the film. Instead, the entire new score was written for Jimmy McHugh and Harold Adamson, mainly to accommodate Franciszek Albert Sinatra, who debuted in the feature film. <br /> <br /> Sinatra, who has made several vocal scenes in his previous films, takes a leaf from his vocalist Bing Crosby. When Bing made his feature film debut in The Big Broadcast, he played Bing Crosby. Frank Sinatra played the role of Frank Sinatra and I can not think of someone who could do a better job. <br /> <br /> The President of the Board is third in the ranking for the stars Jack Haley and Michele Morgan. He is a clerk, and she is a fan of Leon Errol. In fact, Errol is a millionaire who has not paid his help for seven months. Mainly because he is going to go up to chapter 11, or inform the staff. <br /> <br /> Errol is a wonderful old soul to work with, and no employee wants to lose anything good. They combine their resources and make Michele Morgan impersonate Errol's daughter, who is in Switzerland with her mother. The idea was to get a rich bankroll in the hope of saving a family fortune. Only Michele starts to look at another one. <br /> <br /> It's a small plot and certainly not worse than a whole bunch of musicals, but RKO has invested this movie in a good cast of players. Barbara Hale and Elizabeth Risdon play another debutante, and her mother, who suspects that something is wrong, Victor Borge is a non-seeking fortune, Dooley Wilson, Paul Hartman, Grace Hartman, Marcy McGuire, Mel Torme and Mary Wickes , others from the Errol family are playing. This is not a bad group. <br /> <br /> Sinatra sang three good ballads, all had some commercial success, The Music Stopped, Lovely Way to Spend the evening, and I could not sleep in a wink Last night. The last one was nominated for an Oscar for the best song, but she lost to Alice Faye "You'll Never Know." <br /> <br /> The year 1943 was the year of Music Union's Union Strike against the recording industry. To get their material, Frank Sinatra recorded Higher and Higher songs with the acapella choir for Columbia. Bing Crosby recorded the songs from his Dixie movie in the same way for Decca. Both were condemned by union president James C. Petrillo as scabs and both did not cross the picket lines. The strike did not end completely until 1944, although Decca broke rank before other record companies and settled earlier than Columbia, RCA Victor and others. <br /> <br /> The strike gave Sinatra some disturbing moments. He just left the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra when the strike was called. It closed the necessary place for his craft when he was not sure if leaving Dorsey would be the right move. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the higher and higher have been well received.
