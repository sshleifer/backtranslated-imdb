The title of this film almost discouraged me. Not being a fan of Manchester United, the very mention of Beckham was a bit difficult, but I put my prejudices behind me and I'm glad I did. <br /> <br /> I did not expect too much, but I was pleasantly surprised. The movie rushed with me, never watching my watch and I enjoyed every second of the movie. If you like East to East, you'll love this movie. OK, so the story is nothing new, and the classic story is included in the film, but everything is done very funny and with a breath of fresh air. The film moves very fast and provides entertainment to the listeners. The occasional funny moments are a good giggle, not a bad attempt at humor, and most importantly a good British comedy.
