I've always been a fan of the show, so I'll admit I'm biased. When the run ended, I had the impression that too many questions remained unanswered. This movie for me was like a closure. Watching all the people I've been following the last few years has finally been the most satisfying. I hear that this is probably the only murder movie we can expect. If so, this is the right way to go. This movie is sometimes poignant, sometimes annoying, but always satisfying. If you are or have ever been a fan of the show, watch this movie.
