"Stink of life" is a parody of life and death, happiness and depression. Black and white always present in our lives. Mel Brooks' performance is as always brilliant and other actors are doing well too. This movie has some Capra flavor, that's why it's so good. <br /> <br /> There are some unforgettable gags like this one, when Brooks tries to earn some money dancing on the street and everyone passing by just ignore him or when he meets a funny crazy man who believes he is Paul Getty, and then he starts to argue and pat. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen it, you do not know what we missed. <br /> <br /> This film is about the old and eternal struggle of the poor and the rich. <br /> <br /> The only difference between this film and reality is that this movie has a happy ending and reality is not. <br /> <br /> Yes, Life Stinks.
