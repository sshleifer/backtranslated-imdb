This is my first comment! It's a fantastic movie! I watched it all through the happiness of one night on television. For the first 5 minutes I thought it was a B movie, but then I understood what an amazing product it was. <br /> <br /> I suggested some friends to watch the movie, just to tell me it's a bad B movie. How bad. Superficial criticism. <br /> <br /> I think the movie is almost a genius! A well-known director has done a great job here and it's a pity to say that he has not played all the time.
