This is one of the best Bollywood movies I've seen so far. Family and friends feel the same way. This film is really romantic and dramatic at the same time. In my opinion, we need more such films or movies to keep the culture of South Asia alive. Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao acted very well, and their couple attracted many people to the cinema. It must see the movie, it's a family and romantic movie. This film also comes from the creators of Hum Saath Saath Hain and Huma Apke Haina Kon. This movie is now the best ... The film setting was beautiful, which is also a great attraction. This movie must see ... recommended to everyone !!
