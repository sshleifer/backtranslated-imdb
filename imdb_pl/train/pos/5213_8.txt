This is the first review I wrote for IMDb, so naked with me, but I caught this movie on HBO and I was glad to see it. Richard Gere is great in this film as a passionate agent / detective who bends the rules to do the job. I think the story is great and there is never a boring scene that slows the pace of the movie. Some parts of the movie that affect people with dementia are quite shocking, but if you've ever seen a crime movie like Se7en, you'll be able to endure these scenes well. <br /> <br /> So, all in all, if you're looking for a good detective / suspense video, ignore the IMDb's low rating and watch it for sure.
