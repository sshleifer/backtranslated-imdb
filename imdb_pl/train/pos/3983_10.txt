It fully deserves a prestigious Hollywood Award nomination, it is a small jewel with lots of pizazz√≥w and great surprises. Extremely funny scenes include a fun session (and replay) of World War I trenches with Australian comedian Clyde Cook as an optimistic non-com and unfortunate McDoakes as Boyer / Colman's messenger? all under the watchful eye of Ralph Sanford's delightful anger; the lost McDoakes run and run by equally amazed Jack Carson; director's assistant Chandler rejoicing to send McDoakes: "I'll be the director!" <br /> <br /> Comic O'Hanlon has a double role, playing both McDoakes and yourself playing McDoakes! Oddly, Richard L. Bare, who plays in one or several other entries in the series, refused this opportunity here. In real life Bare is a young, six-foot Rock Hudson, but here he plays the role of a veteran (over 500 films!), Jack Mower.
