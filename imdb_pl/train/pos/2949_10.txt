This is the funniest booth I've ever seen and I think it's the funniest thing I'll ever see. If you do not choke out with absolute laughter, this is not your cup of tea. But honestly, I do not know anyone who has seen what he did not like. Now it's 17 years later and my friends and I are still quoting everything from Goon Goo Goo to fart, Aunt Bunnie to the ice man, Ralph and Ed to get out !! There are so many individual and collective expressions of merriment here that if you honestly have not seen this movie, you lose one of the best performances in history. Let's take Robin Williams, Damon Wayans, The Dice, George Carlina, and even great champions such as Richard Pryor or Red Foxx, and it will outweigh it. I do not know how or where Murphy has some of his material, but it works. It comes down to this. This is fun as hell. <br /> <br /> Can you imagine how this series had to shock people who were used to Eddie doing buckwheat and Mr. Rogers and SNL? If you listen to the audience when you break your first joke or when the word "F" is first spoken, they are completely shocked. <br /> <br /> For the first time he says that the word "F" is: he makes a skit about the fact that Mr. T is homosexual. <br /> <br /> "Hey, boy, hey, boy. You look really sweet in these jeans. Now come here and fuck me ass! "<br /> <br /> The crowd explodes in bursts of laughter. Nobody expected the dirty lips that he released on them. But the results were simply amazing. I've never been killed by a merciless comedy the way I was in this performance. In fact, the next time my stomach hurts so much, it was only in 1999, when I saw SOUTH PARK: BIGGER LONGER AND UNCUT. This comedy was raw and unmistakable and it went to the neck, like DELIRIOUS. I do not think you can watch this piece of comic story and laugh. It's almost twenty years later and it's still the funniest thing on video. <br /> <br /> "Last week I took your kids fishing. And I put the worm on the hook and the children put the fishing rod back in the boat and cracked my head in the water for two minutes Gus Normal kids do not shit like Gus, and then they start to move their heads in this way and appear m **** f ** *** Then they looked at each other and told Goon Goo Goo! I said, can you believe this shit ?! "<br /> <br /> See it again and be prepared for the laughter of your weird ass off! <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10
