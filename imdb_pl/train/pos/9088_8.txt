When we talk about the Hollywood Hotel, we can talk about one of three things, about the real hotel, the radio program and the movie that was partly inspired by the first. Dick Powell was the host of the Hollywood Hotel on the CBS radio network, in which Louella Parsons spoke weekly information about the stars. <br /> <br /> Powell and Parsons debuted in the Hollywood Hotel program in 1934, so by 1937 he had a large part in the radio program. Powell visited, sang and kibited with Louella and her movie stars. Thanks to the power she possessed in her column, she was able to force various stars to continue and connect with the latest movies without problems. <br /> <br /> Then the American Federation of Radio Artists came in and demanded her pay accordingly and won the case. This ended the Hollywood Hotel program in 1938. Of course, both Powell and Louella went to other radio locations. The whole story is described in the book of Tony Thomas, The Films Of Dick Powell. <br /> <br /> But before the plug-in was pulled out, this movie came out of the Powell Warner Brothers home-inspired radio program. Powell plays the singer / saxophonist in the Benny Goodman band who signed the contract with Hollywood. But when he goes to Hollywood, he gets entangled in the selfish movie star Lola Lane, her sister twin real sister Rosemary Lane and the actress of the ham at Alan Mowbray. <br /> <br /> When Mowbray is called to sing in the epic civil war he creates with Lola Lane, it's Powell's voice they use. Mowbray then develops Lina Lamont's problem when she is asked to participate in the Hollywood Hotel radio broadcast from the Hollywood Hotel. This led the studio crazy. Let's say the problem has not been resolved in the way it is Singing In The Rain, but Powell's manager, Ted Healy, is resourceful. <br /> <br /> Richard Whiting and Johnny Mercer provide a really good result for the movie. A great hit song appears at the very beginning when Benny Goodman's band with Johnnie Davis' scatical sing sings the Hollywood hymn, Hooray for Hollywood. But my favorite is Powell and Rosemary Lane singing "I'm Like A Fish Out Of Water." Just listening to the lyrics of Johnny Mercer about Ginger Rogers leading Brooklyn Dodgers or Sally Rand without her fan, it is a compendium of American popular culture in the 1930s. <br /> <br /> Busby Berkeley is doing a choreography here, and when the film does not have violent imaginary things that his previous work with Warner Brothers has, the numbers are well-staged. Berkeley's big moment is in the diner, where Powell and Healy were forced to work. The number begins with the transmission of Benny Goodman from the Hollywood hotel "Let That Be A Lesson To You", and then on the "drive-in" Powell, Lane, and the whole place begins to sing to the irritation of the owner Edgar Kennedy. And you know what to expect from the irritation of Edgar Kennedy. <br /> <br /> Benny Goodman shows why he was named King Of Swing, when the band with drummer Gene Krupa and xylophonist Lionel Hampton as part of his band. That's with Frances Langford singing. Probably the last remaining member of the cast was a guy who had a small piece as a radio announcer. He died in 2004, but he did not become the 40th president of the United States. Ronald Reagan always recognized Dick Powell and Pat O'Brien as two guys at Warner Brothers, who were the most helpful to the willing young player who wanted to make his mark. <br /> <br /> Hollywood Hotel is one delightful and fun movie, outdated but charming.
