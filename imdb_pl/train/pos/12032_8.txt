The film I will describe is a small TV movie from 1996, starring Melissa Joan Hart and Daniel Baldwin. <br /> <br /> Main character / antagonist Jennifer Stanton (Hart) is a typical American teenager who feels the pressure of having such a controlling father (Baldwin). However, when he meets a former opponent named Nick Ryan (Jeremy Jordan "Never Kissed"), they immediately "fall" on each other, but Jennifer has another idea where to take their relationship. he manipulates him to kill her parents to protect their "love", but she simply used him to get rid of her parents so that she could be with Brad (David Lascher, a future colleague from Sabrina's cast for Hart). Melissa Joan Hart really really surprised me with her role as an evil manipulator and she wears a movie with her friends and Nick so she can literally escape the murder. The rest of the auxiliary kick works well, and each of them stays on when he has time on the screen. It was also interesting that this movie was filmed and released in the same year, Hart, he portrayed Sabrina, a teenage witch, and this shows that he can work in my film and television genres. <br /> <br /> Although the film dates a bit because it stands out as its best work that includes drama or thriller and I am looking forward to "Nine Dead", which will appear in November because it shows that it can perceive as other people who are not called "Clarissa Darling" or Sabrina Spellman "<br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of Melissa Joan Hart or Sabrina. You can watch it on the Internet, so I suggest you check it out.
