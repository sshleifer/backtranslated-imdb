In student times, I've seen a lot of TV movies, most of it is a normal waste of time that American television throws out. This one, however, was well crafted and crossed out, and its tip was very pleasant. I only saw Richard Dean Anderson at MacGyver and Stargate. I was surprised by his excellent performance, not the range of A-B expressions he usually gives. A nice surprise was seeing Daphne Zunigi after quite a long time reaching for The Fly II. It's nice to see Robert Guillaumme in the lead role. I can not say I have never treated Jane Leeves seriously after her days, Benny Hill, but she almost managed to do well in her role. All in all a highly recommended movie.
