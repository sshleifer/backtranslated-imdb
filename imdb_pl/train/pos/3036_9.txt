The name just says it all. I watched this movie with my father when he appeared and after serving in Korea he had great admiration for this man. Disappointing in this film is that he focuses only on the short life span of a man - interestingly, the whole life of this man would make such an epic biographical picture that it is amazing to imagine the cost of production. <br /> Some posters escape the defective features of the man, which are cheap shots. The theme of the film "Duty, honor, country" is not just the usual words written from the mouth of a high officer - it is a deep statement about the total devotion of one man to his country. <br /> <br /> Ironically, Peck, being a liberal, gained a better understanding of man. He does a great job by showing a fearless human-tempered general.
