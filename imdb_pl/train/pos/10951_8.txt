Big S does not play taboo or force the agenda, for example Mencia or Chapelle (though I like both). It defines the obvious in subtle, almost subliminal comments. Her show will not change the world nor it does not. But along with the hilarious former boyfriend Brian Posehn and Paget Brewster, Jay Johnston about the fame "Mr. Show ", this is one of the hot programs with an appetite for destruction! My site was completely destroyed by the first episode. Listen, I love this woman and like her famous boyfriend, Jimmy Kimmel, she just delivers lines and lets the viewer run with him. The best kind of comedy. Counterfeiting of anything and anyone, like "Mary Poppins" in the second episode, while singing to fake birds to quickly comment on society and college. This one is highly recommended, but only for those who still have a funny bone (and have not lost it in the last treatment of lippo-sucking or boob work).
