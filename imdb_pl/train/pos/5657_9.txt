I remember watching American gothic, when it first appeared, it occurred to me recently, all I remembered is the same guy who appeared in Midnight Caller, namely Gary Cole, I do not watch too much TV, but I watched American Gothic, I bought Complete Series on DVD this week, and it's still as good as ever, it's one of the best TV series ever, the reason I do not watch too many TV shows is that it's just trash, except for Derren Brown, this is all Reality TV or Soaps, such as Grease, Big Brother, etc., I've had enough, I got the Complete Series of American Gothic for 16.97 Â£ from the Asda website, it's the cheapest I can find.
