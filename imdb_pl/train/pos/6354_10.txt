Jim Carrey can do anything. I thought it would be some stupid childish movie, and TOTALLY was not. it was so incredibly fun for EVERYONE, adults and children. I saw it once, because there was almost no cinema, and now it is finally available on DVD on Tuesday and I'm excited, as you can see. you should definitely see it, if you have not done it yet, it was great! <br /> <br /> Liz
