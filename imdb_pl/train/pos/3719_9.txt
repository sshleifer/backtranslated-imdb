That's what I caught at the Toronto International Film Festival. It is a good story, told in a convincing way. The approach to the action scenes from the hand-held camera increased the intensity of these scenes (in the documentary style, not in the style of Blair Witch). Joel Schumacher shows that he does not need a big budget to produce a thrilling movie. <br /> <br /> The actors were strong, especially the actor playing in the center of events in the film, God.
