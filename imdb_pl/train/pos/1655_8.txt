Mendez and Marichal gave us a serious, convincing and painful analysis of the social, spiritual, economic and political crisis that 108 years of colonialism were born in Puerto Rico. A beautiful island with the most hospitable people I've ever met, yet because our nation refuses to face imperial responsibility, Puerto Ricans can wither and die. <br /> <br /> The spiritual crisis that colonial situation in Puerto Rico created, undermining families, and the basic institutions that support every society. Corruption is common to the extent that people do not pay taxes (which led to a fiscal crisis for this nation), and a sense of culture of cynicism and mistrust permeates the culture of the island. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the subsidy allowed for a painful but powerful film to be produced. <br /> <br /> Must see. . .
