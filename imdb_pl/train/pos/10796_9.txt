If you're a fan of one or both of Chuck Norris and Judson Mills, this is a movie worth seeing. It has many adventures in it. It's a great follow-up to President's Man. The chemistry between the three main stars (Chuck Norris, Judson Mills, Jennifer Tung) is amazing. My personal opinion. This film along with the original was so good that the networks should consider turning it into a regular series. I recommend this movie for you. If you saw the President's Man: A line in the sand, but you did not see the President's Man, let me suggest you do it.
