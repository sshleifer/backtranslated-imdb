This may not be an unforgettable classic, but it is a touching affair with an important topic that emphasizes the importance of literacy in contemporary society and the devastating consequences of career and life for every poor wretch who lacks this basic skill. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around Iris, a widow who meets a colleague working at her factory, an illiterate canteen named Stanley. Iris discovers that Stanley can not read, and when he loses his job, gives him lessons reading at home in his kitchen. Of course, as you can predict, both of them, although initially afraid of involvement, develop mutual feelings ... <br /> <br /> Jane Fonda competently plays Iris, a woman with her own problems, dealing with a lack of job prospects, two teenage children (one in pregnancy), an unemployed sister and her abusive husband. However, Robert DeNiro is of course a genius in his captivating depiction of intelligent and resourceful, but illiterate Stanley, who brings dignity to a role that inspires respect. They are not your typical charming young yuppie couple, as they usually depict romance on the screen, but an ordinary working class, middle-aged couple, with beautiful fights. <br /> <br /> I will not give away, but it's a beautiful, passionate affair and a personal look at the worrying problem of adult literacy, though from the perspective of a fictional character.
