From the day I saw this movie, when it appeared in 1981, he was one of my three favorites. Blurb, which I wrote for Amazon, is below and I am excited that it will finally appear on DVD 10/17/06 - the 25th anniversary of the film. <br /> <br /> The last remark in this video explains his appeal - "Thank you to the Manhattan residents who filmed on." A charming and witty romantic comedy is a love story written for New Yorkers (Peter Bogdanovich is a native) who can identify every location (West 12th Street, Ansonia, old FAO Schwartz, Plaza, Roxy, Chez Brigitte, and City Limits, which were a country & western club). One gets the impression that the whole team threw a click just like on the screen, and this intimacy is clearly communicated. I was laughing, I was crying, it was better than CATS. Not only oda to Dorothy Stratten, but also the last performance of Audrey Hepburn (she had an episode after this movie) and her inner beauty is permeating from the screen. Buy it, make a big popcorn tub and curl up with someone you love.
