When I was the president of our university's cafe, one of our tasks was to browse groups and films for student activities. One of the best things that will appear in 1972 was Groove Tube. The original idea was to show off-off Broadway in cinemas, where TV monitors were placed in the audience, so everyone had a great place. The assumption was that the skits would change regularly - ala Saturday Night Live, keeping things fresh. They decided to make a film for distribution to him. <br /> <br /> I believe the creators said Chevy Chase was in the film for the first time. Watching him running naked in the woods was a howl. Like many previous reviews, it was Saturday Night Live before something like that existed. I highly recommend this movie. I told my 13-year-old son about Clown Koko - He can not wait to get a copy!
