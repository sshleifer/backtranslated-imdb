At the beginning I was not sure if I was watching a documentary, a propaganda film or a dramatic presentation. I think that considering the production time, it was a combination of all three. <br /> <br /> Although the dramatic plot was quite predictable. But you had the impression that interesting scenes would appear in the film. We were witnesses of what seemed like realistic training schemes and equipment. <br /> <br /> Where this film was collected for me, it was closer to the end. The scenes had realism (at least as I saw it), with which I had never met before. You can put yourself in action and imagine the thoughts of young fighters. This has been mixed up with the usual problems of presenting Japanese soldiers at a time when one would think that real Japanese actors will be somewhat scarce. <br /> <br /> The film is perfect as the source of the state of American thinking in 1943, when the war was going on with Japan. I was also interested in working in Japan on the help that the US has given Japan in recent years.
