I really can not say much about the story of the movie, which has not been described yet. I have not seen the movie for about 25 years, and the memory of him never left me. I've been looking for him everywhere. In the past, I searched the net, but left empty. Last night I thought about the movie again and tried to remember who was in it, but I was only 10 or 12 when I last saw him and I was not even sure if I had the right name for the movie, so I decided to do another search and finally found this view. I was right. If anyone knows where I can get a copy of this amazing movie to share it with my family, please let me now at tawnyteel@yahoo.com. I would really be grateful. And everyone who has not seen this movie and has a chance for it is worth it.
