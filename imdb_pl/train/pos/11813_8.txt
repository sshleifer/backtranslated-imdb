I love it or hate it, it's hard not to notice that Warren Beatty starred in "Dick Tracy", a film adaptation of Chester's famous comic from 1990. Superhero movies come out of woodwork in recent years and can soon become a genre in itself. <br /> <br /> Beatty's film makes full use of Gould's source material, shooting basic colors in all six tapes, thus giving this unique yet world-wide joyful mutant gangsters and loose seductive women, a lush style visual and tone. <br /> <br /> It can be stated that the strong visual aesthetics of the film drastically shorten change the characters and their acting abilities, which I think can not be further from the truth. <br /> <br /> "Dick Tracy" relishes his appearance and ghostly characters, and Beatty himself, who plays a stubborn and incorruptible detective with the title, is suitably stoic and ready to spoil the bad guys at all costs. <br/> <br /> In addition to visual delicacies and the Oscar-winning makeup, there is a conspiracy, and Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino, a great Oscar winner), tries to eliminate Tr in one well-planned move, but also tries to gain control over all criminal activities in the city, connecting all the gangs under him. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Tracy is juggling his relationship with Tess Trueheart (Glenne Headly), who, as it is her name, stays true to his side and cares for The Kid (Charlie Korsmo), who finally finds a father who can boast about our crime conqueror. Tracy's faithfulness to Tess is checked by the tempting advances of Breathless Mahoney (Madonna), which is also the major squeeze of Big Boy. At the same time, when everything is falling, the situation becomes hot when a new criminal character arrives in the city and decides to play both sides against the middle. <br /> <br /> The performances are good because Beatty's attention to the tense and romantic relationship between each of the clues becomes the center of the material, not just focusing on pointless activities and special effects. Pacino freely experiences the scenery in a role that really stands out from the rest. <br /> <br /> "Dick Tracy" is one of the best and most overlooked comic book genres. I think if Chester Gould were still alive, he would be proud of the fact that Warren Beatty faced his beloved detective fighting crime. <br /> <br /> 8/10
