First of all, the only reason people move around this movie is that they can not stand several parts of a real "changed" story. Consider? Peter Jackson's film was not a perfect performance either. Well enough. It's a very beautiful movie. The backgrounds are wonderful and drawn from well-known artists from Tolkein. The film is about the middle of the trilogy (Fellowship of the Ring and the battle of Helms Deep in the Two Towers) and moves at a good pace. The cast of the voice is at the highest level, and most of the characters look as I imagined. Samwise is a bit ugly for my taste, but Aragorn looks amazing. The film has a great score that completely supports the film. If you like good fantasy stories, but you do not like reading (books are even better), try this movie, remembering it was made 20 years ago. <br /> <br /> Also a special remark: the team follows almost exactly the same thread as Ralph Bakshi (Jackson repeatedly said how much he admired Bakshi's effort).
