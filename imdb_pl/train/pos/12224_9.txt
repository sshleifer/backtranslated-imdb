I had to see the whole movie last night and found it very exciting. At least it was not like the movies of teenagers that appear from time to time. The search for the killer and the relationship of the "partner" between the hero and the so-called bad guy was a part that I liked in the film. I also remember that I was once on the edge of my place during a particular scene in the film. That means it is exciting. Maybe after a while I can watch the movie again. ..
