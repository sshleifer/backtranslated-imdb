Somewhat fictionalized biographical portrait of Abraham Lincoln's early years from director John Ford, focusing mainly on the trial in which a young lawyer defends two brothers accused of murder. <br /> <br /> The film offers an interesting portrait of this important American character and the film is well made, but it seems to be incomplete without great moments from his presidency, and even debates with Stephen Douglas. The obvious intention was to portray Lincoln as a young man developing attributes that would make him the great man he became. But the result was such that I admire the portrait, but it was not as satisfying as I think, it could have a larger range. <br /> <br /> In the role of Abraham Lincoln we have Henry Fonda, who effectively displays silent strength. Fonda's performance contains some nasty manners and other affectations that are quite effective in portraying a Lincoln portrait, especially when combined with some effective makeup and costumes that are sometimes somewhat explicit. <br /> <br /> The cast is solid and surprisingly does not include many regular Ford casts (sometimes referred to as his stock company), but we have Ward Bond one of the most prolific actors in Hollywood. Bond has appeared in more AFI Top 100 films than any other actor, both original and revised. He also appeared in 11 nominations for Best Films. <br /> <br /> There is one scene in the movie that seems to inspire a quite similar scene in "To Kill a Mockingbird", where it would be done even better than this. is here, although this scene is one of the most effective in this movie.
