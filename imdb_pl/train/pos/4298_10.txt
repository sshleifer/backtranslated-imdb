This movie has fascinated me so much that I watch it at least once a year. Sometimes I feel uncomfortable. Sometimes I think it strengthens it. And I always find human figures and real ones. It is a film that shows the harsh reality of life in LA, starting with the recurring search lights of helicopters, looking for dangers lurking so close to the ordinary life of the heroes. It is also a movie that shows how the goodness of a stranger can change your life and strengthen you to change. The Grand Canyon reminds you that any action you take, be it intentional or not, has serious repercussions. I consider this film to be similar in many respects to the film by Robert Altman Short Cuts. They both had a starred list of perfectly filled actors and actresses, and both of these films allowed you to gradually see how the characters are interrelated and influence each other, for better or worse. The Grand Canyon made a coherent message better (hope in the face of a desperate reality) than the Altman movie, although I think that both of them intrigue in their own way. This movie is definitely necessary !!!
