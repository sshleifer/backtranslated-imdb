The creators of this wonderful movie have done a great job, engaging you in the heroes who suffered through this terrible torment. The terrible scene in the forest was made so great that you forgot that these people were just actors, playing parties. I've never been as immersed in a movie like me. Burt Reynolds and Jon Voight has never been better on screen, as well as the great performances of Ned Beatty, Ronny Cox, Bill McKinney, and though he only appeared briefly, James Dickey, the man who is the author of the book on which the film is based as Aintra's sheriff. This is a bit worrying, and children, of course, should be protected from it, but it is a great, dramatic cinema.
