I really liked this movie, it was good and the actors were brilliant! Leon Robinson, who played Richard and many other classic singers, is very good at his work, when you see him in a musical movie, you know he'll be fine! I would suggest that people watch this warming, sad and special film if they want to know more about Richard! Outstanding! Fresh!
