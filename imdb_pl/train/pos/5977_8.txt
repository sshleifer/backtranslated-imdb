Teenager Eddie spends his life persecuted and humiliated because of obsession with heavy metal music. One day he learns that his hero Sammi Curr died, presumably burnt by a factory that wanted to put an end to his music. But Eddie has his last album, never released, and when he plays it, he begins to receive messages informing him how to deal with his captors. Soon Sammi revealed that she was going to come back to life at a local Halloween party to take revenge on a city that once mocked him. <br /> <br /> Full of humor and jokes, this is a very entertaining movie. Sammi is the original villain of horror, he plays the obsessions of the '80s of rock music evil' in the 80's. Worth watching.
