This movie is for Halloween what fun "Christmas history" is for Christmas: both are relatively low-budget movies, "without big stars" ... and both are the two absolutely and the funniest films, both seasonal CLASSICS !!! "Spaced Invaders" comes out with a gallop from the beginning with warmth and humor and a great cast of characters ... all five stupid Martians, Klembecker Realtor, Russell deputy, Vern in the "fuel store" and so many others! You just have to see this movie to believe it, and like in Christmas Story, every time you watch it is getting better, and every time you come to funny things !! THE MOST MOST FREQUENTLY TEN !!!
