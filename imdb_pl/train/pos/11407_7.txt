updated on 1 January 2006 <br /> <br /> Parsifal is one of my two favorite Wagner operas or musical dramas to be more accurate (Meistersinger is the second one), although it is difficult to imagine that it is "the peak of someone's jumping out". The libretto, as usual, the composer, is a confusion of religion, paganism, eroticism, and perhaps even homo-eroticism, and its length can make it seem to the public as to hear dry paint. <br /> <br /> Wagner, being a famous an anti-Semite (Klingsor may be one of his substitute Jewish villains), naturally entrusted the premiere to the un-turned (not because of RW's attempts!) to Hermann Levi, who was his favorite conductor! (Go to figure!) Kundry, the most mixed and other likely Jewish surrogate, is both despicable and kind, depending on the scene. <br /> <br /> Given that many versions of Parsifal's video seem to be clumsy. this opera film is, in comparison, a breath of fresh air. Hans-Jürgen Syberberg, the director, brought him a lot of imagination, but it's hard to know why he made some of his choices. For example: the infamous double Parsifale (each sex!), Dolls, death-mask-Wagner kit and various dolls and symbols, such as the Nazi swastika in one of the travel scenes. (If I remember, "real" Engelbert Humperdinck wrote real music to retouch scene changes.) Although Wagner himself died too early to be a real Nazi, many of his descendants (as well as his second wife, Cosima). at least they were traveling companions, including grandson Wolfgang Wagner, who is still at an advanced age at the Bayreuth Festival. In fact, Wolfgang's son Gottfried Wagner, in total contradiction with his father, tried honestly to accept his great-grandfather. <br /> <br /> Syberberg also seems politically ambiguous from what I read. In 1977, he made a well-known film about Hitler "Hitler: ein Film aus Deutschland" (sometimes called "Nasz Hitler" in English). Because it lasts 8 hours and is not widely distributed, most people have not seen it (including myself). <br /> <br /> Armin Jordan, the audio CD conductor on which this movie is based, Amfortas (sung by Wolfgang Schöne) Edith Clever (Yvonne Minton) plays Kundry, Michael Kutter and Karin Krick play double Parsifals (both sung by Reiner Goldberg!), and Robert Lloyd and Aage Haugland play and sing Gurnemanz and Klingsor. <br /> <br /> Although the opera is performed for a long period of time and all (except the Kundry?) have been described as aging considerably between Acts 2 and 3, no one looks older one day before the end of the opera. (Grail magic? In this opera Grail is the cup from which Jesus drank during the Last Supper, and not Mary Magdalene, as in recent times, an idea that I consider to be ridiculous!). <br /> <br /> conducting and singing are quite useful and it seems that the DVD has greatly improved the sound, if not the picture. (Yes, I agree that the "Kna" approach is better, even on the second stereo version, but it is probably better than all the recorded versions.) <br /> <br /> It is not Parsifal for all Wagnerites, but I think that works well as a film opera.
