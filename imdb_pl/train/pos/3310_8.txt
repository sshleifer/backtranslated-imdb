In the film Kongwon-do ui, he has a relatively intimate look at sensibility (as well as general senselessness) in the lives of various Koreans; empty people looking for ways to fulfill themselves, enjoying the escape of nature. From the beginning to the end of the movie we observe the fallibility of various characters; we learn about their shortcomings and their desires, about the overall complexity of human life (and yet about the general simplicity of humanity). Although the movie is slow, it can be very contemplative. It does not enforce any ideas, but it allows ideas for independent appearance, allows concepts to be revealed. <br /> <br /> The film ends as well and as suddenly as it starts, and the meaning of loneliness is really understood, this love is often an act of egoism and many mistakes that we commit. It's a look at everyday life, very well and beautifully made. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for action or intense drama, this is not a movie for you. However, if you like fair, original and meaningful films that are not forced and without glitz, this is a great movie to watch.
