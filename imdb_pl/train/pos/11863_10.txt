Perhaps this is the best movie ever made, and if it is not certainly one of those who have been burned to your students, as Brian De Palma puts it, this is a great piece of cinematographic work. First there is a touch of director Brian De Palma, who once again proves that he can be one of the best directors in history, is the excellent performance of Al Pacino, which delivers the immortal hero on the big screen (Tony Montana), there are many different (violent) scenes you will never forget (the one with a chainsaw, the one in which Tony sits in a bathtub, which is as big as most salons of most people), there are many wonderful one-line (count how many times the word "f *" is used ck "), there are wonderful little details (a pan-American globe that screams" the world is yours ") or the great discomfort of Giorgio Moroder. Nothing can be named, which is not too sublime here, and it's easy to combine them with "Godfather", "Good guys" and "White Heat", one of the best gangstermovies in history!
