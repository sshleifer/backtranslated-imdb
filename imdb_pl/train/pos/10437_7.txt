It's a slow story. No action. No crazy tension. No sudden surprises. If you can not stand the movie about two people talking and walking, about a story that develops slowly to the very end and a love affair, do not waste time and money. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, if you like dialogue, masterful story telling, inspirational ideas and find true love in the structure of life, this is your movie. However, I recommend watching this movie when you are most vigilant, because the tempo, music and overall tone of the movie can make you in the mood for wool. It's really fantastic. I really mean it. <br /> <br /> Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are sometimes nervous about their manners, but fortunately the chemistry between them makes the game very natural, warm and delicate. They work and feel each other from the very beginning, making you feel like an intruder. <br /> <br /> In your conversations there are excellent comments on many topics that will provoke thought and conversation between you and your partner. I thought it was too deep and too diverse for such young heroes, but I can underestimate their intelligence. Still, it did not spoil the movie. <br /> <br /> The general story is very simple, which I think gives the film a charm and ultimately is the power. <br /> <br /> LINE LINE: The movie's flow is slow. Dialog is fascinating. History is built gently, systematically and in substance. Compilation to the finals is satisfying and ultimately satisfying.
