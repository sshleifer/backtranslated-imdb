I had low expectations for this movie, but I was looking for something unmatched for the evening. I left the theater completely delighted and somewhat surprised. This is a very nice baseball movie with homage and a nice lesson about realizing your dreams. Dennis Quaid performs his role masterfully, and his performance touched me. It is definitely worth a ticket at full price and a few hours of your time!
