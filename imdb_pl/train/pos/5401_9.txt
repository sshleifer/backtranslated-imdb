It is a testimony to Goshy's amazing filming ability that in the same year 1969 he managed to finish both Hitokiri and his wonderful masterpiece, Goyokin. And it is a testimony of how underestimated it is for the general public (compared to the media loved as the great Akira Kurosawa) that both Hitokiri and Goyokin received less than 500 votes between them. <br /> <br /> Shintaro Katsu is Okada Izo: a crazy dog ​​killer, loyal to Tosh's clan and their boss Takechi, played by another steadfast genre, Tatsuya Nakadai. The Tosh clan was part of a larger alliance that supported the Emperor against the waving Shogunate. The historical background is quite accurate - along with the growing political turmoil of Japan between the imperialists and Tokugawa and the Western pressure to end the 300-year-old social and political seclusion. It helps a lot to know about the history of Japan and what eventually led to the Meiji restaurant and the abolition of the Shogunate Tokugawa, but it is not necessary in any way. The film was made mainly for the Japanese audience, which is why certain things are taken for granted, but they also flow very well for the uninitiated. <br /> <br /> As you might expect from Hideo Gosh's film in his golden years (at the end of the 1960s, the visual palette is breathtaking, using the external and internal symbolism hiding behind the visual beauty .The style, however, is never a decorative for Goshy - it is always used in the service of history. <br /> <br /> And when talking about history, Hitokiri is dominated both literally and figuratively by the tortured main character, Izo Okada. Like most heroes of the chambara, Izo finds himself in a moral a double bond torn between giri (commitment) and ninjo (natural impulse) - although it takes some time to realize exactly what its giri is. In the first half of the movie, Izo is trying to get a social promotion. aristocrats - great progress for someone coming from the farmer's environment in the rigid system of social caste in the nineteenth-century j Japo. <br /> <br /> The turning point for Izo is when he realizes the cost of self-sufficiency, loss of identity and consequent loss of himself. It is at this moment that he is undergoing a very symbolic transformation from the famous fighter of the Tosh clan in the "nameless" vagabond without past and future, Torazo the Vagrant. Although it is not technically nameless and is not a wandering species in the form of Yojimbo, the loss of his former self and the rejection of the ego, ambition and self-denial allows Izo to see things as they really are and to redeem themselves. <br /> <br /> Hitokiri ends (which I will not reveal here) in the best way any story can end: both positive and negative with a deeply ironic twist of action that gives Izo the last laugh, the last sardonic note in the face of death.
