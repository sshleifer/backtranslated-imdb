The popular radio storyteller Gabriel Nikt (Robin Williams, a thin and purring, hypnotic tone) does not recognize and does not make friends with a fourteen-year-old boy from Wisconsin named Pete Logand (Rory Culkin) who wrote a book describing the sexual abuse of his parents. For starters, Pete has AIDS, which forces Gabriel even more because his partner Jess (Bobby Cannavale, good) happens to have survived HIV itself. <br /> <br /> He also meets Pete's protector, a woman named Donna (Toni Collette, genius!), and when Gabriel decides he wants to meet and talk to them personally, and goes to Wisconsin, he he discovers some secrets which (naturally) he was not prepared to find. <br /> <br /> Based on the real events that took place in Armistead Maupin (which co-authored the script with Terry Anderson) and directed by Patrick Stetner, this movie moves much faster (90 minutes, maybe a few minutes longer), than it would seem that the movie of this genre will be launched. It's good that it keeps the plot and story in a lean and clean light. It's bad for him that he leaves a lot of holes in the story and does not stitch any openings of the story or story. I'd rather not go into any detail, except that if you're not familiar with Mr. Maupin's works or his personal story, you feel a bit out of the loop. Nonetheless, Williams' performances (I'd love to hear more of his narration, personally), Collette, Cannavale, Culkina and most of the cast (the waitress at the Collete's Donna restaurant often does a great job with a small part she has!) Are at the highest level and the mood here established - namely the cool, lonely dark surfaces of Wisconsin and New York - give this story a wonderful setting. It may have ends that do not bond with each other particularly well, but it's still a pretty convincing story to stick to.
