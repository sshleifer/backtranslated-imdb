I thought that this movie was very well done. Taking place in the mid-1950s, everything seemed accurate to me. It was well manned and reliable. Usually I'm not interested in this type of film, because they just do not have any depth, but I felt that this movie delves into the characters and you can feel how they feel, you really need to know them and take care of them. It led me to my youth and let me mention a more innocent time. This film can be viewed by both men and women and by all ages. After the film ended, I regretted that there was no second part. I wanted to know what had happened to Dani and her family. This film will certainly be a classic. If you have not seen it, try to catch it when it's on TV or rent it ...
