Okay, so the plot is on uncertainty. Yes, all right, so there are some randomly inserted songs and / or dance sequences (for example: Adam's concert and Henri's scenic act). And Leslie Caron can not really, um, you know ... act. <br /> <br /> But in some way, "An American In Paris" manages to go through all this as a refined, top-quality musical - largely based on the incredible dance talent and choreography of Gene Kelly and trucks, which seems to import into every scene with Caron. (It must, because it seems to have ... a problem with emotions.) <br /> <br /> The most successful and technically inspiring number in this musical is of course a 16-minute ballet at the end of cinematography. It's stunningly filmed, and Kelly and Caron dance beautifully. But my favorite number would have to be Kelly singing "I Got Rhythm" with a group of French school children, and then breaking into a series of American dances. It just proves how you do not need special effects when you have a real talent *. <br /> <br /> Not at the level of "classics" from "Singin" In The Rain ", but nice yet high. Worth watching!
