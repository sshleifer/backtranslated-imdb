If you like comic cartoons for adults, such as South Park, this is almost similar to the small adventures of three teenage girls from Bromwell High. Keisha, Natella and Latrina gave exploding sweets and behaved like bitches, I think Keisha is a good leader. There are also small stories with school teachers. There is an idiot director, Mr. Bip, a nervous math teacher and many others. The cast is also fantastic, Gina Yashere Lenny Henry, EastEnders Chrissie Watts, Tracy-Ann Oberman, Doon Mackiean Smack The Pony, Mark Perry Dead Ringers and Nina Conti Blunder. I did not know it came from Canada, but it is very good. Very good!
