If you "get" it is great. <br /> <br /> If it's not, it's decent. <br /> <br /> Please understand that "getting it" does not necessarily mean that you left by shooting at school. The film is so much that sometimes shooting at school becomes insignificant. <br /> <br /> First of all, it is a film about acceptance, both superficially - a traumatic event, but also people who are different for any reason. <br /> <br /> It's also a movie about incurable pain and how different people differ from it. In this case, the contrast between Alice's rage and Deanna's obsession creates the atmosphere of such tangible anxiety that in the middle of the movie we wonder how the director could pull out a happy ending of his hat. Fortunately, the audience is considered human; our intelligence is not insulted by a crazy, unbelievably moralistic ending. <br /> <br /> Besides, I try to keep my head clear in films that are fiction and the like. I must admit, however, that during this movie I cried like a lost little child. There were some things in it that hit * very * near the house and opened old wounds that never healed. But this is not necessarily bad.
