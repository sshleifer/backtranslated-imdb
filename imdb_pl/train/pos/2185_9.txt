Poor Basil Rathbone, an egoistic composer who lost his muse. For some time now he has been pretending to buy texts and music from various sources. The problem is that two sources (Bing Crosby's music) and (Mary Martin's words) meet and fall in love. And then they discover what they are doing. Complications happen, but in the end everything is right. <br /> <br /> Crosby and Martin sing amazingly. Mary signed a Paramount contract, and at the same time doubled up as a regular person at Crosby's Kraft Music Hall Radio Show. For reasons I do not understand, the film audience did not address her, so she returned to Broadway and did One Touch of Venus in 1944 and stayed there. <br /> <br /> Basil Rathbone is doing very well in one of the few times he played a comedy. His ego is being constantly removed by helper Oscar Levant and I am surprised again that they have not made more films together. <br /> <br /> As with most Crosby Paramount vehicles, there are no large production numbers, but I agree with the previous reviewer of the title track performed in the improvised jam session at the pawnshop. Well done to everyone. <br /> <br /> A surprisingly original plot and great entertainment.
