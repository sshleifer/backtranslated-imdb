This game is very addictive, I played it for many hours until late at night, but also the fact that you can not save the game while you are in space, he contributed to this, sometimes I just had to play not to lose any game details . <br /> <br /> So yes, the "Freelancer" is addictive, but also quite flawed. For example, something that worried me very much, that you could not miss any of the cut scenes, so you sometimes had to watch the same few-minute cutting scene every time. A great opportunity for me to multitask to check my email or talk to friends and other things while I had to wait for the cutting scene to end. <br /> <br /> The story starts promising, but the further away, the more funny it is. The game also ends quite abruptly, at least for me. It is obvious that they suggest the upcoming sequel. I do not know if there is a continuation of the sequel right now, but I'm sure that I will probably choose it after release. <br /> <br /> The game is very simple! Even for those who are not familiar with aerial games. Speaking boldly, any fool can play this game. Yes, some levels are quite difficult and require a lot of effort. It took me about 1-2 weeks to complete this game, which may be a bit too short. But thank God for the option for many players! It allows you to continue playing short missions, just as you would for a single player game when you finish it. <br /> <br /> Even if many missions are the same, it just remains cool to be in the middle of mass duels. <br /> <br /> The graphics are good, but there is simply nothing revolutionary or anything. <br /> <br /> An addictive game, but beware of its flaws. <br /> <br /> 7/10
