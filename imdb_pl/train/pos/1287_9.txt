"Let's Bowl" began on the local television in the Twin Cities. It came late at night, something you came across while surfing the canal on your seventh Hamm bottle. <br /> <br /> Even the commercials were produced locally, with Wally in front of Grumpy's Bar, holding the mic and stuttering nervously - "Ahh ... to you, Steve Sedahl." I'm not sure why, but this one always me amused. <br /> <br /> There was a bowling competition under the guise of settling a dispute between two bowlers, but the game was secondary to the commentary and clips. Sedahl played it straight, opposing the bizarre and funny "Wally Hotvedt" by Rich Kronfeld. The most important events included segments such as "How to properly get rid of the old bowling ball" (chuck them to the lake) and "Tips on Dating", where the duet "meets" with several whores, and Wally ends with a bitter complaint "I could have done it myself ! <br /> <br /> Another segment - what the duo did on free days - introduced Steve in a beer that could sprinkle the hovel, jump out of the fridge while Wally tried to climb the cliffs at Taylor's Falls, dressed in tight blue blazer and large headphones. Cheerful! <br /> <br /> Wally's incredible comments on the "league bowlers" and his struggle to apply the right euphemism to different divisions were also events. <br /> <br /> "Let's Bowl" was chosen by Comedy Central and had some good moments, but the network never really knew what to do with it, launching it at the highest viewing times and highlighting "competition" in bowling, which has never been a program point. Fixed ads interrupted the flow, and side characters (Ernie, The Pig, Butch, etc.) were more distracting than anything else. Everything seemed hasty and forced. Even Jon Stewart rejected the "Let's Bowl" in the Daily Show - a disgraceful treatment of the show that deserved a lot better. <br /> <br /> How often "Let's Bowl" come into the world of modern television, a locally tasty mix of comedy genius and total nonsense? Networks have "total nonsense", but it's sad to see them kill such a dark, strange, funny little gem like "Let's Bowl." <br /> <br /> We hope it will be released on DVD.
