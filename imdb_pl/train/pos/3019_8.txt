First of all, I loved göta kanal 1, he had many classic jokes, including this unfortunate guy in a kayak who always seems to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, still behaving the same way in göta kanal 2 movie, but in my opinion hes efficiency it's as much fun as in the first movie, you do not really notice it at all. The thing that made me think about this movie badly, is the choice of a boat, in this movie there are only racing boats, they are certainly fast, but these do not make the waves resemble large floating mansions used in the first movie, I liked it the old ones are better and these new boats make one of the last scenes look funny when a man in a kayak suddenly jumps out of her to avoid the "big waves" from these small fast boats. Really a minus. You must accept that we no longer live in the same Sweden as in 1974. This film also contains some more violence than the first one. Although the film was great in total. I just focused on some inconvenience, which I was disappointed with, but the rest of the movie met my expectations, so check it out! It is worth the money.
