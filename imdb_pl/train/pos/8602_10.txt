One spoke, referring to Nathaniel Hawthorne, that his failures were more interesting than his successes. I believe that the same remark may fit McDonald-Eddy's photos. Especially this one. <br /> <br /> Apparently has many features of a failed movie: it's kitsch, scenario, because of censorship, sounds inconsistent? However, this film also has some good points: good music by Rodgers-Hart ("I married angel", "Tira tira tira la"), good play with E.E.Horton and Reginald Owen. <br /> <br /> In any case, if you dislike it, you can not forget it. This strange film in fact leaves a very strong, phenomenal impression, and it is very likely that you will remember about it for days, or even weeks. Why? In the 1930s and early 1940s, films did not have the same meaning as they do today: they aimed to divert the audience's attention, like a dream, to forget about the difficult reality. Of all the realized dream films, at this time, this film is particularly strong. <br /> <br /> In short, let's say that a better way to appreciate this movie is to watch it without thinking whether it's good or bad. To watch it, if you were watching a dream.
