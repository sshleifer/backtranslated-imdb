This is definitely one of my favorites at American Pie Spin, mainly because most of the other main character (one of the young Stiflers) always seems unrealistic. <br /> <br /> For example, AP: The Naked Miles. You have a teenage guy surrounded by naked college chicks and he's particularly hot on his trail to get rid of his "problem" of virginity and ends up halfway through the act and rides back with his girlfriend, in the mind he gave him a "free pass" for the weekend. I can appreciate the romantic aspect of the whole, but let's be realists; the majority of people who watch these films do not look for a particularly romantic story. <br /> <br /> It seems that the newest part realizes who the audience is and a good old Erik Stifler seems to wake and smell roses and as always Mr. Levenstein gives his "completely natural" humor to the eyebrows equation and scored with this new movie.
