I never took part in the film screening before midnight before the movie "Dick Tracy" appeared. <br /> <br /> I still have a "ticket for a shirt," which I had to set up to be shown here somewhere, and how this shirt, "Dick Tracy" has been stuck with me since then. <br /> <br /> If you've seen a movie, sharp visuals, bright primary colors and strong characters have undoubtedly been engraved in your brain. It's wonderful to see. <br /> <br /> As a director / star / co-writer / producer, Beatty knows what works in the movie and shows it here, taking the well-known American icon and recreating it anew New era. Still in the 1930s, "Tracy" has a timeless quality, like all good movies. I lost sight of how many times I watched "Tracy" and I still catch something new every time I do it. <br /> <br /> The others are at the highest level, starting with Big Boy Caprice Pacino (and reminding them that they can do comedies with the best of them), even the Soulless Mahoney Madonna is a hit that in the right environment can work ( GASP!). <br /> <br /> But there are still topics like family necessity, self-respect, good and evil, even the Machiavellian subjects are examined. Strange for a comic movie, but hey, it works. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, "Dick Tracy" is a classic in itself. Compared to other films from this decade, this is a strong statement. It's a good, powerful movie that does not depend on blood, violence, profanity or nudity. <br /> <br /> There is a lesson to learn here. <br /> <br /> Ten stars. Great Scott!
