one of the funniest mario I've ever played. levels are creative, there are smooth controls and good graphics for your time. there are also lots of crazy bosses and enemies to fight. Sometimes levels become frustrating, and if you skip some hard levels, and yet you have to achieve more in the fight with the boss, it can be annoying. another complaint is the camera angle; Although it works fairly well most of the time, it can be painful in certain situations. if you're a big fan of mario; this one is for you. even if you're not his big fan, I still recommend this one. it's a great game, and getting what you need can take a while, but it's very rewarding. good for playing in short periods of time. it will almost certainly interest you; it definitely keeps me!
