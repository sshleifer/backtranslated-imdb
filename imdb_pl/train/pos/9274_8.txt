Another fantastic film from a country where, for decades of oppression from fundamentalist regimes, there are no problems with creating a passionate subject. Panahi uses a different approach, combining an ironic comedy and an engaging, unprofessional cast. Although he still gives his message about what he thinks is wrongly wrong in his country, he does so without the need for a heavy plot. It is a positive attitude towards the country, in particular its inhabitants, whose people in Iran desperately need it. It's a pity that it will not be released in the country. The insular, paranoid Iranian government claims that this excellent filmmaker succeeds only abroad because it is part of a global conspiracy to shame them. After growing up in the midst of the revolution and observing academicians, artists and educators, he "disappears" in the last 25 years, shows great courage in continuing his work. Realism achieved by shooting the real World Cup qualifier really takes you to the party. The fact that he shot it at 35 mm is amazing, because most of them would try this project only in digital format. It looks fantastic. His insistence on the use of non-professional actors also really works in this film. Great performances all the time. After watching many films showing Iran's problems, as well as news media, we can demonize both people and the government. This film does the opposite. He shows us that they still love the same things, and laughing at themselves and the absurd principles of Sharia law, that perhaps the change for the better is not too far. Some call Panahi a feminist filmmaker, but I think he is fighting for the most oppressed demographics in Iran. Young, independent women.
