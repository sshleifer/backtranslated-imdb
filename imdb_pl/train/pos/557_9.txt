When I went to Dawson City, Yukon from Skagway in Alaska a few years ago and was impressed by the scenery, I can not resist the desire that this film, despite its beautiful color and scenic views, would be shot in a real location. Jasper in the Canadian Rockies is a great place, but it is still not the real place where the movie takes place. When the story moves to Dawson, I feel that Anthony Mann, who has been so good at using the outside, could do the most if he made the movie in the place where he is. James Stewart is here again a man fighting in himself, one side of him does not want to get involved and help people who stand in the way of his earning, and the other side simply can not look away from the murdered people. Ruth Roman is an ambitious woman who does not care who she is walking in, Corinne Calvet is a nice girl. Mann copes well with shootings, but the highlight of the movie is how well he performs in outdoor scenes. He uses outside as much as he can and helps him with winter scenery, dominant whiteness, as in the case of greenery in "The Naked Spur" and bronzes in "The Man From Laramie". Like all Mann-Stewarts, this is a traditional western, with a difference in developing the character of Stewart, which is more complex.
