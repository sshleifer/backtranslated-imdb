I saw it and I like that Melissa is having fun. It was really reliable. My brother-in-law saw this with my sister and I, and when I mentioned to my sister that I forgot he was based on a true story (I saw it a few years ago), he said only because you think it's true for life and both my sister, as I was, anyway, I was wondering if anyone knew what murder it was or who was really involved because I wanted to prove it to him. I love lifelong movies, especially those that are real or only those that teach a good lesson. I thought I saw something about it a week ago, but I do not remember where we would appreciate any help.
