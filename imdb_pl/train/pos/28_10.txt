And here is another proof that we should all worship the Italian Giallo and recognize that it is absolutely the most exceptional species terrifying. "The Red Queen Kills Seven Times" by Emilio Miraglia is a totally mesmerizing sound, original story, stylish production values, charming music, great acting talent and ingenious sequences of blood murders. It is a wonderful giallo (released in the golden year of 1972), which belongs to the top five of every fan of Italian cinema. The story not only presents the average black-and-sex-frustrated killer, but combines good old-fashioned revenge motifs with the macabre myth of the murderous "Red Queen". At an early age, their grandfather tells constantly the fighting siblings Kitty and Evelyn about an amazing woman who kills seven people every 6 years on April 6, of which her sister is the unavoidable last victim. Fourteen years later, Kitty became a successful choreographer of a well-known modeling agency (even sharing a bed with the CEO) when killing began suddenly. Sister Evelyn would be the obvious culprit, but she recently moved to the States ... Or maybe she? Every few minutes she throws at you a complex but fascinating red herring, and the figure of the Red Queen is by far the most fascinating killer in the history of giallo. Her face is never seen, but she wears a blood-red coat and produces the most horrible laughter as soon as she becomes a new victim. It is also not delicate because its victims are barbaric stabbed with daggers, dragged behind cars and even fences! The latter is really one of the biggest (= the most gruesome) acts of violence I have ever seen! What else do you want? Maybe a bit of elegant and tasteful nudity? Great actresses got more than covered, including Barbara Bouchet and young Sybil Danning. Emilio Miraglia is not the most famous director giallo, because he did it only and equally recommended "Night Evelyn came out of the grave", but its influence and meaning should NOT be forgotten.
