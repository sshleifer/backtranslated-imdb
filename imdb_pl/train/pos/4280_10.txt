A group of people travel to Belgrade in a terrible bus run by a drunk conductor and his stupid son (who likes to ride with his eyes closed). Their journey is often interrupted by many funny events that ironically describe the fall of the nation's spirit in 1941 and are so funny that even today they are used as mere jokes. The man who "steals the show" is a peasant with a height of 4 feet and 4 sons, who are almost twice as big as him. In the end, the film has one dramatic turn, and the journey becomes nothing but the song of the swans of a dying country.
