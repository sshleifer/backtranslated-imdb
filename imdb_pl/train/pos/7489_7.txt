This film has many strengths. He has one of the best casts of horror outside of Lugosi-Karloff-Chaney: Lionel Atwill, Fay Wray and Dwight Frye, and the main character Melvin Douglas. It has all the right ingredients: bats, a castle with lots of stone stairs, a mad scientist, townspeople waving torches and hunting vampires, the character "Igor", a beautiful girl, even a stupid Burgomeister. The camera's work with soft focusing is moody and ingenious. There is even good comic relief throughout the script. <br /> <br /> But this is not really a movie about monsters, because nothing is supernatural in "Kleinschloss" ("little castle"). The plot revolves around a mad scientist (nicely played by Atwilla) who values ​​his work more than human life. <br /> <br /> This is not a top-class material, due to the plot's resolution and some embarrassingly bad dialogue for Dwight Frye. But it's worth seeing if you like early horror b / w.
