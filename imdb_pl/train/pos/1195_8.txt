I saw this movie about 20 years ago at a late concert. I still remember the movie, especially the performance of Robert Taylor. I always thought Taylor was underestimated as an actor, because most critics thought he was a solid, almost boring leader, and women just loved watching his films because of his looks. This film, however, proved that it can be an interesting actor. In his long career he did not get enough roles. This is his best performance. He is completely credible in a really sinister role. From what I read, he was a very hardworking and easy-going guy in real life and he never fought enough for this kind of role. He would just do what MGM gave him. This movie proves that he could handle more diverse and difficult roles. Another thing I remember from this movie is how annoying Lloyd Nolan's character was. Nolan was a great actor, but this character really made me worse. The last scene of the movie has stuck in me all these years. This film is definitely worth seeing.
