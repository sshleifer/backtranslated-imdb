Nicolas Martin (Nicmart) quotes from Houston, TX: "Great movie, but DVD" reformatted on TV ", April 8, 2002 - This is a charming and exciting movie. On the other hand, the DVD I bought was "reformatted to match my TV" with Columbia Tristar rubble. There is no excuse for not including the movie in a widescreen format, except that Hollywood treats all movies, such as stupid, rubbish they are so used to the production. br /> <br /> What a pity there is another version. See here for details http://www.dvdbeaver.com/film/DVDCompare2/kingofmasks.htm <br /> <br / > Great performances of the two main actors (The King and Doggie) BTW.
