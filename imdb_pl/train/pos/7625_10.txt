Although Kurt Russell was and probably is the closest person who looks like Elvis in show business, in this movie many things were fake. First, the creators claimed that Elvis opened his famous live performances in 1969 after a 9-year film break, wearing a white jumpsuit made in 1972. They also claimed that he sang "burning love," which he sang for the first time in 1972 and "the wonder of you", which he recorded for the first time in 1970. They also say that he got his first guitar for Christmas, when all Elvis fans know he got it for his birthday. I know all movies based on the past have something fake, but these things are so obvious to people who like Elvis.
