In April 1965, CBS broadcast the first of the monumental television programs of Barbra Streisand. The performance was not only a success, but also won 5 Emmys. This is one of the most memorable moments on the television of the 1960s and (unfortunately) a special television program that they no longer produce. Filled with wonderful songs and a spectacular performance by Barbra, this unique film is a must for any Streisand fan and anyone interested in early television.
