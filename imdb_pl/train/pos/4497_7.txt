I saw only the first part of this series, which debuted in the late 90's and only recently got the chance to see all three parts through Netflix (by the way convenient service). In conclusion, I liked this light series, sometimes with a challenge, mini series. The story of a younger man falling on an older woman seems to be working, and the actors are fine. Yes, it has some love patterns escaping in the rain or at the station, but characters have a chance to be examined, so it does not seem to be tacky, as if it were a Tom Hanks or similar vehicle. Robson Greene, who sometimes reminds me of Scott Bakul separated from birth, does a great job to someone who is in love with his head, and the outflow of lust and rejection throws the series on viewership. Personally, I think that the series could have been done with two episodes, but it is probably a debate. Apparently there is a sequel that should come tomorrow through Netflix.
