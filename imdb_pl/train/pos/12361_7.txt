Bellocchio calls this a mainly political film, a description of the revolutionary movement in Italy, but it seems to be more a metaphor than reality. Well, almost everything in the film seems to be a metaphor. The revolutionaries we see and learn very little about can also be mafiosies. In the company of old and new. <br /> <br /> Papa Andrei, a psychoanalyst, seems to be in favor of ordinary traditional bourgeois values ​​- morally right, unmoved, clean and tidy, thoroughly ritualized. > <br /> Giullia, a revolutionary girl, seems to represent what can happen to someone who needs help very much, but is unable to get the devotion that this commitment requires. (I'm guessing here.) Andrea, an adolescent boy, seems to be the only guy in a movie that's not in some sort of uncouth upatz style. He respects his father, but he is also disobedient. He loves Giullia, or at least we assume that, although he is not mature enough to learn to manage reflexes optimally, he leaves her to appear at school and pass final exams. Its course between these contradictory lifestyles can be described as "media". He is a man in between who knows the importance of gradualism, who can remain calm while they shout about him. <br /> <br /> Most of them are summed up during the oral part of his finals, when he is asked to translate and comment on the Antigone, which contrasts the traditional authority of the gods with the concept of secularity and free will. <br /> <br /> This leads us - through no special course that I am aware - to Marushka Detmars. It brings to mind a New Yorker cartoon from a few years ago. Two hippos are deep in the river, staring at the gazelle drinking from the bank, and one hippopotamus says to the other: "I hate her." She is a good actress. (Let me get out of the way.) But everyone else in the movie. In his speech and speech, he brings with him a rich glow of insanity. It all comes from the actress, not from the director's help. Detmars is not pissed off in the way Catherine DeNeuve went crazy in "Disgust". Walls do not turn into rubber and hands grow. Instead, we see it animated - sometimes animated. And she gives us shocking shocks when her mood suddenly changes and becomes threatening, just like an approaching thunderstorm. <br /> <br /> The critic described her as stuffy, but it probably is not the word he was looking for. She is extremely beautiful with her fluffy brown hair, wide white ready smile, impulsive giggles. And her eyes are like eyes on the paintings on the walls of ancient Egyptian tombs. Sexy parts are quite erotic, not so much because one of them is clear, but because we got to know the characters involved. (It's more interesting to spy on a honey pair next to going to flick.) Actually, there's not too much sex. There is only one scene of simulated intercourse, but the director allows him to play what seems to be in real time. At least in real time for an eighteen-year-old boy. <br /> <br /> The young man who plays Andrea is also okay, which is necessary because the film depends almost exclusively on him and on Giulla. They must wear it and do it. If not for their performances, I'm not sure if it would be as interesting and admirable as it is. It could easily be turned into a rather slow, boring affair. <br /> <br /> Worth
