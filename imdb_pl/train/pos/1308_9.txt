I must say that I really had no idea that I was going to sit down and watch this movie. I guess I had nothing better to do between the class. But once the TV movie interested me. More importantly, Helen Hunt caught my attention. Before the movie, I really was not a big fan of it. Sure, I liked Twister and As Good As It Gets. But something in this movie really did it for me. Now I would see myself as a great fan. This movie has high marks since ... me. Give him a chance, he will not let you down.
