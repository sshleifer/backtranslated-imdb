The beginning of the 1990s was, in my opinion, the culmination of historical drama. Last of the Mohicans, Braveheart, and Rob Roy - all presented a characteristic passion and intensity in their periods. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy was a unique and intriguing taste of time and place rarely represented by the film. It has everything - an interesting story, great acting, amazing dialogue and breathtaking scenery. I was particularly impressed by the real dialogue. I can imagine that people spoke and behaved in the early 18th century. <br /> <br /> Something else surprised me, vulgarity expressed by heroes. I found it to be more revolting and shocking, although often more subtle than most contemporary films. The film had a very racist and sexually charged edge, which was unique and probably very realistic in the context of the era. <br /> <br /> The pace was very tense, with difficulty. There were many intrigues and political threads that complicated things a little, but did not diminish the main plot. <br /> <br /> The action was very well made and thrilling. Something that I will always discover as extraordinary is the fact that during the culmination action movie there is no soundtrack. It creates a very tight, exciting sequence, because we have no hint as to the direction and resolution of the scene. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy will always stay high on my list of favorite movies. I recommend it to everyone.
