I love the TV program. I was hooked for the first time when I saw it. I would like to be there with them. It touches reality when you love someone and you think you want to spend the rest of your life with, then at the turn of events that you meet someone else, and that person is more who you want to be. You are in a situation where you have to choose one or the other. Someone will hurt, you can not stop it. Making a decision is difficult, but do you want to be unhappy when you could be. Why live and live a life that you thought you wanted or thought you were doing right and both are unhappy. The other person will not wait for life, waiting for life. Making decisions that you really want will eventually be better. Getting the most out of what you have is good. Money, cars, houses, etc. ... do not enjoy you, having one person you really want to share with, to share it with.
