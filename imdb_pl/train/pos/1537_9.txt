The film takes place in a small Swedish city, where everyone knows each other. Here Mia visits a parent for his father's birthday, who from time to time has some tragedy, the only question is what will be this year and you will be surprised ... This is an extremely well composed movie, with a story that has a perfect balance of humor and seriousness, which is rare. You are happy, you are hurt and basically everything in between. After all, you can not stop falling in love with Mia (if you're a boy, I think (main actress)) She is a very well-chosen actress, like many other actors / actresses. <br /> <br /> Enjoy
