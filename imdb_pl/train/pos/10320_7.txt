*** Possible spoilery *** <br /> <br /> I recently watched this movie with my 11-year-old son and I was pleased to see that he laughed at the right places and was thrilled by the action sequences. Ron Ely is right as Doc. Cool, calm, almost always under control (and sometimes with a twinkle in the eye). What more could you ask for? I have never read Doc Savage, so I do not know if it's faithful to the source, but I liked bright tone and derring-do. Many people have compared this film to "Raiders of the Lost Ark", which I think is not fair. The budget difference is amazing (the invaders must have at least 10 times the budget). Doc Savage does not have extensive work on the location of Raiders. Special effects are also minimal, but they come to people, the story is great and the mood is just right. Sousa's music is catchy (I love this theme song - every time I watch a movie, I finish humming the subject for many days). The most important thing is the exciting opening sequence, in which the fantastic five and Doc chase the Indian sniper on the roofs of New York and the VERY funny fight sequence between Doc and the Captain of the Sea. Not so good is the villain who sleeps in a huge cot (really!). Overall a great movie to watch on a rainy day. I give it 7 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Doc Savage, Doc Savage ... thanks to you is here!
