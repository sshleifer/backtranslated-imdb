Riding Giants <br /> <br /> This document traces the history of surfing and follows three other well-made and well-recognized films of surfers, Endless Summer Dany Brown, continuation of Endless Summer II by Bruce Brown, son of Dana and Step to Liquid (IMAX) . I saw the first, not others. <br /> <br /> While the surf material is spectacular, I valued the creator's historical perspective the most. He brings us back to the beginnings of sport almost a century ago and shows how he evolved to the present form. This includes extensive interviews with leading personalities and performers on how surfboard designs evolved over time, which beaches in Hawaii and California were most often visited by world-class surfers, and what an amazing adrenaline rush that sport provided. Athletes lived for months on the beaches, surfed from dawn to dusk, they camped on the bunks, they fished for food and the next day they returned to the boards. What an euphoric way to spend a youthful day. <br /> <br /> We see how the media discovered and promoted sport after a slow start. What was the biggest impulse for this sport? Believe it or not, it was a Gidget movie, although I suspect that copyright issues may prevent you from crediting surfing Beachboys songs such as Surfer Girl and Surfing USA. Surfing magazine and Encyclopedia of Surfing (who knew that there is such a volume) are exchanged for their contribution. We also see the comments of the pioneers of this sport, their families and how the present generation benefited from the ideas of creators in the 1960s. One such story is that 40-year-old Laird Hamilton, considered to be today's largest surfer, associated with an earlier surfer, introduced him to his single mother, whom he married before becoming a stepfather. <br /> <br /> Fiery music of contemporary music from all ages is accompanied by stories. Did I whet your appetite? Great. Have a nice ride.
