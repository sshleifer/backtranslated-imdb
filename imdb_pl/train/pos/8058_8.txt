Like many people here, I began to discover my patience during this film. At the end I threw a few tears. <br /> <br /> It seems that most old movies tend to drag on 7/8 length and then catch fire at the end. Older film viewers have learned to spend their free time patiently, reassuring themselves that a large payout is on their way. But this is not quite accurate. You see, for earlier viewers, what is "slow parts" for us was the main part of the story. They watched and found anecdotal and thematic interests. Contemporary viewers, post-Spielberg, are constantly waiting for a small peak every two minutes when they see older films. This is the inflation problem of contemporary movies. Well, it will not happen. There is no need to apologize for these films; you just have to adjust your expectations and your personal rhythm when you watch them. At this point, the difference between Avatar and Informant is like the difference between Euripides and production on the go. Think about it for a minute or two. Do not stretch the obvious, but Euripides still deserves to be heard. <br /> <br /> The "exciting part" for the majority of modern viewers begins with the scene of the IRA tribunal and escalates to the last few minutes, which, if you are even on board or even pay attention to it, will free your heart. This is not a universal abstract appeal for forgiveness; it is the plea of ​​one fool and those who repent of the great hermit, for a little mercy. It's such a personal and embarrassingly naked appeal. Because, after being pissed off at Gypo, irritated at him, thinking that this is the stupidest form of all time, you were finally impressed by the scene of a former Gypo girl, begging another woman to talk to her man to go easy. <br /> <br /> The movie may be sentimental, but sentimentality is not cheap, as some people accuse. It is a matter of life and death, as long as you take seriously the proposal of one's life to the client, sentimentism deny the most serious things. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10. And blame for not being 10 out of 10 is my own, and in some cases yours if you're reading this. We've all asked for more, more, faster, faster, until we can put ourselves in 1935 - really, yesterday, really - as easily as we should be able to.
