A huge, exhausting and passionate summary of American cinema seen through the eyes of Martin Scorcese. Needless to say, it never has a boring moment in its entire 4-hour working time. Many genres, periods and directors are examined, discussed more from the perspective of cinema than the contemporary director. For anyone who is interested in American films or cinema in general. A masterpiece and the best BFI Century of Cinema series. <br /> <br />
