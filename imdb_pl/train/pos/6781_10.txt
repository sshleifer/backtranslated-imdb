When an actor has to play the role of an actor, fiction or facts, the task becomes much more difficult than playing a role. In A Double Life, Ronald Coleman surpassed himself as Anthony John, a tortured double personality. He put all his talent and honesty into this character. Facial expressions, manners, gait and attitude spoke eloquently about what Anthony John experienced while playing Othello on stage. Coleman also did a great job as a Shakespearean actor in these short scenes like Othello, which were part of this jewel of the film. Coleman's closups, when Othello was tortured with doubts about Desdemona's loyalty, was in itself scenes worth watching. Adding to it the desperation on the stage of his character and only someone with the depth of actor's perception of Coleman. It was like watching Spenser Tracy as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, except that this double role was much deeper and poignant. Shelly Winters looked so cute, vulnerable and wonderful at the same time, adding her talent to the movie. It is believed that Ronald Coleman liked his role in this film above all others he played and won an Oscar for Best Actor in 1947. I would watch this movie many times and never get bored.
