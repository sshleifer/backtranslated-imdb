With films such as "Wallace & Gromit" and "Chicken Run" under their supervision, good people from the other side of the pond, Aardman Animation, show us a bit of their twisted humor in the form of "Creature Comforts". <br /> <br /> Coming from a short career start, "Creature Comforts" is a piece of life in which fragments of conversation are removed from the context and passed on to the animal. br /> <br /> Aardman Animation went all over the country, interviewing innocent questions such as "Are you a liar?" and then speed up a bit, asking about their sex life. <br /> <br /> The answers, though they seem boring and mundane, are actually quite funny when you understand that dialogues first appear and animals are added later. <br /> <br /> How many of these animals look like the person making the statement? One of the characters is discussing what she is looking for in a woman: "I like them a little thin." he is an insect, a stick. <br /> <br /> There are two dogs discussing smells and smells, smelling the back of a poodle, talking about different scents of a woman. <br /> <br /> There are two birds in the cage. When the "wife" tells a litany that is her health, her long-suffering husband stands by her, saying nothing. <br /> <br /> Although "Creature Comforts" can find some "legs", it should find a place on TV for those who are tired of ordinary. Although there is more reality show than Carter has liver pills, "Creature Comforts" is one of a kind and definitely worth a look. <br /> <br /> Some of the humor may seem a bit racist, it is a claymation that catches the attention of children (like the old Batman series from the 60s, jokes are subtle enough that children will not get them) and they are jokes for adults.
