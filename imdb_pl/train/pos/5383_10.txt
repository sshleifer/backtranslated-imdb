I thought this movie was perfect because Corrine and Sean are new business beginners. He was full of action and a bit of romance, but there were also some points where Corrine did not speak clearly (when she threatened Sean Gun) and she gritted her teeth ... Maybe she was supposed to do it? I think the roles of Joseph and Sonny were presented very well, and there was an obvious contrast. Also, because I watched the next action star, I'm sure Corrine and Sean did their own tricks that were done very well. I can not wait for the next couple movie, because they make a great band, or maybe a sequel that bets your life - probably called "big" in a big apple "This time it can be about Carmen ... Your life is PERFECT!
