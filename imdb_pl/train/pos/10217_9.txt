The flutter of butterfly wings in the Atlantic can cause a hurricane in the Pacific. According to this theory (somehow related to the Chaos theory, I'm not sure how exactly), any action, no matter how small or insignificant, will start a chain reaction that can lead to big events. This little jewel of the film shows us a series of seemingly unrelated figures, most of them in Paris, whose actions will affect the lives of others. (You can also apply the theory of six degrees of separation.) Each story is an aspect of the jewel that is this movie. Acting is tuned and refined (Audrey Tautou is luminous), stories are credible, humor is just right, and the viewer leaves the theater nodding.
