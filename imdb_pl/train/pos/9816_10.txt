Outrage is a pretty good movie! Robert Culp was very good in the film and he was perfect for the role! It's hard to believe it's a real story, but what can you do? When I watched this, I thought, why do they have to do all these things. It's not right, but they learned the lesson when they chose the wrong man! In any case, if you ever see this movie on TV, watch it because it's good!
