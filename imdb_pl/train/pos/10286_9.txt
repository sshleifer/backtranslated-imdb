This movie is amazing! Although it is funny and funny, it is also deeply deep and opens the eyes. I will watch it again and again. Bruce is a guy who is dissatisfied with his life. He has a job and a life, but this is not what he thinks he will bring him happiness. Bruce is bitter, dissatisfied and offended that his life is not what he imagines. As a result of this state of mind, Bruce loses his job and blames God for everything that he believes is bad in his life. God comes to Bruce and gives him divine powers. Bruce uses these powers to get everything he always wanted. His life is ultimately exactly what he imagined to make him happy ... with one exception. In the process of acquiring everything, she loses one person who really loved him. As the film unfolds, Bruce learns that the real change that must have occurred in his life were not circumstances, but his perception of what was really there. This film was inspiring and deep. If you really pay attention, it forces you to look at your life with deeply humble respect for the fact that most of the time we are much more blessed than we realize. As my wife says, "Since when does anyone know what is needed to make them happy?" And my modest addition: "Let us not lose ourselves and those who count when we try to find out."
