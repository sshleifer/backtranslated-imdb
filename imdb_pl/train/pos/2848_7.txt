New York, I Love You is a collective work of eleven short films, each of which takes about 10 minutes. Shorts do not relate exactly, but they all have something in common, love. Each short movie tells about finding love when it comes to a pair or just two strangers chitchatting. The film features a cast of the band, including Shia LaBeouf, Natalie Portman, Hayden Christensen, Orlando Bloom, Chris Cooper, Andy Garcia, Christina Ricci, Irrfan Khan, Robin Wright Penn, Julie Christie, Ethan Hawke, Bradley Cooper, Rachel Bilson and Anton Yelchin . With such a great cast and such an interesting assumption, I expected an amazing movie; the problem is New York I Love You does not add up. It remains the sum of its parts. Some segments are fun, original and interesting, but others are so insignificant (segments Orlando Bloom / Christina Ricci and Ethan Hawke / Maggie Q) that it's scary. The film is definitely uneven and has a very experimental tone. Storytelling seems to be something that several movie students can combine. Having said that, the film also has some great moments, one of the best is the segment of the old couple, played by Eli Wallach and Cloris Leachman, who walk around Brooklyn on the 67th wedding anniversary. And such moments that made me a spectator, I would like the film to be more consistent, because there is a lot of potential here. But how the whole story is unsatisfactory, for me photos and soundtrack saved everything. The editing was excellent, the way the film was made was impressive, and the ethereal soundtrack could not be more appropriate. In the end, New York I Love You feels like an experimental movie, and as in most experiments there are ups and downs. This is how the film looks like as a whole, which will determine whether it pleases it or not. It may be worth for some and a waste of time for others. <br /> <br /> 7/10
