Very Slight Spoiler <br /> <br /> This film (although it is only on TV) is absolutely perfect. I did not pay attention to differences in appearance and accents, so I can not comment on that. Acting in it was so good that I had to pinch myself and say, "Remember, it's just a movie, it's NOT CLOSED." As I sat and listened to the conversation between Harris and Quinn, I knew exactly what John and Paul were talking about if they had this meeting. John's handwritten comments and burns were consistent with his character (especially in the restaurant!), Just like his depression, while Paul was very relaxed and relaxed. Both actors did a great job, and I was delighted to see this movie. This is a wicked experience for every Beatles fan. And get ready for some surprises!
