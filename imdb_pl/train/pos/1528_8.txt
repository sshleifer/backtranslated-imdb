I am a writer working at home, and Diagnosis Murder is my companion in a lunch break - good, pure fun, good humor and nostalgia for the days of Dick van Dyke's show. How all we were innocent (and how innocent the Diagnosis Murder is). I especially liked the episodes with other nostalgic characters, such as Joe Mannix. Bad people are always caught, good guys are continuing. The stars are clearly happy and have the ball without taking themselves too seriously. <br /> <br /> One beef: why so many female villains, or at least bitches? Amanda was too stunned. It is hard to imagine that she would really do something as gruesome as the autopsy. <br /> <br /> I hope we have not seen the last of Dick Van Dyke and his family on our screens, especially. at lunch !!
