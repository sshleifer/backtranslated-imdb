May and her husband visit children and grandchildren. The visit is awkward because grandchildren and "children" really do not know each other as much as one would expect. There is no heat that should be there. After lunch, Maya's husband says he does not feel well, blames him for cooking his daughter and says irritably that he wants to come home. He dies that night. <br /> <br /> May, now a widow, is missing. Apparently she did not have a passionate marriage or a very interesting one, but she had a purpose. She had someone who needed her, and even though her own needs had been unsatisfied for years, she had something to do with her days. <br /> <br /> Depressed and unmotivated. He intends to stay with his daughter, Paula, who soon after her mother's arrival, informs her mother that she never felt that her mother gave a lot at all. He is letting out of anger at the lack of maternal care. May seems disarmed and surprised, but it seems that there is no energy or desire to really fix it. "I am your mother and I love you." What does he really say? (Too many times I have heard it from my mother and I do not know what it means.) Paula is a bit (well, more than a bit) neurotic. Both women are needy, although they show it quite differently. <br /> <br /> Paula was associated with a friend of her son, Darren, who is a golden handler working in a house belonging to her son. While Paula works during the day, May starts talks and dinners with Darren. Darren is a married man who stayed with his wife because of an autistic son, Nicky, but apparently he does not live at home with his wife. <br /> <br /> May gets dragged by Darren because he is male and likes the connection that they seem to have. Darren is attracted to May because he offers a kind of peace and understanding that he does not receive from other women in his life. (He is too interested in the money that May may give him "to run away from everything", although apparently she is not interested in her desire to join him on such a trip during the day, and May enjoys being a woman she has not known for years or she never expected her to find out again, because her daughter Paula often told her that she would leave Darren's marriage, it becomes part of the May rationalization which she does is fine. <br /> <br /> In Paula's writing group, May is introduced, forced to meet with a widower he is not dragged into, with an older man who is apparently barely able to act, and it is really painful and disturbing because we see complete disgust on her face Maya, when he endures a one-off ghostly connection. <br /> <br /> Finally Paula discovers with some very graphic sketches made by her mother that really was her mother and Darren doing sex. <br /> <br /> This film will certainly look at many people in many ways. Sympathies will be divided. At some point, while writing through Paula, May reveals in a short essay that she felt like she hated her children until the end of the day, and after sleep she went to the pubs, making sure her husband would come home sooner. <br /> <br /> Apparently, a good mother does not think about leaving children alone when she goes to a local pub. Maybe he also revealed himself in the movie earlier that her husband did not like having friends, so she did not have any. She did what he wanted her to do. She was unhappy, but she endured it because, she said, it was easier. So, while May was not the best mother, for those who were willing to have sympathy for her, you would see May's actions as an act of a woman who wants to be sexually and live "in a few minutes" in her life. A woman who simply wanted someone to listen to her, she met her as a human being, she had a friend and a mistress. <br /> <br /> Paula, though neurotic and unhappy, may have become this way because of distant parents who raised her. It is certainly not difficult to understand why Paula feels completely betrayed by her mother. <br /> <br /> This is a well made film, with more complexity than I mentioned, and certainly one that will leave the viewer with many, perhaps contradictory, reactions. A film worth discussing and discussing, and above all worth seeing. <br /> <br /> The movie leaves us with horror and fear of lonely life. Regardless of who is considered "right" or who is considered "improper" by each viewer, this subject of old age and loneliness, causing a sense of fear in most of us, is inevitable.
