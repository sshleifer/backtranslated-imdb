I love this program, it will definitely be a winner. Jessica Alba is doing a great job, it's about time we had a great girl who is not a cutesy. The cast is great, and all the episodes have good storylines. Everything is well laid out and thought out. It had to take a while to get him together because it was not someone who hurried, he just hit something together. It's a great show at all.
