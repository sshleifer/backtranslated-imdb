She is not Michael Jordan. <br /> <br /> Think about all the great NBA players whose career light has been dimmed for no good reason other than the time of their birth. Their names can be as easily distracted from public mouths as the Russell, Cousy, Byrd, Magic, McHale, Oscar, and Wilt lists; but the volume is slightly reduced, for Stockton and Malone, Charles, Patrick and all the other great players who have always lost their headers to Michael. <br /> <br /> I saw that it was written that Gretchen Mol's career was in the wake of the cover article in Vanity Fair's 1998 issue, which provided for the inevitable superstitions for Mrs. Mol. Later it was said that it was exaggerated. I do not agree. <br /> <br /> I still remember that for some time after I saw "The Devil's Advocate" in 1997 or 1998, I would have mistaken which actress Mary Ann Lomax played. Is it Mol or Theron? Oh yes! Charlize Theron was one of "2 days in the valley" and "Mighty Joe Young", and Gretchen Mol was in "Donnie Brasco", "Celebrity" and "Rounders". <br /> <br /> Until I saw "The Thirteenth Floor" (Mol) and "Sweet November" (Theron), I almost straightened them, but I still put them in the same drawer. Both of them were very talented, they had sweet faces, similar body types, short blond hair, and so on. <br /> <br /> Theron, however, was offered more work. I loved her as Sara Deever and as Adele Invergordon her beauty was intimidating. <br /> <br /> In 2003, "Monster" was released and from that moment until the handover of the Oscar itself, all filmmakers knew who the award for the best actress ". And deservedly! Theron was Aileen Wuornos. The only way to better understand what made Aeen Wuornos a real tick would somehow reproduce the digital video trapped in Selby's head. And too big talent that will make her physically unattractive! Unheard of! <br /> <br /> Then in 2005, "Notorious Bettie Page" was released. The performance of Mol was extraordinary. Maybe she was standing in the shadow of Mrs. Theron. It was like a ballroom for the victory ceremony of a defeated presidential candidate, nobody came and nobody cared. It was seen as the continuation of an old tale, once a promising actress with a declining career that records the role in the movie "B". Ho hum! No no no! Wrong! Regardless of what you think about the film (and I like movies about the fifties), if you give this movie, you'll miss one of the better performances of the year. Mrs. Moll was just as Bettie as Mrs. Theron was Aileen. Unfortunately, Aileen, for the film audience, is a more likeable character. For some reason, an amoral, sociopathic killer is less embarrassing to us than a na√Øve, unsophisticated, uninhibited, religious girl, whose greatest crime was a completely trusting and totally unveiled life. Bettie Page was one of the icons of the 1950s. Her photos and videos are never sexual, never pornographic, but they almost represent the caricature of all perverse things. There was no sense of realism, just a parody. Mrs. Moll captured the essence of the character. She gained 20 pounds to add some fascination to her normally slim figure, and when she posed for different photographers in the movie, her body was Bettie. Its full frontal lack of any inhibitions exactly matches everything that has been published about Bettie. Filminess usually presents eroticism or sexuality. This film is about innocence. Seeing Gretchen / Bettie nude did not make me want to jump, but instilled a desire to protect her from all the horrors that people can do. If you submit this film, you will lose one of the best performances of recent years. By the way, a shame for MPAA for granting this assessment R.
