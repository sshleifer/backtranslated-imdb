I do not know why he apparently does not play in Peoria, but it is a very funny, clever British comedy. It's set at the end of the 'swinging sixties'. Peter Sellars is fantastic as a wealthy, forty-something womanizer. The delightfully delightful Goldie Hawn, who plays a 19-year-old American girl in London, is initially the "catch of the day" of Sellars. But a television critic from the television industry can not refrain from falling into a stunned American blonde. > It's a great movie, and the last line is the best gag. <br /> <br /> Try it, you'll like it.
