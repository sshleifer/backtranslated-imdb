Noir classic Otto Premingera works almost like a LAURA flip-side ... while this movie was brilliant and featured high-end Clifton Webb, this movie is much more entertaining. Dana Andrews is less than a good policeman who accidentally kills a man just to potentially pin him to the father of the girl he loves. Preminger keeps things moving on a vigorous clip, making logic errors easily overlooked. Andrews is fine (much less wooden than in the past), and the stunningly beautiful Gene Tierney is stunningly beautiful! Creepy Craig Stevens plays an unlucky victim. WHERE SIDEWALK is a must and a great companion for the equally ghoulish WHIRLPOOL Preminger (also with Tierney).
