This film seems to be well remembered when Tom and Jerry have signed a peace treaty. Things are idyllic for a while, but, as you might expect, they are sour. Probably the most memorable moment was the endless battle with the pipe, frying pan and baseball bat, which both dog and Butch enter at the beginning and at the end of the short. I liked one group and you should try to catch him at Cartoon Network.
