You will notice that the stars have given me this GREAT movie that "... before you see it for the first time." I have never heard about this film before and it happened to me only because this week (and last) it was very slow lending (not much was coming). I'm not sure how this movie passed me. I also love Lucy Liu and Jeremy Northam. Despite this. <br /> <br /> This video is a great example of what to do if you do not have a large budget. He had the right amount of plot and dialog to be very interesting and keep the viewer in the dark; just enough. The whole movie is you (viewer) trying to understand the threads of many twists and turns. I would give this film 10/10, but some of the photos were quite fake. I do not consider it to be too much of this movie, but I do not think it deserves a perfect result. <br /> <br /> Lucy Liu is beautiful and mysterious (as always). I think she is underestimated as a serious talent. Regardless of her beauty (which is difficult), she really takes her roles seriously and does not rest on her appearance to lead her through scenes of sophisticated emotions. And it may seem cold and even lifeless if you need it. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Northam is doing very well at first, as a pretty scientific corporate rat who wants to go through every maze to check. However, as it changes throughout the movie, it's like night and day. I know that some fans of Clive Owen, Jude Law or other people who want to become the next James Bond will hate me for that, but Northam would fit in with this bill. He is polite and cultivated. He has a great attitude and Bond's voice. I think that he too can be cold if the situation requires it, and also down to Earth. <br /> <br /> A great movie and definitely this movie-buff advises you to be seen at least once if you like corporate spy movies.
