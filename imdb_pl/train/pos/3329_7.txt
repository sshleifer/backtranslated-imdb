The only reason I saw this movie was Jimmy Fallon, whom I love from the 9th grade, which was his first year at SNL. I am an avid Yankees fan and have not found a painful movie for the last 15 minutes when they start showing ALCS video clips. I had to cover my ears and make quiet sounds, so I would not have to hear what you can not hear, but otherwise it was perfectly bearable. <br /> <br /> I thought Jimmy played very well, the character was supposed to be nervous and weird, and he's a nervous and weird guy. I know it can not be an Oscar-winning episode, but the movie is just a light, fun, romantic comedy that's right for both women and men. <br /> <br /> Jimmy and Drew worked well together, and they had much better chemistry on the camera than other actors in the past. (Ed Burns and Angelina Jolie in this stupid movie? What?) I think Jimmy has a positive career ahead of him and thank God, because Taxi could have killed him. I think Fever Pitch will help him a lot. Everyone must stop being so critical of their acting ability because they are just starting to film. I imagine that it must be difficult, and if you look at any of the other great actors of our time (Tom Hanks, Russell Crowe, etc.), you'll see that they started with a few flaps. Busom friends? Australian soap operas? I wish Jimmy a successful career on the screen. I never wanted him to leave SNL, but what can you do?
