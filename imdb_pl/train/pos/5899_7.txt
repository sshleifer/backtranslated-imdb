A lovely idea ... saleswoman Linda Smith (Yolande Donlan) inherits the tiny little town of Lampidorra. This country, which was not even in North America, became the 49th state ... (of course, there were only 48 states at that time, because it was created in 1952). Linda travels to the country we have inherited, and we follow her when she tries to figure out what to do with this strange country and even weird people. At some point, she sings a song that she claims comes from her Navajo people, and from there it gets stupid ... though the heavy lipstick of Yolande Donlan and the omnipresent smile are never mixed up or changed. There are other songs scattered throughout the city as residents sing to greet the new princess. Filmed in a glorious British version of technology or a similar equivalent, the only great name here is Dirk Bogarde as a British subject, Tony Craig, a cheese seller. Bogarde made a big plus in the British film industry after serving in the war, and even received the title of noble from QE II. Craig and the "new princess" are falling into each other, and their adventures are becoming more and more intertwined, and Lampidorry's financial problems are worsening ... A funny farce ... like the Marx brothers' movie. Also notice that Donlan later married Val Guest, the writer and director of our small project, and remained married for 50 years! The guest was better known for writing and directing science fiction movies in the United Kingdom and the United States.
