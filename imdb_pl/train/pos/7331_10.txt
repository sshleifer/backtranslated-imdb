In times of magic, barbarians and demons abound in a diabolical tyrant named Nekhron and his mother, Queen Juliana, who lives in the kingdom of ice and wants to conquer the region of fire ruled by King Jerol, but when his beautiful daughter Princess Teegra was kidnapped by Nekhron's fighters, a warrior of Larn must protect her and must defeat Nekhron against taking over the world and the kingdom with the help of an avenger named Darkwolf. <br /> <br /> A nicely made and perfect underestimated animated fantasy epic that combines live actors with animation animated over them (rotoscoping), this is the second best Ralph Bakshi movie only with "American Pop" number one, and "Heavy" Traffic "third and" Wizards "fourth. It is certainly better than its "Cool World" or "Lord of the Rings", the graphics were designed by the famous artist Frank Farzetta, and the animation has good colors and there is also a hottie for boys. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film to fans of fantasy and animation around the world, especially the new DVD with limited edition of 2 discs from the Blue Underground. <br /> <br /> Also recommended: "Black cauldron", "Dark crystal", "Conan Barbarian", "Wizard of Oz", "Rock and Rule", "Wizards", "Heavy Metal", "Starchaser" : Legend of Orin "," Fantastic Planet "," Princess Mononoke "," Nausicca: Valley of the Wind "," Conan The Destroyer "," Willow "," The Princess Bride "," Lord of the Rings (1978) " "The Sword in The Stone", "Excalibur", "Army of Darkness", "Krull", Dragonheart "," King Arthur "," The Hobbit "," Return of the King (1980) "," Conquest ", "American Pop", "Jason and The Argonauts", "Clash of the Titans", "The Last Unicorn", "Secret of NIMH", "Flight of Dragons", "Hercules (Disney)", "Legend", "Chronicles of Narnia "," Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire ".
