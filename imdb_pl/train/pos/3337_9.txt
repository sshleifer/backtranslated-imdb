This is a great movie for real romantics and sports enthusiasts. <br /> <br /> Drew Barrymore is at the best of this film. As Drew's fan it was very nice to see her glow after a few flaps. I had doubts about Jimmy Fallon, but he completely got free when Ben comical, crazy sport. The comedy in this film is great, there were some laughter of loud moments. <br /> <br /> Their first date began to be rocky when he appeared in her apartment with flowers and she was sick with stomach from eating a new place earlier that day. Instead of going away, she helps her take care of her, help her change into pajamas, and then cleans up vomit in the toilet and bathroom, telling her later that she was "very similar to your lady ... without cuts." Everything is fine between Ben and Lindsay throughout the winter, but then the baseball season begins. Lindsay is beginning to realize how obsessed Ben and Red Sox are and why this seemingly great guy is still single. He tries to disregard and think about it as a good thing because he has a busy schedule and does not feel guilty for extra hours when he's in games. He even buys all books about The Red Sox, including one about the "Bambino Curse". <br /> <br /> Everything is going well until Lindsay has a false alarm that missed her period. This makes them both aware of how serious they are and is starting to wonder if he is the person he wants to be with. A very moving part of the movie is after she told him she got her period, and shows him the sad deposition of the Red Sox children's shirt he had bought in case she was pregnant. <br /> <br /> Finally, Ben tries to show her how important she is and decides to go to a friend's birthday party when she said, "I had to check my calendar, and when I saw that there was a Red Sox / Yankee game, I knew that I will be going. " After the party Ben tells her that it was "the best night in his life" Shortly after he got a call from his buddy who went to the game, he gave up the party and told him: "THE BEST GAME EVER !!!" Ben freaks about the fact that I miss Lindsay and it ends up that it really hurts when she says: "A few minutes ago you said it was the best night of your life," he says, "it was a few minutes ago." <br /> <br / > They split up for a moment, realize how immature his obsession is and decides to sell his season tickets, which he inherited from his uncle, because if he did not, "remind him too much about what he gave up for them". Lindsay learns through a friend and decides to stop him from realizing that he is doing it for her. It ends very sweetly showing how his childhood love for baseball has been obscured by all new deeper love, Lindsay. They still go to games and even participate in the final World Series and St. Louis. 2 thumbs up !!
