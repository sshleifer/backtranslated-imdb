I thought that King Solomon's Mines were beautifully made. My only reservation was Alison Doody. Her acting was great, but her make-up and hair were not from that period and it always seemed that she was out of place with other actors. I thought Patrick Swayze was an excellent choice for Alan Quatermain. It was nice to see an experienced actor in this role after watching the film after the movie with fair-haired light-skinned actors such as Val Kilmer, Brad Pitt, etc. He was an excellent choice and I enjoyed every minute of the movie. This version can not be compared with the version from the 1950s with Stewart Grainger. It was a movie on a big screen, not a TV movie. I thought both Quatermains are reliable, but the two media must be separated. I can not wait to see it again and I hope Patrick Swayze will look again at this type of role.
