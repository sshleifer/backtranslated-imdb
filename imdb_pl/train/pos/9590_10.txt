The document begins in 1986 in New York, where black and Spanish drag queens hold "balls". This is where they dress, how they like it, they spread their stuff in front of the audience and are voted on. We meet many members and see how everyone is holding each other and supporting each other. As one man says to another: "You have three strikes against you - you are black, gay and drag queen." These are people who (unfortunately) are not accepted in society - only at balls. There they can be who and whoever they want and be accepted. Then the film goes to three years later (1989) and you see how it changed (tragically for some). <br /> <br /> It sounds depressing, but it is not. Most people interviewed are really very funny and have a lot of humor in their situations. They are aware of their position in society and accept them with humor - as they should. We learn that everyone lives in "homes" run by different "mothers" and they all help each other. The sense of community in this film is fascinating. <br /> <br /> When the movie was released in 1990, it was controversial - and it was a huge hit. He won the best documentary award at many festivals - but he was never even nominated for an Oscar. The reason was "Black and Spanish drag queens are not Academy materials." Fascinating, right? Homophobia and racism together. <br /> <br /> Seen today is still a great movie - and a piece from the era. It's not like that - NY, which they show, no longer exists. The balls are still kept, but not in the spirit we see here. Dragging has also become more "accepted" in society (for better or worse). And I heard that the houses also disappeared. It's a bit sad. I would like to know where these characters are now - I know that two died of AIDS, but I have no idea about others. And what kind of DID met the 13-year-old and 15-year-old? <br /> <br /> Still, it is a unique document - fascinating, fun and thrilling. You must see all the way! Strong 10. Where is the DVD?
