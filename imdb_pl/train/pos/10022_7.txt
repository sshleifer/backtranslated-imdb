Aro Tolbukhin burned seven people alive in a mission in Guatemala in the '70s. He also stated that he murdered another 16 people (he used to kill pregnant women and then set them on fire). <br /> <br /> This film is a documentary that depicts the personality of Aro through several interviews with people who met him and through scenes played by actors based on facts. <br /> <br /> "Aro Tolbukhin" is a serious job, so analytical, it is not morbid at all. Such a horrifying testimony of how some childhood traumas can turn a man into a monster. <br /> <br /> * My rating: 7/10
