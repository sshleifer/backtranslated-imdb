I saw this film at the International Documentary Film Festival in Amsterdam and I had the honor to meet both directors and Tobias Schneebaum, all of whom are alive and sincere New Yorkers. The title of the movie in Amsterdam was "Keep the river on the right", which makes the sensational aspect of cannibalism a bit less visible. Equally important was the love and gay relationship that Tobias Schneebaum had with the members of the groups he studied as an anthropologist. His meeting at the age of nearly 80 years and the inevitable departure were very moving. I can only highly recommend this film to anyone who is looking for a moving story that is different than walking.
