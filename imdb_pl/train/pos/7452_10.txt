I am a big fan of the Faerie Tale Theater and I've seen them all and this is one of the best! It's fun, romantic and classic. I recommend it for all ages. It is great for young children because it is good, Cinderella and great for adults and teenagers because it is fun and not over. I watched it when I was little, and I'm still watching it. He has great lines that my family and I quote all the time. Acting is great and never gets old. If you like fairy tales and romances, you'll love it. I have watched many films about Cinderella in my time and this is the best of them. (I'm sorry, Disney) I highly recommend this movie and all Faerie Tale Theater shows. They are all attractive to all ages and all are unique and very fun.
