Judging the film is completely pointless. It's as if you're condemning (or praising) the new born for your future life. Instead, look at it as a powerful meditation on what could have been and what has been in the last 100+ years. One hundred and eight years of cinematography: what happened to the baby? I like to think about what would happen (creatively) if Europe was not twice interrupted (devastated) by the great wars of the 20th century. On its ruins rose a fake neon castle, not a creative and reactionary circus called Hollywood. Before 1914, the French, Italian and Scandinavian cinemas were leaders in both financial and, of course, creative terms. In particular, the French film has already made several very original and creative paths that could (if not be interrupted) possibly change the average story in an unimaginable way. One wonders what the story of the film would look like if it were not strangled and choked by a merchant and cheap political program from over 80-year-old Hollywood, what Chekhov could describe as a stench of greed and harlotry ... Can that at least realize La Sortie as a key (or at least one of them) to the "Kingdom". So the birthplace of the Cinema: Lumiere Brothers Factory, Lyon, France Date: March 19, 1895 (In summer 1895. There is also shooting with replicas of reels, so if you notice summer lights and light clothing for workers: it was the version shown VERY FIRST PEOPLE WHO HAVE PERFORMED MOVEMENTS. * Louis Lumiere: creative ideas, photos, directing was Louis' property, because Auguste took care of the rest (money), camera (= le Cinematograph) and cameramen (le operator) only a little fifty seconds to get something happened! * Apparently Le Institute Lumiere managed to save about 1,500 of these first films made mainly by the diligent brigade of traveling operators Loumiere crossing the globe *** So all the stars in the starry sky and a minute of silence for perhaps the most magical invention in human history (so far).
