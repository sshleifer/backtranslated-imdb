It turned out that it is a classic production with a low budget. The variety of characters is amazing, from dwarves with axes to ghouls 7 feet! I liked the relationship between the lecturers, not too sentimental, but romantic enough to keep me interested. I also liked the combination of humor (which can be very easy to spoil, too much / too little), which meant that it did not become too dark or too tricky. It was a great step forward in relation to the other efforts of Eaves, Hellbreeder and Sanitarium, in terms of plot and production. They have a great website that is worth checking out. I can not wait for Bane, if the level of improvement persists, it should be fantastic.
