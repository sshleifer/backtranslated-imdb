One thing I can say about this movie is long, VERY LONG! I recently bought this movie a few months ago, seeing that a new version has appeared. I was pleased to discover that it was created in 1978, because the 1970s (although I have never lived in them) is actually one of my favorite decades, especially for music! When I watched this movie, the story was really very good at first, but then after about 50 minutes it started to be very boring and repetitive. I admit that the animation made an impression on me! it was nothing I had ever seen and it was pretty nice to see. but the movie could have been a bit better, it could have more conversations and stories than just 15 to 20 minute scenes that just strangely fought. then for the last 5 or 10 minutes the movie got up and it was good again, but it ended unexpectedly. in my opinion, I thought it was VERY long. I know his 13 minutes in 2 hours, and it's still long on the cartoon, but since it was boring for most of the movie, it made it seem like it was 4 hours !!!! but overall it is a good movie, I think, and I will watch it again on one of those "nothing to do". I will see a new one and I hope it is better!
