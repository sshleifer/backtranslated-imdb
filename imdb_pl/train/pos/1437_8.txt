We often watch films about unwanted events in politics, but I still recommend City Hall. In the role in which he was born, Al Pacino appears as the mayor of New York who is dealing with shooting the boy. But it turns out that nothing he does will have no effect. In this film, characters are as rough as we would expect from any political scandal. No matter how much you trust a politician, you may have doubts after watching this movie. <br /> <br /> I understand that I can not mention any specific example of something similar to what this movie presents, but that is not the point. If we had the idealistic impression of those who are at the top, this film rejects such ideas. Certainly one that I encourage you to see. Also starring John Cusack, Bridget Fonda, Danny Aiello, Anthony Franciosa and David Paymer.
