"Someones at the Door". OHHH, How much I miss this show ... but we are lucky to have an "Invasion" now. Thank you, Shawn Cassidy. American gothic, he had it all. If I had to choose one thing that I liked the most about the show, it must be her "unpredictable plot". The favorite actor was Lucas Black .. I love this southern accent. I bought the DVD as soon as possible, and my children are also fans. There are several hot, steamy scenes. Some are also devilish. So if you're watching kiddos, you can edit (fastforward / skip). He has humor, at the level of Joss Wheedon, who is missing so many shows. Adult prank and adult situation that are supported by finese. There are a few additions to the DVD, but it is a pity that there are no more. If you want to be delighted and enjoy the wonderful show, come and watch "American Gothic"!
