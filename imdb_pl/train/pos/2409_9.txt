This film has problems with its presentation, it may even be offensive to people who seek temporal and cultural fidelity, but it challenges the observer to think about various issues. One of them is the character and nature of the relationship between Jesus and Judas. Another is the historical nature of the Bible and faith. Third, it is the humanity of Jesus. The tension of the Christ-traitor relationship is developed and maintained by the film. Judas's passion is presented as a darker parallel to the passion of Christ. When Judas takes his life, the viewer may feel anxiety. Peter's denial and guilt, however moving, are not as strongly portrayed as Judas's drama. Chris Sarandon offers an innovative and provocative Christ, be it credible or not. I would like to find this movie on DVD or even VHS, for use in research or discussion groups.
