As a person who sought existence as a "professional" person with income supported by a bachelor of chemistry and MS in business management, my mental health was always spasmodically maintained in external leniencies in more artistic matters. My postgraduate studies were always emotionally and spiritually supported by the interest in photography, stained glass, ceramics, forging / welding metals and artistic drawing, which also included silkscreen. <br /> <br /> I also stay healthy with running, walking and recently, walking to remote places in California and nearby states such as Utah, Arizona and Nevada. Jogging, walking and hiking are approaching the earth with time to stop, watch and listen, and photograph or record sounds. <br /> <br /> Against this background I was obsessed with RIVER AND LIQUIDS. I was equally impressed with the documentary content of artist Andy Goldsworthy, as well as the skill and smoothness of the director / operator Thomas Riedelsheimer. Actually, I could not separate Goldsworthy's art from the Riedelsheimer's camera path. <br /> <br /> Wonderful. Great. Great.
