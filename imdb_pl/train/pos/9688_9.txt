I am cautious about movies about talking about animals. For every wonderful one, like Babe, you get as poor a person as the terrifying remake of Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey. Or in the case of cats and dogs, you have a great idea for a movie that does not meet your potential. When I heard about Paulie, setting up a wise parrot did not fill me with certainty. But the film was a nice surprise. And he manages to sneak into your heart without your knowledge. <br /> <br /> Russian caretaker, Misha Vilyenkov (Tony Shaloub) gets a job in a research laboratory. One day he hears singing coming from the basement. And when he's researching, he finds a parrot in a cage, singing her little heart. Misha is fascinated by the bird, especially when it turns out that the parrot does not just sing, it can speak. And there are also a few sentences. It is a parrot with whom you can start a conversation. <br /> <br /> The parrot is called Paulie (voice of Jay Mohr) and he recognizes the confrere in Misha. Wondering how this world for a wise bird landed in a dusty basement, Misha convinces Pauli to tell him his life story. It all began when he was a child and under the care of Marie, a five-year-old girl with stuttering. They both became birds of feathers (OK, bad pun!). <br /> <br /> When Marie's parents worried about her close friendship with the bird, they considered sending him away. In the end, they did it after Marie almost hurt her fall after learning Paulie. Desperately wishing to connect with her, Paulie begins a long journey through America, which includes a diverse number of new owners, flying long distances and even ending behind bars. From the cage that is! <br /> <br /> Paulie was one of the many talking animal movies released by DreamWorks in the late 90s. And although it did not give the same recognition and success to the box office Babe, Paulie is successful on several levels and occasionally is the work of striking intelligence. <br /> <br /> Jay Stand in the style of Stand-up acting fits well with Pauli's role. He never plays the part too happy, even if he is a bit clever Aleck. Paulie is global, but she's also naive in her own way. <br /> <br /> Because he lived with Marie in a rather sheltered life, when he was taken, he must look after himself for the first time. And when he falls into the hands of the various owners, he promises Paulie that he will connect him with Marie, what he believes. Only for those promises that will be broken. <br /> <br /> Paulie is a bit episodic though. He follows the eclectic people with whom Paulie ends, and how slowly he approaches Marie. First, he goes to the pawnshop, where he is adopted by Ivy (Gena Rowlands), a kind woman who teaches him the importance of manners. He sympathizes with Pauli's situation and leads the RV around America to find Marie. <br /> <br /> Paulie is sometimes a very moving movie. His scenes from Ivy are among the best. A wonderful moment for Paulie sitting on her shoulder, singing the numbers of Tom Jones. The way in which it instills the need for hope is great, and part of the dialogue is quite well written, and even inclines to think: <br /> <br /> "There are things in life that you postpone, because you think that I will do later, but Ivy taught me that you must live as if it were not later. <br /> <br /> The scene where Ivy leaves on his way, leaving Pauli alone, is a very heartbreaking moment. And the sequence in which you gather the courage to fly through the Grand Canyon for the first time, majestically ascending, is such a beautifully composed scene that it stays with you for hours after the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Despite the occasional sad moment, there is a lot of laughter. Paulie falls in with a group of parrots in an open-air Spanish restaurant. Animatronic effects are really great, because four birds perform a perfectly choreographic dance number. And Paulie is having an affair. Which is interrupted when it falls into a small thief (also played by Mohr). This may be the only complaint I have. As soon as you feel comfortable in one situation, the movie takes Paulie to another. <br /> <br /> The scene in which Paulie is taught to steal money from ATMs is fun, but also a bit worrying. I'm amazed that DreamWorks was given the chance to include such a scene in a children's film. And Paulie's robbery of diamonds is very impossible. He was caught red-handed and sent to the laboratory for animal tests, where he remained so far. <br /> <br /> The story finally comes full circle in the laboratory, where Misha swears to help Paulie. Of course they find Marie. But the last revelation is the scene of such a shocking intensity that I remained numb for a few minutes. Paulie may never get Babe's longevity, but I believe it's just as brilliant. The same laughter. The same flawless effects. And the same surprising intelligence. <br /> <br /> A small jewel.
