Recently, I found this movie on VHS after searching for it for many years, I was not disappointed. It's getting better every time I see it. Peter Ustinov plays and co-authored the original script (nominated for an Oscar). Other stars you've heard about are Karl Malden, Bob Newhart and Cesar Romero. Ustinov plays an accountant / embezzler, just released from the infamous prison in Wormwood Scrubs (he misappropriated in the seat of the Conservative Party, selected because he is a liberal). He immediately starts looking for a new employer from whom he can betray, and discovers that computers are the wave of the future. He socially constructs his way to the London men's club and learns the identity of the best computer experts in the city, steals the identity of one Caesar Smith who just left the city in South America to pursue his hobby of collecting moths in the wild. He talks with Ta-Can-Co, an American conglomerate headed by Carlton Klemper (Karl Malden). Klemper employs Smith and shows him around the computer center, especially his security function consisting of flashing blue light. Ustinow asks the computer how to overcome his safety, and the computer strongly urges him: "Disconnect the blue light". Using hacker techniques for 30 years in the future, Ustinov breaks into the system and programs the computer to generate checks written for various fake companies. The scheme begins to unravel when Klemper's assistant, Willard G. Gnatpole (Bob Newhart), notices that ta-can-what deals with Ustinova fraud companies. With the help of her secretary Patty Terwilliger (Maggie Smith), Ustinov manages to avoid racing and lives happily ever after. Say it would ruin a very funny, romantic, intelligent and anticipating picture.
