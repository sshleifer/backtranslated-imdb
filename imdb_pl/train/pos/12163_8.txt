I found a rather expressive film, the way the main character disappeared, but at the same time much clearer in certain matters of life than people who mocked him (for example his roommate). <br /> <br /> he was tortured and you loved watching him tortured! she had this perverted side that was terrifying, but we were all happy to see she was out of misery again. <br /> <br /> it was like a character from a game or a pan-man through mine ground or enemy and we love to watch it under sniper or fire attack, but in the end we are glad that he survived ... <br /> <br />.
