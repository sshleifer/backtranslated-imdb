I do not care how many bad reviews the purple rain gets, this movie is spinning! An excellent movie, it has everything, great music (Prince of Coarse!), Romance and drama. <br /> <br /> It's really a very sad movie, very moving. I do not want to say more, I do not want to give out the plot, but I will say it - the film is VERY realistic, there are many romantic relationships that go through these problems, so many families like the one presented in the film. I find it very realistic and so real that the film is more moving. My generation loved the adolescent film, so many of us loved Prince and there is a lot to say for every teenager who has had similar problems. <br /> <br /> Having said that, it's definitely not a movie for teenagers, I recommend it to all age groups. And it is not so dark, the movie has great music, scenes with bands performances and sexy fun scenes between Prince and Appelonia.
