It was a very original, decent movie and a bold move for everyone involved. I do not care if this is the best-prepared movie of all time, the fact that Eddie Murphy does something informal, and that I do not know what will happen next, makes me a favorite. I would like more films to be as imaginative as this one, and not the same old entertainment formula.
