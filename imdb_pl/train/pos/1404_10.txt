HOLLOW MAN is one of the better horrors of the last decade. Sub-thread is original and the main thread is even better. The special effects are brilliant and probably the best I've seen in horror. Kevin Bacon proves once again that he can deal with every role that will happen to him. <br /> <br /> Claude Rains shook the world of the INVISIBLE MAN in 1933, and now Kevin Bacon shocked us * HOLLOW MAN. One of the most exciting horrors in history. The action is intense and the real shudders. You can actually be in a jump if you watch it in the dark on a stormy night. The cast includes Elizabeth Shue, Josh Brolin, Kim Dickens, Joey Slotnick, Greg Grunberg and Mary Randle. They all do a unique job. <br /> <br /> --- SPOILERS --- <br /> <br /> Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) and his team discovered the secret to making someone invisible. After testing on animals, they pass to tests on humans. But someone must be a subject. Volenteering, Caine became invisible. But when his team is not able to restore visibility, Caine is maddened because of his condition when he is looking for his revenge ... * final spoilers * <br /> <br /> The film has created unforgettable shock sequences and is intended to become become a classic in the next century. Becoming the basis of a joke parody in SCARY MOVIE 2, this movie grabs you by the throat and never lets go. The first 45 minutes are slow, developing characters and showing how their experiments work. The other half is exciting and attractive to the majority of action and horror fans. Think about DEEP BLUE SEA. Then change the sharks into a crazy, invisible man. And then change the water into fire and explosions. Mixing the killer shark movie. Interesting ... HOLLOW MAN gets 5/5.
