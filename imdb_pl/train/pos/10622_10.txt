"Hatred of a Minute" is an amazingly beautiful movie. A psychological thriller that takes you on a journey through a nightmare that is the life of a serial killer, Eric Seaver. Strong performances and excellent photos make this film "a must see" for any film student or fan of horror. The reality of history and Eric's human side are separating this movie from other films about psychic killers. Some of the producer's cries, Bruce Campbell, as well as the movie "The Bad Dead" add humor to everyone who knows this genre.
