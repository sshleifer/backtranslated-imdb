Hi: <br /> <br /> I heard about a loss from a colleague who had obvious differences in opinions about entertainment, he loved it. Well, I watched the episode or 2 in the early seasons and I was bored, so I adjusted it. After a few years I came across a loss; bored with the current sci-fi tariff. Wow, I was surprised. Can you say good, gravity, damn it, I got sucked. The pace and scripts are very good, some forward / back flash are so much with lamer characters, but definitely good. My favorite characters are Ben, Locke, Jacob, Richard Alpert, Sayid Jarrah, Sawyer, Hurley, Daniel Faraday, Jin and Wife, Walt, Charlie, Desmond and Jack's dad. Jack and Michael are definitely immature ashat, very spoiled and immature. Kate, one step above them, Juliet was much more elegant than Kate. Mr Eco, in an underestimated and at Charlie's level, if not more, it is a pity they both died. A guy dressed in black talking with Jacob (on the way back) is a real curiosity. As a whole, a great, multi-layered series: I am looking for more. <br /> <br /> greetings
