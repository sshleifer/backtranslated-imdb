Some comments on IMDb compared Dog Bite Dog to classic Cat III movies from the 90s, but while it is undoubtedly brutal, violent and very restrained, this film from Pou-Soi Cheang is not really dingy, stingy or sensational earn a comparison. However, he still has something that makes him worth seeing, especially when it comes to hard, hard action. <br /> <br /> Edison Chen plays Pang, a Cambodian hit man who travels to Hong Kong to murder the judge's wife; Sam Lee is Wai, a ruthless policeman who is determined to track him down, regardless of the cost. As Wai approaches the target, Pang will not stop at anything to ensure his escape until he meets Yue, a completely illegal immigrant who needs his help to escape her life. <br /> <br /> A mercilessly sharp drama with great pictures, amazing sound design, breathtaking results and solid performances by Chen and Lee (as well as novice Pei Pei as interested in Pang's love), Dog Bite Dog is one for hard fans Asian hyper-violence (think according to the Chan-Wooka Park revenge trilogy). Hits, shootings, ruthless beatings: everything happens regularly in this film and is captured unwaveringly by director Cheang. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is a kind of story whose destiny is an unhappy ending for everyone involved, and certainly almost everyone in this movie is dying (rather a nasty death). Unfortunately, there is a thin line between tragedy and (unintentional) comedy, and in the last moments Dog Bite Dog crosses: in a ridiculously over-dramatic final scene, Pang and Wai are trapped in a battle as Yue looks pregnant. Eventually, after all three of them suffered serious stab wounds during fissures, wounded Pang performs Cezarean DIY (now dead) Yue, providing the child with a moment before he dies. <br /> <br /> While this movie may not be a "classic" piece of excess Hong Kong, with its amazing OTT action and stylish visuals, it's still worth looking for.
