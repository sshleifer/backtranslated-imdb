This is one of the best animated films I've seen in my life. This is not just a funny movie or a well made movie. This is a turning point in the art of animation, and even if it was not, only the technical skills that created it would provide him with a place in the history of animation. <br /> <br /> Władysław Starewicz created a time-lapse movie about the secret life of beetles. He imagined a coherent world of insects, with work, homes, nightclubs, movie houses, even small props, such as posters and bicycles and paintings. <br /> <br /> In this movie, he tells a simple story about hypocrisy and revenge. Mr. Beetle has an affair with a dancing dragonfly, to the disappointment of a grasshopper; but he is a cameraman and decides to fire the fling. Mr. Beetle returns home and states that Mrs. Beetle has her affair. Mr. Beetle is chasing a lover, but he forgives his wife. These two create and go to the cinema. And the movie they're watching is Mr. Beetle and Dragonfly. Described in this way sounds banal, but once seen it becomes a thrilling cinematic work. Together with Emil Cohl and Jiri Trnka, Władysław Starewicz invented everything that future animators would use in their work. For this reason, it can not be forgotten.
