This film takes place in the 1950s. Accordingly, the dead (called zombies) arose to eat alive. However, the company has developed a collar that, when applied to the neck of the zombie, makes them obedient and excellent servants. Robinson's mom, Helen (Carrie-Anne Moss), father Bill (Dylan Baker) and Timmy's son (K'Sun Ray), they hire zombies, because everyone in his block already has it. Tim calls the Fido zombie (Billy Connolly) and befriends him. But his dad hates him, and Timmy loses control of Fido and everything goes wrong. <br /> <br /> As you can see, it is - among other things - a start in the series "Lassie" with Fido who will stand behind Lassie. Timmy was named for no reason! Each of the famous episodes of Lassie is shot here. My favorite is when Timmy sends Fido to get help before the zombies eat him! It is also a satire from Douglas Sirk's films from the 1950s, where everything is bright and colorful - but the dark secrets tear people apart. The heroes wear VERY bright clothes from the 1950s (Moss is always in the dress) - furniture, settings and cars are especially in the 1950s in bright colors. Even when the script becomes repetitive, you can always look at it. The script is good - but there are only so many Lassie jokes that you can do. Melodrama is a bit stupid, but the cast is pulling it away. Everyone here is perfect and accurate. Even Connolly as a zombie without emotions does a good job. Moss is the best - it plays every line for all its value --- but it never exaggerates. <br /> <br /> This is not for everyone (of course). Satire can be lost on most people, and gore is quite tame. Gore is being made casually, and happy music makes it difficult to take it seriously. So for some people it really works. I give him 8.
