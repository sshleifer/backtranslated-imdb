This is a very funny Ealing comedy about the community in central London, which thanks to unusual circumstances discovers that they are not English, but are an annex to the French province of Burgundy. <br /> <br /> Film features comic actor Stanley Holloway (best known as Alfred Doolittle in MY FAIR LADY), as well as many other classic comic actors from this period. <br /> <br /> This story was apparently based on news at the time when the Canadian government "officially" handed the hotel room to a visitor to a European member of the royal family. The idea reminded me of the real case of the Hutt River province in Western Australia, where the landowner "separated" from the Australian government because of a dispute over the amount of wool. (It has never been confirmed by Western Australian or Australian governments). <br /> <br /> It's a great scenario that plays with many political and economic problems, like the TV show "Tak minister"; as well as a great little eccentric piece of the character.
