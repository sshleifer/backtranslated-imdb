Indeed: drug use, shooting from magazines, avoiding "Matrix" missiles, a futuristic city with a mix of Asian races and a lonely vampire - all in the same movie - seem to be a story that could only be imagined by a Japanese pop / rock star. And that is exactly what "Moon Child" is and not only. While all these elements may sound like the perfect theme for the camping movie of the week, "Moon Child" pulls him away from him, but on the way waiting for him some expected shocks. <br /> <br /> The film has a distinctive, definitely independent character, jumping from one scene to another not in a smooth transition, but rather sporadically, giving flashes in the lives of the characters and barely rubbing against the real story. But the film does not justify, instead it transforms history into friendship, love, trust and betrayal, all covered with sugar in the aforementioned elements of futuristic society, gangsters and vampires fighting. <br /> <br /> HYDE as a bleak vampire "Kei" is perfect, giving depth to the protagonist and balancing the overly zealous act of Gackt as "Sho", an orphan who is friendly to Kei. Lee-Hom Wang also shines as a vindictive "Son" who befriends an adult Sho. This story revolves around these characters and their extended friends and family in different periods of their lives, and how simple friendship can easily become grief and betrayal. <br /> <br /> The action is sometimes too long unrealistic and the special effects appear to show off, and one of the things that the movie never does, is the assumption that it's about extremely popular Asian singers. Superstars as actors have their disadvantages, just like their characters. The film is rarely bored, and ends where it should, after jumping a little. "Moon Child" is sometimes pleasant, humorous, and even very touching: definitely worth your time!
