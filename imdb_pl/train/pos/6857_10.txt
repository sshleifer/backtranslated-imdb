"Dressed To Kill" is one of the best thrillers in history. Cases related to sex and violence make it an adult film. Brian De Palma once again proves why no other director can match his camera use to telling stories. He directs many scenes without dialogues and tells a lot about his story, only through the use of his visuals and the brilliant result of Pino Donnagio. The film filmed in Panavision MUST be viewed on a wide screen, because De Palma uses the entire width of the film to tell its story. Cropped, on the video "Dressed To Kill", it is barely the same movie. Solid performances from the cast, excellent direction and, perhaps, the best score ever written, make "Dressed To Kill" see.
