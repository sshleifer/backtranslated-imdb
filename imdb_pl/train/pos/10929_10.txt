One of the more pleasant aspects of Asian cinema (actually everything that happens outside these saints than in the United States) are the permutations that appear. For example, after the Second World War, a Japanese manga (comic) can be found in an infinite variety of topics, many of which are treated in a unique way. The same happens in genre films; but again I am talking about films made outside the USA. (where we are too "sophisticated" in our proximity to the mind to appreciate anything that does not apply to the US). For example, would an American company not return to one, but to a series of films with a masked professional wrestler (El Santo) or a werewolf (Paul Naschy) or a real martial artist (Bruce Lee) ...? When it comes to television: forget about it. Although I still love the KUNG FU series, in which the late David Carradine appeared, I always thought that the Americanized version of the Asian martial arts was - as I put it - a bit lacking. Until now there was no pay-per-view channel in which Asian martial artists playing Asian martial artists in Asia would perform. (There are many soft-core porn videos masquerading as entertainment programs, but the so-called Action Channel, for example, has yet to import or produce True Martial Arts.) Before Brother Cadfile investigated the murders of the BBC, he was at least one movie Kung Fu, which included a group of martial arts more or less involved in the murder mystery: 5 DEAD MENS. The work of martial arts is as fascinating as other crime genres based on genres (western, cops show, etc.). It is now available in Dragon Dynasty, and the printout is beautiful, and Bey Logan's DVD commentary is EXACTLY a kind of intelligent, thoughtful analysis that these jewels really deserve. If you're a fan of martial arts movies, enjoy: one of the greatest movie genres of all time (especially martial arts films from the 70s and early 80s) they get a long-overdue second life (and a very valued second look) on DVD.
