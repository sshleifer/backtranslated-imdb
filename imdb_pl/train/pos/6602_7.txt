Just like Frank Miller and his Sin City comics, they used black and white expressions of themselves (and its film influences noir), as did Christian Volckman of the Renaissance. <br /> <br /> It's 2054 in Paris. In the science fiction tradition, the future is a bright, shining gem with many roses. It is a jewel surrounded by misery, inequality and darkness; bright and beautiful at the top with a dark conk underneath. One of those "bright" people at the top, a scientist from a very large and influential global company (Avalon), is kidnapped. The well-known and effective captain Karas (whose voice James Bond himself gave - Daniel Craig) receives the task of finding her. <br /> <br /> The plot and layout are not very original. He is heavily influenced by the film noir, Gibson Neuromancer and other crime novels, as well as films such as Blade Runner, Sin City, Fritz Lang's Metropolis and Minority Report. There is a main thread, surrounded by other possible plots that connect at the end. This is not difficult to understand. <br /> <br /> The strength and originality of the film lies in its intense visual presentation. Paris is a complex set of levels and levels. At its base there is a more primitive industrial infrastructure. As the city grows, its architectural complexity and luminescence increase. However, in this structure the summit is not synonymous with raising human ideals and behavior. Paris has been intricately animated and arranged in brilliant black and white. The film is closer to the spirit of Sin City (comic book), and then Sin City movie was with the source material. It's all the easier because it's still in the same medium; animation. Like the Darkly scanner, he pushed the visual aspects of story telling, so he does it. Light and dark, black and white create an atmosphere of contrasts, as well as visual ambiguity. Good and bad, black and white can lose all meaning at the same time as it is right in front of us. The film proves how black and white can be both ambiguous and obvious. <br /> <br /> In keeping with the spirit of the film, I can be both a critic and a fan. I can love and disgust myself in the same light. This is definitely an experience that I recommend to visual arts lovers. So pour another black and tanned, go into the void and enjoy the ride.
