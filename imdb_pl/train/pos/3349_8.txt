Man With the Gun is almost forgotten, but caused a small storm of media interest in 1955, when Robert Mitchum rejected both Jett Rink in Giant (which was written for him, and which was then substantially reworked) and Charles Laughton's version of The Naked and the Dead instead. Despite the obvious production problems and harsh illumination that sometimes makes both Mitch and Jan Sterling have unflattering sounds, it is an amazing dark western that more than compares with its earlier Blood on the Moon as "the city slayer's sets" to work in a city that never had a chance to grow up before being beaten by local badgers before going to ?? possibly ?? be almost as bad as the people he sends. Certainly his way of dealing with the news of death in the family? burning the living room to the ground and persuading the manager to try to kill him? it does not inspire much confidence in its stability. In addition to a good script and surprisingly good support from the usually annoying but well-manned Henry Hull, he also boasts the strikingly good early result of Alex North, which even includes early training for one of his tormented emotional signals, which will later appear in Spartacus.
