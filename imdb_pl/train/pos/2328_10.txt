Excellent movies are rare. Even my favorite films have flaws - the back window looks a bit on the stage, the figure of Chris Elliot on Groundhog Day does not work, music in the Best Years of our Life is too bad, the beginning of Nights of Cabiria is a bit too slow - but this movie is perfectly made from the beginning to end. <br /> <br /> The screenplay is brilliant, the acting is great all around (though Reese Witherspoon and Sam Waterston are amazing, the whole cast is shining), the direction and photography are inspired and the musical score is touching being obtrusive (like some of the Miramax results that they are too manipulative). Every sad moment really moves, every moment of light makes me smile. This is really one of the best movies I've ever seen and I would like there to be more such films. <br /> <br /> I'm glad Reese Witherspoon went to renown after this film, but I'm sorry that her latest films are much more extravagant and stupid than this serious movie about real people, real feelings and real problems. Excellent! You must see.
