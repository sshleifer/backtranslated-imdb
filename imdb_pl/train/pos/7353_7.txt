This movie can be one of the most underrated movies from Bollywood history. This hit song from 1994. He had all the good performances, music and direction. I remember that I was in Allahabad, when this movie was running and was somewhere in March during Holi, people were playing their song "Ooe Amma" on their loudspeakers at the highest volume. If someone who likes to watch Some Like It Hot and drools over Marilyn Monroe, he should see this movie. Thumbs up to Govinda. How many of you know that this movie was shot in southern India and after Sholay could be one of the few blockbitters to hit the Silver Screen. With movies like this Indian comedy, it will never be dead.
