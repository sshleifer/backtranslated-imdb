SUMMARY The future seen from 1939 in England. In the face of the war over Europe, the salvation of mankind will not be in the politics of the past. This bold new world of science overcomes the mistakes made in the past by man. <br /> <br /> CONCEPT WITH REGARD TO THE BROWSER Watch out for your leaders and what you have been told. Thinking outside the box can lead to a brighter tomorrow. There will always be descent and fear, and learning to overcome this is our only hope. <br /> <br /> PROS AND CONS I've seen this movie a long time ago and recently downloaded it from the internet (it's public domain). It is a fascinating work on many levels. Because this is a story about the future seen from 1939, it has obvious drawbacks. This vision of the future is both frightening and capricious. This movie was innovative for its day. The special effects are very good, as well as the plot. Actors suffer a bit in the British theatrical sense, because they can lean slightly towards Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> One of the main themes of the film is that science and technology can solve all our problems that we now know is not always true. Another plot of the films is that the charismatic leaders are the curse of human existence and will probably always be with us. <br /> <br /> The basics of almost all later science fiction movies can be seen in this video. The set design and wardrobe "Forbidden Planet", the shortcomings of technology in "2001: A Space Odessa", and even the lush landscapes / landscapes of "Star Wars" owe some inspiration to this film. <br /> <br /> The end of the film leaves the viewer somewhat embarrassed. Although he is optimistic in his final sequence of reaching for the stars, we wonder if mankind will ever be able to do so. Even when we reach, there are those who try to stop us. This film vision of the future, while interesting is also somewhat funny in today's standards. Huge flying machines and guns that could shoot people into space never materialized in the real world, but in 1939 they were considered the next logical step. <br /> <br /> Many great British actors are in this movie as young men. Cedric Hardwicke and Ralph Richardson are the most recognizable, and their oratories are visible here. Raymond Massey is an interesting choice to play the main character, Cabela. His character almost becomes a new sent Christ to save the world from his own destruction thanks to the new religion of science. <br /> <br /> This is a good piece of cinema history, the themes of which are still valid, even if the vision of the future did not hit the mark.
