While the film was shot on the National Guard in Florida, "Tigerland" reminded me completely of Fort Polk in Los Angeles, shooting ranges, maneuvering areas, water at the waist and everything. The film was quite authentic and the characters similar to those on my AIT in 1974. The difference between Tigerland, 1971 and my 1974 is that the sergeants and instructors knew that they would not return to Vietnam because there was almost everything, so the training was very relaxed - it was not a challenge. It was the forerunner of all our problems in the 1970s and 1980s, which I know of when I was in 2004. I never heard anyone mention "Tiger", but the army had realistic training villages in Vietnam at various bases in the US Vets in Vietnam told me that by 1972 Basic and AIT could be quite rough and rough, because the coaches were there and they were authorized to train men associated with Vietnam with these skills to do so, although this was not always the case. Both a sergeant from Polk and one of my VET non-commissioned officers in Vietnam, when we became instructors in the basic training brigade at Fort Bliss, told me that they can not do anything to make someone ready, and people just have to find out for themselves. This movie is high.
