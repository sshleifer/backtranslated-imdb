War is hell. But this movie about World War II is heaven. <br /> <br /> This series is not only a breathtaking, almost exhausting look at the Second World War, it's a poetic masterpiece narrated clearly and perfectly by Laurence Olivier. /> <br /> This documentary series specifies the genre. No doubt it is very long, but you'll like it all and want to come back for more. (I have a series on DVD and probably watch the series three times a year). <br /> <br /> Really, this is an impeccable piece of making movies. Other than Olivier, the best part of the series is listening to veterans telling their stories; whether it's a real battle or finding a pig for a butcher so that they can have something delicious for supper. <br /> <br /> I'm going to watch it now (again, my ... 11th time).
