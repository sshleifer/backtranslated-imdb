When I saw this movie for the first time, I thought it was a typical material "love your neighbor" ... The more movie was happening, the more I got involved. Acting is great from both actors, the direction was great, the story was extraordinary. I took my eyes off for the first time in my life for the movie. A real must have in every serious video clip. 11 out of 10
