I agree completely with the previous comments. I remember this document as one of the most amazing and informative I have ever seen. As I mentioned earlier, I remember that I started to watch, thinking that it was just another study of nature - interesting, not necessarily special, but I was wrong. Not only the history of the colony was unbelievable, but I remember that music is so much a part of its attractiveness. If I remember correctly, they were Native Americn pipes (similar to the music at the end of One Flew Over the Cookoo's Nest). I was also looking for a copy. This should require observation of everyone, especially schools. It should be re-released.
