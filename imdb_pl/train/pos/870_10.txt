"Read My Lips (Sur mes lèvres)" (probably having a different idiomatic resonance in the French title) is a smart, winding contemporary story about office politics, which unexpectedly becomes a criminal criminal, because extremely fitting characters move up and down sensual slippery slope . <br /> <br /> Both wires are magnetic, Emmanuelle Devos (whom I have never seen before in spite of her long CV in French films) and even more disheveled than usual Vincent Cassel (who brought a sexy and / or menacing look and voice to some American movies). <br /> <br /> The first half of the movie is on its premises in a competitive real estate office and he is a neophyte. The other half is in its area as an ex-con and its poignant adaptation to this environment. <br /> <br /> Writer / director Jacques Audiard cleverly uses the woman's insulating disability as an entrée for us in its perception, turning the sound up and down so that we can hear it like her (so it's even more annoying than usual, when members of the audience say), using visual effects as sensory reactors. <br /> <br /> None of the characters work as expected (it's not like this flexible victim of "In the Company of Men", not in individual interactions, not in scenes, not in the general arc of an unpredictable plot (no , until the last photo, but listen, the audience was waiting for this fulfillment), when we move from the hustle and bustle of a modern office, to a hot discotheque, to romantic and criminal offers. <br /> <br /> There is a story that is thematically unnecessary and unnecessary, but it just gives us a few minutes to catch a breath. <br /> <br /> It's one of my favorites this year! <br /> <br /> (originally written on July 28, 2002)
