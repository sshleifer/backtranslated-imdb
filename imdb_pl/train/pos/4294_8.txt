Yesterday afternoon there was no dry eye among the audience after I left the cinema, seeing this jewel of a movie in a sold-out home as part of this year's Hamburg Film Festival. And tears spilled out of laughter. This movie was funny, there is no other way to say it. There was nothing boring about it, I laughed at it, and with me all the other three hundred lovers of French cin√©ma. <br /> <br /> Alain Chabat was absolutely wonderful. A great clown, if needed and serious if the situation requires it. The event was obviously completely exaggerated, but that was exactly what history needed and what made it work so well. Charlotte Gainsbourg was equally wonderful, which I love very much and my mother was also very strong. The sisters may have had a slightly more detailed character in terms of scenarios, but otherwise there is nothing to complain about. I spent a great afternoon watching this movie while Hamburg drowned in the rain outside, and I wish for such films from France to be regularly published in Germany. But distributors are a country that does not seem to understand that the French are making good films. At least I can not wait to find a DVD with subtitles (Hello Australia? Please?), Because this movie I need at home to watch it a few more times!
