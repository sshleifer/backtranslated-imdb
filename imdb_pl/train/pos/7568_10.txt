I saw this my last day at the festival and I'm glad that I'm stuck on these few extra days. Poetic, moving, and most surprisingly, funny, in a strange way. It is rare for directors working in this style to be able to find real strangeness and humor in a hyperrealistic world, without appearing to be a valuable or irritating balance. He manages to improvise as well as completely control. I hesitate to make comparisons, because these filmmakers really digested their influence (Cassavetes, Malick, Loach, Altman ... ordinary suspects) and found their own unique style, but if you like modern directors in this tradition (Lynne Ramsay David Gordon Greene), you are on a real feast. It's a great movie and I hope more people will see it. If this movie is playing at a festival in your city, go! go! go!
