If you are outclassed in a terrible song, you will find a classic fairy tale under it. Christopher Walken is very funny and surprisingly good in this role. His characteristic style of play works well for the sly Kotek in Boots. The other actors are doing well with their parts. I did not find any of the actors terribly false or awkward. In particular, the king seems to be a real non-system and I wonder if he should be. I do not remember the original story. Special effects are typical of the eighties, but at least they are not too fake, like some of the computer-generated tariffs we see today. In general, I recommend this film for children and adults who are a child in the heart.
