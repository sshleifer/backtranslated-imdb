Rumor has it that at the time ABBA ?? the award-winning Swedish star disco favorite reached its zenith, the band was disappointed in singing in English and wanted to appear in their native language. Soon marital problems began to appear and the recordings became less and less frequent. The band dissolved, though unofficially, in 1982, and pop lost one of the most famous artists. Although they have never admitted that there is any truth in these rumors, the fact remains that ABBA would never succeed if they recorded only in their mother tongue. If you want to appeal to the largest media market in the world, you must satisfy the needs of English-speaking users. <br /> <br /> It's amazing for me how such a small island is located next door away from the European continent could create probably the best known, though not the most used language in the world. Everyone speaks some English; whether it's just "hello" or just a curse - you'll find an English speaker almost everywhere. Pedro Galindo, of course, disagreed because Trampa Infernal was never written for global consumption until it was recently released on the budget DVD. It's a real shame because it's actually a decent movie that's much better than many of its English-speaking countrymen. <br /> <br /> The film begins on a slightly unknown territory of the pistol duel. Two unidentified figures were shown, sneaking around the destroyed complex, looking for each other in the inevitable final game. After some tension and a few would-be cases, one of the shooters emerges victoriously. Then we find out that they were just paintball guns, and the two players are actually young people from the local city. Nacho and Mauricio are the most dangerous rivals, and Mauricio always tries to prove that he is better than his gentle opponent, but he has not yet succeeded. <br /> <br /> Later that night, while the victorious gunslinger celebrates his triumph with his girlfriend Alejandra and his pal Charly, Mauricio enters the bar and says he has the last challenge for his great nemesis. He says it will be a competition that once and for all turns out to be a city that deserves the highest respect. Nacho is initially reluctant, because Alejandra warns him of the dangers of continued competitiveness, but he finally succumbs to the pressure of his peers and agrees; to the distaste of your morally superior partner. <br /> <br /> They plan to go to the distant region of Filo de Caballo because recent press reports have reported that many people have been massacred by what the mischievous bear thinks. Mauricio suggests that anyone who kills an animal could be considered the greatest, and he promises that it will be the last battle he will fight against his opponent. <br /> <br /> After visiting the armory to buy a weapon and ignore the warnings of the senior shopkeeper, the groups decided to leave the secluded forest. Hunters are hunted because they find out that the "bear" is actually a deadly veterinarian from Vietnam who still does not know that the war is over and he regards all people as his enemy. What started as a competitive adventure suddenly becomes a battle for survival because they are persecuted and killed by a sinister killer. <br /> <br /> I picked up the Tramp during my studies in Madrid from a Mexican student who lived in a dormitory - a door for me. I remember that the copy I watched was faulty, and the tape ended about 10 minutes before the end of the subtitles, which meant I never saw the final scenes. Fortunately, I recently came across a budget DVD on Amazon and immediately added it to my collection. <br /> <br /> Slasher Gallindo is a surprisingly good effort, which is distinguished by a clever direction and an enthusiastic plot that attempts to cover areas that slashers usually do not approach. He is so good that he reminded me of more than one occasion for the classic Predator Arnold Schwarzenegger. This is particularly evident in scenes that show a masked assassin running through the woods and a panicky panicked troupe as they fight to escape from the maniac's playground. <br /> <br /> In spite of Gallindo's obvious awareness of generic phrases (the Warden uses even clawed gloves and la Freddy Kruegar); The tramp is also trying to add something else to the standard template. While most of the game's time depends on specific category rules, the last third heralds a significant step in individuality when the maniac defends himself with a machine gun and tempts the hero to his lair at the final clash. From that moment, the film quickly turns into genres and becomes almost an action movie that, depending on your taste, excites you or disappoints you. The last slasher who tried to cross these two styles was that the cheesy eighties of The Majorettes, which is not necessarily a good thing. <br /> <br /> As with many Latin films (especially Almodovar's Spanish cinema) and Amenabar), Trampa has a subtle trend of morality to its history, which is transmitted without success to the throat of the viewer. Experience the temptation of masculinity and you can not always be a winner. It is a sugar-covered spot, but it is treated gently enough not to diminish the joy of this function. <br /> <br /> A tramp can be tacky, but it deserves to be seen and recognized as one of the better late slashers. The killer looks amazing in terrifying military uniforms and a white valentine-style mask and originality attempts at work. He may lack the gore that is enjoyed by the most honest fans of horror, but he has enough in terms of tension and creativity to guarantee at least one viewing.
