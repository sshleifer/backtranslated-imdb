Clint Eastwood definitely produced better movies than this one, but this one does not embarrass him. Dirty Harry catches everyone's attention and unless someone wants to watch an affair, there's no reason why you would not like him. He is cool because he is dirty, he is great because he kills without much thinking, he is perfect because he gets a bullet straight into the heart and the hero, because he does not care. <br /> <br /> From what I have seen in the films in which Eastwood plays, the main character always captivates the audience. In White Hunter Black Heart is a crazy director, in "In the Line of Fire" he is "Old" un ", while here he is" almost "without work with his job, it means that he does work for himself, he does not care about his superiors who practically send him on holiday. <br /> <br /> Based on the rape victim, this movie is promising for all "non-sensual" movie watchers. The film has nothing to deviate from its main plot. However, what makes it a bit worse than Eastwood's best movies is that although the character's main role is captivating, it is not, because it is too obvious from the beginning. This is not a movie that will make you sit in a place without moving. Besides, there are too many people dirtier than Dirty Harry.
