Some movies that you know you'll love from the first few seconds. This is one of those movies. Tracking its roots is derived from "Double Indemnity" and "The Postman Always Rings Twice" in the 1940s - it was a great example of Modern Film Noir in the 90s. Nick Cage plays the main character who gets tangled up in the murder of his husband and wife, and his luck changes from bad to worse even worse when he tries and tries to escape people, the city, violence and the threat of Red Rock West. Many twists, great performances by Cage, Hopper and Walsh, a hypnotic musical background with a sliding guitar and smooth directing make it a real joy. Favorite line: When Cage looks at the empty gas indicator in the car leaving, he shakes his head and says: "F *** in the" history of my life ".
