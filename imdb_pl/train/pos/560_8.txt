Another very good Mann movie thanks to a combination of father and son Walter Brennan and Jimmy Stewart. Brennan (Ben Tatum) is often a comedic conscience of Stewart or Wayne (Red River / Rio Bravo). It is there to see that a younger man is taking a fork or a bend. "You're wrong, Mr. Dunston." Jeff Webster (Stewart) gives the impression that he cares only about himself, but it is clear that he can not leave Brennan. John McIntire is perfect as Skagway's law with due respect for the traps of justice over reality. Another key topic is helping people and thus helping people. The loner can not do this and suffers for it. <br /> <br /> The signature above is playing on Tatum's assurance that he can not live without coffee. This addiction to nicotine turns out to be fatal. Probably the first and last time on the screen. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie and now I own the DVD.
