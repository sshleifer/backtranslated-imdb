I know that you do not expect this from a movie of this genre <br /> <br /> pedigree - it's a direct descendant of The Best Years of Our Lives <br /> <br /> and The Men ... movies about men staying in the hospital <br /> <br /> dealing with tragic circumstances. But this movie is full of wonderful <br /> <br /> surprises and performances. There are excellent performances by Erica Stoltz and Helen Hunt (including quite a risky nude scene), and Wesley Snipes and William Forsythe. As Emanuel Levy wrote in <br /> <br /> in his book "Cinema of Outsiders" (about an independent movie <br /> <br /> movement) "Waterdance is coherent, attentive to details and <br /> <br /> niesentymentalny with mean humor - immediately <br /> <br /> funny and sad, and the whole cast is impressive. "I was <br /> <br /> extremely touched by this film, it's hard to hit like this, but I also have <br /> <br /> very delicate moments and laughs loud times. A rare jewel.
