I recently saw this film in my international business class. I did not expect anything other than the next boring documentary (not to say I do not love the documentary I just have bad luck with movies in this class) Imagine my surprise when this movie appeared, actually a movie. <br /> <br /> This film is a story about all cultural differences in the workplace and how they have to work together to reach everywhere. The clash of culture shows how different the world is and how we perceive each other differently until someone comes and calls. I highly recommend this movie to anyone on business or who just wants to laugh, because it's so funny. <br /> <br /> Well, that's all! your health
