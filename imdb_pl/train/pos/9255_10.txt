If you want to have fun with a lot of subtle humor, you'll love this movie. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why someone would not enjoy it. Take this for what it is: a vehicle for Dennis Hopper who will make your head laugh. This is not Shakespeare, but it's well done. Ericka Eleniak is absolutely beautiful and has her own in it - better than any episode of Baywatch - and shows talent for subtle humor. It is a pity that she did not have many opportunities to take care of it. <br /> <br /> Tom Berenger fits perfectly into the role of the "real navy", and William McNamara does a solid job as a hustler. <br /> <br /> Put Hopper in the middle of the chase behind "The Cherry on this Sundae" and you have a movie that caught my attention and made me laugh. I bought it as soon as it was available. <br /> <br /> Candy-brain.
