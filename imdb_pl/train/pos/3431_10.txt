Simply the best Estonian movie I've ever seen, although it is made by Finnish director Ilkka Järvi-Laturi. Tallin Pimeduses is a funny thriller with a band of gangsters who try to steal a huge amount of gold, a national treasure belonging to the Republic of Estonia. But at the same time it is a kind of summary of the conditions of many Eastern European countries at the time. In the early 1990s, the Soviet Union fell into pieces, and many countries, such as Estonia, became independent. Now conditions can be better in most of these countries. But in the early 1990s, many of these new nations had to fight corruption and organized crime, which in Soviet times left them as legacies. (And many of them still ... at least on a certain level ...) <br /> <br /> Tallinn Pimeduses is a very realistic film from that era, with credible characters and a well-written script. The actors are also very good, especially Jüri Järvet (perhaps the best known Estonian actor, Snaut in Solaris Tarkovsky), a game and an old gangster who is slowly bothering with his lifestyle. But the most amazing is the performance of Monika Mäger, a child actress who plays Terje, a boy girl in her early teens, whose presence on the story is very important. (and her name is not even mentioned in the IMDb loan list !!!) in <br /> <br /> There are not many films in the world that can be entertaining and artistic at the same time. But Tallinn Pimeduses does it. Unfortunately, other Järvi-Laturi films are far from this kind of achievements. His first, Kotia päin was too artificial, and his latest story was created at night, it was a strange mess.
