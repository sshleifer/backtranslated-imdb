Like Dr. Alan Feinstone, Corbin Bernsen changes a wonderfully insane performance in "The Dentist". <br /> <br /> With his already obsessive compulsive high-speed trends, the IRS is pursuing him and a very suspicious wife; Dr. Alan Feinstone is losing mental health every day. <br /> <br /> When the Doctor really realizes that his wife is having an affair with a local boy from the pool, he causes a series of events that lead to torture, murder, total murder! "Dentist" is a solid movie! Bernsen makes the figure of Dr. Feinstone, relative and at the same time hating. Although he is completely devoid of a gourd, the audience will still feel sorry for him. That my friends ... are damn good. <br /> <br /> A nice solid cast of supporting actors completes this pearl of the film. Excellent direction, good killings and gore and effective stimulation will ensure entertainment throughout the duration of the films. <br /> <br /> WE RECOMMEND HIGHLY!
