I started watching the concert from the first season, and at the beginning I was quite skeptical about it. The original movie was a bit childish, and I was looking for some science fiction program, waiting for the new BSG season. <br /> <br /> But after a few episodes, I became a fan. I loved the heroes - not as stupid as you think - Jack O'Neill, not only wise Samantha Carter, wonderful Teal'c, favorite woman and children, and brilliant Dr. Daniel Jackson. <br /> <br /> Of course, stories are sometimes not serious, sometimes even funny, but it's not about technology or the fight with space - it's about helping a friend and even risking his life for him. It's about "we do not leave anyone behind". Fighting to the end, when all hope is lost. About free will and all the good qualities that make man human. <br /> <br /> And now it's breaking, it's the 10th season and it's still doing well.
