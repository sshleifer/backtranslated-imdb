I had no idea about the facts that this movie presents. Because I remember this situation, I accepted the information presented at the time in the media: a confused happening around a dubious personality: Mr. Chavez. The film is a revelation of many realities, I wonder if something of this caliber has ever been done. I suspected that the hero was Mr. Chavez, but everyone who appeared in the photo <br /> <br />, was important and finally the reality of this entelechy: people, was overwhelming. Thank you Kim Bartley and Donnach O'Briain. <br /> <br />
