This animation has a very simple and simple plot of good versus evil and depends on action. What distinguishes it from other animations is how well human movements are animated. It was really beautiful to see a running woman running around the screen from left to right and looking around, her movements were so well made. Why do not they use this rotoscopic technique these days? This is quite effective. <br /> <br /> Fire and ice, in its prehistoric scenery and rarely dressed women, was clearly devoted to showing a beautiful lady in danger in various sexy ways, her sensual body serving as a clean eye. Some may hate it and consider it another cretish male sexual fantasy, others (including many women) love its aesthetic quality. It certainly did not bother me! Bakshi just loves to animate lush, sensuous babes, which can also be seen in Cool World, and I do not think he has to apologize because it is an adult animation. But as a child, I liked this animation and never forgot it. <br /> <br /> This one was just unique, so different from the standard Disney or Anime tariff and for that reason alone is worth watching, it can be the best Bakshi. For those who like animations with lush women: try also Space Adventure Cobra. <br /> <br /> I give Fire and Ice 8 out of 10.
