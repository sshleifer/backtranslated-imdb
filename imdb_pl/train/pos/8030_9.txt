It was another great Tom Berenger movie .. But some people are right, it was like another character of SGT BARNES, but it was still amazing ... Tom Berenger played a great sniper in the jungle of Panama! Billy Zane was a buddy at first, just like Cpl Upham from Saving Private Ryan, but eventually he became a bit more aggressive! The sniper was great, and the action buffs should watch it .. I would like to remind you that it would not have as much action as the reg action movie. I also got it on DVD and it's great!
