One of the things that I've always liked about Robert Ludlum's thriller is that when you think you know it, it's going in a completely different direction. There are so many twists in this movie that I have a painful neck to watch. <br /> <br /> One thing I like, directed by John Dahl (Kill Me Again, Rounders, Unforgettable) is that it may be up to you to write and, in this case, write (with your brother Rick ) a good story. <br /> <br /> Now add Nick Cage, Dennis Hopper, Lara Flynn Boyle and JT Walsh to the cast and you have a story that will keep your interest, even if you play characters that everyone has perfected. Dahl seems to bring out the best in people, and it will interest you and guess you until the very end.
