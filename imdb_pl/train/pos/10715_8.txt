Teresa Pavlinek was a popular Toronto Second City cast member. In Canada, she made many guest spots and commercials. Finally, someone makes sense to create a show for her. The support case also seems quite good. I've watched the pilot a few times now and I still think it's refreshing. Although I'm not sure why the show is listed as The Jane Show 2004. (I may be wrong) But as far as I know, the show was conceptualized in 2005 and appeared on Global TV in Canada early in 2006. fresh idea and I hope it's good. It is a pity that this can not be combined with Corner Gas. Now I know that Corner gas is on CTV, but two shows will be great additions.
