After setting the sitcom world in the next work of "Father Ted" by Arthur Matthews and Graham Linehan, it was a forgotten jewel for the BBC "Hippisi". Although it was created by a pair - six scenarios were written by Arthur Matthews himself. <br /> <br /> Set up in London in 1969 - Ray Purbs, a hippie, is the editor of the anarchist magazine. His friends are his roommate, the very laid-back and burning Alex, his "girl" is feminist Jill, not too bright Hugo. <br /> <br /> Simon Pegg was great as Ray, but he's great in everything he's in. This sitcom had something of "Citizen Smith." Ray was very similar to Wolfie Smith, who tried to defeat the public, but he did not cope miserably. After all, this sitcom will be released on DVD in March, I can not wait to buy it. As it was in 1999 and has been repeated on terrestrial TV - my memories are not very good on the show, but I remember two episodes really clearly, the first is the opening "Protesting Hippies", which I thought was a great start - where Ray goes to protest against sandpaper, and another episode was "Hippy Dippy Hippies", which in my opinion was episode 4, again quite clear memory of the police. Unfortunately, sitcom met with a negative reaction from viewers (I do not know why). The BBC ordered another series, but Arthur Matthews did not agree with this because of the negative reaction. Well, I can not wait for a DVD. <br /> <br /> The best episode: Hippy Dippy Hippies - series 1 episode 4.
