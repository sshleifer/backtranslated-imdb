It's a great movie visually. Pictures of the Mexican desert, old residence, figures in their picturesque costumes ... all this creates a real work of art. <br /> <br /> This story seems a bit loose, but that's because it does not mean to be a realist. It was taken from the book One Hundred Years of Solitude, which is to be an evocation of the isolated, unearthly atmosphere of Latin America "so far away from God and so close to the United States." The enormous debt Erendira owes to her grandmother is a symbol of Latin America's international debt, although there are many layers of meanings. <br /> <br /> If you can appreciate a slow, rich pattern, this one is for you.
