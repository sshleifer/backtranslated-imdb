... Heads, Hands and Feet - a band from the past, like Strange Fruit. Triple whammy there. Those who profess that they do not like this movie are heartless or younger than 40 and have no experience with a real movie. Sad for them. It is a painfully well-observed small image, which is a great way to pass an hour or two and probably will not disappear even at the second show. Stephen Rae, Timothy Spall as a thick drummer (in many respects the most delightful character of all), and Bill Nighy - a new name for me - as a neurotic singer and frontman, everyone revolves in great performances, and Juliet Aubrey has a beautiful doe eyes with sharp acting as Karen, who tries to keep the band together when they spectacularly self-destruct. <br /> <br /> Echo by Syd Barrett / Brian Wilson are loud and clear, Mott the Hoople back in front of one in their overstated absurdity, and the script has never been sniggly for more than a minute. Do not compare it with Spinal Tap, The Rutles or The Full Monty - it's unfair at all. The closest comparison is Commitments, and this is not bad. And every movie that can bring back memories of Blodwyn Pig - a band I do not remember, but the name lives - well, it shows that someone in the band knew what it was all about. <br /> <br /> A little joy and thanks for memory. <br /> <br /> Oh ... and I have ANOTHER - Stiff Little Fingers; a-a-a-a with SteelEYE Span ... Spooky TOOTH ... Ten inches NAILS? (You must watch a movie or have been on the road)
