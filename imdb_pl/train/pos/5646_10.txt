Recently, when I was shopping, I saw a set with American gothic and I thought: "I remember it!". I once set an alarm to go back and watch it when he was in CH 4 in 1996 at 1.30 (I was 14). I remember it mainly because it was really scary and strange, no one could be as frightening as Lucas Buck (from B !!). Nobody has ever been. <br /> <br /> However, what bothers me is the same as in the case of a TV set. Episodes in a funny order, I kept thinking when Dr. Matt left ?? - they made it so confusing. <br /> <br /> However, this is not the fault of writers, producers or directors (TV people in the background of money producers, they are still doing the same - just look at programs like Carnivale and Farscape who do not like originality in studios !! !!!) <br /> <br /> To end - If you have not seen it yet and call yourself a Fantasy Sci-Fi, Horror, supernatural drama ... FAN = MUST. They even said the same in SFX when browsing the set of mailboxes.
