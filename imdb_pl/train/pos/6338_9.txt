I really liked this movie, I saw the original classic several times, but I did not remember any details. I think this movie is much better than a comic, it's not as black and white as this one. I especially liked how they made him smile so completely and give the reason why he was what he was, the villain in this movie was not real Grinch, but Major, much different from the original cartoon. Jim Carrey was perfect for the role in the whole great movie for both children and adults.
