Many Zorro movies have been made for many decades, but it is a pity that one of the best is probably one of the least visible. <br /> <br /> Fighting Zorro Legion is slightly different from other Zorro movies. First of all, it is the series of the Republic in 12 chapters. This time, Zorro is not played by a studio star such as Douglas Fairbanks, Tyrone Power or Antonio Banderas, but by a similar actor Reed Hadley. Although Hadley does not cast such a strong presence on the behavior of others, he does the right job, which is helped by the fact that he is not the only hero here; as the title suggests, he has a legion to fight. <br /> <br /> Another big difference is that the setting is not in California. This story takes place in central Mexico in 1824. When a man posing for a living god encourages indigenous people of India and a band of outlaws to help him overthrow the newly created Republic of Mexico. Something Zorro and a handful of supporters are planning to do everything in their power to stop. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, there is at least one incredibly bad moment for the episode, from the horned "twang" sound effects to the absurd acting. But in general, it represents one of the best series of the Republic of All Time and probably the best Zorro. <br /> <br /> The plot is stronger than most series and never becomes unintelligible or meandering. action - fans of Indiana Jones movies will notice LOTS of pieces borrowed from this series.
