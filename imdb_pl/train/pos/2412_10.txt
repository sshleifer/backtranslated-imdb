I believe that Monarch Cove was one of the best-written and played "Drama" series that has appeared on any network for a long time. This program had huge potential and I could not wait to see it every week. This can be turned into a great Primetime soap. People are eagerly awaiting this type of acting, because we are "Reality TV" exaggerated. I miss the type of writing and acting that shows how Dallas, Knots' Landing, Dynasty, MelRose Place, etc. Delivered. Monarch Cove updated this concept quite well and expected it would only get better. You can develop a lot with these characters and they were all very interesting and engaging in themselves. It would be a waste not to study it and develop these characters after we drew and joined us in their world. I absolutely loved this program because it was mysterious, interesting and sensual without overdoing or insulting. I loved it.
