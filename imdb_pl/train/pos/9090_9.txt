"Hollywood Hotel" is a fast moving, lively, wonderfully entertaining Warner musical comedy, which is unfortunately overlooked. Keep this in mind, if only to ensure the official Tinseltown song - "Hooray for Hollywood". The score of Richard Whiting and Johnny Mercer, however, contains many other jewels, including the charming "I'm Like a Fish Out of Water" and "Silhouetted in the Moonlight". The best music number is "Let That Be a Lesson to You" in which Dick Powell and the company describe in detail the misfortunes of people who are "behind the eight", a fate that literally falls on the late burning Edgar Kennedy at the end number. The picture celebrates the Hollywood splendor and pierces it instantly, because it makes a lot of comic experiences from pompous and manic ego actors and two-faced studio directors. The cast included a group of great comedians - Allyn Joslyn as a cunning press agent, Ted Healy as Dick Powell's would-be manager, Fritz Feld as an excitable patron of the restaurant, Glenda Farrell as the sarcastic Gal Mona Marshall on Friday, Edgar Kennedy as Mabel Todd as the foolish sister Mony and Hugh Herbert as her even stupid father. The "racist" element mentioned in another review is a ten-second fragment in which Herbert appears in a black face during the pseudo "Gone With the Wind". It has a dubious taste, but should not interfere with watching other pleasures in this film, especially the Benny Goodman Quartet (including Teddy Wilson and Lionel Hampton) in what I think is the only material available on this amazing jazz combo . The sequence of "Dark Eyes" takes a bit too long and appears too late, but otherwise "Hollywood Hotel" is a gem worthy of your time and definitely a movie that should be taken into account when the DVD is released.
