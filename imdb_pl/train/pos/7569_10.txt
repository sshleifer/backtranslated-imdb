In times of our culture in which the reality revealed as a narrative is an overwhelming fiction, as we know it on a small and large screen, "Apart From That" is a film that reveals moments of real life that are more honest, fresh and innovative in the presentation than ever I have seen. The usual spoon-feeding conventions do not appear in this film, leaving the audience to sit and watch those real life moments that appear on the screen in turn. When watching a movie and even after contemplating a post, it's hard to believe that these amazing performances, in fact, perform. Every moment with a large cast of actors seemed to be revealed in everyday life. Despite this, "Apart From That" does not feel like a documentary or television television, but instead it moves to its own category, with unique cinematography and directing. I am looking forward to seeing this new category of stories continued with other films by directors Jennifer Shainin and Randy Walker. <br /> <br /> This movie must be seen.
