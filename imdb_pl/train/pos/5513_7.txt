From what I read, many people were disappointed with this film, compared to part 1. At first I could understand it, but after a moment of thought I think they are wrong. Soderbergh continues his fact-based story of Che's life, which he began in Part 1. Part 1 told the story of a revolution going from unpromising beginnings to final success. Part 2 tells the story of the revolution, which goes from unpromising beginnings to a completely unsuccessful conclusion. It is not Soderbergh's fault that these two parts of Che's life have had completely different results. He boldly decides to say it in a fairly simple way. The viewer may feel much better starting from the cinema after part 1 than part 2, but this is the reality of Che's life, and in my opinion no director's fault. The film is far from perfect. It's probably too long. At least in Part 1, we saw different aspects of the war because the partisans were successful. In Part 2, they can not catch a break and we see that their number is constantly reduced by death and capture. Che's capture and death are treated well. The film is considerably strengthened by a dialogue in Spanish. Benicio Del Toro is again perfect as a charismatic Argentinean. So if you saw part 1, you'll see a very similar story about a completely different story in part 2.
