In probably the best adventure movie of all time, four urban guys confront the anger of nature, telling a story of survival. This place is a forest Georgia, with forests, mountains and wild rivers. <br /> <br /> The director, John Boorman, decided to use the local population, not the actors, to present secondary characters. These residents give the film a depth of characterization unsurpassed in the history of the film. No "actor" from the central casting would ever come close to the unusual faces, voices or actions of these people. I do not recall a movie in which secondary characters are so realistic and colorful. As much as anything else, this rough realism makes this movie so amazing. <br /> <br /> Another motive is the theme of the film. Nature in the wild can be violent. How appropriate is the setting in the south of America. Very few places in the United States are or have been as violent as the land of Redneck. In the story of Darwinian survival of the best adapted, the film presents the idea that people are part of nature, not separated from it. <br /> <br /> "Deliverance" is largely a product of its time, when unlike today's Americans expressed their concern about the disappearing wildness. The wonderful scenery of the film, the sounds of birds, frogs, crickets and the roar of the rivers of the Bystrzyca, combined with the lack of civilization, all constitute an environmental message. And this is the next strength of the film. <br /> <br /> At the entertainment level, the tension gradually increases as the story progresses. Even in the middle of the film, the tension becomes extreme, and then it never goes away until the ending is over. Very few films can withstand this level of intensity in such a long story. <br /> <br /> Finally, the technical quality of the film is at the highest level. Directing and editing are impeccable. The cinematography is excellent. Dialogue is interesting. And acting is great. Burt Reynolds has never been better. Ned Beatty is perfectly staffed and does a great job. And Jon Voight should have been nominated for an Oscar. If there is a weak link in the film, it is music that seems shy to me. <br /> <br /> In general, "Deliverance" will almost certainly appeal to viewers who like adventure in the fresh air. Even for those who do not, rough features, acting and plot tension are enough reasons to watch this movie, one of the best in cinema history.
