This Sam Fuller movie from 1953 contains some of his best works, and his sad thing is that he could not continue to get the support of the major Hollywood studios to do his thing. The plot looks like this. Hard, hard, wide (reading a prostitute) goes on the subway one hot summer day, and Skip McCoy gets his wallet. Skip (and dame) do not realize that he has a microfilm with him, which is to be handed over to the communist spies. This initial shot without dialogs, mainly in close-ups, is beautiful, one of many that Fuller uses throughout the film. Playing a child named Candy is Jean Peters, who was never better or better looking. She forgets how beautiful she was, and she copes well with this role. Richard Widmark played the Pickpocket, and he set his style in Kiss of Death in 1947 as a crazy creeper with frightening laughter, and although it's a bit "softer" here, it's still frightening. These hard figures have soft spots here and there, but their noir and nasty all the time. The outstanding performance belongs to the wonderful Thelmy Ritter, who plays Moe the Stoolie, saving cake for her own funeral. Ritter received a well-earned Oscar nomination for her role, but lost to the boring but popular performance of Donna Reed as B girl (read prostitute) in "From Here To Eternity". Hollywood loves it when a good girl goes bad, and loves to accuse them, even though their performance is usually horrible. See, for example, Shirley Jones in "Elmer Gantry. Set among docks and dives in New York, with a clear black and white photograph of the great Joe MacDonald and a very good art direction. A set of New York subway and Widmark shack near the river is especially good. Villian of this piece, built on top of Cold War and Red Fear, is an ordinary-looking comedian, played by Richard Kiley, who is far more dangerous than a pickpocket who is a criminal, but is simply an attempt to earn a living, and above all a loyal American.
