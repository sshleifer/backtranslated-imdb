David Lynch usually creates videos that resemble jigsaws arranged in the wrong way. They are interesting to look at and think about, but they are not really in your mind. Perhaps art will always mean the most for the creator. <br /> <br /> A simple story is not a typical movie by David Lynch. Anyway, there is nothing typical in them anyway. It's a odyssey through rural America. A real journey Alvin Straight took the mower to get to his brothers' home. He traveled 300 miles from Laurens, Iowa to Mt. Zion, Wisconsin, to make up for his ill brother for previous offenses. <br /> <br /> The heart of this movie is the sweet voice of Richard Farnsworth. He brings Alvin Straight to us in a simple and honest way. The fact that the film is slow, suits Alvin's slow journey towards implementation. <br /> <br /> Alvin meets a confused and frightened young girl on the way. She is pregnant and decided to escape from her situation. After listening to Alvin, he talks about the family, reconsider. <br /> <br /> Later, Alvin witnesses a desperate woman killing a deer with her car. She complains that she killed a few and goes away. Alvin feels bad, but he's clever enough to cook expensive meat that night. <br /> <br /> Later, Alvin's mower loses brakes and almost kills him. A nice man and his wife let him stay in the yard when he fixed it. They even let him call his sweet but slow daughter, nicely played by Sissy Spacek, who was haunted by a terrible tragedy in her own past. Alvin insists on paying for the call. The man even suggests that he will be happy to lead Alvin to his brothers. Alvin refuses with thanks. <br /> <br /> While Alvin is waiting, he also goes to the bar with a kindly old man when they discuss the severity of the war and the price their soul has borne. Alvin also professes a fatal mistake he made as a sniper who persecuted him forever. <br /> <br /> Alvin also meets two arguing brothers who repaired his mower. He talks about them sensibly, calling for high labor costs and repairs. It helps them even to appreciate each other, learning from their mistakes with their brother. <br /> <br /> At night, before Alvin leaves the man's courtyard, he takes off his hat. The man tells him it is an honor to stop him and asks Alvin to write to him. This scene is perfect in its simplicity. He is honest because he is so simple and true. <br /> <br /> The journey is on and we can not help you become more involved in it. We want Alvin to reach his brothers. We want him to fix it. We want to know that this world is full of forgiveness. <br /> <br /> It was Richard Farnsworth at its best. It was his last movie and his performance was amazing. You can not fail to understand his pride, listen to his wisdom and eventually feel his pain. It becomes like a man who offers him his backyard to stay. <br /> <br /> If justice is in the afterlife, Alvin Straight, his brother and Richard Farnsworth sit together in the bar. I can imagine how they discuss their lives, regrets, hopes and joys. As Alvin says in the film: "My brother and I looked at the stars." Well, I know everyone has the best view at home.
