I just finished looking at this well-thought-out and beautifully played / directed movie. It was about whether I was going to waste my time watching a movie on Lifetime Movie Network because of terribly distracting ads. Reading previous comments convinced me to do it. In the end, the worst thing that could happen is that I can fall asleep during one of the boring, but long ads with errors. So why did I watch it? mainly because when the IMDB gives the film MEDIUM AVERAGE 5.8 STATISTICAL SOCIETY WHO is 7.3. and all. Helen Hunt continues to amaze me with his ability to take on difficult roles, adapting his main personality to fit every role. <br /> <br /> The portrait she painted in this film about a tough but perceptive man was beautifully made. When a scene requires quick, accurate, verbal contact, it can stand with any actor. Nevertheless, she is fluent in providing the amount of emotional response without saying a word based solely on facial expression and body language. Without ads, which by assumption kill the continuity of any good movie, it would be a real sharp balsam. I gave him 9.0
