I saw BLOOD OF THE SAMURAI for the first time at its premiere at the Hawaii International Film Festival. WOW! The blood simply blew us up with pure vigor, gore, vitality, gore, excitement, gore, total abundance, and even more, all in THIS GREAT FUN! Especially for those who like these Japanese samurai movies and ninja from the Japanese chambara, you ALWAYS MUST SEE THE BLOOD!
