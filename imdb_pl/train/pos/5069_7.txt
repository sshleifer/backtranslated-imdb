The film is more about Pony than Gray Owl. This also applies to aborigines, Canada, English, Gray Owl aunts and North Bay nuggets. A great story. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent movie, more like a book that raises interesting questions about cultural identity and values. The key scene is Gray Owl, who admits to Pony and her reaction. <br /> <br /> Some notes on user ratings. It should be noted that user assessments are bipolar clusters in 5 and 7; it is not for everyone, but has strong consequences. This film is underestimated and overlooked, but it will be noticed for many years. Few women have seen the movie, but they rate it more than men. Has it been properly placed on the market? <br /> <br />
