James Cagney is best known for his difficult roles of characters and gangsters, but in his career he also played quite a lot of "soft" characters. This musical is one of them and it was the first, but not the last musical film in which Cagney would play. <br /> <br /> Cagney even sings a little in this and also a lot of dancing. And it must be said that he was not mad at it. He plays this role with great confidence. Apparently he had some dancing works at an early stage of his life, before his acting career began to grow, so it's no wonder that he also played musical roles in his career. Of course, he feels at ease in this completely different genre than most people he's used to seeing. <br /> <br /> The film was directed by Lloyd Bacon, who was probably one of the best and most successful directors in this genre. His earliest musicals from the 1930s largely defined the musical genre, and he was responsible for genre films such as "42nd Street." His musicals were always light and pleasant to watch and more comical than anything else. "Musicals from the 1930s were never really associated with his singing, it was something that was more visible in musicals from the 1940s and later, mainly from the MGM studies. <br /> <br /> As usual, he has a clear and simple story, an embedded musical world, which of course is also predictable and proceeds in a formal way. Nevertheless, it is a fun and simple story that simply makes movies entertaining. Likewise, the characters and actors who portray them. It's a bit weird that at the end of the movie the whole plot line of the film is abandoned when the film starts only with the musical routine. <br /> <br /> The musical moments towards the ending of the film are also fun and well made, although I am not too fan of the genre itself. Once again, young Billy Barty appears in the music numbers. he often played little boys / children / mice and anything more at the beginning of his career, including the film musical "Gold Diggers of 1933" from the previous year. <br /> <br /> A commendable film of an early genre. <br /> <br /> 8/10
