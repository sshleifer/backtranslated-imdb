This is the funniest movie I've seen in a long time. Bad acting, bad scenario, bad scenery, bad costumes, bad camera work and bad special effects are so stupid that you feel staggering with laughter. <br /> <br /> So he will not win an Oscar, but if we have beer and friends, then you can not go wrong.
