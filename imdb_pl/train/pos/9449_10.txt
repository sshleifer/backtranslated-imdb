I watched the movie in the early hours of the morning when I should sleep. This in itself was a testimony that Deliverance was a film binding spells. I think that Boorman did a great job in directing this film. How efficiently the early stage was performed with the people of the hills and duels. It showed it as well and early as it was reserved by nature and the people in the area were simple. Example - at the end of the "duel" boy playing banjo smiled (he loved his banjo), but when Drew tried to shake the boy's hand after "duel", the kid was too reserved to answer. A trip on the river never bored you. The rape scene was brutal but necessary to show the group in this forest part of Georgia. I think that later traumatic Beatty's shock was well done. Some said that the gehenna did not affect him. I do not agree - if you really paid attention to it, he did not react during the whole action immediately after Reynolds had flipped the arrow to the attacker and driven off the toothless guy. It was misleading when Ed killed the other guy later, at the top of the cliff. It looked like the arrow was shot while Ed was curled up and expecting death, but then you realize that the arrow he shot earlier had finally worked. <br /> <br /> Anyway, a great movie, and I was hesitant between 8 and 9 in the vote, but after reading the news from the unhappy voter who gave him "1", I gave him "10". The reasoning of this person seemed to be based on personal bias rather than an objective point of view, and his vote was of course an uncorrelated attempt to lower the grade.
