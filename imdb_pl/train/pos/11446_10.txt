Right now I'm watching this movie a second time (on TV) and for the second time I got into it when I was working for an hour (I think I saw 2 minutes this time). This movie is really impressive, the way Goldsworthy is looking for nature, changing nature in a way that you would never have thought about, really is amazing. This whole movie gives you a warm feeling of seeing with such love playing around the world around him. Or just seeing his hands covered in dirt and broken fingernails just touch you.
