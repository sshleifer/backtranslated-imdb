"Gandhi as husband and father?" Was always discussed by people in India. "Gandhi ... my father" is a story that only a few would know such details. Certainly an insight into Gandhi's personal life. <br /> <br /> Generally, I liked the film with the story and cinematography. Jariwala, Akshay Khanna and Shefali Shah did a good job. Most of the scenes would be pretty wallpaper on the desktop ... worth recommending. Traditional Indian folk music as a scoring in some parts of the movie gives a good sense of events. <br /> <br /> However, I did not like the style of the narrative. In a few points I found a tone that was too dramatized. <br /> <br /> Generally good job Anil Kapoor Productions. I recommend it as "must-watch-once". 8/10
