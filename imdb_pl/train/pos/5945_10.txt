Let me explain one thing. For the most part, the mentality of those who run the Hollywood show, to be honest, immediately supports me, and even more in detail, regarding the treatment of beloved, iconic comic characters. Why? Well, let's take a typical scenario of Hollywood board meetings to illustrate if we ... <br /> <br /> Head # 1, "Hey, there's a lot of dollars you can get from superhero movies these days." <br /> <br /> Leader No. 2 "Good point, let's make one out of a hurry! ?? We will make a happy immersion in the hat and I will choose a superhero randomly to resist the movie! (The bath takes place and the famous superhero character is pulled out) <br /> <br /> Head # 1 "Great! Who can play a role now? <br /> <br /> Executive Director # 2 "Who is the big money star at the moment?" <br /> <br /> Leader # 1 * * the name of a big actor * is the thing this week. <br /> <br /> Head # 2 "But does it really fit the role? I mean, it does not look like a character at all. <br /> <br /> Head # 1 "Who cares ?! It's a great name; Anyway, we'll make a movie with him. <br /> <br /> Head # 2 "You're right! And besides, we'll fill the whole movie to be full of special effects to appease the moronic masses that no one will ever challenge! <br /> <br /> The above scenario clearly illustrates one of the reasons why you generally hate the most modern movies about superheroes. The whole style, no substance and just pathetic casting of cult tropes. Of course, to be fair, there are exceptions to the above rule; when does Hollywood do it right? take the casting of the original (and still easily the best!) Superman; Christopher Reeve, and more recently Patrick Stewart and Sir Ian McKellen in X-Men movies. <br /> <br /> But back to the general negative features presented today by Hollywood? ... would not it be great if our studio directors had ALWAYS chosen actors who really matched the roles? In this less-than-perfect world, one filmmaker believes in it or not, throwing actors based on their true resemblance to their comic counterparts. Her name is Sandy Collora. Unfortunately (but usually) Hollywood has not yet allowed Collor to direct a full-length feature film, but fortunately for us, he gave us tempting glimpses of what the final result in the form of two (so far) short-character super hero functions would look like. One of them is the excellent Batman: Dead End, and the other is a trial trailer for a completely fictional movie called Worlds Finest. <br /> <br /> Well, let's not have our words here? this is absolutely amazing stuff! <br /> <br /> The cast of the winner Mr. Universe and the male model of Michael O'Hearn (who looked similarly amazing, but he was completely wasted in a weak Barbarian) makes it the best choice to play the iconic man of steel. In fact, in terms of physical similarity, there has undoubtedly never been a closer approach to the comic. <br /> <br /> Added to this Clark Bartram came back to life after his wonderful performance as the Dark Knight in Batman: Dead End; Again, another extremely reasonable part of the casting! <br /> <br /> What can I say? ?? If it was really a full-length movie! The leadership of the studio in Hollywood? attention! That's how it should be done! <br /> <br /> As the last note, once again I am intrigued by the very divided reactions that this short film has caused fans. Simply put, the most severe and violent reactions against him appear again (as in the case of Batman: Dead End) from the younger, less experienced audience; fact betrayed by their slightly grammatically primitive tirades and liberal use of the base diction. Such an unfortunate state of closed mind is a really sad phenomenon that our above-mentioned directors in Hollywood undoubtedly derive great satisfaction from. After all, the same misguided people are probably exactly the same CGI addicts who push out popcorn, who enjoy the most of the crap that Hollywood is throwing out of the flood.
