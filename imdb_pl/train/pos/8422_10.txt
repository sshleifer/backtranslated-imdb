The film about the Russian revolution calls for the general to be played. However, it is not an ordinary addition. This is Serguis Alexander, a former commander of the Russian army who is now forced to experience the same scene in which he suffered a professional and personal tragedy to please a director who was once a revolutionary in Russia and was humiliated by Alexander. Now the time has come for this broken man to finally "win" his second-lasting battle. It is one powerful film with the meticulous director of Leon Sternberg, ensuring the greatest irony of Alexander's character in all possible ways. Jannings deserved his Oscar for his role in the very moving performance of playing the general at its summit and in its deepest valley. Powell gives a sinister support because the director with the revenge and Brent is perfect in his role, and her face and movements show as much expression as Jannings' love. Everything around the glow. Rating, 10.
