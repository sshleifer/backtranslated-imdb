I consider this film very good. The premise is quite ingenious and as a viewer I was attracted with the development of the character. Stimulation is very good for those who like to think - hidden from the viewer early enough and there are questions that can be answered later, creating a well thought out and very satisfying film, both intellectual and action point of view. <br /> <br /> It looks like some people were looking for a non-stop roller coaster with this movie - one of those that are loading from the gate. It would be more analogous to one of these stands, which first takes you slowly up the hill - creating a great feeling - and ultimately, in my opinion, is more satisfying for the initially founded foundation. <br /> <br /> A great movie.
