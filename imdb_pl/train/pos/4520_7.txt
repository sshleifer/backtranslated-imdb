A bit too long and at the end, this comedy is absolutely delightful, never condescending or ridiculous to look at the problems of a "strong" who likes to wear women's clothes at night. br /> Julie Walters is beautiful as always, but Adrian Pasdar is completely reliable and steals the film. He (she) is absolutely gorgeous in high heels and silk stockings.
