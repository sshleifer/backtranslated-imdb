At the time the Lady from Shanghai was born, the marriage of Orson Welles and Rita Hayworth fell apart. The film was just as difficult for Welles to revive the old flames and create a classic noir. Not well received at this time, the Lady of Shanghai has gained critical recognition over the years. Better with age better. <br /> <br /> Welles is an Irish sailor Michael O'Hara who in a memorable night saves the beautiful Rita Hayworth from three bandits in Central Park. Sparks fly, but then it comes to rubbing, it turns out that you are the wife of a crippled but genius criminal attorney Everett Sloane. Nevertheless, Sloane clearly likes Welles and employs him to avoid his yacht. <br /> <br /> So far this movie has started to sound like Gilda. If Orson had seen Guild and was not thinking about his male member at this point, he would return to the seamen's hall in Lower Manhattan. Instead, he engages in a charming network or intrigue and is considered to be related to two murders, and Sloane as his outstanding adviser. <br /> <br /> Welles, for whatever reason, decided that his wife would be blonde in this movie. Apparently Harry Cohn hit the roof when Rita was known around the world for her copper red hair. It could have spoiled him in the picture when he joined the head of the studio, who saw how the vision of the independent movie Welles threatens their power. <br /> <br /> Screenwriter Glenn Anders plays Grisby, partner Sloane dude, he winds up the corpse. The second corpse that is here is Ted DeCorsia, a private investigator who is trying to get into business for himself. <br /> <br /> It's a good noir thriller, showing Rita in her best style, even if she was blonde here. The final shooting in the room of mirrors is beautifully displayed, but I do not recommend watching it if you are on any controlled substance.
