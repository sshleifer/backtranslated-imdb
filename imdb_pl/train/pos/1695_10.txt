Usually the best way to irritate me in a movie is to add a reference to Orson Welles. But here is the sci-fi comedy quoting the broadcast of "War of the Worlds" ... and that is gold! The very idea of ​​a small group of small, aggressive and stupid aliens confused with children in Halloween costumes is great. Do not be fooled into believing that because it seems to be a movie for children, it's unassuaged - it is not, there are many hidden treasures ... A jewel!
