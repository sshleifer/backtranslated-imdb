So the thriller with Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis with David Duchovny and Michelle Forbes on their way west. This last couple is investigating the famous crime scene for an upcoming book; Pitt is a serial killer on the lama (without Dave's knowledge), and Juliette is his poor, not entirely companion. It's a good cast, and history moves, but Pitt is not terrifying as a serial killer, although it's one of his better early roles. The best thing here is Michelle Forbes, who can always shine, whether in the roles in the "Homicide Department: Life on the Street" or in the short series "Wonderland". <br /> <br /> Voting: 6
