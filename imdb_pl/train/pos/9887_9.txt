"Erendira" is a movie from Mexico, which is rarely mentioned. The movie only exists in low quality VHS format. It is a pity that this movie was not released on DVD. "Erendira" is stunning and beautiful thanks to magical realistic paintings. "Erendira" is based on a story from the novel "100 years of loneliness". Erendira constantly dreams and accidentally burns her grandmother's house. Her evil grandmother played by Irene Papas forces her to prostitution to pay for the damage. The whole city gets a piece of Erendira. Although the topic sounds harsh, the film does not use sexuality. It's done in a mature, artistic way. The film also has amazing costumes. Some of the most surrealistic aspects of the film that stand out the most are origami birds that turn into real birds, and a golden orange with a diamond inside. Erendira is an amazing movie in which you can even feel humor. This is definitely a movie that deserves a special DVD edition. As they would say in espanol, "Es muy muy bien !!! Excellente!
