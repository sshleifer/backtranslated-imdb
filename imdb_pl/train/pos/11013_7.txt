There were many films produced by Hollywood during the war, which were intended to arouse the support of our soldiers from the public. Some who see it today may reject it or simply perceive it as propaganda, which they are technically, but have a positive character and aim to unite the nation. This film is quite an effective and entertaining example of the genre - it has a fairly realistic scenario and good production values. Pat O'Brien plays almost the same character, which he played in MANY other films (you know, a tough, polite but stomping guy). Randolph Scott is, as always, knowledgeable and entertaining, and the other additions are excellent (look for young Robert Ryan as one of the bombardiers in training). Although the story resembles several other films about our pilots and crews, the film is well-made so that it is interesting and not too far-fetched. Perhaps with the exception of the very end - where the film is a bit exaggerated, but also VERY satisfying. The only serious negative, and mainly for villains, is that part of the footage is a bit sloppyly integrated with the film and "nuts" like me, who are both history teachers and airplane enthusiasts, will probably notice it - everyone else will not notice.
