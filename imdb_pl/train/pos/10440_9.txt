This movie is intelligent. That is, more than most other films, it goes beyond the smallest common denominator - stupid people probably will not appreciate it. History is also based on dialogue. It has some similarities to Lost in Translation, although Before Sunrise is much brighter, less abstract and simply much better. <br /> <br /> Scenario, characters and even a somewhat surreal atmosphere seem completely realistic. The actors are doing great. I rarely saw a movie in which the script and acting were perfectly melted together. <br /> <br /> Dialogue goes into very personal matters, with the risk of becoming a bit higher. However, it remains on the right side almost all the time, although I found some uncomfortable and embarrassing moments. Balancing on this thin line requires outrageously talented actors. Sometimes it gives great results, and overall this movie is simply amazing! Only very, very rarely is "love" in films presented in a way that I consider credible and realistic. Each time it is achieved, the result is fantastic. I think that the stunning and seemingly timeless beauty of the female main actress has helped in this respect. In this movie it still looks stunning, 12 years later. <br /> <br /> It's just a jewel of a film that can not be missed. One of the best movies I've seen since the 90s!
