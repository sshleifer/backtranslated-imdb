Sabrina the Teenage Witch was one of my favorite shows of life T.V: I used to watch everyday episodes when I came back from school. So far, I think I've watched each episode at least once and the whole series 3 or 4 times. Melissa Joan Hart plays the perfect teenager / witch with normal teen problems, which we can all relate to. She is funny, smart, sociable, funny and much more. Caroline Rhea and Beth Broderick perfectly match the role of Aunt Sabrina. Zelda, an intelligent scientist, and Hilda crazy, crazy, perfectly balances Sabrina's life. Although I have to agree that the school years are not as good as in high school, but that does not mean they were not good. I think the ending was amazing, although it was not what I was hoping for, it made sense and I liked it so much. :)
