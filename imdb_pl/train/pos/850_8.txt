MATADOR (2005) *** _ Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinnear, Hope Davis, Philip Baker Hall, Dylan Baker. Brosnan gives one of his best non-Bondian roles as a middle-aged killer in the mid-middle-age crisis during a mission in Mexico, where he befriends a square but nice American businessman (Kinnear in his most polite company) and discovers that he is more to life than death. Newbie filmmaker Richard Shepard made his debut on the big screen, showing a sharp black comedy with a sharp eye on visual details and nuanced dialogue and character development that make him the talent to watch this fresh air in a comedy of a friend - Formula that distorts what is expected of his buddy tracks and allowing Brosnan to get out of devilish joy. An unknown hit of a sleeping jewel.
