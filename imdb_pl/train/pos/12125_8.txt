I saw the movie again and noticed how close it is to the novel, if we ignore the part about Cary's childhood [Leslie Howard]. Given that <br /> <br /> at this time, you can not show much on the screen, [the thing is not that there are many things in the novel] obsession with Mildred [Bette Davis] is very well conveyed to the public. I recommend this movie to anyone who has ever fallen in love with another person and the other party tried to use it. I read that Maugham was asked to record a novel for sale, but when he started in the studio, he began to cry and could not finish more than a few lines, and the whole project was thrown away. You can say that the novel is written from the heart, and the film is a good adaptation of at least part of it <br /> <br />.
