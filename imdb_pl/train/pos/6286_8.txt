60 seconds have passed. where I started, it keeps you in a movie with good action and cool cars. people say that this is not a good movie, I do not agree that it has some bad parts, but there is no action movie. I gave him 8 out of 10 reasons for action and comic relief if you like Rock or Face Off, than this movie is a good dose of the frame but also one of the most rated actors in my mind - Roy Lindo. I think that sometimes people look far into the movies sometimes, when you have to sit down, enjoy the movie and after the words ask yourself if they have achieved what they show. that is, if it was an action pact where it was concerned. or where they are trying to make a movie to change the way a movie is made and win every prize, right? I think they did an action movie that they decided to do, give it a chance and you will not be sorry.
