Intense actors such as Bruce Dern, Jason Patrick and Rachel Ward combine to make this contemporary film a winner. Of the three, I do not know who was the most interesting because they all offer good performances and intriguing characters. <br /> <br /> Patric makes a narrative in this noir, playing a former boxer and a mental patient. Wow, that's what makes an interesting guy! He looks stupid, but he is not. Ward is a skimpy, attractive, cynical, intelligent and compassionate conspirator of a kidnapping plan that goes wrong. Bruce Dern is also in the mix, and Dern is never fascinated by any film. <br /> <br /> The film can be considered slightly lower for the average viewer, but I found it fascinating ... and I do not like to depress films normally. What I found was a kind of bizarre crime movie. Look and see if you agree. This is quite an unknown movie, which should not have such a status, because it is simply a good story and well made.
