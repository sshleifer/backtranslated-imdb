I picked up the movie without cover and did not even know what it was, but when I watched it, I was laughing. This is now one of my favorite movies of all time. Rusty and guys have created a masterpiece, which I highly recommend to anyone with a sense of humor. Thank you Rusty for giving us something to laugh.
