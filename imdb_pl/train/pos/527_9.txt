It is no surprise that the screenwriter / director Michael Powell considered "A Matter of Life and Death" to be their favorite of their films. This colorful romantic adventure, published in the wake of the Second World War, would only be a tonic for a traumatized nation that needs a good lift. <br /> <br /> After a series of other patriotic war movies, "Archers made him the most bizarre, skittish and the most patriotic. British, in principle, upholding the British heritage (Shakespeare, beer, fair play, good manners), is also clearly Americanized in its baroque compositions, technical ingenuity and a great multiethnic cast. <br /> <br /> Oddly reflects in 1946 the classic "It's a Wonderful Life", AMOLAD opens on a big firmament, with one of those cheerful readers proclaiming the earth and the heavens and what a great, wonderful world we live. <br /> <br /> Then he goes inside the British cockpit, hit hard, stirred up in flames and with the other pilot already dead. It sounds like a misunderstanding, but soon the connection with it will become clear thanks to the events that will follow. <br /> <br /> Approaching nearly 5 minutes, the exchange of rapid fires between British pilot Peter (David Niven) and American radio makes contact with June (Kim Hunter) is breathtaking. Piotr, resigned from dying, exhausts, however, a lot of vigor, charm and exuberant beliefs, and his warm attachment to June ends with the mutual exchange of "I love you". <br /> <br /> Holding on to the magic of the moment, Peter, by supervising his Conductor 71, whose task was to transport him to the "Other World", escapes death and is on the beach. Later, he meets with June on a bike and immediately adjusts the body to the voice. <br /> <br /> But being aware of their mistake, the higher court wants to send Peter back and order the French conductor (Maurice Goring) to come down to recover him. But Peter is adamant to live because of the mistake of June and the conductor, and deliberately guards his corner. <br /> <br /> Peter's fate ultimately rests with the heavenly court and the American prosecutor (Raymond Massey) whose bench consists of several dead war heroes and elegant British delegates. A surrealist attempt that breaks down b / w back into the rich Technicolor, after the verdict is announced, may be a dream, but the final shot in the hospital confirms the predictable outcome. <br /> <br /> Abstract, filling the frame "stairway to heaven" is used twice: the first time in b / w, when he lifts Peter and his mysterious French guard up, crossing giant statues of potential attorneys Peter in the process, including Abraham Lincoln and Plato. For the second time, gently lit colorful stairs provide a setting for what is an iconic image in the cinema - Peter and June froze next to each other, their amazing eyes fixed on the frame, their fate sealed. <br /> <br /> The unusual feeling that separates Peter and June never becomes bland or talkative; he is treated with nobleness and conviction that the couple is already adequate enough to be married and must simply convince people of his love so that she can keep them together. <br /> <br /> A French conductor who can freeze time and body of people, fills many key moments, lecturing Peter about history and his playful tricks, tweaking Peter's book "Top 100 Game Tricks" and his cup coffee. <br /> <br /> How was it inspired visually like other Powell / Pressburger collaborations, it was the first time that they combined the color with b / w ?? the latter have a happy quality when used in the scenes of the sky, and both are equally captivating. <br /> <br /> An excellent script more than suits the imagination of the set, with a dialogue that sounds so instant that it does not seem to have been written or made on the screen. Funny and witty, writing Powell / Pressburgera deserves equal recognition with the power of color and composition. <br /> <br /> Made in 1946, "A Matter of Life and Death" is one of those films that oppose his age, looking fresh and imaginative, even at this age in which CGI would destroy his artificial effects , probably depriving them of an emotional miracle. <br /> <br /> Other disturbing changes would include the need to shorten the average seconds of cutting and the inevitable request to shorten the dialogue to keep a small span of attention of most recipients. Powell intertwines a spell that subconsciously absorbs the viewer from the first frame, giving him the freedom to experiment with images without revealing the logical development of Peter's situation.
