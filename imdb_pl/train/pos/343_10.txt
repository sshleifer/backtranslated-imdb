Katherine Heigl, Marley Shelton, Denise Richards, David Boreanaz. Even before I knew what the movie was about, those names were enough to get me involved. Great, talented and popular, it's the performers you need to pay attention to. <br /> <br /> Ok, where to start. We already know what the film is about. Five beautiful girls attacked by a "romantic" serial slass, a guy they rejected during the school dance 13 years ago. His trademarks are subtle threats of death hidden in the cards of Valentine, chocolates infected with a worm and bleeding nose. His favorite weapon: take ax, knife, electric drill, bow and arrow, hot iron, etc. Ok, so basically a horror with a nice, twisted sense of sexuality. <br /> <br /> Horror movies should not be Shakespeare, but I will not go there. I love horror movies, but not all of them. This one, I love it. Is there with my other favorites. It's funny, sexy and scary. The killer's mask is childishly frightening, and seeing an amor shooting from the bow and arrow into the victim is really strange. Acting is on top: Denise Richards, Marley Shelton and David Boreanaz have a great time. I really wanted to see much more Katherine Heigl. I am one of her biggest fans and I would like to see how soon she will do the main job. Jessica Capshaw is a very talented actress, and Jessica Cauffiel performs the role of blonde, which she perfected in Urban Legend 2. The smaller parts were also good; Hedy Buress was hoot ('bleedmedry.com') and this younger version of Denise Richards looked terrible like her. <br /> <br /> The most important events: Every scene of death had a special distinction. The most terrifying of them is the opening stage in the morgue. The hottub scene, though ridiculous, was well made. And the audiovisual labyrinth was sinister. The soundtrack is great, with terrifying music and some great alternative melodies. <br /> <br /> Lowpoint: I felt like the killer was not fired enough. during the culmination. I also thought that the culmination was really undetermined, but still funny. <br /> <br /> The phrase at the end was not so much a surprise, but I'm really happy that the filmmakers decided to save this whole "Explaining deadly routine". <br /> <br /> I do not like telling people which movies should see, but if someone asked me to choose a horror that I thought was really worth seeing, then Valentine would. <br /> <br /> My rating: 10/10 (Bullseye!)
