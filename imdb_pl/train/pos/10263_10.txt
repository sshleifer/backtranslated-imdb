"House of Games" is an unmistakably constructed movie, and one of the few films I've seen made me stare at the screen with amazement at how smart and unexpected it ends. I first saw it on video a few years ago after reading a review of Roger Ebert, who announced it the best movie of 1987. I had doubts, mainly because it is not as well known as other movies from this year. Boy, I was surprised. It was one of the smartest, best-written movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The screenplay is a piece of work, not only in terms of the plot (which revolves around and turns the rug from you only when you think you have all invented it), but also in terms of character development. During my second viewing, I began to realize that the Mamet scenario does not only work as a clever transition movie, but that every story development contributes to our understanding of the characters and their motivations. The climax of the film is particularly effective because it is absolutely unavoidable. This is naturally due to what we know about characters, and therefore is more than just an arbitrary end to the turn. The performances of Lindsay Crouse and Joe Mantegny are also very suitable for this. I can not imagine any actor other than Mantegna, playing the role of Mike, and Crouse plays his role with adequate restraint to suggest a repressed criminal way of thinking. Their work and the extraordinary scenario of Mameta form one of the biggest films of the 80s. It really has to be seen.
