Does anyone know what kind of John T pickup ran? I look like Ford from the mid-1970s. This movie is my favorite, as well as my wife. It was the first memorable movie we saw as a marriage. The pickup is interesting because it's similar to the first truck I went and recently I found another similar one. I would like to bring back the pickup. I need to remind the one from the movie. Also, the music was amazing and the acting was great. Where and what is the woman who portrayed her aunt John? Did John have a double stuntman on the tower when he almost fell down? Also this year Mustang led DebrÄ™ W. He looked like a model from the 1960s. Thanks,
