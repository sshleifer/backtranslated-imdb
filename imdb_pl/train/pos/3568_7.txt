This film takes Cinderella's story to the beginning of the 1950s and makes it eccentric, using the Isle of Man as a backdrop. The Ugly Sisters have become incredibly charming English high school girls and, along with Kathleen Turner, as a stepmother flutter in a variety of great costumes from the era. The story is slightly changed compared to the traditional version: at the beginning it is strangely connected to the story of "King Lear", and in the later stages of Cinderella it is rather assertive than usual. It looks great and works pretty well all over the world, but sometimes it's the best.
