I was about thirteen when this movie was released on television. It is much better in action than most movies. Martin Sheen is perfect and although Nick Nolte has a small part, he also provides excellent support. Vic Morrow as a villain is wonderful. <br /> <br /> When Sheen "tests the water" in his Ford "34" (COOL) along a mountain road, it's spectacular! <br /> <br /> Grand end. <br /> <br /> I am disappointed with the low voting I received. I think that the younger generations are more interested in the trash that now appears. <br /> <br /> Good taste escapes the masses!
