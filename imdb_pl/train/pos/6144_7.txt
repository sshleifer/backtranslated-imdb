I saw it in my childhood in The Wonderful World of Disney, so I did not remember much. When I last watched it, I sat there thinking, "That's the weirdest thing I've ever seen." <br /> <br /> The "traveling" scenes look like something caused by an LSD overdose. Animated characters are mainly weirdly colorful / voiced versions of the Jungle and Robin Hood characters. I noticed some things not really Disney: children were threatened on the knife edge and prostitutes (during the song Portobello Road). <br /> <br /> It was very funny, although the music numbers were long and I do not see much of children bored. Also, the subject was a bit dark because it was set during World War II.
