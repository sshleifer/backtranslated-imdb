One of the most current and engaging documentaries you'll ever see. Although the story takes place in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas, it provides an intimate look at the political dynamics that prevails in the western hemisphere. This film is basically another chapter in the history of "US support, the coup in Latin America," but this film chronicles in real time, which can happen when the poorest people are armed with unity, political and courage! <br /> <br /> The political insights of this film are invaluable. There are clear examples of private media as a powerful force of mass deception and propaganda. We see poor people from Caracas grappling with the brutal reality of "American politics." You get a clear sense of impending doom if people can not cope with the glaring tyranny suddenly and illegally imposed on them by the conspirators. We also see arrogance and fascism, supported by the CIA, private media, plutocrats and generals who plotted to bring Venezuela back under Washington's rule. Although well led by President Hugo Chavez, the inhabitants of Caracas are forced to act without him, after Chavez was kidnapped by renegade generals. Their answer is the top of the film. If someone is looking for a perfect picture of what the US government, Hugo Chavez and revolutionary Venezuela is about, this movie is the one!
