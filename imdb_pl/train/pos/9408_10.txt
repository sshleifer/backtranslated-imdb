Often labeled as the 'Man in a White Suit' comedy, it's more than a chuckle here and there. <br /> <br /> Sidney Stratton is an eccentric inventor who has no chance for the world to flourish his inventions, because no one pays attention to him, he is just a strange, strange man from work about this place. After bluffing in a textile factory, Birnley uses his laboratory to achieve the goal of inventing a fabric that not only does not wear out, it also never has to be cleaned! At first he is proclaimed as a genius, and those who ignored him in the beginning suddenly want his big piece, but then the industry's doom punches go up and they quickly gain something more terrifying. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie is very funny, in fact some of the scenes are fun, but the satirical edge of the movie raises it above ordinary for me. Contradictions about the arrival of technology are crucial here, do we want inventions that will save us the fate of closing industry? You just have to see what happened to the coal industry in the UK to know what I mean. The decade that was filmed in the film is crucial because the creation of nuclear weapons has become more than just a rumor, science has been proceeding in frightening new proportions. You watch this movie and see a quick turn of events for the main character of Stanley, from the hero to the enemy in one foul, the victim of his own quest for a better humanity! It is so dark that the film should be called The Man In The Black Suit. <br /> <br /> To be honest I can not find anything wrong with this movie, the script by Roger MacDougall, John Dighton and director Alex Mackendrick can be shot today and it would not be out of place to be the focus and the thinking that he has. The sound and surroundings are enormous, the direction is smooth, and the tonal shift cleverly handled by Mackendrick. Some of the scenes are simply marvelous, especially torn to the strings of the heart and evoke a certain scene in David Lynch's "Man of the Elephant" some 29 years later, and yet after such a breakdown the film still manages to blink, like the genius it is Alec Guinness, closes the film, so that the viewers wonder not only about the future of Stanley, but also about the rest of us in this fast-growing world. <br /> <br /> A timeless masterpiece, thematically and as a work of art, 10/10.
