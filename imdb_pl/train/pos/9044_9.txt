I recently saw this movie due to the recent success of Jake from Brokeback Mountain. I thought I would see movies that I missed. I did not have any expectations that I would enter the movie, so I was surprised that I missed the movie altogether. It is a thrilling story about father and son, as well as a story about weaker grounds. I even threw a tear in the finale of this wonderful story. This film appeals to all ages. The only reason I give him 9 out of 10 is that he slows down a bit, but eventually he comes back strong. Acting was great, the story was great, and the pictures were captivating, considering the film's setting. GO TO THIS FILM! Rent it, buy it, watch it, LOVE it! I know yes!
