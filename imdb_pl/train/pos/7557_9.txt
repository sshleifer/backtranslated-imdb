Gender Bender the Limerick: <br /> <br /> A man or a woman? Who knows? <br /> <br /> It turns out that "it" is both. <br /> <br /> Sleeping in clay <br /> <br /> Then everyone left <br /> <br /> In one of their UFOs. <br /> <br /> Gender Bender is another great episode of the first season. I like this one because history is one where you are never sure what will happen next. It is completely original. Teaser is very funny with close-up eyes and reflections of disco lights. I really have to learn this trick with the thumb that a person dealing with sex does. I really like the atmosphere in the small Kindred village, and Mulder and Scully are spinning in the middle of the night. This is very exciting. This is one of my favorite episodes of the first season. I think I like it so much as it turns out to be strangers at the end and the left crop circle. Many people see this as a non-mythological episode, such as "The Unnatural" or "Space," but I think that it can be easily seen as related to mythology. Perhaps the person practicing sex was similar to the space bounty hunter and could look like everyone else. What? In any case, I give the segment 9 to 10.
