sammo must have 10 out of 10 in this movie because he has everything. great story, great fights, great heroes and great scenes. <br /> <br /> in this movie, we see Dick wei chow and chong fat behind a billy. sammo takes over the leu karung leung in the casino, sammo loses the fight, but what a fight is full of high-speed action and elements of comedy thrown in. <br /> <br /> some great and touching moments in the film, lam ching ying appears in the episode and is killed - gutted. <br /> <br /> the final sequence will make you reach for the scroll button as one of the best battles I've ever seen. sammo takes over a lot of guys and ends up with a quadruple to billy chow.
