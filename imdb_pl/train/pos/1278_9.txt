"The Last Big Thing" is a wonderful satirical film that sardonically stimulates pop culture to the level of humorous self-printing. Characters are so interesting and fun that they can laugh / sympathize with them. Which leads me to enter characters that I liked best ... <br /> <br /> Simon Geist is a man in his thirties who is creating a pop-culture editorial magazine entitled "The Next Big Thing" The thing is, this magazine does not really exist, and it's just an excuse for Simon to get closer to the actors, interviewing them, just to stupidly pat them, insulting their way of buying in pop culture. His real-life friend, Darla, also writes a magazine (which is real), which is mainly related to her and Simon, as well as her and her father. Darla is a really nice (or disgusting) character, depending on how you perceive her subdued neurotic behavior. Magda is a prostitute, a character I liked the most. Brent is a flat character who does not matter much to him, much like Tedra, the queen of music videos for many rock bands with an assessment of B. Still, these characters connect a very interesting network. And this movie questions all the motivations that people have for what they do and why they do it. It's a great movie and I suggest you see it if you're in a crowd of independent artists. Mark my words! <br /> <br />
