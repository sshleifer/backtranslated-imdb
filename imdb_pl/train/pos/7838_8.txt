If you're a fan of T-Rex / Marc Bolan, I recommend checking it out. It shows the capricious side of Marc Bolan, and also Ringo Starr, apparently having fun, making some scenes that are not part of the concert, but it's nice to watch, leaving you feeling like only people, and when a talented musician shows up, both funny and professional, which impresses and makes an impression on screaming girls. Watching him at a concert, you would never know that being a rock star is a job, but you just have a great time playing great songs with some good friends like Elton John and Ringo Starr appearing in some live performances. It's true that there are a few songs missing that I would like to see there, but like every album, it can not have everything. I just bought it in 2006, but if I knew it appeared in 1972, I would definitely buy it years ago. Sad and strange that a man with so many songs about his love for cars would never learn to drive a car and die in a car accident!
