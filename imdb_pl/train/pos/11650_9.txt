The most-anticipated film of 2002. After three and a half years of hibernation, Rajini played in this film. The noise for this movie was too high ... <br /> <br /> This is not a typical Rajini movie, in this movie it also gives some spiritual messages. But it also contains typical Rajini actions, style, songs, etc. It is a good entertainment film and gives good news. <br /> <br /> Because of the script, I rate this film as Good instead of Perfect. It must watch the movie. Do not miss it!
