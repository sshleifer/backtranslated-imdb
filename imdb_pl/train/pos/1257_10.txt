I have read many reviews about this movie and I have to say "What's the matter with you people?!?!" It was a great movie! I thought this movie was great from beginning to end, and the story was very well told. I am convinced that people who did not like this movie did not pay attention to the film. There are many very important scenes that, if you do not pay attention, will be confused, and the following scenes may not make sense. I urge everyone who did not like this movie to watch it again and watch it for yourself so that you can really get your attention. This story was perfect for me and, as I said, it was very well told. Each scene in the movie makes sense and everything fits together at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> All the actors have done a fantastic job! Sean Connery has always been very good at his role. Laurence Fishburne was wonderful as Tanny Brown, playing a very interesting character. Kate Capshaw was also a nice touch and looks fantastic. Blair Underwood was a nice surprise, I did not expect anything great from him, but he managed to achieve a great performance. Ed Harris was a real gem in the movie. It's really a sick game and it really makes you see how distracted it is. Watch his eyes in his scenes, just great !!! There is also a very young Scarlett Johansson (as Kate) in one of her first roles ... this is not a bad place to start. Great cast in this movie! <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who likes a cast or just likes thrillers. It's a great movie and you should see it. Do not listen to the opinions of other people, go to the movie and draw your own conclusions. I hope you will watch this movie and I hope you enjoy it the same way as me. Thanks for reading, <br /> <br /> -Chris
