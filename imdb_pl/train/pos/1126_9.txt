My interest was raised as I browsed and saw the name of Iphigenia. My name is Eugenia, so I thought, OK, let's see what it is. I'm glad that I stayed on the channel. What a wonderful, wonderful story. Drama, sadness, some of the best activities, but a great time to be. I watch it and it makes me sad because of all the nonsense that the film industry is making, and these beautiful little jewels are lost. Try Iphigenii and I hope you like it the way I do. Even my children (27, 25, 20 and 17 years old) could enjoy it. It starts slowly, but the drama is built and you will be drawn into history. Watching this beautiful movie made me want to cover myself with a more Greek tragedy and pathos.
