This German document, in English, refers to Scottish environmental sculptor Andy Goldsworthy. He creates art from objects he finds in nature. For example, at the beginning of the movie, we see him taking parts of icicles and "gluing them" with a small amount of moisture into a serpentine shape that seems to repeatedly pass through a vertical rock. <br /> <br /> Of course, icicles are melting, but passing is part of most of Goldsworthy's work. He goes to the party and feels it, deciding intuitively what to do on this day. He talks about "dialogue" with the rocks and other materials he works with, trying to work * with *, not against them. They can be stones, flowers, leaves or sticks. The sculpture may last several minutes or years, and may not even last long enough to finish and photograph. Work seems to be more a process than a goal. <br /> <br /> Film and work are beautiful, inspiring and encouraging to think. It moves quite slowly, which is appropriate for the material, but you should be sure that you will go when you sleep well. But go, if you have the opportunity. <br /> <br /> Search the Internet for a few other sites about Andy Goldsworthy or read about his local sculpture at Stanford University. There are also several books with photographs of his sculptures. <br /> <br /> My thoughts: Skip reading this part if you want to find out what this movie means to you completely independently. I remember some ideas that came to my mind while watching a movie about which I thought I would share with those who are still reading. First, the transitory character of many works by Andy Goldsworthy reminded me of the natural outflow and flow of human life. We were born, we live and eventually die. It's natural and also part of Goldsworthy's art. <br /> <br /> The second thought was to be a terrified way that Goldsworthy managed to integrate his passion and work with life so much. Most of us have a job that is tolerated at best, a life we ​​hardly notice, and passions that we really want to spend more time if we even remember what they are. Andy Goldsworthy managed to create an amalgam of all those aspects of his life that look as if they work very well and are alive for him and for him. Wow. <br /> <br /> Seen August 28, 2002.
