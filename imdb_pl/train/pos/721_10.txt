ROCK N ROLL HIGH SCHOOL has a special place in my heart because it introduced me to Ramones. I was too young in the mid-70s to be very aware of them, although I had an older cousin who was a big fan at the time. I finally saw RNRHS on television one afternoon in the mid-1980s, when I was fifteen and I was laughing all the time. (Is not every high school student's dream to throw out his school and blow up, all set to a rock soundtrack?) I made a later movie release a year or two later and watched Ramones concert sequences over again thinking, "Man, these guys are kicking ass! I need to check out some of their albums! "The rest is history. Twenty years, many Ramones / cassettes / CDs and three Ramones performances later, are still one of my favorite bands, and the RNRHS still breaks me down. Now, when Joey, Dee Dee and Johnny left us (R.I.P. everything) at least we have this movie and lots of great music to remember.
