I saw this movie when I was a small kid on TV (thank you to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) and I had nightmares about him after many years. <br /> <br /> Trnka was one of the mentors of Bratislava Pojara, one of Canada's best animators of the National Film Council. Pojar was in turn a mentor and collaborator of the great Drouin. If you like Trutka, you should see "Night Angel". <br /> <br /> The symbolism is obvious but cleverly used. The oppositions of beauty and life (plants) are opposed to anonymity in a glove. Poor marionette hero is condemned despite the lack of political agenda. <br /> <br /> Most remember the feeling of pressure in the decor. The small room in which the action takes place is the whole world of the character. Invasion of the hand is a total violation of this world. <br /> <br /> Beautiful and haunted movie. I found a copy of this and other wonderful shorts from Trnka in the public library and showed it to my own children. You must see.
