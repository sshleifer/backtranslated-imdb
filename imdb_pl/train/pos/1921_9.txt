ABC did more to this concert, allowing TV veterans James Garner and David Spade to join the cast of the show. Initially, the show was audible and even predictable with John Ritter and Katey Sagal. John's loss shook the world. Katey and the three children are a really solid professional cast. The hour of the lesson after John's death in real life came to me. I lost my father at the age of 17 and could sympathize and understand their pain and agony. ABC should be proud to maintain this program, and even to keep it as John's final wish. This program matured and evolved due to such impossible circumstances. They should be rewarded with Emmys.
