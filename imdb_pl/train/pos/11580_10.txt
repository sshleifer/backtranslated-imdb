As another reviewer, Hanna's War is an outstanding film about an outstanding person, Hanna "Anniko" Senesh, who became a Jewish Joanna Arc. Unfortunately, I do not agree with the opinion that Miss Detmers as a leader is too beautiful to be taken seriously as a resistance warrior. In fact, her performance is not held back by her beauty, but makes her even more severe in fear of the sadistic brutality she faces with the resistor. Maruschka Detmers performance is brave, poignant, cordial or understandable and completely credible. In other words, "In the zone" for me. from initial loans. If you want to learn more about the suffering of someone else in what they believe and be funny, try to try Hanna's war with Maruschka Detmers. My hat is also Ellen Burstyn as Hanna's mother, a very famous and famous actress who could make an effort to leave the movie. It is the effort of a team of two actresses, but not the situation of All About Eve.
