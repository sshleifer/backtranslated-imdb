Although I can not claim to be a comic book fanatic, I read my participation, so I think I am part of the audience and I was not disappointed. The couple at the end does not end up, almost full of ideas and it seems that Lena Olin, one of my favorite actresses, has been on the floor of the cutting room. Also a bit of Blue Raja Hanka Azaria can go a long way. Even so, it's easy to forgive all these disadvantages when you have a movie that's so much fun. It seems that all actors have a great time, especially William H. Macy as a simple arrow Shoveler and Janeane Garofalo as The Bowler. And unlike some, the city project made the joke even more fun. I also liked the way the disco was the music of choosing bad guys; somehow it seemed appropriate.
