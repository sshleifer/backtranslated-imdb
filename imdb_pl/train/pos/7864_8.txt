This is another Madhur Bhandarkar movie. I'm not sure why he is obsessed with showing children *** and g * y concepts for Indian viewers, but some of these scenes are really disgusting! What's new? It is a nice piece made by Bhandarkar, where he shows the story of an entertainment reporter played by the main lady in the famous film, Mr. and Mrs. Iyer. What distinguishes this film is that it also includes stories of people with whom this reporter works or with whom he is friends, such as her roommates, her colleagues, movie stars, models, rich people and other people presented on the entertainment website # 3 in her newspaper. <br /> <br /> Noticeable: This is another good performance of Mrs. Iyer. It will probably be noticed in this role. He does selective roles, but shines in them. It is noticeably repainted and less beautiful in this film. But then entertainment reporters should not overshadow the people they embrace, right? Verdict: Madhur has come up with another good movie that presents social issues very nicely. However, this film loses focus and it is not certain what the director is trying to convey. <br /> <br /> Is he trying to show us the splendor and charm of rich people? or is he trying to show us the life of an entertainment reporter and contrasts with the life of a REAL crime reporter? Is he trying to tell us how the government and the rich rule the press? or trying to illustrate problems related to the use of children and g - folk. Other concepts presented include the unwritten principle that young women must sleep with directors or co-starfares if they want to enter Bollywood. <br /> <br /> In addition, he talks about how the flying assistants are sick and tired of their work after a while and resort to extreme measures, marrying a lot of older people, etc. He also talks about unhappy women and spoiled children in rich families. <br /> <br /> It was all right for me ... but it can be too complicated for the average filmmaker who just wants to ease the stress of everyday work
