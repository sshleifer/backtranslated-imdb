This is the second movie by Eytan Fox, which I saw. The fantastic actor, Lior Ashkenazi, who starred in Walk on Water, also has a small role in this film. <br /> <br /> But the real stars are young Israelis who live together in a small apartment - Noam (Ohad Knoller), Lulu (Daniela Virtzer) and Yelli (Alon Friedman); and the Palestinian who joins them - Ashraf (Yousef "Joe" Sweid). There is something like "Friends / sex in the city" (mainly homosexual) and everyone just wants the war to end so that they can live in peace. <br /> <br /> But it is rubbing. No matter how many placards you place or how much you delight in peace, the war will not end. Many have tried to bring both parties to the table for years, but they just want to continue it for whatever reason. There are many people on the Israeli side, both in the US and here who want it all and will not consider peace. There are many people on the Palestinian side who apparently would be out of work if the peace came. It is not in everyone's interest to end this war and the children suffer. <br /> <br /> It's always on your mind when you watch this fun and addictive movie. He will not leave. You know that something tragic will happen and of course it will happen. Because feelings on both sides are strong, and revenge as a motivator, there is always a tragedy and this is what makes it a version for friends / sex in an adult city. There is no exterior. This is real life and it was beautiful.
