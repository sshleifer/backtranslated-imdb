This film really deserves more recognition than its capture. It is a truly stunning and rich representation of blood ties, favors and loyalty in the world of crime. The film is beautifully filmed and delves into all the classic crime topics, such as betrayal and power. This film is a film for viewers, requires attention and understanding, and finally rewards it fully. He is the godfather of Hong Kong and is a welcome change, not another epic martial art that seems to be the main contribution to the world of cinema from Hong Kong and China. It includes the arrangement of great characters, actors and development, although it can be said that I had to watch it twice to nail what was happening with some of the heroes because of their many interactions in the film. AL in all 8/10 Great plot characters, but there are characters that do not stand out enough, and the music did not really make me start, and sometimes I felt that it was not well in sync with the action (it's action through the way), so he loses a few points for it.
