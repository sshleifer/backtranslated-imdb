This movie is simply brilliant. The photos are good, the acting is great, and the story is absolutely breathtaking. This is the story of Donald Woods, a white South African who considered himself a liberal until he discovered the reality of apartheid. Kevin Kline is completely convincing - to the point that when Donald Woods himself appeared on television a few years later, I recognized him after Kline's performance. Denzel Washington also performs the masterful performance, as always. <br /> <br /> I encourage you to look at this. It's long, but it's worth the patience because it tells such an amazing story. Remember, people, it really happened.
