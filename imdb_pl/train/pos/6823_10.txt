Last week I spent watching movies by John Cassavetes - starting with "a woman under influence" and ending with "premiere". I am completely and completely amazed, especially with these two films. from the first minute to the last in the "opening night" I was completely and completely absorbed. I only experienced it a few times, but the feeling that this movie was perfect lasted from about two-thirds until subtitles appeared. everything about this film, the way it was filmed, the amazing performance of Genesis Rowlands, subtitles, opening, music, story, feeling of depth, pace, tenderness, originality, heroes, dexterity, small moments ... for me it is really lofty. I could not agree with the previous comment about taking him to a desert island, because the very depth of the film is something that can be seen. If you are unlucky to have a home fire, I guarantee that instead of making the last attempt to save a stock of money under the bed, you will save a copy of the movie instead.
