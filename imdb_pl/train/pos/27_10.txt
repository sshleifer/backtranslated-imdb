"The Red Queen Kills Seven Times" by Emilio Miraglio (1972) is almost the best example of giallo I have ever seen, combining all the required elements into one sinister goulash. First of all, it's very important to me, it has a complicated, twisty thread that ultimately makes sense, and the killer here does not go completely from the left field at the end. The story of a series of macabre murders (you know how much from the movie, right?), Which takes place in the seeming fulfillment of the ancient prophecy concerning the two sisters, is engaging and murderer, red cloaked figure with crazy madwoman's laughter, it is both frightening and unforgettable. Each wonderful giallo requires charming actresses, and here we have quite a large assortment, headed by the absurdly beautiful Barbara Bouchet as one of the two sisters, and in one of her earlier roles, Sybil Danning, as a lusty tramp in Barbara's fashion house. Another essential component of superior giallo is a catchy, hummable result, and Bruno Nicolai provides one for this movie that should stay with you for a few days. Wonderful scenery? Check again. The painting, shot largely in Wurzburg, Germany, is a real feast for the eye. OK, OK, but what about those murders? After all, this is not the case in gialli? Well, I am pleased to inform you that the majority of viewers should be satisfied with various knives, shootings, impalements and other slaughters, which this film tastes good ... not to mention the crypts, the bizarre sequence of dreams, rats and bats (and a lot of them too!), References to drugs, rape scene, obligatory red herrings and, in the person of Ugo Pagliai, hunky leading man for viewers. As I said, perfect giallo. And even better, this DVD comes from great people from No Shame and you know what it means: a great print and plenty of extras to run it! Thanks boys!
