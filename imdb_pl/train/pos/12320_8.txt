Sinnui yauman is undoubtedly one of the best ghost stories ever made in the film. Written by Songling Pu directed by Siu-Tung Ching, A Chinese Ghost Story has it all. Ling Choi Sin played by Leslie Cheung is a young man who goes to look for a monastery that is deep in the forest, where the villagers seem to be very afraid of rapprochement. A wandering is dangerous for wolves, and a crazy Taoist monk lives in a temple. <br /> <br /> Ling Choi Sin meets Tsing, a beautiful and mysterious young girl who also lives nearby in an abandoned temple. She is forced to seduce men for her evil mistress, but when she meets an innocent Ling Choi Sin, they fall in love with each other. <br /> <br /> Ling Choi Sin is a kind of inept fool, but his heart is in the right place, while Tsing tries to protect him from other ghosts in the forest, he tries to protect her from a monk who tries to kill ghosts in the forest. There are great martial arts, even a monk who explodes in a drunken song when he performs the ritual forms of the Taoist sword. The film makes many traditional old movies about martial arts, with magic and flying in the air, jumping from tree to tree, with elegant long dresses and scarfs, but the film really flows and everything is effective. <br /> <br /> Tsing is to be the wife of a monster from a bad tree that can not be good, and we feel her difficult situation in the house where we meet her sister and stepmother who is really good. <br /> <br /> In the end, they must fight the witch's tree with a deadly tongue and go from Yin into the depths of hell to fight the millennia of evil to save their souls and bring Ling's ashes back to her home to have the right a funeral so that she could have a chance of reincarnation. <br /> <br /> A beautiful story that really pays attention to details. This film is touched in many ways, you'll laugh, cry and just play with great martial arts and cinematography. And although in the end Yin and Ling Choi Sin enter the morning sun under a charming rainbow, we never know if Tsing got reincarnated, but we know her
