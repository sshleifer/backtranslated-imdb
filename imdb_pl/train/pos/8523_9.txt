I was a fan of this book from the third grade, so of course I watched the movie, read the sequel, and then watched the TV show. It was a good performance in itself, and now as an adult, I'm still happy about this show. My only real problem was that he did not follow the book. When I saw it for the first time, I was so disappointed that I turned it off. But it comes from the girl who owns the first addition to the book. But after some time I decided to try again and ignore the book (something like what you're dealing with Harry Potter movies). I found a great series! It was pure fashion and something that everyone can enjoy, just the right comedy to let everyone go. It is really nice! Clean and wonderful!
