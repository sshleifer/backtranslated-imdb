Full House came to me when I was about 9 years old. I remember seeing remixes of American funniest home movies with Bob Saget and one day my mother told me that he was also in the Full House program. One day I was lucky to catch an episode while visiting my family. At the beginning it did not seem too interesting, but when I watched more and more, always at 9:00, I would just be like that. <br /> <br /> This program really makes you want to be there alone, spend time with girls, come with them to places, and maybe even join their little family "sing." <br /> <br /> What I like the most about Full House is that it is a great performance for children and adults of all ages. There will be some parts that are more for adults and then parts intended for children so that the whole family can enjoy it. No matter how trashy it may be, it is still a great performance and I strongly recommend it to everyone. <br /> <br /> 10/10
