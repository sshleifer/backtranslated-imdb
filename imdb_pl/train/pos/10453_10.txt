While traveling by train through Europe, American Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and French Celine (Julie Delpy) meet and decide to spend the night in Austria. The next morning, Jesse returns to the United States and Celine to Paris. <br /> <br /> "Before sunrise" is one of my favorite romances, and even one of the most beautiful love stories I've ever seen. It's a low-budget movie with a very simple and real story, but the chemistry between Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy is perfect, and the dialogues are stunning. The direction is amazing, passing the feelings of Celine and Jesse to the viewer. I just finished the review of 1000 in IMDb and chose "Before Sunrise" for this significant number, because it is a very special movie for me. I do not understand why this film was not nominated for an Oscar, with such a great script, directing and performances. Yesterday I probably watched the movie for the third or fourth time and I still love it. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Antes do Amanhecer" ("Before Sunrise")
