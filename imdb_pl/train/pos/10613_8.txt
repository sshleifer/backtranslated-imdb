This is a long-lost horror starring Sydney Lassick ("Carrie" and others) and Barbara Bach. Sometimes it is difficult to find a copy of this movie, but it's worth it. This film is frightening and at the same time tacky. Three young journalists (Karen, Vicky, and Jennifer) appear to travel to the small town of Solvang, California, to attend a festival where their hotel room is mixed up and they seek refuge in Earnest Keller's home (Lassick) and his strange Virginia's wife. Vickie stays behind feeling bad because the other two are ready to film their story. Soon, she is murdered at home, in a very shoddy way, by some unknown force hiding in the ventilation system (she is cut off by the closing cover of the ventilation opening when she falls on her when she is being pulled by the basement). Soon Karen returns and is murdered in an even more brutal way, stabbing her face in the ventilation cover. Jennifer is fighting with her (former) lover in a pretty boring plot, and when she comes back home, her hosts (whom we have already discovered are brother and sister, and whatever is in the basement is their son) invent a conspiracy to murder her. Virgina does not entirely agree with Earnest's plan to murder Jennifer, but she is deceived to enter the basement where she meets Junior. Here, the film becomes almost comical, because Junior (portrayed hysterically by Stephen Furst) is a distorted, mentally deficient man whose actions and movements cause a few chuckles, although it is to be frightening. At this point, the tempo of the film increases and the ending is well done. Actors / actresses do a great job with materials, especially Lassick, Furst and Bach, and although this is not the scariest movie ever made, it's very funny!
