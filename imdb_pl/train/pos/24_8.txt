Although it was of course low-budget production, it's worth to see performances and songs in this film. One of the few Walken music roles to date. (he is a great dancer and singer, he also demonstrates his acrobatic skills - watch out for the cartwheel!) Also with Jason Connery. A great story for children and very nice characters.
