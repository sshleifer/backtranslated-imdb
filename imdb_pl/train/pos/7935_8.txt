Hood of the Living Dead had a lot to meet before the initial loans began. First of all, every game of "... living corpses" calls His Holiness, Mr. Romero, and immediately sets a high standard that many films can not afford. Secondly, my companion watching the movie confessed that every urban horror would overtake the groundbreaking Leprechaun In the Hood. Skeptical, we decided to watch. <br /> <br /> We've been rewarded with a surprisingly honest movie about zombies. Oh, the budget is certainly low and, of course, directors' friends populate the cast, but Hood of the Living Dead loves zombie cinema. Cheap? Yes. But when it's so cheap, you can clearly see where LOVE holds it together. <br /> <br /> Ricky works in the lab during the day and as a substitute parent for his younger brother at night. He dreams of moving out of Oakland. However, before the planned escape, his brother is shot in the driveway. Ricky's sensible scientific mind presents an option better than CPR or 911: injections of the experimental regenerative formula of his laboratory. Unfortunately, the little brother wakes up in the ambulance as a bloodthirsty zombie of Oakland! Chaos and chaos! I think it is more economical to eat enemies than to take revenge on the driveway, but on the other hand I am a weak judgment of the complexity of urban life. (As a poor judge?) In response to a bloody scene involving four men, I expressed the opinion "Ah-ha! White shirts at all, so blood appears. Economical! I used the same technique in my own low-budget horror movie." Jordan replied: "No This is a gang dress. White shirts have been banned for some time in bars in New Orleans. "Oh. <br /> <br /> Many movies are embedded in someone's living room, so there is a lot of time to wait for the zombies. are sympathetic, and the film is honest - exceeds the budget in spirit. <br /> <br /> Explanation of zombies: When a man plays God, zombies arise! Or maybe: Follow the rules of testing approved by the FDA before experiments on humans! <br /> <br /> Contribution to the zombie canon: This is the first zombie movie I've seen while shooting a ride. As for the actual zombies, the infection spreads as usual, but unusual shots from the head do not they are - they shoot arrows from the heart, Zombies have pulses, the lack of which proves a real death. And these zombies are making pretty good snarls of a jaguar snarl. <br /> <br /> A humorous zombie movie in jokes: Mercenary named Romero. Groan. <br /> <br /> Favorite zombie: Jaguar-noise small zombie brother, of course!
