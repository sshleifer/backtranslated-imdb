Well done and stylish, and at the same time meaningful, this thriller would be better for non-giallo fans to get interested in this genre than later Argento entries, which exaggerate in all directions. <br /> <br /> For fans of these crazy Italian thrillers, they will appreciate George Hilton and the bends that take his character and what he has gone through. The work with the camera is fresh with a bit of graphic violence and weird, but appropriate choices and a good, not overblown musical result. The less you know about history, the better it works. <br /> <br /> The only thing that has not been saved from being a wonderful Sergio Martino is that history has no additional sexual or psychological or both elements to put it on top. It's a more routine mystery, characters are well defined, but they live or die according to the plot, not according to their own advantages and disadvantages. <br /> <br /> The recently released DVD (2005) looks beautiful and definitely so that you can see the movie, unless there are ever any projections of art houses, which seems unlikely.
