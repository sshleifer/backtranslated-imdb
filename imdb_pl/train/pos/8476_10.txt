*** Spoilery * <br /> <br /> My dad recorded this movie for me when I was 3 years old. At the age of 5, I watched it over 400 times. I just watched him and watched. And I'm still doing today! He has a grim story, the lamb's mother is killed by a wolf - a very emotional scene - and he wants to become a wolf, just like him. After years of training, the lamb really becomes REALLY a looking thing. He and the wolf are traveling to their old barn, but he can not kill the lambs, no matter how much he wants. It ends up killing the wolf, but is no longer seen by his former friends as a lamb and can not return to his previous lifestyle. <br /> <br /> Art is beautiful, the songs are OK, and the voice game is better than some things today. <br /> <br /> In summary, just * to see this movie is a great masterpiece. Although it is difficult to find today. <br /> <br />
