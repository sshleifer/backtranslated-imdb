I am a huge fan of Jet Li! He is the best live star of the HK action movie ... and consequently - This movie has shaken! I saw it in the video shop and, as it was in the main part of this mainstream video store, I did not register his presence at first and I had to look twice. I knew immediately what to rent. My only feature (I suppose I expected it) is that it was named (AAARGh), not subtitles. Otherwise, the original / strange / cool plot of the movie and full of action made him one of the better films of Jet Li ... despite all of them belong to this category ....
