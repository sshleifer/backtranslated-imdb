it can not be War & Peace, but these two academies would not be available if it were not James Wong Howe's genius ... <br /> <br /> this is one of the few movies I fell in love with as a child and I came back to without dissatisfaction. Regardless of whether you are interested in what you offer fictitiously or not, BB & C is a visual feast. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying it's his best job, I'm not an expert there. but the look of this movie is amazing. I love everything in it; Elsa Lanchester, cat, crazy hoo-doo, retro-downtown; but the way it's put on the movie is breathtaking. <br /> <br /> I even like the inconsistencies indicated on this page above and the "special effects" that now seem to draw back. all this creates a truly cohesive world.
