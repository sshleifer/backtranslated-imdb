I bought it cheap from the leftovers in our local store. He was almost in perfect condition and I had never heard of him before. Of course, nobody else did. <br /> <br /> I can not believe my luck. You go through the whole realm of emotion and try to overcome a complicated message - undoubtedly the very moral and not triumphant position of the Mandela Party. Despite the huge length (I had to watch it at two meetings) - it was like a book that could not be put down. Perhaps the songs are not so memorable, but the spirit of this thing shines forever. I do not understand the comments that a musical (clearly designed for the stage) is not realistic! I saw the "South Pacific" and I also read the book and I can guarantee that the musical is not realistic compared to the book. I will value this little find until it wears out. One day they will do it again with a better budget. <br /> <br />
