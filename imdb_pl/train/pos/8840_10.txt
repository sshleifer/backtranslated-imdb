Watching in front of the devil counts as one of my best experiences in the cinema. I was intrigued by my mixed reaction to the film - for me extreme opinions indicate that the film touched something that was accepted or rejected by the audience. This is one of those movies that have stayed with me and I'm still wondering about it. <br /> <br /> Certainly the DVD will illuminate more themes and film elements? Which include: Sidney Lumet's return movie, the time shift technique used in the story story, the great combination of Lumet and Masterson and why it works so well, the master direction, the relatively rare focus of Hollywood movies on male heroes and their largely doomed fight for it, to become an open check book for her women, an under-represented, but still resonant performance by Marisa Tomei and, of course, an excellent Hoffman with this central monologue about the sum of its parts - for me the heart of the film. <br /> <br /> Uff! Certainly a masterful film. Imagine, therefore, my disappointment with watching the eagerly awaited DVD - just to not find any comment, no coolies, no interviews, no extras. <br /> <br /> Hey - distributors - get it done!
