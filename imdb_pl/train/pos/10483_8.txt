Yes, this movie is predictable and definitely not award-winning. But then he does not try to be anything that he is not. Full of fun romp with real fun one-liners, amazing and very funny performance of Peter O'Toole, grounding and mundane performance of Joan Plowright. The band's performance was in place, each playing its role in a clever, comic way. The music was good, but not great, but it filled the movie nicely. From some of the negative comments, I concluded that the subtlety of humor passed through their heads. A good example is the comment about "a strange baseball-like game", well, my dear American, or cricket - from which baseball comes - and explaining this to the unconscious American team was very funny for those who know cricket. No, you should not wince when Carl broke the window; it was funny how Lord Foxley said "yes!" to get more money to break, and the manager said "oh no" also referring to money. Jesus, it seems that every joke has to be explained to some people ... All in all, I liked it and I had great laughter! Worth to see.
