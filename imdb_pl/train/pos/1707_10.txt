This movie is not for everyone. You are smart enough to "it" or not. Fans of science-fiction movies who do not take themselves too seriously, will definitely like this film. I recommend this film to those who can appreciate parodies and fakes. Everyone I recommended this movie to liked it. If you like Monty Python or Mel Brooks movies, you'll probably like this one. The characteristics of the voice takes place in a brazen and one-line manner they fly fast and furiously.
