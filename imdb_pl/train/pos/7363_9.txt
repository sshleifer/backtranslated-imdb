This is not a song about love. <br /> <br /> My only word summarizing this movie would be: "Perfect". <br /> <br /> Probably will not speak to mass public movies? to film <br /> <br />, which forces you to participate. You watch, think and ask. <br /> <br /> Comparisons can be made with Deliverance (Theme / Theme) and <br /> <br /> perhaps with The Blair Witch Project for general style of filming. <Br /> <br /> However, this movie stands out against both. <br /> <br /> Cinematographic effects (solarization, image freeze, blur, etc.) <br /> <br /> have been seen before, but are mostly used effectively in this movie <br /> <br /> to strengthen the natural tension of the story. <br /> <br /> Acting is strict, dangerous and completely reliable. <br /> <br /> The real subject of the film is about friendship; the title really captures the <br /> <br /> game. Probably it is not the kind of friendship that most of us <br /> <br /> have experienced or would like to. <br /> <br /> This is a love song.
