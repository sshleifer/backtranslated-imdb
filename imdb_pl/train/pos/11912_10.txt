I liked Albert Nun's "Nemesis" for his trashy action and a partially complicated script. Many people complain about the "misleading" theme for the first movie, probably because "Nemesis 2: Nebula" has a stupid rock-like story with the same super-action to perform. <br /> <br /> This one gives the name of the hero of the first movie, Alex, a huge super-woman sent to the past to save the future. She is brought up by a tribe in Africa. A large part of the movie has a dialogue in African without subtitles, which I liked because it made it seem a bit authentic (how often do genre films really try to do it?). It does not take long for the evil cyborgs to go back in time to find it and try to kill it. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, this is shit (not the first was great). There are thematic topics regarding political unrest in Africa, treasure hunt and tribal struggle. The image is very short on the brains, so none of these things are treated very well. The picture is basically a struggle with a few chases that boil down to the fibroid-cyborg. It has entertainment value, just do not expect quality or anything from the first movie.
