Watching David and Bathsheba is a much better way to teach the Bible that he is attending Sunday school. Despite the script, which is sometimes funny, the movie is very funny. The studio system had its drawbacks, but it did not spare any expenses when sumptuous production was needed. Peck presents King David as a lustful but tormented poet who commits what is tantamount to the murder of sexy Bathsheba's bed, Susan Hayward. Raymond Massey as a Prophet Nathan performs his usual saturated and wild performance. Look for the silent star of Francis X. Bushman as King Saul and bride Gwen Verdon as a dancer. Applause for the Old Testament and Hollywood.
