Four prisoners - Carrere, a young company director accused of fraud, a 35-year-old transsexual in the transformation process, Daisy, a 20-year-old mentally handicapped idiot and Lassalle, a 60-year-old intellectual who murdered his wife. Behind the stone slab in the cell, mysteriously outstretched, they discovered a book: the diary of a former prisoner, Danvers, who occupied the cell at the beginning of the century. The diary contains magical patterns that supposedly allow Malefique prisoners to be one of the most frightening and smartest horrors I've seen this year. The film has a gloomy, dark atmosphere influenced by the works of HP Lovecraft, which creates a very frightening and disturbing atmosphere. In some scenes with imagination and brutal death is a lot of gore, and the figures of four prisoners are surprisingly well developed. It is a pity that Eric Valette did a really terrible remake of "One Missed Call" after a stunning debut 9 out of 10.
