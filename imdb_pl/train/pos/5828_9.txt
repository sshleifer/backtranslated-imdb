Micro-speakers are the classic Stooge abbreviation. The guys are inept mechanics working in a radio station, and during several trips in the television booth, the perfect imitation of the "Voices of Spring" recording by Curly is confused with the real song, which leads to a radio contract and a happy party. The false interpretation of the quintet from "Lucia de L'Amamore" is particularly funny. No doubt this is a must-see for Stooge fans. <br /> <br /> Although evidence of Curly's falling health is visible on his face and voice, his performance is amazing and this is probably the last look of old Curly. Some fans think that "A Bird in the Hand" is the last big Curly short, but its rough voice and slow motion are too difficult to watch.
