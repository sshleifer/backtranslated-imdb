... the Romeo division is coming to change the paradigm. <br /> <br /> Let me just say that I was short. I saw it by accident when I was in Boston at a film festival and thank God for it every day. I really, really believe that I was part of an event, like reading a Tarantino script before any other, or watching the first Show Mean Streets. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure which festival is shorter or what the creative team chose for future products, but I hope I can be with it. <br /> <br /> Again, a really amazing movie track.
