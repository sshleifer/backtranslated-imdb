Ice Age is not only the animation of the year (in my eyes) is also the best animated feature I have ever seen! <br /> <br /> Teaser excited me last year and spent many happy hours on the website. Scrat is cool! Like the rest of Sub Zero heroes. <br /> <br /> The animation is great. Your heart really goes out to the characters in this movie. They have good dialogue lines and are well developed. It's hard to say which one really steals the picture. <br /> <br /> I survived their journey with laughter, tears and amazement. Nothing has been forced or completed. The emotion was real, especially in the dramatic second half. The last film that touched me was Anastasia in 1997, as well as Fox Production. And before that it was The Land Before Time 1988. They all have a real charm and try to entertain the whole audience, not just cynics. 10/10 <br /> <br />
