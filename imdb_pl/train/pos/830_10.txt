I did not have too many expectations when it comes to film, but I thought it was fantastic. Pierce Brosnan is unique in a completely different role. He gave up armani's slick suits to get an absurd look and pays off, showing that he is a great actor. Pierce and Greg Kinnear get along well and have been doing one of the best buddy pairs for a long time. Humor is dark, Brosnan, Kinnear and Hope Davis are great, they mix it with a touching element of a friendship story, and you have a great movie. This is probably one of the best comedies for a long time. This is a film that definitely shows that we can expect great things in the Brosnan era after the Bond era.
