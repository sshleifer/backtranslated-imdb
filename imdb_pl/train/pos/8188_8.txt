I really enjoyed the first part of the two, The Impossible Planet, and I was a little worried that the second part would not hold as well as it was in the past with two participants from the second series of Who. Fortunately, my fears were unfounded because I liked the episode just as much as the previous one. In any case, we start with the surviving crew members fleeing the Ood who became the pawn of the devil. There is also a bit of philosophizing the role of the Doctor in the episode, which I liked very much. Needless to say, it was a good solid story about Dr. Who. However, it can be a bit too intense for younger viewers. <br /> <br /> My class: B +
