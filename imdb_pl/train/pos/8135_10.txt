I am shocked. Shocked and terrified that 428 of you, IMDB users who voted for me, did not give the film a rating higher than 7.7? - This is C! If I could give FOBH 20, I would gladly do it. This film ranks high on the pantheon of modern comedy, alongside Half Baked and Mallrats, as one of the most fun movies of all time. If you know anything about rap music - YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS! If you do not know anything about rap music - learn about something, then see it! Comparisons to "Spinal Tap" underestimate the inspired genius of this unique film. If you liked Bob Roberts, you'll love it. Watch it and vote for 10!
