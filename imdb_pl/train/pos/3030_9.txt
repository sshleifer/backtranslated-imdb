This movie has scenes that come back to me in the weirdest days - this intense scene with Mr. Muckerji, who tells Melandez that someone with whom he spoke with witnesses, a girl is pushed out by a woman who fits her description --- she is one it turns into a Greek accent "Mr. Muckerji" - and then when Boyer discovers that she just took the poison and gives her the last slap in front of her head, she dies - it's a delight! "Fools - fools - all my life" ... etc. Etc. - you understand ... I have to buy this one. I love acting of Dan Seymour: he usually plays some plump foreign sultan or police chief and has appeared in Casablanca and many great pictures.
