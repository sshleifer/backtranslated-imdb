<br /> <br /> Charlie Kauffman has made an incredible popularity in metaphysical anger, but this Canadian jewel makes him hilarious. <br /> <br /> Like most strange movies, the less you were told about the story, the better, but let's set the stage, two friends Anthony and Dave is together from childhood, they do not cope with the world, and that means that I have to wait longer. But there are even more problems. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie, made me smile long after the final credits and it's a rare experience with so many mass-produced pieces of "nothing". <br /> <br /> Do not miss this. <br /> <br />
