This movie can be really bad, but it's a lot of fun. Bad acting and poor direction reinforce the film's hysterics. The twins are very funny in their role of Conanesque. If you enter this movie, expecting the first Conan or Excalibur, you will hate it. If you look at it in a good mood and accept it as a good, silly game, you will have fun. Watch the scene in which they try to hang their brothers, the funniest scene in the movie. I'd like the Mystery Science Theater 3000 to do it!
