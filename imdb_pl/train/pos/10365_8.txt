This is the true story of an Australian couple accused of murder when their baby disappears. Meryl Streep is as perfect as ever and is able to keep our interest, despite the fact that she plays a character who is not particularly nice. <br /> <br /> The media rush surrounding this case in Australia is similar to Sam Sheppard's murder case in Ohio in the 1950s. These real situations show that the media can actually influence the way a criminal case is dealt with. I remember that Cleveland Plain Dealer ran the big headline, "Why is not Sam Sheppard in jail?" The prosecutor eventually succumbed to this ruthless pressure, and Sheppard was tried and convicted. It was only after years of imprisonment that he was cleared of charges. <br /> <br /> I love movies that tell a real story, they do it in an interesting way and they make an important point in this process. This is one of those movies. Other good films that tell the story of innocent people accused of crimes are "Hurricane", "The Thin Blue Line" and "Breaker Morant". In particular, the latter is another Australian movie that is highly recommended. <br /> <br /> 8/10
