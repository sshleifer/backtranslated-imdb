"A Family Affair" takes us to a less complicated time in America. It's sobering when I saw that everything was different. It was a more innocent age in our country and we observe a "functional" family dealing with matters. The film is also the beginning of the series with the Hardy family. <br /> <br /> The film directed by George Seitz is based on a successful game. Judge James Hardy and his wife Emmily are facing an internal crisis that must be dealt with. Daughter Joan returns home after she made a social mistake and her husband is responsible. At the same time, another daughter, Marion, brings a cavalryman home, who is clear, collides with her father. Happy teenager Andy seems to be the only one without a problem, until his mother leads him to dance Polly, which he does not want to do. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, Judge Hardy will prove why he knows best when he puts the plan into practice so that everyone can reunite. In the end, he is a man who understands not only the law, but also the way of dealing with those external forces that threaten his position in the community and what will make his family happy. <br /> <br /> Lionel Barrymore plays Judge Hardy with conviction. It is an adhesive that holds everything together. Spring Byington is seen as Emily, mother. Mickey Rooney has a small role in this film, but it is always cool to watch. Cecilia Parker and Julie Haydon appeared as daughters, Marion and Joan. Sara Hayden and Margaret Marquis also appear in the film as aunt Milly and Polly, a girl who surprises Andy with her beauty. <br /> <br /> "A Family Affair" is a good way to observe our past through a positive picture painted by an American family.
