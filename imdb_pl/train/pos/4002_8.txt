At the beginning of the film, we watch May and Toots prepare to travel to London to visit their adult children. You can see that Toots is not in the best health, but goes on. When he suddenly dies, Maya's world begins to get out of control. <br /> <br /> The film, directed by Roger Michel, based on the art of Hanif Kureshi, is a study of how this mother will come to terms with her new status in life and awakening to a world she does not even know she existed to so far. <br /> <br /> May's life as a suburban wife was probably boring. Of course her sex life was almost nothing. We learn that she had a short extramarital affair and then nothing at all. When May loses her husband, she can not go home, so instead she stays behind her grandson in her daughter's home. It is in this scenery that May begins to lust for the young and cocky Darrens, the occasional lover of her daughter. <br /> <br /> Darren wakes up in May a passion she never knew. It can react, changing before our eyes. May, who is careless at the beginning of the film, suddenly begins to dress, becoming an interesting and attractive woman. He ends up falling on his head with this young man who sustains her passion she never felt before. <br /> <br /> Knowing a few cases similar to this story, it was no surprise to me to watch May's reaction. Her own chance for a normal relationship with widower Bruce ends frustratingly at May, who realizes how great her sex with Darren is. We think that the younger man is only in this matter, to be satisfied and be able to extort money from May. Finally, Helen's daughter discovers what her mother did behind her when she discovers the erotic images her mother made. <br /> <br /> The film is a triumph for the director. In Anne Reid, Mr. Michell found an unusual actress who brings so much to the role of May. Daniel Craig is also amazing. He knows how Darren will react to the situation. Anna Wilson Jones as Helen is also important to this story because she has to confront her mother with what's happening behind her back. Oliver Ford Davies plays a small role as an older man in Helen's class and is quite effective. <br /> <br /> The film is satisfying for those who will see it with an open mind. <br /> <br />
