Almost 30 years later, I recall this original PBS film as almost unbearably delicate. Periodically I check IMDb here, hoping that someone has good sense to buy rights and put them on DVD. It's September 2004, and I still hope - a deep sigh. <br /> <br /> One of the two main actors went to a small career mainly in the evening soap in prime-time; the other, Frances Lee McCain, was seen in small roles here and there for several years. But nothing they did before or after did not fit into the little movie that was produced, as I recall, in the short-lived PBS series that showed the original scenarios of new and upcoming playwrights. I watched it every time it was shown on PBS, maybe 2 or 3 times. It was before the era of video recorders, so I do not have any record of it, except in my mind. <br /> <br /> December 31, 2006 addition to the above: Happy New Year, ladies! This great movie is finally available on DVD at ladyslipper.org. I understand that DVDs are burned from a personal copy of the writer.
