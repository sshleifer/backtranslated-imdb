This movie The Bad Race: The legend about samhain contains little thought and effort. He is ridiculed by the specifics of the ultrafast death in the style of "slasher" and ordinary disgusting acts of death. Acting was rated as D, because the actors show very little abilities, and the stupidity of them in the film is too dubious. The way they portrayed how people of their age behave was incredibly different. The strange division of porn suits the fact that it does not really offer much, and any area that is respectable, but runs pretty fast with absolute death. An example is a poor man who has been gutted from the anus, and the scene lasts about 5 minutes. It is very obvious how little fighting children put up. This movie is a good choice for someone who likes to watch terrible deaths and practically torture.
