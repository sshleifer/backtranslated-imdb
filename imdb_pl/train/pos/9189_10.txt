Let me start by saying that after watching this episode for the first time on DVD at 10 P.M. one night I could not sleep until 3:00. <br /> <br /> This short review may include spoilers. <br /> <br /> I am a longtime fan of The Sopranos and I can safely say that this is the best episode I have seen. I'm not saying everyone should feel that way, but I do. This episode is identical to the weekend that I spent with my family, watching over my own father, sleeping in ICU before his passage. <br /> <br /> The episode begins with Tony in an alternate reality: he is the seller's identity has been confused with the identity of a man named Kevin Finnerty. <br /> <br /> It took ten minutes before I knew either Tony was dreaming or watching another program. It was not like normal Sopran√≥w and I liked it a lot. <br /> <br /> Option 1 is confirmed when Anthony (or "Kevin") looks at the sky in the "spotlight of a helicopter" and we see a doctor with a flashlight passing through him. We see it only for a moment and the sequence takes place until we return to real life in a situation similar to the one I just said. <br /> <br /> Tony left the coma just for a moment. His boys take A.J. house and Carmella, overwhelmed by stress, break down in the corridor: the moment of the signature in the episode. <br /> <br /> Throughout the rest of the episode, we enter the real world: a potential family of negative results of this coma and the alternative reality of Tony, which corresponds to what is happening both in his mind and in the real world around him. <br /> <br /> Then comes the star point in the episode: after AJ ends telling his mother that he has flunked out of school, he enters Meadow sitting side by side with Anthony. <br /> <br /> He walks up to Tony and says the best episode: "Anthony, can you hear us?" In Tony's world, he enters a dark hotel room and turns on the light. He takes off his shoes and goes to the phone. He tries to call, but he can not - as if he was trying to say something to Carmella, but he could not bring himself to do it. Not yet. <br /> <br /> He sits down and looks out the window. The shining light, which repeated itself throughout the episode, seems to call him from the other side of the city. <br /> <br /> Moby "When it's cold, I'd like to die" fits in perfectly with these last photos and helps in creating an emotional roller-coaster from the episode. <br /> <br /> 10 of 10. <br /> <br /> PS: Watch the next episode. You will learn what light is. It is wonderful.
