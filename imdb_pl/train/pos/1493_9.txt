I thought Mukhsin was wonderfully written. It's not just about entertainment. There are many subtle messages that I think Yasmin tried to convey. And yes, it can be confusing for some of you (especially if you have not seen Septa and / or Gubry for 76 times). <br /> <br /> I bet you noticed how they use the characters from the two movies before well? It's really ironic how these characters relate. Just like an overbearing neighbor, this prostitute from Gubry. A nestling on a snooker pad turns out to be religious and the wife of a pious man in the future. <br /> <br /> And I absolutely love the teacher. Its primitive, but freshly awakening. For example, when they took a picture of Rumah Tumpangan Gamin's sign, Mukhsin's voice suddenly appeared, saying "Bismillahhirrahmannirrahim .." (the scene in which he climbed the tree). <br /> <br /> He took the attitude of Malaysia (and in a gentle way, laughing at how pathetic it is) in character. For example, even children can be really sharp like a tongue (along with a piercing annoying voice) and just a bad mouth ppl the whole movie. And how can you be so nosy and talk about ppl when your life is not organized. <br /> <br /> I can only say that this movie completely reached my expectations if I did not cross it. <br /> <br /> It kept me stuck to the screen, I could not even take my eyes off him. Not even in the cinema. Ha ha.
