When "Girlfight" was released, the reviews praised him, but I could not see him. I finally saw him when he was released on video, and I understood great reviews. <br /> <br /> The film starts in high school in the middle of the ghetto. We quickly get to know a student Diana Guzman (Michelle Rodriguez). He has a bad face and every idea about Diana, which we can draw from this expression, will soon be confirmed when he starts to fight. When Diana is in trouble because of it, we meet her father, an aggressive type. apparently, we can not completely blame Diana for her attitude. <br /> <br /> But then the movie really rises, because in Diana's mind a new thought grows: boxing as a way to escape a grim existence. Her older brother got into boxing, but her father probably will not agree. Only Diana can decide what to do. <br /> <br /> Only the first few minutes allowed me to say that I am in a very difficult, non-Hollywood movie, but the brief appearance of John Sayles in the supporting role really confirmed this. Even before they reach any boxing scene, you feel like you are slamming into your face when you see Dian's ugly life. And when they finally reach the main story of the film, there is no turning back. <br /> <br /> In total, I definitely recommend this movie. I admit that using boxing as a way to show someone who is trying to do something with himself was for many years a clich√© in the cinema ("Rocky", "Million Dollar Baby"), but still think that it was a great job with it. In fact, this could lead this species to the top. Really good. It is a pity that Michelle Rodriguez has wasted herself in Hollywood movies.
