First, explain what a great movie is for me. The excitement related to the fact that you do not know what will happen next will make me watch the movie for the first time (see example: Twister). There are other things that work great, such as good humor (John Candy in Uncle Buck and The Great Outdoors), good plot with good resolution (Madeline and Matilda), an ingenious story (all episodes of Star Wars - George Lucas is a MAN) and good music (again all episodes of Star Wars, Wizard of Oz, Sound of music). What makes me watch a movie at least six times in the theater and buy a DVD or VHS tape? Characters. By saying this, I introduce Cindy Lou Who and The Grinch. Excellent performance by Taylor Momsen and Jim Carrey. The rest of the cast was very good, especially Jeffery Tambor, Bill Irwin, Molly Shannon, Christine Baranski and Josh Ryan Evans. But every scene with Cindy and The Grinch-together is excellent and very funny and / or nice. Cindy Lou is my favorite character in this film and the most convincing reason why the film is better than the cartoon. Grinch has a strong storyline, good conflicts and a very good topic (I can not start because I do not want to mess it up). Jim Carrey was very funny like The Grinch - especially when he contacted Cindy. And music! Wow! Excellent music by James Horner. I loved his selection of instruments and compositions. Very good job Jim Carrey-I did not know you could sing. Taylor Momsen! Whoa! Your vote is enough to see the video at least once. On your solo - Where Are You Christmas - is your voice really as high as it seems? Sounds like F #? It's an obscene range for a 7-year-old (obscene means in the best possible way). Good job. This is the best performance of the child I have ever heard in the film (Taylor beat the children of Von Trapp - without the slightest feat!). And now to the actors. Jim Carrey was great, funny and surprisingly very sensitive (it really showed up in his scenes with Taylor Momsen). Taylor Momsen's indistinct expressions (one of the secrets of a good acting performance) are very strong - it really becomes Cindy Lou Who. And when he is in dialogue, he is even stronger. <br /> <br /> ****************************** danger: spoiler alert ******** ************* *************************** ********** ********************************** <br /> <br /> Examples: expression when it was first sees Grinch. It's a classic quote ("You're the the one", then filled with the "da da da THE GRINCH" line of Grinch, then it rolls over to the sorter and is then saved by The Grinch). "The Grinch quote and the subsequent answer were also very good. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the movie is the situation where Cindy invites Grinch to Holiday Cheermeister." This scene is the two outstanding actors in their best interaction and Little Taylor Momsen completely stays with Jim Carrey in this place, I sincerely hope that we will see Taylor Momsen in many other films, in total everything was great in this film (maybe except for the feet and noses).
