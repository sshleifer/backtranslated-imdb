I'm not a parent, I'm not a man either. But I was able to identify with the pain and pain of each character. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that teenagers should watch. Maybe in this way they will start to appreciate the value of the family again. I apologize for those who do not understand the values ​​of love, family and friendship. <br /> <br /> It was very interesting to watch Patrick Duffy in a different role than Bobby Ewing. And it's great to see 19-year-old Ben Affleck, who gives his all in moving and sincere performance. He showed at a young age that he is capable of deep drama. He should receive more serious roles. Note Hollywoodland ... its first major role for years and went out and won the best actor award at the Venice festival in 2006. <br /> <br /> This movie can be appreciated by people of all ages. Perhaps they should not be watched by children under 10, because they may be afraid that the same thing may happen to their families, but I recommend it to the whole family. <br /> <br /> I bought this movie on DVD and watched it many times with my friends. Because it presents values ​​that are important in life.
