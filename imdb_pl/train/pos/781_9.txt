"Crush" examines feminine friendship, avoiding mostly saccharine, which spoils so many films about the same subject (eg "Steel magnolias"). At the same time reveals the power of sudden passion to overwhelm and surprise. The presented events were highly unlikely, but the basic emotional truth seemed to me very authentic. Not a movie for a crowd of speeding vehicles and explosions, but adult women will certainly react with laughter and tears.
