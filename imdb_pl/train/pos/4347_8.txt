I will not go into too much detail about the story of this movie, because other reviewers have been working on the same topic. <br /> <br /> I just wanted to say that I really liked this movie. The performance of Peter Falk alone is a sufficient reason to watch the film. <br /> <br /> The small film "Wandering" with Falk and Paul Reiser in the northern part of New York is the scene for most of the action in the film. <br /> <br /> Very well written for adult customers. Lots of humor based on reality and a well-played drama give the film a sense that it can be your family. <br /> <br /> I really can not say enough about this movie except that it's a shame that a beautiful movie in this way does not have a bigger exposure, while other junk stuff is there. <br /> <br /> It's great to see Falk with the great leading role of a man and he uses it. This proves that his famous friend and screenwriter / director John Casavettes rightly cast Falk in many groundbreaking films from the 1960s and 1970s.
