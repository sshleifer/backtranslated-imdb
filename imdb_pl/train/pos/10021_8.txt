This story based on two works by Edgar Allen Poe ("The Fall of the House of Usher", "Dance of Death" (poem)) is actually pretty scary from the beginning to the end. This is similar to some old black and white films about people who meet in an old decrepit home (for example, "Cat and Canary", "Old Dark House", "Night of Terror", etc.). Boris Karloff plays the mad inventor of life-size dolls that terrorize guests. He dies at the beginning of the film (or maybe?), And the inhabitants of the house are subjected to many terrifying experiences. I will not discuss too much detail here, but it is definitely a must for fans of the old secrets of the dark house. <br /> <br /> Watch it with lots of popcorn and soda in a dark room. /> <br /> Dan Basinger 8/10
