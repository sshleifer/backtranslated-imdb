Stuart-breaking stinger with Stanwyck playing a bizarre whore who falls asleep at the top. This cinema in front of the code really allows everything, leaving nothing to the imagination. Stanwyck is outstanding as Lilly daughter of the speakeasy daughter of the owner / father who sold more than alcohol to his clients (underpants). sleep on the way to the top. John Wayne makes a poor "episodic" and proves that the actors are doing better with age and acting coach. I loved teasing and strong lines between the actors. I highly recommend this film to all film lovers and watch Stanwyck who is wonderful and beautiful like Lilly.
