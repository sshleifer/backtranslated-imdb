Joe Don Baker belongs to a handful of actors who are often better than his material and are almost always underestimated. He has played in many films, as a heavy or hero, and has a strong, solid presence that Wallace Beery made half a century before him. Baker can provide material that would sound absurd, coming from another actor, and it's so great. He seems to mean what he says, no matter how banal, obvious or stupid, which puts him in the league with Tommy Lee Jones, Oliver Reed and Don Stroud. This is what made the WALKING TALL trilogy work so well and the same magic is here in FINAL JUSTICE. It was a significant hit in cinemas and video in the 1980s, which was aging much better than many of the better known action movies from the era. By transferring the action from Texas to Europe, there is a real timeless quality that does not push you away from the action on the screen. To be honest, I've always liked Greydon Clark's films, which is a non-nonsense director in the same style as Clint Eastwood from the '70s, and this is one of his best. FINAL JUSTICE is one of the lost gems of the late 1980s, just like MAN ON FIRE in its real gravel and violence. I suppose if they convert it from The Rock, the whole new audience will love it as much as I do.
