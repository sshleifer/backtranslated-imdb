Honestly, I had no idea what the movie was about when I started it. In this way, I watch movies whenever possible. No prejudices. I thought it would be a movie about stones in the forest or something like that. I was wrong, a little bit. <br /> <br /> I read at the beginning a bit boring, but when it started to do, it really drew me. I know the feeling of being pulled into something dangerous where you feel helpless, but you do things you do not want to do. <br /> <br /> Another user commented on how this movie was stupid and unlikely, but I am begging you for a difference. Things like that happen. I'm sorry, but not everyone lives in a dream world where nothing bad happens, and crazy situations are "unbelievable". I'm really sorry, but the reality of the WORLD is that they happen. The creator of this film, as well as the actors, did a great job of how things can go wrong and how people can make really bad choices. Sometimes things turn out to be good, sometimes they turn out to be bad and that's life. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie.
