I was very excited about this movie because I've always heard that it was very scary. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, this is a Japanese movie that they decided to bring to America, but in fact they were filmed by Japan with the original crew! I think it made the movie ... more Japanese (probably because it succeeded in contrast to most Japanese-American movies from horror films), but also made it somewhat inaccessible to the American audience. The difference in what frightens Japanese culture and what scares American culture throughout the film. It worked well at times when they were aimed at capturing the nervous fear of the main character: a terrified fish in a large, crowded, unknown pond in Tokyo. <br /> <br /> The plot was also quite misleading. In a typical Japanese way it is extremely complicated and confusing. The beginning of the film is actually the center of history, and from there we are constantly moving forward and backward until at the end of the film we see the ending and the beginning of the whole story. This constant passing of time was very confusing to me. Besides, I did not think that some things were explained so well and I had to ask my friend to explain it to me (she has already seen this, as well as a sequel that apparently reveals more stories). <br /> <br /> In general, there is a lot of American audience to worship, lots of bizarre images and macabre details that are a healthy plus of jump scenes.
