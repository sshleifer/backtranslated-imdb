The Thing About My Folks is a great film about relationships - first of all an adult son and his father, but also the son with his wife, sisters and mother. Paul Reiser wrote a semi-autobiographical film about his relationships with his father. The film is funny, poignant and provocative for thought. This led me to re-evaluate my relationship with my deceased father and my adult son. Peter Falk is perfect as Paul's father - the role could not have been better. I hope that both Mr. Falk and Mr. Reiser are recognized in next year's film awards for their efforts - Falk for his performance and Reiser for his script.
