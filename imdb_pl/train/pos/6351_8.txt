When Grinch appeared, I was excited, though I thought it would be a happy movie and it was. Although he had a small nightmare before Christmas. You know a kind of dark and terrible. I loved this movie because it helped people fill the spirit with Christmas. So mostly Grinch saved Christmas. And what happened at Whoville then says that Grinch's little heart has grown by three sizes that day. MERRY GRINCHMAS!
