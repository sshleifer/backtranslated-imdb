It is primarily a fantastic series. It is very well done and very interesting. As a great buff from World War II, I learned a lot before I saw this series. One of the best things that affected it is all interviews with past people when the war was relatively fresh in their minds, relatively saying it is. It's against the people you're talking to in today's programs, just the majority of these men were not really involved in the higher levels of what was going on at the time. One of the best parts is the narration of Sir Laurence Oliver. I recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about World War II, but I really think that only die-hards (like me) will want to buy or watch more than once. My only real complaint about this whole series is that some facts are not as accurate as we now know. Especially with information about the Soviet Union is exaggerated or just in some places inaccurate. This information is now different, which we now know because of the collapse of the USSR. In general, a fascinating view of the Second World War and the need to see every serious historian of World War II, both professional and personal.
