Modern, original, romantic story. <br /> <br /> A very good game for both Nicole Kidman and Ben Chaplin. <br /> <br /> Miss Kidman is doing a good job imitating the Russian accent. Ben Chaplin is also good as a shy, boring official. For men (and some women): Miss Kidman looks fantastic and is very nice. I forgot who a great woman is. It is not difficult to imagine that John falls in love with her. Some unexpected turns in history are good for tension. Although I was hoping for a happy ending, the last part of the movie was a big surprise for me. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: a good movie. <br /> <br /> Les Pays-Bas: huit points.
