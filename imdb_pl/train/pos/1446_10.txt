Has Al Pacino ever been in a bad movie? His name seems to be an imprimatur for top-class cinema. This is such a good performance that he has ever given. Pacino is an American Olivier. And this is a political thriller as good as it gets. There are no good guys or bad guys. But the system has an unavoidable effect on people who think they are launching it. Pacino's performance is not only fascinating - praise at the funeral of the deceased child is incredibly powerful - the film is characterized by fast, rough realism, which improves great performances without resorting to tricks. This excellent portrait of metropolitan politics also allows for two hours of perfect watching movies without unnecessary violence, overheating sex or gutter language. There is murder. There are bad people. But they face effectively without crossing the line. This movie restores my weary faith in Hollywood. I do not reward many dozens. He deserves it!
