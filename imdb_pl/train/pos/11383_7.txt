It is a great musical with the timeless score of one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and the pleasant atmosphere of "Parisien", which gives the film a lot of charm, but when it comes to the story ... well, it really is not there. Or at least not well-designed. Acting is not as smooth as Caron. But I liked some dialogues, I liked the scene in the Seine, I liked the character played by Levant, the colors; and of course the dance, which is quite wonderful. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that it is 7.5 - 8 points.
