Moonwalker is a Fantasy Music film with Michael Jackson in various segments. I will evaluate each segment individually. <br /> <br /> Segment 1 opens a movie with a music video. The music video is a concert of Michael Jackson performing the song "Man in the Mirror", the music video also shows the montage of historical figures such as Gandhi, Martin Luther King JR, John Lennon and many more. The first episode was a good choice to open a movie, I liked the song, and I loved the editing of historical characters. I even loved the message in the song. I give the first segment 9/10. <br /> <br /> Segment 2 shows the assembly of Michael Jackson from Jackson Five to his solo career. The editing, which I thought was well done, I liked the animation they put into it, and I loved their song choices, such as "I want you back, Beat it, Thriller, feel it and the way I feel." The only thing I would like them to do a little better in one of the songs in the editing is "We are the world". The reason you see only raindrops are those of Michael Jackson and the chorus of stars, but it's hard to see the chorus. In addition, the segment is still good. Daję him 9/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 3 is the song Bad. You're probably thinking about Michael Jackson's music video about bad, yes and no. This segment is a music video, but it is remade by children. The segment was charming, but it was not as good as other segments. Daję him 6/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 4 is a short movie Claymation Music, which takes place after the children's version of "Speed ​​Demon". In short, Michael Jackson is being hunted by his beloved fans and the press, and he dresses up as a rabbit and rides a motorcycle to free himself from them. Claymation in the chase sequence was great, but some parts of the movie in which Claymation's characters looked a bit fake when they interacted with real people. At the end of the clip out of nowhere, the costume of King Michael Jackson comes to life and dances with him. I liked to dance, but it was like out of nowhere. I give him 8/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 5 is the Grammy award-winning film by Michael Jackson, "Leave me alone." The video talks about media that stabs into Michael Jackson's personal life, and Michael Jackson feels they will not leave him alone, no matter how innocent it turns out. The video really speaks (but remember, it happened before child molestation, only rumors about him in the 80s), but I did not think that this movie should be in this movie, because it's a movie for children and I do not think that children will understand what they are singing about. I give this music video 8/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 6 leads us to the main story of the whole movie called "Smooth Criminal". Michael Jackson plays a gangster who uses his star powers as a criminal character to protect children (including son John Lennon Sean Lennon) from an evil gangster named Mr. Bigg (played by Joe Pesci). The segment I thought I really brought the movie, especially when he danced and sang the song "Smooth Criminal" with a group of criminals. I also thought that the special effects were good. Strange in the Segment is why children spend time with an adult man and never explain why. Also the character Joe Pesci talks about drugs and what he intends to do with them. That means why you should talk about drugs in a children's film. Besides, it was good. My rating for this segment is 8/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 7 is the last segment of the entire movie. The film ends with Michael Jackson, who sings the cover version of Beatle's song "Come Together", and then during the loan we see Michael Jackson singing with Ladysmith Black Mambazo. Michael made a good cover "Come Together" and I think it was a good idea to put together a group of good vocalists with a talented musician like him. My rating is 9/10 <br /> <br /> This movie is a good movie by Michael Jackson. I think it really brings out the child's imagination. The film is almost as imaginative as the Beatles' animated film "Yellow Submarine" if you like Michael Jackson and you are able to make a movie with great creativity. My overall rating for this movie is 8/10
