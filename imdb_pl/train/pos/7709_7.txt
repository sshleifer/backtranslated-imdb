I know that I should like this film and I do it mostly, but as others have mentioned, it is a bit too long in the tooth. I also found that the raging hormones of all male crew are a bit annoying. It is strange that they have not started panting and howling at the moons. I must also say that in general the film leaves me cold. It's a very sterile atmosphere that permeates the film. On the plus side, the effects are great (except the cartoon monster), as well as effects, props, costumes and of course Robbie. If the job was not in this movie, I do not think it's as popular as it was / is. The second half of the movie picks up the pair when we start to examine forgotten gadgets "Krell". As many times as I saw in this movie, Krell still leaves me scratching my head, exactly who and what they were. Based on what was produced at the time, in addition to "This Island Earth", Forbidden Planet is a mile above the average Sci-Fi films of those times. Color filming further enhances his pleasure. Certainly a classic in itself, defects and everything, and deservedly so.
