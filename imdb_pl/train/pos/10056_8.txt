We watched this in my lesson on women's health problems to show how women in many societies are treated worse than men and absolutely loved this film. I'm going to try to get a copy myself to watch. The story is very moving and I recommend it to everyone. I am a fan of different cultures and this movie was just what I needed. It is a film for the whole family, despite its evaluation. This is a movie that I will show to my children. The professor of our class wanted the film to be primarily education about women, but this film was something more. It's one of those movies that will always remain in my mind and be a favorite.
