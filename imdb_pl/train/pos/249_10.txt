I've seen the trailer of the movie several times and I have to say that Ned Kelly looks like a wonderful movie. When I saw the trailer for the first time, I could not take my eyes off him (it certainly caught my attention). Heath Ledger stays with what he knows and works for him, pieces from the era. Not to mention Orlando Bloomie, who looks fantastic for a fraction of a second. I think that this film will be a hit and will be seen over and over again by many people.
