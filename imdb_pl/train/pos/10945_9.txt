The best performance since Seinfeld. It is really funny. Her total focus on herself, the huge number of homosexual neighbors of the stoners, the departure of songs or fairy tales, make this the latest show on television. One of the few shows I pay attention to. A scene with a wise old black lady in a pharmacy ("Oh, wait now that you are close, you look old," turns your face away and leaves lol), overdose of cough syrup, sleep with God, it's all so funny or so stupid just a lot of fun. Visible weaknesses are her sister and only a policewoman because they are too fucking normal !! I really can not wait for the next show, something I have not felt for a long time.
