The question of whether someone likes this version of the movie "The Ghost Train" invariably depends on one thing and one thing: your reaction to the performance of Arthur Askey. <br /> <br /> It tends to steal almost any scene it is in, and not always in a good way. Sometimes you would like him to settle down or withdraw only a little to allow the plot to have many characters to develop (which to some extent they do). But somehow, everything points to the character of Tommy Gander Askey. <br /> <br /> Personally, I like this movie, and even to some extent like Askey. I always think I put it in a VCR in those weird hours of the early morning when I can not sleep and I really can not find energy to watch anything else. There is something in watching old black and white films in the quiet dark pre-dawn, which I find attractive ...
