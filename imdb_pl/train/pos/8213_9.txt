Every witness of our justice system - or lack of it - will find this film really satisfying. There were not too many shades of gray in relation to a character or story. Virtually every character in this film personified the best and the worst in our society. The popularity of this film is probably due to the fact that most of us had to deal with scum at one time or another, and with repulsive, lazy, buzzing bureaucrats who strengthen them in the name of "political correctness." <br /> <br /> The performances on the entire album were convincing. I sympathized with the victim of rape - at the same time I thought it was satisfying to see him washing away the contented, malicious arrogance from the face of former assailants. In particular, I found a causeway, one of the ugliest characters in all the films I've seen, so it was nice to see her old victim put her mouth shut for good. The main rapist and psychopath were just as ugly, so the only thing that suited him was that Dirty Harry eventually finally broke into a loud grotesque fashion. It was the only continuation of Harry's dirty saga, which equaled the first.
