This is a great movie for all generations of X'ers. What other world compared America from 1972 to our psychotic 21st century. You can see how America in 1972 passed by watching this movie. I discovered that the clothes and style of the car brought back to me fond memories of a much better country than now. Just think ... then there were only 4 or 5 TV stations to choose from. There were no AIDS, Muslim terrorists, Road Rage, 911, bird flu, snipers from motorways, etc. Etc. War in Vietnam came to an end. 7 years will pass before Star Wars come out. Personal computer and internet would be in 29 years. <br /> <br /> When this movie first appeared, the producers had to sell the film themselves, because no other film company wanted it. It started with concerts in small Protestant churches around the country, shown on film projectors (it was obviously before VCRS). A church pastor who would be interested in showing the Thief the night of his congregation would receive a copy of the film. Then he prepared the evening to show him in the church or the dining room. Members of the congregation invited "unsaved" friends and family members, and this will be the social event of the week. <br /> <br /> If you manage to avoid the limited production values ​​of the movie and just watch them because of its nostalgic value, I think you will like the movie more. Of course, I say as gen. <br /> <br /> If I had a time machine, I would go back to 1972 and say goodbye to the cesspool of the 21st century, which we now have.
