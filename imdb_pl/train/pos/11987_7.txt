Because it's been several years since I've seen this classic, I decided to go back and see it more in dept, but first some internal remarks from the film critic. <br /> <br /> This animated series is one of those that I grew up with, it made my childhood joyful, made it amazing, I miss some of these things today, that clearly we do not see so much, like in times, and then in the review ... <br /> <br /> Talespin, or Luftens Helte, which is called in Denmark, is a great animated series, is very similar to chip and dale, ducktales and many of the old ones, so it has a strange feeling that surrounds him, I can not remember this series as much as I would like to remember it. <br /> <br /> But in my opinion it was very wonderful, it came with some news, not such a wild message, but it is one of the old messages that can be forgiven. <br /> <br /> Now I do not want to sound old or anything, but I feel that time has eluded me from these cartoons, today we see something like Ed E dd and Eddy or anything strange in this style, we have all new or almost new programs like Hannah Montana or something like that, but I feel that we do not have the same spirit in cartoons or real programs as we do in the early days. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm wrong now, but I feel that the time has changed a lot, to sum up, I would be excited to see that the series, such as Talespin, are being re-released on the TV screen instead of all the new ones, give me back My childhood stories, give them to the children I have one day, give them back ...
