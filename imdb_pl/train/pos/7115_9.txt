A wonderful and sharp war movie that focuses on the inner passion of the blinded sailor Al Schmid. Although it is difficult and unpleasant, it is finally heroic - Schmid's triumph over disability and depression. The battle scene was great. But one bone to choose from. No matter how many .50 missiles they fired, I've never seen impacts hit water or dirt! It hurt realism, but I can live with it. A great performance by Eleanor Parker, again as his friend.
