Debut? Wow - Cross-Eyed is certainly one of the most enjoyable indie movies that I watched last year, which makes it hard to believe that Cross Eyed is the writer's debut film. I mean - I've logged in to IMDb to find more of the author's videos ... because Cross Eyed has this unique signature - you want to see what else this writer can say. Nowadays, a well-written, well-filmed, well-assembled and well-filmed movie is rarely seen. For me - Cross Eyed captures what film making should be - combining the best elements of all films to create a wise, artistic and touching story. More please.
