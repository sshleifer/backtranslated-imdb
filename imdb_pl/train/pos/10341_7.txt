A real comic farce depicting the mid-1970s situation was a huge hit for about 5 minutes and disappeared from the face of the earth. I am constantly amazed by some comedy films, which are a big issue a week, then disappear: HIGH FEAR, CHEAP DETECTIVE, BLACK BIRD, DO NOT LOOK NOW, WE ARE IN BOTH ... and have no profile today. NORMAN was the comedy of the month in 1976, when everyone seemed to see it, they laughed at it and never mentioned it again. NORMAN is known for being filmed on the videotape and transferred to the film. The experiment at this time is a noisy politically incorrect wardrobe, slamming the farce Farrelly Brothers should think today. If they did it in the first place, there would be no complaints about its content and slant. It's very funny and very naughty and funny. As it should be. In fact, as a 1976 movie. With all the colors of horror films and clothing, it now works better.
