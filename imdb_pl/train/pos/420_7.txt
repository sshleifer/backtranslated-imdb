This movie presents the saga of the legendary Wild Bill Hickock. He, Buffalo Bill Cody and Calamity Jane, are the main heroes. <br /> <br /> When the civil war comes to an end, Lincoln mentions his concern that the country's dynamics will be strengthened if people follow the advice of "Go West, young man", which fortunately the movie mistakenly attributed to Horace Greeley, just like many others. But then he is murdered, and some financiers speculate that they can enrich American weapons with Indians. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, we see Wild Bill Hickock, who interacts with the little boy while the steamer loads in the dock along Mississippi. Wild Bill uses the Bowie knife, which finally gives the boy, calling him "Arkansas toothpick", which was actually a different type of knife, although both were used on the border. <br /> <br /> Hickock finally meets Buffalo Bill Cody, who looks close to the photos and images of the real man. Cody just got married and brings his bride to the Old West to settle down. <br /> <br /> Once they reach their destination, they run into Calamity Jane, who falls in love with Hickock. He looks at Cody's wife and asks Buffalo Bill: "Is this your pugs?" This line made Hayes's management have a problem, because one of the definitions of "pugs" was a prostitute. Demille wanted to go inside, and one of his advisers pointed out that in the Beatrix Potter books about Peter the Rabbit, three rabbits were Flops, Pugs and Cottontail. He paid attention to this and asked the censors to identify "the rabbit of bad virtue." It worked; the line remained in. <br /> <br /> Indians became restless, partly thanks to the better weapons they got from the agent of the Eastern financiers. Cody and Hickock were asked to help explore the area so that the soldiers could safely reach the beleaguered area. Cody ran branches; Hickock went to check the activities of an Indian chief who was an old friend and who led some hostile Indians. <br /> <br /> The defeat of Jane is captured, and Hickock is caught trying to save her. They are taken to the boss, and although none of them say, the tortures used against Hickock break the willpower of Calamity Jane, and she says Cody uses the route. <br /> <br /> Both have been released, and Hickock joins Cody and his forces, partly to warn them that they are trapped. With the help of Hickok, they stop the Indian attack. <br /> <br /> Hickock decides to attack the runners and finally takes the prisoners. While waiting for power, Hickock is shot by shooting in the back while playing cards. <br /> <br /> There are many historical anomalies in the film, but it retains the taste of the legend. Not bad for the thirties.
