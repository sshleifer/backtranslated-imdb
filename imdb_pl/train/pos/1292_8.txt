Preston Waters, an 11-year-old boy, has problems with his parents and brothers, especially because of money problems. He is crazy that he has his own home and his own rules, because his brothers always stole his money and his parents disregard his wishes. On a dreadful day, Preston rode his bike; It was the same day that the villain of the story, Quigley, tried to jump out of the police and accidentally drove a car through Preston's bike. Wanting to be far from the police, Quigley is in a hurry to see if he can damage the Preston bike. The problem was that it was an empty check! Preston is a wise boy and decides to pay a high price for this check: 1 million dollars! All this money gives Preston the things he's always dreamed of, like a mansion with a pool, lots of toys, and even a limousine! Problems begin when the FBI and Quigley want to know where the money is, making Preston a difficult situation and struggling with many problems. <br /> <br /> This movie was one of my favorites in my childhood. :)
