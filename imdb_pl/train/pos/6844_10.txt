"Dressed to Kill" is the best film by Brian DePalma, an absolute thrill, full of tension, humor and style, which today is unmatched. DePalma has a bum rap in Hollywood, because most people say he breaks Alfred Hitchcock. He does not. Hitchcock could only dream about what DePalma shows in his thrillers. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the original uncommon version of "Dressed to Kill" is no longer available on video. The current copy issued by Goodtimes is a cut by R. Valenti approved by R. But some copies of the original DePalmy cut still exist. This is the one distributed by Warner Home Video, both in a green cardboard box with Angie Dickinson on the cover, and in a black case with a flap with a theater poster on a silver lining. These are the ones you can get if you can find a copy. I have green and is among my precious things. <br /> <br /> Anyway, going back to history. Dickinson plays Kate Miller, a sexually frustrated wife who is treated by Dr. Robert Elliott (Michael Caine) for her obsessive fantasies. During a trip to the museum (a real DePalmy trip for working with the camera and tension), Miller is taken by a stranger. You can guess what's happening to her because ads and box graphics betray the story. But there are a few complications. The prostitute (Nancy Allen) is the only witness to the murder. Kate Miller's son Peter (Keith Gordon) is a teenage genius determined to solve the crime. And the automatic secretary of Dr. Elliott has some message ... about the missing razor ... <br /> <br /> I do not spoil the film at all because what I described above takes place in the first half hour and the biggest surprises DePalms are reserved for the last hour. This film, however, is clearly enough for Valenti (head of the MPAA) to demand cuts in the film. What surprises me is what cuts he wanted. A few cuts in the initial shower scene and one or two cutting scenes and some Nancy Allen dialogs (Valenti wanted the "cock" to turn into "bulge"). It is a very violent and bloody movie, but the objections concern sexual content. I would love to hear Valenti's explanation about how the seeing of two women on the delicate love scene in "Lost and Delirious" is somehow more harmful to the young mind than Arnold Schwarzenegger, who throws people away with a chain gun. It's just not fair. <br /> <br /> What makes "Dressed to Kill" so good is that not only technical points are first-rate but also very good. Michael Caine, who participated in many nonsense during this period, gives one of his best performances as a doctor. Angie Dickinson is better than usual, perhaps because she has an important role here. Nancy Allen adds this to her series of performances, in which she became one of the most underrated and underrated actresses in the world. Keith Gordon is wonderful as a genius and I loved all of his inventions. <br /> <br /> DePalma is one of our best directors who have never received the recognition he deserved. A recent joke from the AFI 100 Best Thrillers list showed that very few people know what a thriller is. If they opened their eyes at least once, they would see that DePalma bet on his thriller career and is the best craftsman. This is even better than "Psycho". It is a pity that very few really know. <br /> <br /> **** with 4 stars
