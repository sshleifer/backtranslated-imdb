I recently watched this movie from 1954, in which Vincent Price appeared for the first time in the film Turner Classic Movies. The price is presented by Don Gallico, the magician / inventor who is forced to murder, when his boss steals some of his magical inventions (and also his wife, presented in a short role by the charming Eva Gabor). Although Price is a killer, I really supported him, he is a nice character who is crazy about the greedy people around him who use him. <br /> <br /> Although this movie does not do it. There is no "horror movie" in some of its more famous roles (such as my favorite "House of Wax"), but it is still enough to interest viewers. <br /> <br /> This is mandatory for Vincent Price fans.
