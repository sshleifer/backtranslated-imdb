This film was an interesting Hollywood movie about the novel under the same title Pearl S. Buck. While some today may think that it is rich in racial stereotypes, for the time being the idea of ​​Chinese heroes was progressive in itself. I discovered that white Chinese actors were not as bad as I expected it was not the Asian equivalent of a black face. Then in America there were not really any Asian actors (even George Takei did not play), and Rainer did a good job on her part. It was not the biggest performance I've ever seen, but it was nice because of the old-school pre-method. The locust scene was very well shot and had convincing special effects. <br /> <br /> I wonder if the time of release during the Great Depression in some way turns this film into an allegory. Especially political shocks of staggering peasant farmers and how they seem to lag behind all this. <br /> <br /> The film had some similarities to the style of John Ford, but I think that it was also influenced by the East. If it were a western family, the locust would win at the end, punishing the farmer for his pride, lust and gluttony. However, here he learns his lesson and then wins.
