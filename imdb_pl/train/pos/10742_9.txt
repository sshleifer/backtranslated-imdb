A difficult movie to comment on when you say it is bad? Well, it is not, but then it is equally difficult to say that it is good. What is, it's convincing watching, it's as close as it happens to destroy it without being there. It's tsunami photographs that are approaching the coast of Thailand, come alive, you know you want to turn around, but you have to look. <br /> <br /> The Naudet brothers cope very well with the commentary, even in the most tragic circumstances, there the view of something that is happening in another country does not change or offend. The facts are on cellulose and little is needed for the viewer to understand what is happening. <br /> <br /> You can not change history, and you should not want to, this film is a testimony of humanity at the darkest hour.
