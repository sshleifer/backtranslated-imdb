In 1996, "101 Dalmatians", Cruella De Vil was arrested by London Metropolitain Police (God bless them) for attempting to steal and murder 101 puppies - Dalmatians. The whole covered with mud and hay, she spent the next 4 years in a "tin can". Now, four years later, she was unfortunately released from prison. I say it's about 28 years - in dog years !!!!! <br /> <br /> So in 2000, Disney decided to continue the successful version of the classic live movie and this is now called "102 Dalmatians." There is a 102 Dalmatian added to the family (I think it's Oddball, I should know because it was shown on TV recently) and the puppy did not have any points !!!!! In addition, while Cruella (again played by Glenn Close) escaped again, she wanted to have a bigger, better coat - again made of puppies !!!!! <br /> <br /> I especially liked the theme song - I'm sure that everyone loves the song "Atomic Dog" from the 70's. And now we hear it in this movie !!!!! <br /> <br /> "102 Dalmatians" is a great movie, which I'm still wondering - WHEN WILL "103 DALMATS" BE? ??? LOL <br /> <br /> 10 stars
