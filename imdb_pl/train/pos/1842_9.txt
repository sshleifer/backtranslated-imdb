Series 2 has started great! I do not think you need to watch series 1 to understand what's going on, but as with any series, it's nice to feel the character's meaning and take care of what's happening to them. And this program makes you think so! These 4 30-year-old women seem to lead an exciting and exciting life, but the premise is credible and realistic. So the twists and turns that come through their love and sex life are exciting, but you also know that these are problems that happen to real women. It's about the decisions we make as women, and how we sometimes follow certain paths in our lives, and we do not consciously make those decisions!
