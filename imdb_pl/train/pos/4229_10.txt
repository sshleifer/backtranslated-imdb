Do not waste time reading my review. Go out and see this amazingly good episode, which may be the best Columbo ever written! Ruth Gordon is well-mannered as an intriguing and at the same time charming mysterious writer who murders her son-in-law to avenge his daughter's murder. Columbo is his usual rumpled, dazed and far-sighted one, and this particular part contains fantastic chemistry between Gordon and Falk. Ironically, it was not written by the announced creators of Levinson or Linka, but it is probably the densest, most original and full of corners of the story, Columbo. Completely satisfying in almost every department and full of droll and witty dialogue and thinking. A truly unexpected and ingenious climax. 10/10 ... search for Netflix!
