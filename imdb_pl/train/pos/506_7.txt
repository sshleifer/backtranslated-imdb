This two-hour episode is a powerful pilot who perfectly takes characters and backgrounds for the "Enterprise", "prequel" of the original series "Star Trek". Several times he stumbles over the convention "Trek" and clich√©s - cosmic candy stripteids never go out of fashion, and I can already predict harsh references to T'pol as "Seven Vulcan" - but the band looks strong, the characters are well drawn and you can already notice that this particular team will have to be more resourceful, in different ways than those from previous (later) series. Scott Bakula gets the right note as a captain with Kirk's insolence and boldness, but without his satisfaction and pride, and I look forward to the ways the series will include the engineer, weapons master and communications officer (not just a famous telephone operator!) As supporting players . It seems that the writers took on one big mistake committed in "Star Trek: The Next Generation", "Deep Space 9" and "Voyager": instead of starting with a large cast of the band and giving the characters a short spasm, it starts with a smaller core character to which you can later add a little more diversity - which I hope will happen, because after about half a dozen episodes will need more variety.
