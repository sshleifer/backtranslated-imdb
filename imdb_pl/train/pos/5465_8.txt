This is Warner Brothers' hard-line movie with the participation of young Barbara Stanwyck. An excellent master in presenting the Machiavellian cool, a technique that she perfected eleven years later in Billy Wilder's Double Indemnity, Stanwyck stars as Lily Powers, the weary daughter of her husband's brutal husband in a stifling city of steel. She was cynical and numb during the years of being offered as a sexual favor to her father's clients. When her father dies in a distillery explosion, he jumps on a freight train to New York and literally falls asleep on the bank's corporate ladder. <br /> <br /> It would be ridiculous if it was not for the burning Stanwyck working here. Thanks to her blind looks and amoral methods of seduction, it is easy to see why men become addicted to her aggressive corporeality. One of the young men he seduces along the way is John Wayne with a fresh face, accountant Jimmy McCoy. Melodrama becomes heavy compared to the last third of the film with a suicide murder, quiet work in Paris, to keep Lily alone, and the new president of the bank, who is so addicted to Lily that he misappropriates corporate funds to keep her in luxury. The tip with the tack is a bit disappointing, but not before Stanwyck touches the screen. The film has interesting accents, such as the bond linking Lily with an African-American woman named Chico and a German immigrant who teaches Lily about Nietzsche's philosophy of the importance of avoiding sentimentality.
