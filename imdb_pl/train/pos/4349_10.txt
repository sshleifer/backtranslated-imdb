Sam Kleinman (Peter Falk) unexpectedly comes to his son's place. His son Ben Kleinman (Paul Reiser) is very surprised to hear that his mother Muriel Kleinman (Olympia Dukakis) left his father. Ben's wife, Rachel (Elizabeth Perkins) and his three sisters are trying to find Muriel while Ben and his father visit the house for sale. But this is not the end of their journey. Their journey changes into a long therapeutic session between Ben and his father. Raymond De Felitta is the director of The Thing About My Folks (2005). Paul Reiser stands behind the scenario and did an amazing job. The dialogue between Ben and Sam is simply amazing. And he has been working with the script for twenty years, so it's no wonder it's so good. Who would be a better man to play father than Peter Falk? Nobody, I can tell you that. And I really like the story, why Paul wanted Peter Falk to do that role. Peter was an actor who made his father laugh. And Peter certainly made me laugh in this movie. Go fishing. And how an old guy beats the younger in the game of billiards, and then he beat him with a stick. The film is often very funny and I laughed a few times. You can not tell a story better than it is said here.
