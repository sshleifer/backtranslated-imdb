I could not believe the comments about the movie. <br /> <br /> When I read the horrible reviews about the movie, I was wondering if you actually watched the same movie as me. <br /> <br /> What I watched was amazing! I think that actresses and the director did a fantastic job in the film. <br /> <br /> I have not had the pleasure of seeing any of these actresses before and could not have been more restrained by the amazing work they have done or would have to say that this is the most credible movie I have seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> What I do not see is why everyone has such a problem with the choice of Deanna in the attempt to commit suicide, with comments that made you sound like it was the choice of actresses and her stupid choice. I do not understand it, it's a movie written by someone else and directed by someone else, so how can it be the mistake of actresses I do not see. I think it was a really reliable movie that I would see again and recommend. Opinions are what they are and it is so bad that so many are so close to the mind. I hope to see any of the actors soon, I think everyone played great roles. <br /> <br /> Busy Philipps will one day be the best-paid actress and I hope she will be able to laugh at all who criticized her! You come girl!
