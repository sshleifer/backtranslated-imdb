In this transmission of horrors, paranoia from the Cold War of the 1950s, the Reagan era and school movies, Adam Arkin plays Tony, the star who plays Full Moon High in the 1950s. He and his father (Ed McMahon) travel to Communist Romania and one evening lost on the streets is bitten by a werewolf. When he returns to the country, he can not control his animal urges and continues his deadly madness. Frustrated, he escapes from the city. Decades later immortal Tony returns to the city and re-enrolls in high school. He still can not control his changes, and the city's residents and his friends realize that he is not quite human. The culmination of all this is the great football match of schools. <br /> <br /> I expected it to be one of those "so bad, good" movies from the early 80's. But I was surprised that the film was indeed, rightly funny. The cast, including Kenneth Mars as a perverted trainer, Roz Kelly as the lusty previous flame of Tony, Demond Wilson as the bus driver, and Alan Arkin as a bizarre doctor, do everything with fun results. <br /> <br /> While watching this movie, it struck me how similar writing and humor were to "Family Guy". "Full Moon High" has the same approach and never takes itself seriously.
