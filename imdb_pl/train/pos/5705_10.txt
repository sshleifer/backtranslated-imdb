A great early musical film by Rene Clair, equally funny and witty as his silent "The Italian Straw Hat". Using sound in an expressive way, not just dialogue and effects, Clair influenced early musicals in America (the operatic scene with A Night at the Opera is heavily influenced by Le Million, for example). It should (but should not) be watched by all moviegoers, and the Criterion DVD is exactly as good as you'd expect. There are not many extras, but most of the DVD accessories I've seen are useless, and Clair's interview on the disk is something I've never seen before. Get it while it's still around.
