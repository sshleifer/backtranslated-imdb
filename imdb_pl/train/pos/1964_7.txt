I can not accept negative comments from other reviewers. They are too critical, perhaps because they are stuck in the past. I would like to see a comment from someone who has never seen Basic Instinct 1, maybe someone very young? I left the cinema, enjoying that I was not impressed by the IMDb reviewers. 14 hours later I am still trying to find mistakes in the story, but I can not think of anything serious. My advice to all is to see it with your own eyes and decide. <br /> <br /> Similar scheme to Basic Instinct 1, but the plot is less confused. I was still thinking about it, but in a more satisfying way. Sharon Stone is as sexy and angry as before and she is wearing her 48 years very well; it remains her decisive role. David Morrisey was satisfactory, although he is not Michael Douglas. Of the cast, I particularly liked David Thewlis as a police detective.
