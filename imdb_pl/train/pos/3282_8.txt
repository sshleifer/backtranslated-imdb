Not knowing what the movie is about, I checked it in the video shop and after watching it I liked it. You can not see a multi-genre film from the director Bernard Rose (Candyman, Immortal Beloved). Great story and characters. As Glenne Healdy's fan, I was surprised by her British accent. The only exception to this movie was the ending. However, it is worth the rent.
