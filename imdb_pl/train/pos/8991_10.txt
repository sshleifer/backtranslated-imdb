TO DIG! it's funny, funny, funny, interesting, stylish and very well done. Knowing that it was created on such a modest budget for 7 years, it is amazing that such a story can be told, especially in this style and content. If you're a fan of music or a fan of documentaries, then you have to see. <br /> <br /> Focusing on Brian Jonestown Masssacre and The Dandy Warhols over the years is a great way to show the contrast between a decent team that meets moderate success thanks to perseverance and the ability to compromise and a brilliant megalomaniac, supported by a variety of characters that sabotage their success through drugs, alcohol and madness. If I did not know that it is a movie material depicting real people, I would swear that it is an extremely well-written and imaginative scenario. The story is fascinating, concise and simply amazing.
