The remote control is extremely well made. It defines how the characters connect in future episodes. I do not think anyone can create a better pilot for this program. It shows extraordinary creativity in the writing part. Although not everything was straightened out, because it was the first episode, many events that occurred in future seasons, were presented in the pilot. An example is the future relationship between Ross and Rachel. Although the nervousness of the first episode appeared, it was overcome by an amazing storyline and an outstanding cast selection. <br /> <br /> Bravo. <br /> <br /> A great start to an unrivaled comedy!
