This is one of my favorite movies and I recommend it to everyone. On my list of favorite movies (mental list, mind), the only ones with them are movies like the Lord of the Rings, Spirited Away and Fly Away Home series. <br /> <br /> I can really relate to the main character Jess. At the beginning of the film, she is a shy girl with a slightly strange background who has many more friends than boys. She really draws you into her life. I certainly can not blame any of the main character's actors or anyone else in the film. <br /> <br /> Football was interesting, even for someone like me who has no idea about the rules. The film is never boring. The romance is really sweet and it did not make me blush too much! The only thing that really did this was the Indian factor. Jess's parents are Indians and throughout the film there are many colorful Indian conventions, which gives a very interesting cultural insight as well as everything else. The Indians are also funny! Essentially, it is a film from the age of puberty about choosing the path you want and fighting for it. <br /> <br /> Feel good thanks to the comedy thanks to this movie. They are fun, refreshing and make you feel good! ^ _ ~
