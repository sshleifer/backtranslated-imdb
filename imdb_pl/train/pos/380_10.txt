Breaking away from escapist escapism in the early 1980s, Steven Spielberg directed Whoopi Goldberg in the adaptation of "The Color Purple" by Alice Walker, about the desperate existence of an African American in the 1930s. Watching Goldberg playing in Celie, it's amazing that he is the same woman who played in films such as the "Sister Act". It is a kind of film that could easily be - no, make it NO SHOULD be - part of the Black Women's Studies and Studies program. There is one scene that can be the most wonderful editing work ever on the screen (you'll know when you see it). I can not believe that it did not win even one Oscar; it could be Spielberg's second best film for the Schindler's List (maybe even related to it). Also starring Danny Glover, Adolph Caesar, Margaret Avery, Oprah Winfrey, Willard E. Pugh, Akosua Busia and Laurence Fishburne.
