The most amazing, uplifting movie about the restoration of the gospel. Much better than any other movie or movie about the restoration so far. If you have not seen him, jump on a plane to Salt Lake and see him now. You will not regret! You really understand what the first saints had to struggle with, putting total and complete faith in the prophet Joseph Smith. In the end, you see certain things that the prophet and persecution that he and his people struggled with had to fight. If you have any questions about the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and our humble beginnings, just watch this movie and then feel the total and total sense.
