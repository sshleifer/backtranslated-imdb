Ah, I loved this movie. I think that's all. I laughed loudly for a dozen times. Yes, I am a girl, so I write it from the girl's perspective. I think it's a pity that he scored only 5.2 in the ranking. Too many voters? It was well above other romantic comedies. Just because I'm a woman, I do not like all the elegant movies, on the contrary, I prefer other genres. Romantic comedies seem to be shallow and not as fun as they were meant to be. But as I said, this movie had it all, almost in my opinion. A great script, good one-layered, great acting. Although the figure of Eva Longoria Parker is very similar to Gabrielle from Desperate Housewives, but so what? It was amazing. I will stop this movie on rainy days, days when I feel low and need some laughter.
