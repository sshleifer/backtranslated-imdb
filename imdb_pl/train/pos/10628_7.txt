despite sporadic acting and the story "everything seen before," it is quite a fascinating movie. <br /> <br /> Has tension, scenes with a demon are really quite scary, some elements of the visual effects are great, and most importantly, there is no ridiculously misplaced humor that could distract attention from the movie, as it has too wiele (horror√≥w) <br /> <br /> to be honest, this is not the best movie in history, but in fact it draws you in and at least makes an attempt to develop a character <br /> <br /> I was glad that I watched
