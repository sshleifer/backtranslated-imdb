The best-selling book about honor killings in Jordan was withdrawn by publishers after accusing that history was fabricated; related to other allegations about the past of his author as a woman. A few years later, she reappears, admitting that she took a certain amount of a dramatic license, but she wanted to work with the creator of the film to prove the essence of her accusations. Below is a fascinating insight into a pathological personality, someone who behaves on one, does not make sense unless what he says is true, but who seems incapable of saying anything that is not surprisingly dramatic, but at best unproven and most often, verifiable fake. It is almost impossible to imagine what Mrs. Khouri hoped to gain, appearing in this film: debt collection? fame? - everything that she achieves is to project a certain self-image as a deeply damaged person, and even this can not be considered a nominal value. The director Anna Broinowski appears more and more often in the camera when her film develops and becomes more and more nervous about starting up; but in the end she is rewarded with an unusual, though frightening and disturbing story to tell - and one of those films that remind us how weird the world we live in.
