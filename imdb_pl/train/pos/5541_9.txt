Very cheap climate, showing great ingenuity in the use of props, sets and effects (fog, lighting, focus) to create an amazing and moody texture. The story is complicated, acting is only functional, but it shows how creative effects can develop the entire visual narrative. This movie is recommended because of mood and texture, not because of history.
