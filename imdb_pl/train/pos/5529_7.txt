The first time I saw this movie in the theater in France about a year ago. He came and went with a small pump, but I enjoyed the beauty of landscape photography and fascinating natural material. (History, though nice, is really accidental.) If you've actually thought about it, there's no way that most of what's happened could happen in real life.) I just saw it tonight, here, in the States, DVD. Again, I think it has very limited distribution. The hits only had one copy and I do not recall ever playing at the Cleveland art houses. <br /> <br /> The photo seen on my TV is not so breathtaking, although it is still very beautiful. The film material about wildlife is still fascinating. The story of the relationship between a ten-year-old child and a fox is even less convincing the second time you know where it's going. <br /> <br /> However, as I said, history is accidental. It's a beautiful movie to watch, and if you like photos of wild animals, you should find it fascinating.
