I began to lose faith in films that have recently been flooded with a typical Hollywood movie. The plot lines fail, and the work with the camera is simply copied from the last movie with a similar taste. But then I saw Zentropa (Europe) and my faith was renewed. The metaphorical plot is not only fascinating, but the use of colors and black and white is visually stimulating. Narrator (Max Von Sydow) guides you through a charming journey at every turn and absorbs you in Europe in 1945. We've all seen death shown on the screen in a hundred thousand ways, but the beauty of this movie is the way you get every slow moment that leads to death. Unlike many films, one does not cut out one second of showing (for example) a knife, but it forces you to watch the destructive but sensual beauty of the last moments of a man. I think we can all take something other than what this movie tries to say, but it's definitely worth spending some time to find out what all this really means. I would like to talk more about the film in detail for anyone who wants to send me an e-mail. Be happy!
