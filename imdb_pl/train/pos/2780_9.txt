Great movie - I loved it. Great editing and use of the soundtrack. It captures the real feeling of Indian life, but we can all appeal. Well chosen cast with some great characters. The film develops all the characters, so you really take care of them all and feel that you know them. The use of Indian music and drums in some football scenes is great, and the direction really works because everyone comes out as real and natural. You just can not stop Jess in this movie! Acting was really good, even the damned walk and body posture of both leading ladies is very convincing as a person who played football.
