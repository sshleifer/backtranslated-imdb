Upcoming movies from the era are now quite common. In 1980, "Lisa" really give it meaning. Jodie Foster plays his character straight. Ever since she did "Taxi Driver" four years earlier, she has a stronger character in this movie. She is a high school student, Jeanie, who has a lot of courage and seems to be getting out of every situation she is in. Scott Baio plays Brad in front of Chachi on Happy Days. He is considered immature by other girls. Cherie Currie is Annie, hangs in a bad crowd, chased by the father of a policeman. Jeanie and her three friends decide to live on the wild side until they move into the rented house, where the party is completely out of control. Getting to know life on the other side of the tracks can be fun or dangerous. Annie is rescued by Jeanie and Brad all the time he wastes. Reality returns hard when killed in a car accident. And one goes out too much an older man. Growing up is not easy, sometimes we need to discover life, how it is. In fact, you have to watch out for the people around you. For me, I was my person and I tend to stay that way! Great music, great story, this movie is a real gem! 4 out of 5 stars!
