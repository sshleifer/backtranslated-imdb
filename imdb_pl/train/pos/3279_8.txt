I am glad that it is now available on DVD. This movie is a perfect example of the triumph of content and style over flashing lights with empty heads and loud noises. <br /> <br /> Basically, if you have little or no wit and imagination to engage in a literary narrative, you will not like this movie. The reasons for this are quite simple, but unfortunately rarely achieved: Matthew Jacobs did a fantastic job, successfully transferring the story of Catherine Storr's novel "Marianne Dreams" to the screenplay. An unenviable task, because anyone who has seen the movie about the book will no doubt know. <br /> <br /> Casting is excellent, allowing director Bernard Rose to use actors in a way that is rarely seen today; they indulge in acting! I know, I know that actors doing their job and acting instead of resorting to a brazen attack on the camera lens, whistling a kaleidoscope of car chases, explosions and fights explode around them, it's really a rare feast, but really it's a movie. <br /> <br /> This brings me to the final reason that it is a film for an imaginative thinker, not a tabloid-readable spoon-fed person - in addition to a solid script, direction and acting, it is based on the atmosphere, uncertainty and alleged horror. If it is to be classified as a horror film, the "Paper House" presentation is more like Sophocles than Tobe Hooper. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, if you like a lot of loud noises, explosions, constant cuts and bright flashing colors, it would be better to watch "Transformers", but if you like a full tension story that develops through skillful and suggestive use of the narrative without insulting your intelligence by force feeding you with cacophony nonsense, it can simply be your thing.
