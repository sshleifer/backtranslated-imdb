Ray Liotta and Tom Hulce shine in this wonderful example of brotherly love and commitment. Hulce plays Dominick, (Nicky), a young man with a mild mental handicap who, by his medical school, 12 minutes younger brother, Liott, plays Eugene. He is imprisoned in Baltimore and concerns the issue of rivalry of siblings, inseparable bond of twins, child abuse and good always winning evil. It is captivating and full of laughter and tears. If you have not seen this movie yet, please borrow it, I promise you will be surprised by how such a wonderful movie could be noticed.
