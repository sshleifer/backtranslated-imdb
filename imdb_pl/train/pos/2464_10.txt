One of the best movie dramas I've ever seen. We work a lot in the church and this is the one that can be used as a resource that emphasizes all the good things that actors can do in their work. I highly recommend this one, especially for those who are interested in acting, like "must see". There are several scenes with comments. First, the cemetery scene in which Hamlet meets Yorick (everyone knows about this scene simply by going to elementary school), and his interaction with the skull was exceptionally well made. The logic used in this scene was huge - I suppose there is more to be a testament to Shakespeare. For a second I really enjoyed the scene in which Hamlet, Horatio and the character played by Robin Williams discussed the upcoming duel.
