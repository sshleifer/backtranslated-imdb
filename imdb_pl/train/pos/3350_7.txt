I do not remember seeing it before tonight, probably the title sounded so ordinary that it still passed me. But it is a well-crafted Western b, with an interesting, dark plot, complemented by an action changing from good to tricky. he remains for some time as a slayer of the city. As usual, good businessmen have mixed emotions - they want to get rid of the bad ones, but they like the interests they bring. It still applies: relax the laws on drinks and gambling and encourage the industry, but pretend that it regrets the disgusting effects it can have on ordinary people. What is fascinating in this film is the cynically intense portrait of Mitchum, which involves cleaning the city of villains and accepting the city's residents that his brutal methods were the only ones. Favorite piece: a sudden fall of two bad dogs in the Red Dog salon. Shooting from the main saloon bordered on nasty, but it was an effective way to combat the spread of poison. <br /> <br /> Generally a very good movie with its only mistake, which seems to be a small hokeyness - not so good for Do-Gooders who probably prefer negotiating with the evil instead of life.
