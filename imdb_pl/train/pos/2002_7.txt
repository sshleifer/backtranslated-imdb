To some extent, I really liked this movie better than the original VAMPIRE. I think that this movie is quite misogynist. As a woman and a horror fan, I got used to the fact that women in danger are the basis of the genre. But Sheryl Lee's cheek too much. In this movie Natasha Wagner is a more fully realized character, and the main bad guy is gal! Arly Jover (who played the midfielder at BLADE) is very unearthly and deadly. Jon Bon Jovi ... ok, yes, not a great actor, but he's fine. At least he does not start singing. Catch it on the cable if you can. It's at Encore Action this month.
