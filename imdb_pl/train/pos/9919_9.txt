This mesmerizing, breathtaking and frightening movie is "Apocalypse Now" without fiction. Slow pace, quiet in the mood, gives good flashes of poisoned stains on Earth, which may be signs of inevitable destruction. <br /> <br /> I have no doubt - nature is harassed and we are a disease. Greed, the very essence of humanity that drives evolution and progress, has transformed us into something like cancer, on the way to engulf the host and perish with him ... <br /> <br /> Manufactured landscapes are an unforgettable experience - at least never I will not treat my toaster and iron the same way.
