Greetings from the dark again. How rarely does a film examine the lost soul of sufferers. Adam Sandler performs in the role of Charlie, a man who lost his family in the tragedy of September 11 and has since lost his career, reason for living and probably his mental health. Don Cheadle interacts as Sandler's former roommate at the Dental School, which seems to have an ideal life (which Sandler apparently had before September 11). <br /> <br /> Of course, the similarities in the lives of these men are obvious, but it's really refreshing when I see human feelings in the movie ... feelings other than lust and revenge. Watching how they help one another by being there is painful and cordial. Writer / Director Mike Binder ("The Upside of Anger" and Sandler's accountant in this film) really bring a different look and style to the film. Some scenes do not work as well as others, but are generally well-written and well-targeted. <br /> <br /> Sandler and Cheadle are excellent. Sandler's character is somewhat reminiscent of his great performance in "Punch Drunk Love", but here he brings a lot more depth. Cheadle is always okay and does a good job of expressing the weight she wears ... just watching him work on the puzzle. <br /> <br /> Supportive work is excellent thanks to Jada Pinkett Smith (as Cheadle's wife), Liv Tyler (as a very patient psychiatrist), Saffron Burrows (in a strangely attractive role), Donald Sutherland as an irritated judge, and Melinda Dillon and Robert Klein as Sandler's in-laws. <br /> <br /> The film really touches on how the tragic events of that day touched one man so deeply that it is fundamentally ruined. In addition to the interesting story and some great photos from New York, you must love every movie with the vocals of Chriss Hynde, Bruce Springsteen and Roger Daltrey ... and Eddie Vedder impersonating Daltrey. Not exactly an optimistic movie, but it is a high quality film with an extraordinary story.
