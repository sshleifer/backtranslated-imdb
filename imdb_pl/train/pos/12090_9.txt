I saw this movie when I was 10 or 11, alone in my parents' basement on a Saturday night. He was shown in the Chiller Theater, a regular frightening function that I watched religiously as a young "no". Now I have seen many old horrors thanks to the Chiller Theater, but none of them has ever been stuck with me like "Danse Macabre", a.k.a "Castle of Blood". I am now 51 years old and it was only last year that I was lucky to locate a relatively new, high-quality DVD version of this wonderfully thrilling supernatural classic. I've watched it four times already and I do not think it bothered him. <br /> <br /> They just do not make movies like this. Haunted catacombs and fog cemeteries just do not work as well in color as in black and white during the day. Anyway, Edgar Allen Poe and Barbara Steele, the wonderfully dark, web-wrapped haunted castle sets, restless ghosts recreating their deaths ... this one is out there with Robert Wise's The Haunting, The Innocents (from Deborah Kerr) and newer "The Others".
