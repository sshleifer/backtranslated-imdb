This film is a great representation of the Nutcracker; the dance is great, the scenery in the background was perfect, and I LOVED THAT I WALKED BED. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the costumes ... Especially I loved Marzipan, the tutu was lovely. The special effects were very well made (eg Tree, bed, etc.), and I liked the rats very much. I love that they did not make them terrifying, but charming and cozy. I suppose that except the king. <br /> <br /> If you're a completely male person, you will not like it, but it's a very good movie that's good for all ages - not all levels of testosterone. <br /> <br /> But I have several complaints. <br /> <br /> First of all, why did they have to put their partner Sugar Plum Fairy in these terrible tights? It would not matter if he was naked! And secondly ... why did they have to make a PINK outfit at EARTH?
