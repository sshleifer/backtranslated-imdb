When Alan Rudolph's "Breakfast of Champions" slides down to theaters with little enthusiasm and mockery, I think back to 1996, when Keith Gordon's "Mother Night" appeared. Now, when Kurt Vonnegut's entire conversation is "impossible to realize", it is surprising that he received two great film treatments (the second is "Slaughter-house Five"). "Mother Night" is certainly one of the most underrated movies of the decade and I do not understand why. It's great! He remains almost entirely faithful to the book of Vonnegut (without being stiff or too literary) and adds purely cinematic poetry to it. How many film adaptations of any author's work can he claim? Vonnegut himself even appeared in the episode at the end of the film and can you ask for better support? It is not only a beautiful movie, but also a beautifully played, written and directed film, which belongs to my five best American films of the 90s. It is a pathetic, inspired, surrealistic masterpiece that does not deserve neglect. I would sincerely encourage everyone to see the "Mother of the Night" - he is not even familiar with the work of Vonnegut to fully appreciate it (as sometimes the "Five" does). It's a powerful piece that affects the cinema.
