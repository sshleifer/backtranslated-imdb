Seriously, can you imagine such talent in one movie without a huge budget: Daniel Day-Lewis, Ray McAnally, Brenda Fricker, Hugh O'Conor and Fiona Shaw? There is no doubt that Fricker and Day-Lewis deserved their awards: it would be perfectly reasonable, however, if O'Conor (as Young Christie) and McAnally were rewarded: the clich√© is true: they do not play roles, they live in them. The Day-Lewis performance is a tour de force - a transformation that evokes admiration, but it was a real sign of the Academy's intelligence, which alongside this performance also honored the beautifully restrained, still and painful work of Brenda Fricker as Christie's mother. Incidentally, if you have not seen this great actress in "Swann", this is another movie worth checking out for her contribution (and sublime Miranda Richardson).
