I just watched this movie on DVD and thought the game was very good, but the whole story left a lot to be desired. This movie has the same texture and appearance of Panic in Needle Park or Drugstore Cowboy. It's hard to believe that people can live in a lifestyle like this; on the abdomen of society in which their total existence is based on the most serious drug use, crime, violence, sex and total disrespect for anyone or anything, including themselves. <br /> <br /> Val Kilmore is outstanding in his role of "burnt" former porn star John Holmes. The supporting staff is equally good. However, it is a gloomy, dark movie, disturbing and depressing. The murder was brutal, but the everyday life of these people was brutal. If you are not interested in these murders or you were not a "fan" of John Holmes, it really is not a movie to watch. If you want to see a documentary drama about the murder, it's much better in 1960 in the cold blood of Truman Capote with Scott Wilson and Robert Blake.
