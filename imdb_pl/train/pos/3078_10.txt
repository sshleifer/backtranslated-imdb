I loved the program ... intelligent acting, a smart dialog, a great plot with real people ... please bring it back or share it online ... I really miss it ... Hope Davis really shines in this program. I like the idea of ​​SIX DEGREES ... It really makes sense in this crazy world. Get rid of these stupid reality shows and give this exhibition a second chance. Please bring it back. When I was in the air, I watched online and liked how I could watch it with minimal interruptions, in fact, ABC online makes it easier to watch programs, when you miss them in the best time ... the endless days have disappeared. Whenever you want to restore it, I'm ready.
