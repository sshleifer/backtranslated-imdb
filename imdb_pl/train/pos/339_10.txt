I read the book Schneebaum (the same title as this film) when it was first published and was deeply moved by its ability to see many ways of "otherness" (his and the Amazons people with whom he lived and loved) to a decent life. His subsequent books were not so powerful, but they showed his constant search. His description of sexual relations with men from the tribe overtook his time in the early 1960s, but his honesty and openness on the subject were welcome. This film beautifully conveys both eccentricity and generosity of man, but also allows to see the inevitable destruction of innocence (in this case it is not a morally positive term), which appears when "civilized" people interfere in traditional societies. Nevertheless, Schneebaum himself became a kind of higher innocence, which suggests the possibility of saving mankind from its own destructive nature.
