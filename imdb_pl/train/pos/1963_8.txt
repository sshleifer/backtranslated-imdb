All of our reviews begin with the following information. Over the past 15 years, I have seen with my wife nearly 100 films a year. We have recently been honored to receive lifetime film passes for any movie at any time and at no cost! So we can see what we want whenever we want. The point is that CRITICS counts on ZERO. Your local critics or national critics like Ebert are not really different from you or me. The only difference is that they write about the film and are forced to watch hundreds of movies, regardless of whether they want to or not. Therefore, we believe that if you get money worth two hours of pleasure that are good enough for us! We will NEVER listen to or read critics NEVER. We care only about our friends and those we know as much as we do. That's enough. <br /> <br /> This movie is very good. not only good, but very good. Critics are a group of morons. Only because they hated it nakedness and language. It was worth the ticket price and that's all you can ask for. Is not that right? Each film can not be nominated for the Academy Award. Sharon Stone is great and does a great job in the movie and that makes me mock what the critics want
