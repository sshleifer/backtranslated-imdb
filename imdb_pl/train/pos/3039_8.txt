Frank McCarthy, who produced the Oscar-winning biopic of Patton, pays homage to another American general, Douglas MacArthur. Gregory Peck gives a strong characterization of a man, his genius and his egoism. With MacArthur, you never knew where it began, and the second interrupted and mixed up too many times. <br /> <br /> The whole story of Douglas MacArthur is a six-hour movie or mini-TV series. It would cover him from his family's days spent in West Point, where he still has the highest scholastic average ever reached by a cadet. He would talk about his service in the Philippines as a young officer, his legend building courage on the battlefields of the First World War in France. He would also have to tell you that he was shooting at the World War I Bonus marching veterans in 1932. Probably putting the last cabosh on all odds that President Herbert Hoover had to be re-elected. MacArthur he and Hoover had penthouse apartments at Waldorf Astoria in New York during the last years. It must have been a topic they avoided. <br /> <br /> This movie focuses on the years 1941-1952 and is told in retrospection. The film begins MacArthur speaking to the student body in 1962. Speaking the words of the famous speech of Duty Honor Country, MacArthur returns to World War II and a desperate fight against the progressive Japanese on the island of Corregidor and the fields of Bataan on Luzon. The film takes him through his struggle to regain the Philippines, the occupation of Japan and the first 18 months, culminating in the easing of command by President Truman. <br /> <br /> MacArthur as a movie would not work at all if it were not for the creations of Dan O'Herlihy and Ed Flanders as presidents of Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman, respectively. This is part of the movie that I liked best, seeing MacArthur and his relationship with these two men. <br /> <br /> FDR O'Herlihy grabs an aristocratic squire and an exceptionally cunning man who was our 32th president. Roosevelt was a man who scored points with unusual subtlety and cunning. Sometimes he liked to plot a bit too much for his own good, but he was a master of politics in the last century. Note how he deals with MacArthur, both as a battlefield commander and as a potential rival at the same time. <br /> <br /> Truman from Flanders is just like people remember him, a dull man from people who did not like MacArthur's haughtiness from the gitgo. Of course, in historical books, Truman released MacArthur in 1951 for insubordination. MacArthur was insubordinate, there is no doubt about it. <br /> <br /> I could, however, write the whole thesis about Truman-MacArthur's relationship. On the way, there never was a crisis. I always thought that FDR would handle the whole thing in a much better way if he was still president. <br /> <br /> MacArthur was also very eloquent, and Gregory Peck captured some of this eloquence in some orations that made him as much a legend as victories on the battlefield. Listen to Peck in the Japanese surrender, to say goodbye to MacArthur with the nation before the joint session of Congress and, of course, his speech to the cadets in 1962. Watch the newsreels and see if you disagree.
