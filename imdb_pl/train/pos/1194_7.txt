The film focuses mainly on tormenting Robert Taylor as an absolute buffalo hunter and people who have to endure it. Set amidst the hunt for a declining number of buffalo, it depicts the end of a tragic era of senseless slaughter and is full of drama and remorse for both buffaloes and Native Americans. Taylor is blinded by his hatred of the Indians and his naivety that buffalo herds will never disappear. In one scene he shoots an animal after an animal, while in another he murders the Indians and then eats the food they cooked on the fire. Under this ruthless superficiality there is an insecure person who comes down to begging his companions (Stewart Granger, Lloyd Nolan and Russ Tamblyn) not to leave him. This is not the nicest movie and is overwhelmed by the drama it creates, which leads to a bleak and very accurate conclusion in the blizzard.
