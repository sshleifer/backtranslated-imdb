In this truly fascinating, dark film, a young impoverished student sells his soul to the devil for a lot of money, in return the devil takes his mirror image (it happens splendidly in the film and incredibly announced, when Balduin, the student is previously practicing fencing in front of the mirror), visual metaphor "A man struggling with himself" which represents his immediate future. The student enjoys his money, but the woman he loves is unattainable (he has made a pact with the devil, cuts him off forever from love and other riches), you can have love or you can exchange your soul for money, you can not have both. Balduin is haunted by his doublet (subtitles express it beautifully, like action.) Some scenes are amazing, a sense of doom when the Devil disappears with a mirror image of Balduin, it is amazing, like the feeling that his pact has cut him away from human forever of society (the scene in which he escapes from his room and ends up in the "wilderness" on the edge of the city, no longer completely human (lost his soul), is like a hunted animal outside human society. There are many other things to say about this amazing film. Paul Wegener was an amazing actor and director, my cultural hero, it helps if you know a little about the history of Germany during the creation of this film and the German look-alike tradition (do not search on Google, get the right book) Remember that it's a very early movie, sometimes it's a bit clumsy, but taking into account what he has to say and the tragic finale, this is one of the worst in history (yes, it is!)
