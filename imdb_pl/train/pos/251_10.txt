"If Ned Kelly was born later, he would probably win the Victoria Cross at Gallipolla." that was Ned's Bravery. <br /> <br /> In Australia, and especially in the country of Victoria, you can tell and immediately recognize the name Ned Kelly. In Greece, he is still a Hero, the life of the Blood of Jerilderie depends on the tourism he created, but in Mansfield he still did not forget that the three policemen he "murdered" were from there. <br /> <br /> Many buildings that he visited in his life are still standing. From Old Gaol in Melbourne, where he was hanged, to the post office he held at Jerilderie. In Benelli there is a cell in which he once was in Greta, and on the site of the Ann Jones hotel, the station, and even the logs where he was captured in Glenrowan, can be visited. <br /> <br /> Evidence of all the events in the film (with the exception of his love interests) can be found all over Victoria, in police files, and even in a sash, for which he received an award for saving Dick Shelton from drowning. None of this is bad, and what has been omitted will further justify Neds' actions. The horse he "stole" Ned was in fact stolen by Wild Wright (the man with whom Ned packed himself after leaving prison). Ned was already in jail when the horse was stolen so he could not steal it. <br /> <br /> The Jerilderie letter is more than before. It is not an excuse, but a biography of Ned, an outline of what he represented and who he protected. So read it, watch the video, and then decide what Ned represents.
