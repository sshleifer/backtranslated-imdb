Skippy from Family Ties goes from pure to metal kid in this pretty bad movie. The film seems to have arisen in response to all nervous parents who have claimed that metal music turns their children into evil or makes them kill - except that the dead evil metal star tries to get back from the grave (using Skippy help out). And although the plot is banal and banal, corniness (for example, a bad green fog taking off the girl's clothes) and the soundtrack make the movie so funny (and great). And of course, there is nothing like Ozzy Osbourne playing a preacher who asks what happened to the love song :). Definitely a movie for having a few friends for a good laugh. And when you're on it, it's a double feature in Slumber Party Massacre 2 - it's a "bad rocker" (as given in the video field) a drill killer in black leather with fringes. Must see for the bad movie fans.
