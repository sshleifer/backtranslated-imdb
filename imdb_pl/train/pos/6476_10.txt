Many posters commented on the unsatisfactory conclusion. It is always a problem with long, complex dramas. Crime is basically banal, so the repayment is always anti-climatic, while a detailed exhibition harms human drama. The writer used many clever devices to get around it, but it did not succeed completely. Answers to exactly what happened and why they could have been delivered, but if they are, they are well buried. The viewer inevitably feels a bit cheated. <br /> <br /> But in a sense, this is irrelevant. Drama has never been about crime or even investigation, it was the impact of events on the lives of those involved; family, investigators, witnesses, press. And it was like that. Writing was a significant cut over the factory in the prime-time drama, and uniformly good performances. In the band song you can not focus on people, but Penelope Wilton deserves special attention for a unique tour as a mother-wife-daughter, and Janet McTeer was in a cracked form as a hard bitten old clay. > <br /> One of the most interesting aspects of drama is dealing with race, like an elephant in a room that nobody is prepared for. Subtle, powerful things.
