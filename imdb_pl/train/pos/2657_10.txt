"Nothing". There is nothing in room 237. But you do not mind going in there anyway. So, hold on. Understand? Stay away. <br /> <br /> There has never been such a psychological feat of a horror movie that this film achieves. This is the highest rated horror of all and rightly so. Jack Nicholson is a great actor and this is one of the biggest performances in the cinema. <br /> <br /> It's about a family moving to a secluded and abandoned hotel for 5 months during the winter. Then father (Jack) becomes almost possessed by horrors in the hotel. <br /> <br /> Kubricks's direction is nothing but perfect. Strained tracking shots, tormenting music, mystical news and a perplexed plot make it the best horror movie ever made. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, he constantly refers to danger, death and horror. Red is used in EVERY scenario. Was red intentionally placed by Kubrick? Of course !. <br /> <br /> This is Kubrick's definitive classic and this is the third of his films that I gave 10/10. He is a perfectionist in his direction and can be seen in all his films. He loves to embarrass his observers in each of his films. <br /> <br /> I will be talking about this film for many months. It has infinite depth. <br /> <br /> In summary, this is the cornerstone of horror and tension. A masterpiece of terror 10/10
