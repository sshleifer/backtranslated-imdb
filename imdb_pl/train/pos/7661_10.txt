Scanners II: The new order is just as good as David Cronenberg's classic scanners, the scanners were produced in 1980, and the Scanners II in 1991, so there's an eleven-year gap between the two films. The film captures the style of scanners, which is a good thing, there would be no scanners without a head explosion, so Scanners II has a head explosion scene that is just gruesome as the first. Scanners II: The New Order has several other fancy scenes with bloody scenes that are well made. The Scanners II story: The New Order is a new approach to the series, because it uses scanners as vigilant forces for the police chief and a group of scientists, until the young scanner David Kellum finds out that he is used and decides to get revenge. <br /> <br /> Scanners II: The New Order is a great continuation of David Cronenberg's classic science-fiction scanners and should be visible. Check it out. 10/10
