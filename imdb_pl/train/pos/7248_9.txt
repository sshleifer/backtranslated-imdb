When I saw the Destruction of 3000 for the first time, I did not have any expectations about this film. Although it was not as bad as it was thought. This is a kind of Italian version of Roadwarrior, with a cast that is almost known in Italy, including Venantino Venantini. Behind the story is Elisa Briganti and Dardano Sacchetti, who are also responsible for the story of the Zombie body eaters. You can also see other links to Italian horror movies: Luca Venantini plays the role of Tommy, and you can see this kid in Paura nella citta dei morti viventi (AKA Gates of hell) as John Robbins and in the cannibal apocalypse as the role of Brother Mary . Pretty funny movie with boring parts.
