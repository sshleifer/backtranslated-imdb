The reception of Samuel Fuller on South Street is unusual: the film "Red Scare" is devoid of hysteria, in which the communist threat is nothing but McGuffin, who ignites the conspiracy. Pickpocket Richard Widmark relieves the loose woman Jean Peters from her wallet with a microfilm strap; none of them knows that they contain secrets important for the Cold War. Peters, as it happens, was under the supervision of FBI agents who are just as worried about theft as the man who runs it, the cowardly companion Richard Kiley. Trying to recover a valuable film, both sides use the help of Thelma Ritter, an old-fashioned old woman who is always on the ear and wants to sell what she hears. <br /> <br /> Fuller draws from a rich palette of tempos and tonality in the story's story, which becomes a race with the time of increasing brutality. From the subway to the wharf, his Solstice in Manhattan takes on a sweaty gloss that is almost spicy. Peters and Widmark's love scenes become an unstable mix of turbulent and tender tender, and their recording is "Again", a song introduced by Ida Lupino in Road House, starring Widmark. The pace fades in the beautifully written and played scene of Ritter's death - among the most moving vignettes in all noiras and a kind of a mirage oasis in the film of parched sentimentality. It is a fuller / director who works only in the strictest field of the noir cycle; his subsequent search for American pathology (The Crimson Kimono, The Naked Kiss, Underworld U.S.A.) never resulted in a synthesis as rewarding as Pickup on South Street.
