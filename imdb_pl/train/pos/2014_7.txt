Mel Torme and Victor Borge, in their younger years, are used to make this movie interesting - especially watching the young Sinatra after a 30-year sunny side, and definitely telling him that it's "yes, I'm a popular singer, but it's not still an actor. " Michele Morgan is an annoying, unclean presence, and Jack Haley is an actor whose attractiveness has always been completely lost to me. Leon Erroll is stupid as usual, but generally quite funny. 7 stars with a potential of 10 are of the right "class", because with a combination of its positive aspects, along with the lack of a large part of the story, and stupid of this, and the previously mentioned nervousness - this is generally at best average. Most of the fascinations result from watching three icons of entertainment in the early years.
