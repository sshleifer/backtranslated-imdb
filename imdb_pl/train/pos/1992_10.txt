I'm really getting old, I'm watching this 40-year-old movie and I'm wondering what my grandchildren will be watching in 40 years, it's an old saying, but they do not do it anymore ... it's not just history, its music, acting of both young people, as well as the old casts, it seemed, she was born to play her roles, young oliver, old Fagin ... too much to mention them all, the role of judge oliver stands before, I saw in other roles over the years ... ingenious smart-winger, "Ron moody like Fagin," you and the lady are snapping, the movie not only won 5 Oscars, but I also took a few golden awards of the globe .. if you decide to see this movie .. do yourself a favor, take some if not all children, to see this masterpiece
