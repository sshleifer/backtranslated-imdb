I just watched this movie at the 2001 Toronto International Film Festival. The working title was "Dog days". The audience's reaction was mixed. Some people thought that graphic sex and realistic violence were too big for them. Others seemed to really appreciate how good this film is. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for people with weak hearts. It's like "Happiness" with pronounced sex and a less optimistic view of humanity. It is animal poisoning, being repulsed by an elderly citizen, bathing in an orgy in a shopping center, penetrating an anal candle and mentally incompetent molesting. <br /> <br /> If it sounds too much to cope with it, this movie is not for you. This film shows humanity in the most desperate and pathetic style. The banality of our existence is pushed to our face with the greatest joy. <br /> <br /> Seidl is not interested in the redemption of mankind here. And why should he? This film is characterized by the excellent achievements of all involved, is always interesting and is probably the most intelligent social statement that will be made in the movie in a while.
