In the spirit of the classic "The Sting" this movie hits where it really hurts ... in the heart! A primitive, proper psychiatrist, thirsty for adventure, meets with the dirtiest and worst of the scoundrels. An unprotected doctor falls in love with a badman career and begs for participation in his operation. While the movie moves in a "slow" fashion, its culmination and ending are stunning! You will especially like the doctor "forgive yourself"!
