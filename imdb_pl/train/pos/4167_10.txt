The Devil Dog: Hound of Hell is a really good movie. He has a good acting act, including Richard Crenna and R.G. Armstrong. The music is terrible and gives this devilish chill! I liked the effects on the dog and I think that the creature itself looked really nice with horns, a frill on the neck and it behaved really sticky! If you like horror movies and have not seen The Devil Dog before: Hound of Hell and we are able to find and buy this rare movie because it's a good movie and I do not think you'll be disappointed!
