** Uwaga Spoilery ** <br /> <br /> First of all, let me say that Rob Roy is one of the best films of the 90s. It was an amazing achievement for everyone involved, especially actors Liam Neeson, Jessica Lange, John Hurt, Brian Cox and Tim Roth. Michael Canton Jones has painted a great portrait of honor and shame that people can represent. But unfortunately ... <br /> <br /> constantly and wrongly compares to "Braveheart". These are two completely different films, probably similar only in that they both refer to Scots in historic Scotland. However, this comparison often worries me because it seems that it is almost assumed that "Braveheart" is a better movie than "Rob Roy". I really like "Braveheart", but the idea of ​​comparing it to "Rob Roy" is a bit offensive to me. Simply put, I love "Braveheart", but it's a pale shadow, how much I love "Rob Roy". Here are my special reasons ... <br /> <br /> - "Rob Roy" is about real people. <br /> <br /> Let's face it, William Wallace in "Braveheart" is not a real person. He is a legend, a martyr, a figurehead greater than life. Because of this shot, he is also an ideal person, never doing the wrong thing, and basically showing his Scottish people the promised land. When he finally fails, it's not his fault. Like Jesus, he is betrayed by the people he most trusted. He goes through even the worst kind of torture because he wants freedom so much. <br /> <br /> Wallace's performance is very well made and effective. But it really does not inspire me or intrigue me. I believe that human ambiguity is much more visible than human perfection. That's why "The Last Temptation of Christ" is a better movie than "King of Kings" and this is also one of the reasons why I think "Rob Roy" is better than "Braveheart". Rob Roy can be heroic and brave, but he is far from perfect. He makes a few mistakes that have affected the lives of many of his relatives. Certainly not a false claim against the prince of Argyll was an act of nobility and courage, but also an act of selfishness and self-centeredness. Let us not forget that the countrymen he claimed to have protected were brought to homelessness at the end of the film because of this act. But Rob did everything he could, and that was all you could ask for. <br /> <br /> Rob Mary's wife is also a normal, ambitious person. But let's start with what it looks like in this movie. Sure, she's beautiful, but she does not wear make-up, and she basically lets her show her natural beauty. Compare this with two loves (or one, depending on the point of view) of William Wallace in "Braveheart". Now these two ladies are hot, but they do not indicate how women looked at that time (especially lay people). Maybe this is not a fair comparison, but just another example of how accuracy accuracy is much more effective. <br /> <br /> In the whole "Rob Roy" Mary must live with her cruel rape through the wicked carrion, Cunningham. She feels compelled to tell Rob about her fight, but not because she knows Rob has to seek revenge for her rape. Such a revenge would certainly mean Rob's death, and Mary is not prepared for such sacrifice. <br /> <br /> The villains in Rob Roy are equally attractive. Although the enemies in "Braveheart" are well-written, they are not original. Robert the Bruce, a courageous and cowardly man, is harassed by moral decisions that are known in the fictional kingdom. Should he claim to be the King of Scotland, or should he betray Wallace to ensure the safety of his name? Bruce is the most ambitious character in "Braveheart", but from Brutus in "Julius Ceasar" to Fredo in "The Godfather Part II", these characters are not very original. Longshanks, although in itself irresistible villain, is very one-dimensional. It is an epidemic of evil, and his ways of tyranny are in direct contradiction to Wallace's heroism. <br /> <br /> "Rob Roy" has three villains who are wonderful in their shouts. First of all, let's start with the Marquis of Montrose. He is a man who is so obsessed with his self-image that he wants to let an innocent man suffer because of it. "Make sure he does not make fun of me" is his favorite word for "factor." He is an obsessive power man, upset that a man of a great noble ruler as prince of Argyll can be considered a greater providence than he. He is disgracefully obsessive and insecure. He is a bad aristocrat, but in a way that makes him unique. <br /> <br /> Cunningham and Callarn are conspirators in "Rob Roy" and they are also direct attackers of Roy. Callarn is so cunning in his cowardice that he is almost comical. He will do everything to keep the marquis's good will, which includes stabbing in the back and cheating. Cunningham is a convincing figure because he seems to have been brought up to do everything in his power to get Marquis status and affection. I need a father, she does not know much that the Marquis is his real father. Therefore, when the opportunity to acquire wealth comes from Callarn, he captures it without even questioning it. It is very similar to the evil of modern man, so focused on himself and in vain that he does not care about the consequences of his actions on others. <br /> <br /> Many have criticized Tim Roth's performance in the film for abusing it. Hogwash, I say. It is clear that Cunningham is not simply angry, but also a psychopath throughout the film. In a world where a man and his stepson are able to shoot random people for entertainment, is Cunningham unbelievable? We live in a society in which people seem to diminish the value of human life. "Rob Roy" simply teaches us that only the circumstances of this reduced value have changed. The problem with all human history is that the vanity of the human heart does not allow for compassion. Rob Roy and Mary give us hope that goodness will win, but snakes will always exist in our world. <br /> <br /> Another character that fascinates me is Prince Argyll. He is a true nobleman, and his values ​​of honesty and courtesy contrast directly with the awning. He appreciates the courage of Rob Roy and Maria and has a direct concern for the Marquis and its factor. Give the world hope for people of power. I hope that people like Marquis are an exception, not a rule. <br /> <br /> - The last duel in "Rob Roy" is more exciting than the 10 battle scenes in "Braveheart". <br /> <br /> One thing that torments me is that people tell me that "Braveheart" is a better movie because of battle scenes. First of all, the battle scenes are not very original. From "Spartacus" to "Gladiator", Hollywood has a long tradition of historical European battle scenes. "Braveheart" has some of the best battle scenes ever made on film, but they have one important problem. These battle scenes have no context except for the fight for freedom. <br /> <br /> Now, do not get me wrong, the duels are not original either. In fact, there are probably 10 times more movies in duels than in battle scenes. But the context of Cunningham's duel with Rob Roy is a beauty to see. This is one of the biggest scenes in film history. Let me explain why ... <br /> <br /> First of all, the style of fighting and wearing two characters in this duel perfectly describe the characters. Cunningham is insolent and dangerous, Rob Roy is strong and brave. Cunningham uses the fencing sword while Rob uses the sword. Cunningham fights with quick, difficult moves, and Roy's battle style is more obvious. <br /> <br /> The whole movie, from the deliberately slow first half to the exciting second half, leads to this moment. It is a powerful thing and it is clear that Rob must exterminate the dangerous evil that has plagued his entire world. When Rob finally gets the lead (literally and figuratively), this is one of the biggest moments in film history. Rob wins because he has more to survive, and his honor is more powerful than 10 Cunningham. The use of music is absolutely cooling in this scene. Good control over real evil is stronger for me than seeing how a dude gets eviscerated to be able to shout "FREEDOM!". But hey, maybe it's just me. <br /> <br /> - "Rob Roy" is more realistic than "Braveheart" <br /> <br /> I do not know if people from aristocracy or Scots talked like people from "Rob Roy", but I feel that it is clearly an attempt to capture their speech patterns. I feel that "Rob Roy" bores many people because they can not understand what the characters say. If it is, read some Shakesphere or add subtitles. "Rob Roy" is actually one of the largest films written in the 90s. Many of the dialogues in this movie are clever, but you may have to watch the movie several times to understand it. <br /> <br /> However, the dialogue in "Braveheart" is not very interesting. Of course, what do you expect when the main character is a Scotsman played by an Australian? This is a legend and apparently no attempt was made to capture the speech of the times. This movie takes place a few centuries before "Rob Roy" and yet they speak like people today. Therefore, the reason why many people like it. Recipients are becoming more and more lazy and do not want to spend time or patience to understand complicated things. Therefore, as with many epic films, they expect villagers to be a recognizable English accent, while the characters will speak their mother tongue not too far from our American language. Sure, it's clear that Wallace is a Scot, but other than that he sounds like Scotty from Star Trek and a pair of "Aye" for confirmation, the Scots in this movie fit the Hollywood tradition of how we think the Scots should sound. br /> <br /> So these descriptions prove that "Rob Roy" is a better movie than "Braveheart"? Hardly. But if he proves this one, it shows that it is not widely known that "Braveheart" is a better movie than "Rob Roy". Put simply, "Rob Roy" is a film that has very modern themes. "Braveheart" is a film about a legend that is inspiring, but not realistic. You can decide what you think is better ... <br /> <br /> Grade - A Score - 9
