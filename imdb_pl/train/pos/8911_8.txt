I've seen The Blob a few times and it's one of the best low-budget movies about alien invasion from the 1950s. <br /> <br /> A strange meteor lands right behind a small town, and an older man goes to investigate. A strange gelatinous substance attaches to one of his arms, and the young couple who saw the land of meteors arrived on time and took him to the local doctor, where the old man is completely absorbed by the mass. The doctor and his nurse are the next victims, and the mass is getting bigger. When these incidents are reported to the police, they do not believe in young marriages and accuse them of all this. In the end, they believe them, when the mass, now huge, appears in the city cinema and everyone runs to the streets shouting. Then he attaches himself to the dining room with a young couple and a few others in the middle. The droplet is stopped by spraying a load of fire extinguishers on it and freezing, which is its weakness. Then it is transported by plane to frozen Arctic wastes and removed there. But it's just frozen, not dead ... <br /> <br /> This movie has a typical setting for this period: teens and a small town. Blob has a good rock and roll song at the beginning and the film is moody all the time. <br /> <br /> Continuation, watch out! The Blob appeared in 1972, and the remake came in 1988, but it is the best movie The Blob. <br /> <br /> The cast is led by Steve McQueen (The Great Escape) and it is a movie that made him a star and Aneta Corsaut plays his girlfriend. I do not know any other stars. <br /> <br /> Blob is a must for all science fiction fans. Fantastic. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4 stars out of 5.
