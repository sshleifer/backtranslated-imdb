I really liked this movie. History jumps back and forth and is not easy to follow. History has no solution, and you are wondering what really happened. Because I like this movie, I liked it. I especially like the fact that the "dating" scenes between boys and myself have been drawn into their lives. And of course, every Staphane Rideau movie will get a few extra points. ;-)
