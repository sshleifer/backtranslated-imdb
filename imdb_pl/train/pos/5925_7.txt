Due to all the negative reviews of this film, I hardly saw it. However, I was pleasantly surprised that it was quite a pleasant horror. Acting was not great - apart from the great Alice Krige - but some dialogues ("Just beware of lunch") were quite fun. <br /> <br /> In total, the above-average effort of Stephen King 7/10.
