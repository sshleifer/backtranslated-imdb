As a child, I loved computer animation, although it was VERY limited, and the tools were almost non-existent. This movie, when I sat in awe and watched amazing images and almost hypnotic music, shaped my desire to create moving things in my computer. It is an agreement covering the whole package, between music and video, which really has one blow. If you know a child who wants to get involved in computer animation, it MUST BE. <br /> <br /> Still, almost 20 years later, I rate this movie as one of my three favorites. Originality, I think, is still unmatched by most of today's McMovies that Hollywood spits out. At the moment I want to check if I can do it myself; if the imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, this movie deserves TON imitation =)
