After reading only two comments here, as a longtime Bronte fan, starting with Heathcliff Olivier and continuing with many versions of "Rochester" Charlotte, more than opening eyes is to see that sister UN.com Bronte has given a lie to the masculine-chauvinistic period in which the trio lived. Of course, the "miracle" in all three versions of the nineteenth-century British household is that "girls" were "spinsters", and their only real brushes with "men" were their vicar father and their wastrel? brother. That said, it is ANNE Bronte, who in her single test proved a "feminist" point, far ahead of modern types, including the franchise voting series. But history shows more than a few who preceded it, including Greek heterai and Sappho, and such as the ancient Emperor Yang Kuei-fei. And what about "Eve" and her apple?
