This stupid movie is really funny for a younger audience. Her heroes are two bagpipe detectives, whose sophisticated attitudes lead them to some stupid ways. Pursuing the case of a big murder, you'll see that detectives are approaching everything to solve a crime. No nudity, but a lot of sexual implications, stupidity ... everything young people go to. Low budget, but very funny. Specified the cult classic potential.
