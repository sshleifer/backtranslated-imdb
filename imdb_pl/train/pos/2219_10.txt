This film was a fascinating look at the Creole culture and society that only a few African Americans know. My two children are the products of my grandmother on the father's side, whose father was a member of the gens de couleur libre and a black woman whose parents were ex-slaves. He married outside of his culture and against her and was cut off from the whole family, except for one sister who took pity on the fate of her brothers; raising 8 children during the great depression in 1929; providing the family with food whenever they could. Of course, she secretly helped this family, fearing for their own communication. My daughter was fascinated by the movie. We made it part of our library.
