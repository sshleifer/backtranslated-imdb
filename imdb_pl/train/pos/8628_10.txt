"Der Todesking" - the second full-length feature film by Jork Buttgereit (the first of which was known as "Necromantic") has no central character or heroes, but a thematic continuity in the act of suicide. a series of fragments, each of which contains the self-destruction of a complete stranger. Yes, production values ​​are low and disturbing, but in many respects 'Der Todesking' is extremely effective. more important than pure entertainment. Unlike other Buttgereit works, this is not very bloody, but there are also unpleasant pictures, such as the castration scene on Tuesday, decomposing corpses and various acts of suicide. and full of pain! - simply amazing, if you want my opinion. 10 out of 10 - check out this postmodernist shock! Disturbing art in the purest form!
