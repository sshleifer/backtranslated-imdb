Edmund Burke said that "all bad needs are good for me to do nothing." Hollywood often gives us junk because there are not enough families to watch high-quality movies. This film was a uplifting story of losing and restoring faith. He was not violent, he was not lewd and he did not deserve the assessment of PG. The western landscapes were well filmed and some of the views were breathtaking. The actors were a bit young for their parts, but otherwise they were credible and talented. The musical result was too loud, and in some places it completely drowned out dialogue. I am rarely surprised by the endings of films, but I was surprised. Sometimes the good ones win and win thanks to honest efforts. We liked the movie and the message, and recommend it to the whole family.
