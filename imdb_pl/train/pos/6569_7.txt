"Jake Speed" is a great movie with great news. It has its drawbacks, of course. Sometimes it is a bit slow. He introduces his villain too far into the story. His action takes place at the speed of the snail's heartbeat. He has a cast of class Z (although I have always admired the work of Karen Kopins, who has a good look at Sandra Bullock). <br /> <br /> But with all this goes "Jake Speed" really inspires, thanks to the charming script of Wayne Crawford (who plays the title role) and Andrew Lane. <br /> <br /> Why do I think it's inspiring? Because he tells me, "Hey, why do not you try to be a good man." <br /> <br /> The story is basically a "stranger in a strange land" premise that is good and heroic. placed in a real world where bad things happen to good people. Jake is more than a scout. He is more than a knight in shining armor. Jake Speed ​​is the patron of optimism in a dirty, vile and evil world. <br /> <br /> Because of this, "Jake Speed" really had to be a hit. He has great news, which should have been to Hollywood, and then to the rest of the world. <br /> <br /> Imagine a film industry that really pushed to present good and decent people. I'm not saying we should watch the Waltons at every Cineplex theater, but it would be nice if more movies like "Jake Speed" had a chance. ("Due South", a TV show about the Canadian Mount, is a good comparison of what you can do to brighten up American entertainment.) <br /> <br /> Sure, "Jake Speed" has violence, blood and weapons, but the general the message is that if you try hard enough to be a good person, you will overcome the forces of evil each time. 10/14/99
