By entering this movie, I heard good things about him. Coming from this, I was not really surprised or disappointed. Simon Pegg is a childish character, just like his other films. There were a few laughs here and there - no wonder. Probably my favorite parts of the movie are dancing on the club scene. I have to try it the next time I'm in the club. A few stars here and there, including: Megan Fox, Kirsten Dunst, this chick from X-Files and Jeff Bridges. I find it funny when I saw the appearance of Thandie Newton on stage. It is of course in the previous film with Simon Peggy, Run Fatboy Run. I see it as a toss, or you like it to some extent or you find it a bit boring. I will add that Kirsten Dunst is adorable in this movie. : 3
