I saw it in the Cinema MK2 Haute-Blance just one night after the first public screening in Paris. A very nice film about three 15-year-old teenagers, all in the same psychological stage. Many scenes allow us to return to adolescence and our first feelings about sexual relations. one can imagine that the director would like to reduce the first strong sensual feelings of girls to lesbianism, but even in this case, he does not spoil the probability of the story. Sometimes the movie may be a bit slow, but it creates this intimate atmosphere. I finance young talent actresses, especially with Floriane and Marie, very convincing. There are many small details, but this movie also allowed me to discover what synchronized swimming is: impressive!
