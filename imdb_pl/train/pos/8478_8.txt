I saw this movie as a child and broke my heart! No other story has such an unfinished ending ... I grew up on many great anime movies and it was one of my favorites because it was so unusual - a tale of injustice, cruelty and loneliness, life and choices that can not be undone and the need for others . Chirin stays alone when the Wolf kills his mother, but the Wolf is also alone when Chirin follows him up. The wolf does not kill the lamb, although every night he says "maybe he will eat you tomorrow". The tape I have is broken and damaged with age and use. I will fix it and one day I will watch the film again and I will cry as much as I do as a child. Stories like this, with this depth and feeling and this complexity of meaning, are very rare. It's a sad story, but I've never met with any more beautiful catharsis. I am glad that I saw this movie and I am happy that I saw him as a child.
