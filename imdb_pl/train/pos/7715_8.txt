First of all, watch out that this movie is almost fifty years old! However, it is still one of the best films of all time. I wonder how much of today's production of disposable celluloid will still be discussed in 2050? <br /> <br /> The story is simple but solid enough and the effects are phenomenal for the day. I can still remember when I first observed it as a child, when the monster enters the force field protecting the ship and you must see its outline for the first time (and only). If I trembled with fear, I can tell you. It looks like today, but it is still effective enough. <br /> <br /> The scenes with the tiger show their age now. You can see the outline in which the tiger was blended into the Altaira arrows, but they are only visible. <br /> <br /> Similarly, the effect by which creation melts through Krell's door is wonderfully made. br /> <br /> It is also amazing to see Leslie Nielsen (better remembered in the movies from the plane and the naked pistol) as a young but still mature man. He was 30 years old when this movie came out! Almost 80 now! <br /> <br /> All in all a good movie that will definitely be a favorite for many years. Timeless.
