A brilliant chess player takes part in the tournament and falls in love with the woman he meets there. In itself it would be a pretty bad story. So there is more. The fact is that the chess player is also completely alienated from the world because of his brilliance in the game and the fact that the player is persecuting history. <br /> <br /> This film is coming back from the romantic frivolity of the tournament tension to the historical events that shaped the chess player and works quite well. It's easy to get attached to the two main heroes and it's easy to believe that they can get together like in this movie. The additional tournament effect is also very good and creates a nice voltage setting. <br /> <br /> I have no idea about the strength of chess players because I do not play this game myself, but it looks nice and credible. In total, most of the movie goes very easily. It is also easily forgotten. It's nice to watch, but nothing more. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 chess players caught between the tower and the hard place
