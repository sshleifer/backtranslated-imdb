I have no doubt that Victor McLaglen won an Academy Award for Best Actor for this film thanks to the three-way division between Mutiny at the head of Bounty Clark Gable, Charles Laughton and Franchot Tone who were in the same race. But The Informer is still a great movie because John Ford would not win his first best director Oscar if he was not. No division into his prize. <br /> <br /> The film and story of Liam O'Flaherty, on which he is based, is associated with the poor simpleton of a man named Gypo Nolan, who was once a member of the Irish Republican Army. He was paid out of cash for some stupid feat he pulled out and wants back. It's up to the last penny and if he can not come back, he wants enough to go to America. The information leading to the arrest of a former comrade named Frankie McPhillip, played by Wallace Ford, is a twenty-pound prize. In a moment of weakness he goes to the Black and Tan policy and informs about McPhillip. <br /> <br /> IRA really wants to find out who issued McPhillip and they're pretty sure it's McLaglen. There is nothing to hide your own songs. He makes a little effort to get another man, Peter Mulligan, played by Donald Meek. He also exits the J.M. hanger. Kerrigan. <br /> <br /> The whole of The Informer takes place in 1922 in Dublin from around six in the evening to the early morning of the next day. It is necessarily filmed in the dark and shadows, which makes it probably the first thriller of noir. Had it been done after the Second World War, Informer would fall into the noir classics, such as Odd Man Out or The Third Man, which are very similar. <br /> <br /> John Ford knew the world very well. He took some time off during the Rebellion and was then in Ireland and had a brother who was in the IRA. His real name, before he was angled, was Sean O'Fiernan. <br /> <br /> Preston Foster plays the commander of the IRA Dan Gallagher. In the book Gallagher is a harder and more deceitful man than Foster has him here. My guess is that John Ford wanted him to be a nice hero to interest fans of the movie. He makes it clear that Foster must eliminate the informer, because the Blacks and Tans will catch him and get him out a little more and put the organization at risk. <br /> <br /> The IRA Trial Scene is a movie attraction. When Foster asks Donald Meek if he recognizes the authority of his court, Meek can not say "no". Justice and the king's order do not work here. This graphically illustrates at this point, despite the occupation by the army and policemen, the British really lose control over society. <br /> <br /> Of course, Informer is a pretty grim story that John Ford is touching, but rather less than one would expect. Even when McLaglen spends his money on drunken madness, the IRA is still in the shade, watching him and counting every shit. <br /> <br /> Informer is a story well told about Ireland in a grim and gloomy time.
