Once again, Jet Li introduces his charismatic presence to the film screen in the Black Mask. In this movie, Li plays Tsui, a refugee from the program of a super soldier, who tries to regain mankind, which the program has taken away from him. To do this, Tsui decides to become a librarian in order to live a normal and peaceful life, but fate requires him to cleanse the problems of his past before he can continue to seek peace. Other members of the super soldier program fled at the same time as Tsui, but want to match the world instead of finding inner peace. So Tsui becomes the only thing that can prevent his ex-teammates from releasing information that could cost the lives of many innocent people. This movie screams on the screen at a frantic pace and never lets the audience go. Martial arts are amazing, but because they use wires, they can not be appreciated as much as the American public deserves. If you like action movies that have an interesting story and require good acting performances because they involve both psychological and physical conflicts, then the Black Mask is for you. I'm glad that some of Jet Li's films are finally being published in the main stream in the US and I'm waiting for the changes that will require this release (such as dubbing and soundtrack) to affect the movie. This is one of the best Li movies, go out and see it on May 14, when it will be released in America.
