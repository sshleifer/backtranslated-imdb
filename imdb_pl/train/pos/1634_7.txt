I first caught the movie for the first time on HBO in (probably) 1981 and at 15, I thought the movie was fun. I remember that I have NOT seen the performances of Alfred E. Neuman shown in theatrical trailers. When MAD Magazine satirized the film and suddenly stopped in mid-apology from the "ordinary gang" for having dropped to satire so stupid, I just assumed that they were playing in themselves, which I am sure they were serious to find ( and Ron Liebman) so ashamed to remove their names from any loans, I was quite surprised. There are certainly many inferior movies to be associated with. Watching the video on video now (at the age of 32) with the restored references from MAD, I still have the opportunity. And being a fan of Ron Liebman (Hot Rock, Where is Poppa?) I think it's his crown jewel of performances (SAY IT AGAAAAIN)
