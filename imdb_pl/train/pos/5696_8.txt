What are you doing with a 14-inch porn star that was involved in drugs and murders and then died of AIDS? Of course, you're making a movie. Probably the reason he was not done earlier is that Eddie Nash would be on the road to his production. So it is not a coincidence that the film was made shortly after Nash was sent to prison. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the movie is its fast pace. There is no time for unnecessary nonsense. And why would it be? There is too much good material here to demand boring filler scenes. The cast is good. Kilmer was mediocre in a series of films, so in the end it was a quite suitable role for him. Bosworth is cute, so it does not matter how she behaves (she's solid), and McDermott, who's quite annoying, is pretty good, largely because he has so much facial hair that I did not recognize him at first. (It's a pity they did not do Cruise in every movie, so I would not have to watch his stupid face.) I totally failed to recognize Christina Applegate, and I would not know she was there if I did not see her name in the end credits . Kudrow is charming as always, a bit unusual to see her in a dramatic role. (Btw, "Friends" is the worst television series of all time.) The only questionable choices are the early episodic creation of Carrie Fischer and the totally absurd incorporation of the moron of the 90s Janeane Garofalo. You thought I would join Paris Hilton too, right? No, I think Hilton is the perfect choice in her 10-second appearance as a stupid whore. Because the film concerns, among other things, decadence? and about a porn actor? fits perfectly.
