The film is a true show of how impersonal and selfish has become a higher society. He has a lot of characters and each character represents a different category of people. No character is 100% good and moral as opposed to the heroes of all typical Indian movies and no character is 100% evil, and all are just different. The film is a perfect combination of emotions, drama and entertainment. For the first time I liked the film that caused some social questions. I recommend everyone to see the movie. Madhavi Sharma is a journalist who includes these hip-hop Bollywood events on page 3 of the newspaper, but this is a story about how he becomes a crime reporter for the newspaper. But that's not all, it shows how she could not survive there, and when she helped save the innocent children, how brutally her voice is suppressed. Even she is fired from work. Then she could not find a job as a crime reporter and must do it again. Not only she, but also a very large number of characters are woven into a movie and all give different feelings when watching a movie. I really congratulate the director on making such a great film. Please do not let her miss her.
