This is probably a very good "continuation", better than the first live action movie of 101 Dalmatians. He has good dogs, good actors, good jokes and good slapstick! <br /> <br /> Cruella DeVil, who had quite a lot of therapy, is now a dog lover and very friendly to them. Many, including Chloe Simon, the owner of one of the dogs that Cruella once tried to kill, does not believe it. Others, like Kevin Shepherd (the owner of a second-chance shelter) believe that it has changed. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Dipstick and his friend gave birth to three sweet Dalmatian puppies! Little Dipper, Domino and Oddball ... <br /> <br /> Starring Eric Idle as Waddlesworth (funny ara), Glenn Close as Cruella and Gerard Depardieu as Le Pelt (another baddie, name should point), this is good family movie with excitement and much more !! One of the falls of this movie is that it has many painful slapstick√≥w, but it is not as excessive as the last movie. It is also more fun than in the last movie. <br /> <br /> Enjoy "102 Dalmatians"! :-)
