I really liked this movie. Acting adult actors was great, although the main kid was a bit stiff. But he did well because he was a new talent. Humor is very sublime, not on your face like most Hollywood comedy junk. It means. Professor of Nut. If you have short attention and you're used to typical Hollywood things, you probably will not like it because it's a bit slower. I chose it for Blu-ray and I have to say that the image quality is at the highest level. Probably one of the better-looking Blu-ray movies I've seen so far. The additions were also great. They got a bit removed, but it's probably good, because most of the deleted scenes really did not add anything.
