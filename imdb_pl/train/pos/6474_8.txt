I got into it completely and I could not wait for each episode. The action revived how emotional the missing person in the family must be, and the consequences that it would have on those closest to them. The only problem we had as a family was how quickly everything was "explained" at the end. We have not heard clearly what has been said and we have no idea what Gary was doing in all this? Why did Kyle call him and why did he do it? We invested in a series for five hours. We felt cheated that only five minutes were stopped at the end. I asked around and none of my friends who watched him was any smarter either. Very strange, but maybe we missed something important ??
