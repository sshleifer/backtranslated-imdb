Young, handsome, muscular Joe Buck (Jon Voight) moves from Texas to New York, thinking that he makes a living by being a stud. He gets there and quickly learns that it will not be easy - he goes through one degrading experience after another. At the end of his rope, he connects a maimed, slimy Ratso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman). Together, they try to survive and get out of town and move to Florida. But will they succeed? <br /> <br /> A very dark, disturbing but fascinating movie. Director John Schelsinger paints a very dirty portrait of NYC and its people. In this way it is outdated - the city could have been so bad in 1969, But now it has already been significantly purified. He also uses every trick from the camera in the book - the color changes to black and white; triple dream sequences; flash forward; flash backs (especially with rape); shock; strange sound effects ... name it. It makes you confused and not in the center - but I could not stop watching. <br /> <br /> There is not much history - basically focused on the friendship between Rizzo and Buck. There is the implication that they could be lovers (this shows the last type of shot). This is just a portrait of two damaged characters who try to survive in the cold, cruel, urban jungle. <br /> <br /> It was originally rated as X in 1969 - the only reason is that the MPAA did not think that parents would want their children to see it. Nevertheless, it was a big hit among high school students (then X meant that nobody was under 17). It was also the only X-rated film that won the Oscar as the best movie. Hoffman and Voight were ready for acting awards, as did (mysteriously) Sylvia Miles, who was in the picture in a total (maybe) 5 minutes! It was finally reduced to R (without any cuts) when it was resumed in 1980. <br /> <br /> Also in this movie was presented an excellent song "Everybody's Talkin" - and it became a big hit. br /> <br /> Great movie --- but very dark. It gives me 10. I do not see it on commercial television - it is cut into bands and unintelligible.
