I just saw it at the Vancouver International Film Festival in 2003 and it was fun as hell and a little surreal. Takes place in Toronto, where the two losers live in this dilapidated house in the middle of the highway system. David Hewlett (PIN, CUBE, CYPHER) and Andrew Miller (CUBE) are as great as two losers who want the world to just leave. Acting, dialogue and writing are very good, and the whole movie looks great for such a low-budget movie. The screenwriter was the presenter / screenwriter Vincenzo Natali, who seemed intelligent and down-to-earth. This guy is so ingenious with these great stories that work so well in small budgets, that's shaming the Hollywood budget!
