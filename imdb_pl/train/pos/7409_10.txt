Expecting to see a "cute little film" from mainland China, I was poorly prepared. The dynamics of the family, the community and the inevitability of change have rarely been explored in the film. Each character is solid and completely involved in this story. The organization is much more complex than the American recipients. However, there is no difficulty in progress, even when reading subtitles. Jiang Wu, as a late brother, is a constantly shining light. Leave your cynicism in the cabinet. It will be there when you check out.
