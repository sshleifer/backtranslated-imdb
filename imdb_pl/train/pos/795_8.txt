It is a pity that a few comments before me do not know the facts in this matter. It is based on real events, the publicized case of disappearance and murder in the Wilmington region, DE / Philadelphia PA from 1996. Until 2000 I have to admit that I was very skeptical about how Hollywood dramatized real history and events was really impressed by this how close they were to what was constantly reported in local news and news at Philadelphia Inquirer throughout the period. Of course, I immediately noticed that the actress (which I really like in Cold Case), who played in Fahey, did not remind her (Anne Marie was really prettier). I must admit, however, that Mark Harmon really broke the personality type that was revealed as Capano, and the behavior that Capano showed throughout this period. The details of the case were fine ... no deviations from the dramatic effect ... even for carpets, pistols, furniture and refrigerators. In conclusion, I also wanted to add that I met Tom Carper many times on various functions (a good man, even though he is a politician) and I'm glad he pulled the strings in the federal sphere, necessary to solve this shameful crime. Guys like Capano are real and it was great to see him finally put behind bars.
