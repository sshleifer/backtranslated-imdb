This is a great movie, which I think is not sufficiently recognized as "Saturday night fever" or "Grease" in the career of John Travolta. He plays a man who is in love with a girl but is too blind to admit his feelings. Instead, he wants to engage in a mechanical ride on a bull because he thinks it will show his masculinity. Although it was created in 1980, Nadal is up to date. The great country music soundtrack is great. 10/10
