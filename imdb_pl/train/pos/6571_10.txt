<br /> <br /> The first thing I have to say is that I own Jake Speed. I've seen it at least 10 times. This movie is one of the most fun movies in history. The film begins with Margaret (Karen Kopins), who is trying to find her sister. Her sister was kidnapped in Paris and the family did not hear anything. Jake Speed ​​(Wayne Crawford) arrives, telling her exactly where her sister is and submitting an offer to find her. Jake Speed ​​is a hero. He does not work for money, because he just wants to help and have a good adventure. His partner (Dennis Christopher) follows him and writes his adventures in novels. This movie is a great adventure. It's fun, full of action, just great. I think it's a cult movie with a very small cult. Crawford is perfect as Jake Speed ​​and throws away some liners that you will never forget. Kopins and Christopher are also good enough as a girl and midfielder. John Hurt, the guy who's stomach exploded in Alien, playing a devilish, perverse villian that just adds fun. In many respects, this movie is similar to Indiana Jones, in a sense it is similar to James Bond's films. Maybe it should be called Indiana Bond, but whatever the title is, it's a very nice movie.
