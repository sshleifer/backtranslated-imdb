Neil Simon has a lot of work, but it was Strange Couple who brought him fame. This movie really works. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthaw have great chemistry. The supporting cast of this movie is also great. <br /> <br /> This is about 2 men living together who are from opposite planets. The script is full of humor from this situation. This was done earlier in some forms. This is what unites everything in a very good package. <br /> <br /> Simon has done another decent job, but this is really his best job that allowed the rest of his work. It is difficult to imagine Simon who has ever come to this.
