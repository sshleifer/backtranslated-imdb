I have never heard of this film in spite of a relationship with George Clooney (whose company has produced and appears in a very entertaining supporting song) and the director of his Ocean's 11 Steven Soderbergh. What's worse, we chose it in a discounted basket for 4.99 USD (Canadian dollars in this case!) What a great and pleasant surprise. But I am of the opinion that if William H. Macy is in it, you can not fail. It was very similar to the comedies of Ealing from England in the fifties. OK, with a bigger curse. It's a strange, sometimes funny, funny movie. The actual attack made me laugh so much that I cried. Perhaps the funniest use of briefs in the history of the film. Maybe it was the low expectations that I had, but I watched with a group of people and had a great time. The best $ 5 I spent in my age.
