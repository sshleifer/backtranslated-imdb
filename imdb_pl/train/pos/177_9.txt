It's a good movie and nothing more. And he looks great. Sure, he bypasses political issues. Well, so what? I'm sure she did not try to create "Good Night and Good Luck" here. Let's not try to do it, but something else is ... light tariff. <br /> <br /> And very nice! <br /> <br /> Do we remember how it was in 1984? We have become very sophisticated according to the media when it comes to what we watch or not. I usually differ in this matter. Goldie knew it was funny, and she went ahead and did it. <br /> <br /> As its lightest tariff: Protocol, Overboard, Host, Wild Kitties, Private Benjamin, Looks Like Old Times, Foul Play, Death Becomes Her, Club of First Wives and Remake of Out-of-Towners, GOLDIE knows what he's doing ... he plays every role in the camp that you can leave! Goldie just knows each other well and knows what he can do really well. <br /> <br /> She always made me laugh merrily and innocently. I loved her in Laughter and in everything she's ever been to. She never tried to be someone else, just who she is ... and this is a bubbling, giggling girl from the neighborhood who is very pretty and has a smile and laughter that always surrounds me and reminds me that life is quite short and you you just have to brighten up, because before you know it ... you are old, wrinkled and suffer from one of the inevitable ailments of life. Even if it's so late. <br /> <br /> I appreciate Goldie for who she is: beloved, comic actress.
