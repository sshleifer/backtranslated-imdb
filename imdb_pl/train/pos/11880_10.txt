"Scarface" now has a serious cult, even 22 years after its release. <br /> <br /> It is also widely criticized as very tacky, unrefined, exaggerated and all bloated! These are people who compare Scarface to Godfather films. It is true that on the technical front (cinematography, script, direction, etc.) Scarface is behind the "Godfather". <br /> <br /> But it's also true that what Scarface has and some other gangster lack of films is the harshness and raw attitude of gangsters. The Latin gangsters in this movie look much more dangerous and more than any of the polished Italian or Irish gangsters from other classic gangsters, such as "The Godfather" or "Goodfellas". This is one of the main points of Scarface's victory and I strongly believe that the majority of critics wrote this fact as "stickiness"! I saw the original Scarface from 1932 and I have to say that both of these films are too different from each other and should be seen as two different films instead of praising the original for "remake"! <br /> <br /> Al Pacino was criticized for being loud and loud in this film. But what do you say, that's how the filmmakers wanted to have Tony Montana! This is the bad young man who makes hasty decisions and throws tantrums every second minute! He is not a peaceful Michael Corleone here. It's Tony Montana, a very tacky, uneducated person who really does not think too much and gets angry all the time! <br /> <br /> Certainly this movie is 80 years old. The soundtrack is all 80s! I love some songs, including the theme "Gina and Elvira", "Push it to the limit" and the title instrumental song. <br /> <br /> There are several unforgettable and beautifully shot sequences, including the famous chainsaw scene, Rebeng's hit, the first encounter with Sos and the visit of Tony to his mother. <br /> <br /> About the performances: Al Pacino is brilliant as a furious Cuban refugee. Apparently he mentioned that he liked to play Tony Montana the most in his entire career. And it really looks like he has had fun in all of his scenes! You may wonder what "Scarface" will look like without Pacino. I just could not imagine that anyone would introduce Tony Montana and, in all likelihood, the movie would not be so effective without him! <br /> <br /> Steven Bauer shines as a friend of Tony Manny. <br /> <br /> Robert Loggia is great as Tony's boss, Lopez. Like F. Murray Abraham (as Omar) in a small role. <br /> <br /> Then there is some sweetness in the form of Elvira played by Michelle Pfeiffer. It looks beautiful and is adequate to its role. <br /> <br /> The director does not exaggerate during a specific part of the climax. Without revealing anything, I would only say that it is the only small part that suffers from improper handling. <br /> <br /> "Scarface" is definitely one of the most entertaining and one of the best gangster movies ever made outdoors. Enjoy what it is: a raw portrait of Drug Lords and their gangland!
