House of Games is a spelling setting. It is nice to watch movies from time to time, which are excellent dozens. I've seen some movies that can get you so quickly. From the initial scene, this movie just gets you. <br /> <br /> I am trying very hard not to give too much to those who have not seen it yet, but there will be FEW SPOILERS, WHO DO NOT READ YET IF YOU DO NOT KNOW. <br /> <br /> I would say that House of Games is not just a great movie, but the best movie about cheats I've ever seen - without any. From the moment the video ends, she asks for replaying. <br /> <br /> Lindsay Crouse as Margaret Ford is just perfection, from manners to the inflection of the voice he immediately enters the role. Joe Mantegna was also great. The dialogue in this film has unforced, almost unmarked quality, and these two people communicate in the same way as with their voices. I also loved the way of filming, in this grainy, surrealistic way, it fit perfectly and helped make the film what it was. <br /> <br /> There were a few movies that I saw and loved and it reminded me of The Grifters and The Typical Suspects, but in fact the House of games is completely different. Margaret and Mike are the two most absorbing characters I have seen on the big screen and not only have screen chemistry that is strong and tangible from the moment they meet, but the accumulation that begins from the moment they look at each other is electrifying. You know something will happen, but you have no idea what. And just when you think that you guessed what "something" is, you realize that you did not even scratch the surface ... <br /> <br /> House of Games is one of those movies that can be dropped into a certain genre film, but it's basically a movie about human nature. The character's examination concerns not only the artist's mind but also the victim's. As the film moves and we get to know more and more about the main characters, we learn about them not only through what they say, but also how they say it. This is a great study of the character and is flawless in the way it speeds up the conclusion. <br /> <br /> In summary, I'll put it 10 out of 10, call (although this is not my absolute favorite movie, quite high on the list), definitely outstanding and would go as far as saying that it is the best character research and includes some of the best "twists and turns" I've seen. Although I love all kinds and genres of films when it comes to the movies of the human psyche, it really is not much better than that. See this movie.
