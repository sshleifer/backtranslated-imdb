"Imagine that you can bring life back to life with one touch". As soon as I heard this, my attention focused on the trailer, and after the first episode I found my love in this program. A contemporary tale that lifts my spirits and draws my attention throughout the show. I think that Acting and Casting is just perfect, each character brings something unique in the series, which adds to its perfection. Even once villains can overflow with a unique sense, from a man of a bee to a guy who can swallow kittens, they never let me down. And the deaths that normally lead to a depressive moment often end in purely comic (such as the exploding book Scratch and Sniff) <br /> <br /> Even with the many demonstrations of Crime we have now, Daisies is one of the few that it really stands out from the rest, being not only a secret, but also a love story, a comedy and a fairy tale with a hint of drama, all baked in one wonderful dough ... err show. <br /> <br /> What really shocked me was the fact that it was in ABC. Over the years I have never had a reason to turn to ABC, but it brought me back every week with a smile on my face. It was as if Pushing Daisies had brought ABC back to life. But yes, after two seasons, several awards, a large fan base and positive criticism of the program was rejected. It looks like Ned has touched ABC again and killed him forever. I will always be a fan of this show, and I recommend it to anyone who likes to talk a lot and a lot of love from the programs they watch.
