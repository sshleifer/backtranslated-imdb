For one I really like this movie for some reasons I'm late, but I want to touch why people do not like it. First of all, there are people who like to hate Tom Cruise. I really do not understand it. Secondly, I think Cameron Crowe will successfully cover two groups of viewers. Accidental, relaxed, "not wanting to think too hard" a group of film viewers remains confused, when the plot takes a total of 180 at the end of the film. And deep, philosophical, mysterious fans are devastated when Crowe has one of his characters completely explaining the mystery. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie. And Tom Cruise does a very good job. I think it's probably his best performance from what I've seen, although I probably have not seen all of his films, and even most of them. The supporting staff is also good. Penelope Cruz gives a solid performance, and Jason Lee was very pleasant. <br /> <br /> I like this story and I think that Vanilla Sky is more than anything. It's a mystery, adventure and romantic comedy, but it's just a good story. And it has a lot of philosophical subtexts, and many similar ideas and stories like this appear in historical philosophy. David Aames (Cruise) is a man who had everything he wanted, more or less lost, got a second chance to catch him, to get him back, and finally confronted his demons and the full range of what was going on he chooses reality, simplicity and normality to see if he can finally find one thing he will never be able to master: happiness. <br /> <br /> Many people were disappointed that Crowe created a complete secret at the end. I think it's necessary. The audience then knows beyond any doubt that David is aware of his circumstances and makes the choice at the end even more powerful. <br /> <br /> And the music in the film is great. This probably makes the movie as enjoyable as it is. Especially "Njosnavelin" Sigur Ros, which is an amazing song. <br /> <br /> In total, I would give her 3 out of 4 stars. It's a movie with a substance for those who like to think and a great story for those who want to relax. This "moderate" approach is probably the reason why people do not like him so much, because it is not a full secret or a loving love story. He mixes and matches various elements and genres.
