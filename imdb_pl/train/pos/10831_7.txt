Excellent cast makes this movie work; all characters are very well-developed and it is clear that the actors liked to film this movie. <br /> <br /> This is not quite the comedy I expected, but rather a light look at the attempt to regain youthful glory than a lewd humor. There are a lot of subtle references for music fans, which in themselves are intellectually fun. <br /> <br /> I hate to draw direct comparisons with other films, but so much of this movie reminded me of Alan Parker's films that I can not help: imagine that the Obligations really did - and then tried to regain that glory 25 years later.
