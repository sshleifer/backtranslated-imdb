What a great movie, I have no words to describe. I do not know how this movie is rated at 7.3, it should be 9.3, but one way or another can not make this movie, and Akshaya's acting is just great, the other half of the movie makes you cry and the movie is really good an unexpected ending that makes the film perfect. You should watch this movie once, I think twice as good, it's up to you. Anyway, I love this movie and it's not only sad and fun, it also gives really good meanings and what you should do, I think it's one of the best movies in Bollywood history. but I know that people have deferent, so yes. the only thing I do not like about this movie is music, background music is good, but the songs are not good enough, I think music would have been better if AR Rahman was the music director, but in any case, we can not do anything about it so yes.
