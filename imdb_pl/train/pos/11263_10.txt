It's a great show! I had a history teacher in high school in the USA, which was similar to that. There are many "facts" in history that are not entirely true, and Mr. Wuhl shows them very well in a way that is unforgettable. <br /> <br /> Mr Wuhl teaches the class of film students, but the students of history will even appreciate the witty way in which he discovers some very famous mistakes in world history and tries to impress their pupils on their brains. Using live actors performing skits is also very fun. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this series to anyone who is interested in history, which he learned as a child turned upside down.
