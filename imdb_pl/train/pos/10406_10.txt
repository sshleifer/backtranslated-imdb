Abu, THE THIEF BAGDAD, helps King Ahmed regain his kingdom from the wicked wizard. <br /> <br /> When Europe went to war, and much of the world was in flames, Sir Alexander Korda's London Films unveiled this abundant escapist fare from the legends of The Arabian Nights. Filled with swords and spells, he gave viewers in 1940. A short rest from the headlines. It is also a great piece for the movie, with good acting and an intelligent script. <br /> <br /> Conrad Veidt gets the best bills and deserves it, playing evil Jaffar magician. His saturated face with piercing eyes makes him look like macabre roles that he played with such delight in the Silent Days. Here is a black character that is worth watching. As a boyish thief, Sabu is perfectly manned in his third film. Although he is not a hero in the typical sense of the word, his character is certainly heroic in deeds and actions. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is doing very well. John Justin is both energetic and sensitive as an unenlightened king who needs to know the difficult situation live; Sabu wins a significant share of the action (when he is not turned into a dog), but Justin is properly fit when he needs to. The lovely June Duprez plays the threatened Princess Basra, desired by two very different men. The appearance of late in the film, the huge Rex Ingram shakes like a gin with an attitude. <br /> <br /> Allan Jeayes uses his good voice to gain an advantage as Narrator. Miles Malleson gets another eccentric role of the childish sultan Basra, forever looking around for his mechanical toys (Malleson was also responsible for the screen and dialogue of the film). Aged Morton Selten presents the kind King of Legends. Mary Morris, later a unique stage actress, plays the double role of an accomplice of Jaffar and a six-armed silver dancer. <br /> <br /> The film began in Britain, but the wartime difficulties forced KordÄ™ to transfer him to Southern California, which probably explains the presence of American Ingram in the cast. The direction of art, in the bustling Technicolor, is the most attractive, especially the fairytale architecture in blues, white and pink. <br /> <br /> ****************** ******* <br /> <br /> Born in 1924 in Sabu Dastagir, Sabu was employed in Maharaja's stable in Mysore, when he was discovered by Korda's company and put in front of the cameras. His first four films (ELEPHANT BOY-1937, THE DRUM-1938, THE THIEF BAGDAD-1940, JUNGLE BOOK-1942) were his best and he discovered that when they finished, he worked outside of Hollywood. After excellent military service in World War II he resumed his film career, but for years he played ethnic roles in non-distinguished smaller films, and BLACK NARCISSUS (1947) was the only great exception. His latest film, Walt Disney A TIGER WALKS (1964) was an improvement, but it was too late. Sabu died of a heart attack at the end of 1963, At only 39 years old.
