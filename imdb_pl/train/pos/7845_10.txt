So Fox pulled out the plug in the middle of dramatu / tajemnica ... <br /> <br /> How is it weak? Do they expect us to invest our time in new concerts when there is a real risk that we'll never know what's going on? Why were not the remaining episodes shot in the US? They were broadcast elsewhere. <br /> <br /> Hey, Fox! Do you listen? It was a great concert, but you left us hanging. If you intend to introduce new dramas / secrets, at least finish the application before the topic ends abruptly. Every time something like that happens (and it seems that it happens often with you - eg Fox), there are more people who will "wait and see" before they invest their time. This means that you will see an artificially low percentage share and the probability of ending the series will be higher. See? It's a vicious circle. Do not let us down again ...
