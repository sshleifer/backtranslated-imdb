I'm not saying that as a fan of Chris Rock, I say this as a person who had low expectations for this movie and turned out to be wrong. The first disadvantage was to finish work on everything everyone saw. The second disadvantage was that chemistry between Regina King and Chris Rock seemed false. Finally, the acting in this film was below the norm, and the best actor was Regina King, and the worst was Mark Addy. but I saw this disadvantage and saw a solid comedy. In the heads-up scenario, see how the sky can wait, but better. So for all of you, Chris Rock fans, watch this movie, you'll like it. He has a good performance in this film. <br /> <br /> Generally: 7 out of 10
