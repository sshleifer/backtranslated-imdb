When will people find out that some movies are made for fun and do not necessarily change the world? If you realize this, expect a lot of fun while watching "Bill and Ted's false journey." This is a movie that is fun to watch, Keanu and Alex create a great band on the screen that reactivates their characters from "The Perfect Adventure of Bill and Ted" with even more "style" than in the first movie. This is not rocket science, but it's great to laugh, characters are extremely popular, and the plot is so radical that you have to laugh. Do not expect that "deep and meaningful" just expect pure fun!
