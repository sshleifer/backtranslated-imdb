Watching this movie was the most fun in the cinema for a long time. However, I am not able to say whether it is a good or bad film, because such simple qualifications simply can not be applied. This photo has everything that any movie can have. It has the features of romantic comedy, political commentary, thriller, drama, action movie, musical and absurd self-aware artistic film. It's all there, creating a myth. <br /> <br /> The basic idea is the Indian couple, Nandini (Karishma Kapoor) and Shekhar (Sanjay Kapoor), happily living in Canada, who are rushing to India, visit their parents' parents after an alarming report. The rest of the story takes place in India, where the couple are in the middle of the story of fratricide violence. At some point, the story borrows from "Not without my child", but naming Shakti as a modification of anything would be an injustice. <br /> <br /> The seeming story tells of many surprising breaks, including Shah Rukh Khan's dream of Aishwarya Rai, which appears as if from a different movie. In fact, these two stars are on all posters, but they appear really late in the movie, and only Shah Rukh ends in a real character. It makes up for it, however, with a thrilling and truly unexpected performance. <br /> <br /> Karishma Kapoor has the most work to do in this film and performs an admirable job, combining the turns of the film and turns away with a show of credible emotions. Another noteworthy presence is Nana Patekar, who plays Narsimha, the tyrannical father of husband Shekhara. Nana Patekar dominates every scene she is in, with a frightening but nuanced character. <br /> <br /> The movie is not devoid of realism. Violence is widespread, but it is really worrying in the case of abuse by most female characters, with Karishma being repeatedly beaten. Sometimes this violence is clearly disturbing, but ultimately it becomes surreal, because after each dramatic sequence there is such a comic and spectacular turn that the overall effect is nothing but purification. <br /> <br /> I've seen Bollywood publishing and mixing genres, and amazing plot tunes are certainly their standard. But "Shakti" raises the bar, absorbing even more masala, without becoming funny. It is a film that achieves the splendor of Shakespeare's tragedy, where the audience of the mob and royal family is equally entertaining. It is a clean, unpaid cinema, and the director Krishna Vamsi had to have a dream of having fun, throwing each trick in the book. Perhaps the most important message of violent violence and the inspiring range of maternal love were not thoughts in my mind, but I left "Shakti" for joy. Making movies can be the most fun in the world!
