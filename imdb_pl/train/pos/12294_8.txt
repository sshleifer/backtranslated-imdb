I suppose I always felt that Hotel du Nord was connected to the studio, the movement of cars and cameras was too smooth and trouble-free so that it could be filmed on the spot. But no problem - it is still underestimated, beautiful composition of Marcel Carne. The story sometimes seems a little uncertain, as if they made up for it over time, but because it is unpredictable, it draws attention to the bitter end. Shots of money, when two lovers are alone in their room, are burdened with a rather slim dialogue, but it is so beautiful to fall into some misfortune. Do these two young people symbolize cancerous hopelessness in pre-war France or simply idiots? Suicide sentences are quite common; if suicides are young and healthy, and their lives unhampered, would you think of anything other than that they were simply wrong fools? <br /> <br /> Arletty played well the role of a prostitute. anyway! I only saw a few films from Jouvet - this is the most impressive invention as a pimp in HDN - my problem is shallow: every time I see his face, I think about Sonna Hale in Evergreen! <br /> <br /> And the extremely atmospheric, well-preserved and photographed film with so many events requires several reviews to make everything ready. Annabella and Aumont created an exceptionally beautiful pair; Francois (Heurtebise) Perier in his second film had a small funny part as a gay. All in all: wonderful.
