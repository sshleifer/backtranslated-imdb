GBS wrote his own screen adaptation of this award-winning Nobel Prize, but he did not get it produced (he won an Oscar in 1938 for a great adaptation of PYGMALION art from 1914). When Otto Preminger mounted (produced and directed) this production in 1957, Seven years after Shaw's death, he noticed that the British author Graham Greene was adapting and it was a solid choice. <br /> <br /> Taking a stick from Shaw's own screenplay, Greene uses footage from the Epilogue scene to create a framing device to combine two acts of art (one early and one late in the story of Joanna) into a single and most satisfying whole. Where the change of tone on the stage is buffered by a break, it works just as well back into the bedroom of KING Charles Balois (where Joan's man dreams about the events that led to his current situation) and more material from Shaw's Epilogue - introduction Warwick's shadow, John Gielguda (English "king of the creator"). <br /> <br /> Most of the language is solid GBS, and performances by brave Shauvian (like Felix Aymler's Inquisitor or Harry Andrews' de Stogumber) for relative newcomers (the movie set up Jean Seberg's career) are prime. It may be weak, known only from many movie villains of Richard Widmar, to see him play a weak and slightly stupid Dauphin, but the performance - strangely melted - is professional, even if it is probably bad. <br /> <br /> the symbol of the opening credits and the choice of the director to use the visual vocabulary of black and white films serve Shaw and the whole story well. Go in anticipation of good quality entertainment and you will not be disappointed.
