I've read about FLAVIA THE HERETIC for many years, but I did not see it until the beginning of last year when I started buying movies and for some reason I've been thinking about it lately, although it's been several months since I watched it. <br /> <br /> It's an impressive film, set in Italy around the 15th century. Definitely the Middle Ages (though I do not think any specific year was ever given). It is a time of Christian advantage, age is a time of total madness, and the film captures it perfectly. <br /> <br /> Flavia, our heroine, is a young woman who meets a fallen Muslim on the battlefield. He seems to be a warm and intriguing guy, and she is immediately taken with her. Her father, a soldier of a standing family, appears almost immediately and murders the wounded man right in front of her eyes. But she will still see him in her dreams. <br /> <br /> Her father sends her to a monastery, which seems more like the madness of the open air - the inhabitants, so severely suppressed by the relentless medieval Christianity, slowly go crazy. Flavia is influenced by one of the better nuns. But in the crazy world, only crazy are really crazy, and this sociopathic sister clearly recognizes the madness around her. Her look at the times in which she lives strikes at Flavia, who, being young and seemingly sheltered, begins to question everything in the world in which she has been trapped. <br /> <br /> The film is unwavering in the presentation of this world, showing a lot of unpleasantness. We see a battered horse, the ruler rapes one of the women from his lands in a pigsty, a pious torture of a young nun. Through all this, Flavia notices and questions, finally rejecting the Christian dogma, which creates such a parade of horrors in categories that over the years would have gained some criticism for the anachronistic appearance. I do not agree with this criticism. Flavia's views, though sometimes expressed in a way that vaguely reflects, for example, the then feminist commentary (the film was made in 1974), revolves around very obvious questions. Perhaps it is hard to believe that in its time it could be such a fish without water, but it is a small issue that does not make belabore. Flavia is written in such a way as to allow our epochs or any epoch to empathize with its difficult situation. Going deeper into this matter would be the lack of a forest for trees. <br /> <br /> Flavia is excited when Muslims arrive, entering the countryside, and she discovers a new version of the handsome Islamist who is still visiting her dreams. Struck almost immediately, it allows her to practically lead her army, becoming a statue of Joan of Arc in full equipment and directing invaders to destroy Christian society, and take revenge on everyone she saw, committing evil. /> <br /> Is it a harbinger of a new and better world? He may think so, but the Muslims of that era were not great in feminism either, because he soon learns a difficult situation. As they say, meet with the new boss ... <br /> <br /> It's really just a miniature of some of the things that happened at FLAVIA THE HERETIC. The film is quite gloomy and very slow, rather depressing. It is definitely not a movie of mass audience. However, this is quite good and does not belong to the pile of "incomprehension", which is often thrown carelessly. I think there are a lot of values ​​in the last movie and I'm happy that I saw it.
