You would be forgiven for the fact that the Finnish director from Helsinki would not be good at directing the American horror (especially the one that is entirely in the American prison) - see to prove that you are wrong! It was produced in the 1980s, and the film was shot on a budget more suited to modern TV advertising by DIY (something that I think everyone would really notice now, and practically everyone got used to $ 100 million budgets for action movies, regrettably dominant in the industry mind!) is Harlin's first large production and - at least today - considered a star cast. I still think that most of the Nordic contribution to the film industry as a whole has more to do with Stellan Stargaard's screen performances (not to mention Mr. Bergman's well-publicized director's efforts) - but this movie really proves that outside of the US and Hollywood there are relevant film talents that force us to watch the film in suspense. Try and watch this movie, even if you're not a horror fanatic, IMO is definitely worth it!
