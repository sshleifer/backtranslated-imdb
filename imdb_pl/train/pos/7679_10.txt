I chose human trafficking for my project of the humanities quarter for school. After some research on the Internet, I found this DVD and ordered it. I just finished watching and I still think about it. All I can say is "Wow." It is such a fascinating story of a twelve-year-old Vietnamese girl named Holly and an American man named Patric, who is trying to save her. The ending leaves breathless, and although it is not happily eternal, it is very realistic. This is amazing and I recommend it to everyone! You really connect with Holly and Patric, and your heart breaks for her and for what's happening to her. I liked it so much and now I want to know what will happen next!
