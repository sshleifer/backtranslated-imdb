A mad and graphically bloody Japanese movie about small beings turning people over and turning them into nekroborg-zombie machines that beat each other so that the winner can eat the loser. In the middle of this, a pair of lovers are infected. <br /> <br /> Technically excellent horror comedy (?) It's only for those who have strong stomachs, because blood and body parts are flying. Good taste makes it impossible for me to describe what is happening here, but let's say it is quite macabre. If you like these things with a few steps above the slender content, check out this video. Personally, I do not like movies like that at all, but how ill and distorted they reach the level. Here I was intrigued enough that I can suggest it to people I know, who really like bloody movies .. It's also a movie with enough details that I want to see again, since I know what's going on at the end - I want to go back and see, what it was, what I did not catch. There is a rare internal logic in these movies. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 for those who like blood and severed limbs, this is a zero or more accurate alarm for everyone.
