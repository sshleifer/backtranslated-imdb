I liked the quiet noir of the first part, the acting of Pacino and Cusaka, especially their scenes together. She set the mood of the surroundings and the combination of the old polka and the idealistic youth. I would like Bridget Fonda to have more scenes in the movie; she was a serious and attractive character. The film disappeared from the tracks when the mayor's assistant began to sniff around the mafia to get to the bottom of something that his boss apparently did not want him to interfere. junkyard. Here history has become unbelievable. Something I do not understand: why did the policeman and Vito have a shootout if it provided information that could lead to the collapse of a corrupt judge?
