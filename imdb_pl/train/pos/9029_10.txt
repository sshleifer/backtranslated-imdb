I saw this movie a few days ago. This movie is so great that I feel that if you want something really bad that you've always dreamed about - you can have it. This shows a great desire to fulfill happiness and sadness, hopelessness and failure. But if you are strong enough and your heart really belongs to something that you love, you can make everything change and you'll be happy.
