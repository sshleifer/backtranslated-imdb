I am a VERY big fan of Jim Carrey. I laughed with ASS during Liar Liar and Ace Ventura. I also like him in his serious films, especially at the Truman Show. This one is a crossword of his VERY funny side and his serious side. It is obviously VERY funny in this film, but there are parts that are very serious and pulls them out with great ease. is a real multifunctional actor. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the cast, I was happy with Jennifer Aniston's acting. I think it is more than just a few nice tits and a great asshole. Morgan Freeman makes VERY cool God. When it comes to Steven Carell, his limited scenes are VERY fun, especially on the anchor scene. <br /> <br /> Generally I would have to rate it as 9. A good actor, a funny script, and some very serious situations that make a very good movie.
