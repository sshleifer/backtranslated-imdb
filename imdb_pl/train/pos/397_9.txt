I must admit that Tsui Hark is one of a kind, you can not beat a person with a strong style of presence in the movie. Presenting Chinese fantasy may not be easy for the audience, the director tried to restore the classic fantasy tales from Zu Mountain and that's what he showed. <br /> <br /> The new Legend of Zu really improved from that in 1983. From this new update of the millennium, we could see the vision of Tsui Hark in the mountains of Zu. Spectacular visual designs, an amazing epic fantasy action, beautifully made. I kept me stuck to the whole picture. A great cast with great acting. It's a really cool movie to watch, but is it too weird? <br /> <br /> The disadvantage is that people will definitely be confused with a wide storyline shortened to a 95-minute movie. The plot may not have much of a connection between the characters, but thanks to re-watching the movie you will have a better understanding of the characters themselves. Some may complain that there is not much physical fighting, except that characters who have supernatural powers to defeat enemies, hand-fighting spirits would not make sense at all. <br /> <br /> I appreciate this nice, stylish photo. He may have a thin story, but hey, look at Tsui Harka's Time & Tide, but we're also confused by the plot, but it was really something stylish and amazing. Tsui Hark always attracts something to H.K. Cinema. American viewers may have difficulty understanding when watching this video, because it is not Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, it is a completely new genre. Although it may not be a masterpiece, but its special effects are really better than Storm Riders. It's really worth checking out.
