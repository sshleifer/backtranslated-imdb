Fine. Yes, it was a very tight budget with continuity errors (like single scenes of course shot in the sun and then in the shade and then mixed up), and although I love Nick Mancuso, he was often too good in off-site burnt and some of the smaller support casts they were really bad (plus at least one actor was used for two different but visible roles). But come on. Richard Grieco was hysterical (his hair is worth the trip). Steven Ford was very nice. Mancuso had some great lines, while Nancy Allen, ironically, was completely bland and uninteresting. Classic? No. Bad parts? Yes. Funny? Big yes. I would like him to be on set on the day when they decided what hairstyle Grieco would have. "Are you fast?" ... "You are not so fast."
