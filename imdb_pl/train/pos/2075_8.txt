Talking about the movie is depressing, it's not necessarily bad. I am very keen to watch a depressing movie if there is a point to do, and this one certainly has one. This is often a painful story of a Chinese man and his family because they experience many years of both hardship and abundance. BUT, I have to warn you that it could just be the most depressing Hollywood movie from the thirties - because the peasant life in China was at least TOUGH. Be prepared to watch episodes of hunger, death and illness. <br /> <br /> The only negative phenomenon, apart from the persistent tone of unhappiness, is that the main role is played by Paul Muni. Although he was an exceptionally talented man, it's just a shame that Hollywood has always cast people of European descent to play Asian tracks in this era. If you pay attention at all, it's pretty obvious that Muni is wrong.
