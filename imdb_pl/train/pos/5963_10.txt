This movie is awful, but you have to see it. I'm not here to discuss the whole film, but the biggest chase scene in history. When Eddie deafened Tim's milk, he chases him down the hall. Eddie puts obstacles in the way with funny consequences (like nailing a trumpet, buy a DVD and watch it slowly). The best obstacle is an overturned mop bucket in which one jumper jumps and then moves on the ground through the door. But when it moves, it raises its speed, thus opposing physics (mainly friction); however, what is behind the door is the highest. The sharpest staircase in any school that this jockey moves to CLEAR in the air. In fact, he probably will die of a broken neck. It not only opposes all concepts of reality, but makes the funniest noise ever made in this situation. Go and buy this one. Trust me, this scene is worth your 6 bucks.
