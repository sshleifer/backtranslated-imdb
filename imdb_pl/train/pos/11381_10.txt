The best part of An American In Paris is the long ballet sequence at the end, in which Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron are a living personification of several major painters. Kelly was previously founded as a pavement artist in Paris, so the sequence is the logical ending of a musical full of life and energy, Gershwin's melodies and cast members such as Georges Guetary and Oscar Levant. Kelly was the best here - a bit different from Singin 'in the Rain, and the effect of the whole film as topped with ballet makes it an undoubted factor. No wonder the sequence ended with "That's Entertainment" after all other MGM music events have passed!
