Although I do not think it is a perfect 10, I agree that it was well above 6, which is rated here. No, the Brokedown Palace was not perfect, and yes, its story has been repeated many times before. This does not mean that you should not do it again if it is well done and I think that this movie had some strong moments. Acting Claire Danes, as I have said many times, was just as impeccable as Kate Beckinsell and I Think Bill Pullman was absolutely great, as were secondary performances (Pullman's wife, crooked policeman, skipping or traveling or any other). The photos were also beautifully filmed, there was a lot of good in this film, even if there were any negatives (the three main ones I found). <br /> <br /> Here I did not like it - friendship between girls - in fact individual girls' personalities - were not developed to the depths of the late middle of the picture. It would be unlikely to lose interest before, because despite the positives, more character development should have been done earlier, and some scenes, such as initially arresting girls, were almost obscured, so there was a bit of a jump without character development and the scene I think would be suitable for this type of film. However, this is not my main problem. WARNING WARNING-SPOILER. <br /> <br /> The end, as already mentioned dozens of times, was AMAZING. It was awful in two ways. First of all, although it would be predictable and very Hollywood, I wanted a happy ending! Yes, it was an emotional and powerful ending, but in such a movie is the feeling that justice will be served, and I sat through it to see it. I was really shocked by this ending and everyone was involved, but I think that both girls should get out, and if not, the policeman should have what comes to him. I mean, nothing happens. Bad guys, everything goes well. Very disturbing. <br /> <br /> I also do not understand the ambiguity of the ending. I understand endings inspired by thinking, but it was not a "mysterious" or "clue" movie that we watched, and I would like to know something about what really happened, who was guilty, etc. With this ending we decided to decide for ourselves, but because I doubt somehow whether there will be continuation, I did not want to guess. <br /> <br /> However, in this film there was a lot to like, and the acting is definitely at the top of the list I would rate it as 7.5 and I would say that it is definitely worth a look.
