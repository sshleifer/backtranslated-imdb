My observations: the vampire at the end is delightful and wonderful, exotic and fantastic. Jeanette wore it well and gained even naive Nelson. The boat striking his balcony served him well. His mafia costumes were designed surprisingly well, especially according to today's standards. 1942, the costume designer did a great job. The theme of the main song is just beautiful. <br /> <br /> Note on negative posters: 1942 was the time of World War II; Pearl Harbor happened a year earlier. The US is just emerging from the Great Depression; I needed to go out and spend these hard-earned money on the entertainment of singing, dancing and yes, fantastic fantasy. Despotic dictators tried to rule out there in RL, to put out freedom. Thank God, the audience had the opportunity to watch fantastic feature films. In these depressing times, filming was a privileged feast. When you, negative posters, become actors and even movie stars, then you have room for talks and criticism. Jeanette and Nelson's films stand the test of time. <br /> <br /> Angel wings wonderful, on a real angel. RL wings at a costume party are not so hot, but great at Jeanette considering SL. <br /> <br /> Beautiful singing of Jeanette and Nelson, as always. Jeanette's dance was pure pleasure. <br /> <br /> 15/10
