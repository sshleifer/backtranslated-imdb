Ghosts That Still Walk is one of those movies that grabs you and does not let go to the end, especially when you see him as a child. Seeing the film as an adult, you have to admit that it's not that scary, but the story is very fascinating and contains many wonderful mysterious scenes (especially those with a terrifying mummy) <br /> <br /> One of the best scenes in the film is without doubts scene with grandfather and grandmother in the new RV; the scene with rocks is very exciting and quite scary. Also scenes in which the main character reveals the secret of his mother are quite frightening. <br /> <br /> Okay, playing in the movie is not that great, and the movie sometimes seems a bit boring, but overall Ghosts That Still Walk is great fun. It is a pity that a few people watched this movie, this movie really deserves more. I just want to say: Mr Flocker, you have done a good job! And for all of you Hollywood producers; If you want to make a movie, rework it!
