This film revolves around Japanese culture, as does the life of one modern Japanese family. Physical contact is welcome for people over 7 (especially in public places), so bowing instead of hugging, even when you are close friends / relatives. Ballroom dancing involves embracing someone else as well as publicly! Especially that ballroom dancing is very popular. People who play ballroom dancing in Japan are perceived as a bit like nudists in the West ... they want a lot more than they do, but they are inhibited by culture. A great family movie that any amateur dancer could enjoy the dance sequences themselves. I understand that it was more popular than the Titanic in Japan. I guess the Japanese are like the rest of us - they also like to be cuddled.
