A farewell friend aka Adieu L'Ami / Honor Among Thieves is not perfect, but it is a neat and funny thriller in which unmatched French war veterans from Algeria Alain Delon and Charles Bronson imprisoned in the same basement vault, one to return the stolen bonds other, to clear the two million earnings that sit there during the holiday weekend. Of course, things are not so easy even after opening the vault, which leads to shapely twists. On the debit side there is a very strange striptease scene in the parking lot, Bronson has a very annoying Fonzie slogan he uses at the most inopportune moments, Brigitte Fossey, wearing probably the most disgusting mistake of the 60's (makes her look like a bald woman whose wig is torn off from the top of the head by a strong wind) is a kind of responsibility ?? her "I will cook spaghetti! I will learn to love well! I will read Shakespeare! "Is the speech hysterical in all bad ways? and it's a pity that this is a terrible last line / shot, but otherwise it's a surprisingly funny and unpretentious number that is worth checking out if you can find a decent print. <br /> <br /> The British Cinema Club only offers an English soundtrack, but because Delon votes alone and the rest of the cast is fairly well-known, this is not a big problem, especially since the panoramic transfer is of quite good quality.
