"Bye Bye Birdie" is not one of the best musicals of all time, but it is great fun and available to many recipients. The original movie could have been great, with Dick Van Dyke, who recreated his characteristic role on Broadway, but instead tinkered with the story, so the film is very unsatisfactory. This re-make, which was broadcasted in ABC in 1995, is much more faithful to the original script and contains several original songs that were used during the national tour from which the film took off. choreographed this movie.) <br /> <br /> Jason Alexander is a completely different type than Dick Van Dyke, but he is well manned as Alberta (before the days of "Seinfeld" he began in the musical theater). Vanessa Williams fits perfectly with Rose. It is also a great work of Tyne Daly as Mae and Marek Kudisch as Conrad Birdie (the role he played during the national tour). <br /> <br /> However, this movie is not without problems. The main responsibility is Chynna Phillips, who, however attractive, looks and seems too old to be a teenage Kim. And George Wendt is somewhat unremarkable as her father, slightly throwing the number "children" away (a certain number of original cast members, Paul Lynde stole the show.) <br /> <br /> But all in all, it's a stunning, well-made movie which the material deserves.
