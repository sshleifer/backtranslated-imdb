I recently bought this movie with many other LaserDiscs from eBay. I usually deal with war and action movies, but sometimes I like romantic comedies. <br /> <br /> If you're bored with today's special FX movie and romantic comedy with a high gloss, you should visit the Shop Around the Corner shop on a calm evening. In the movie, I like the fact that the characters have a lot of decency. There is nothing false or pretentious about them. Take, for example, Mr. Matuschek: when he finds out that his wife is cheating on him with one of his employees, he tries to shoot himself. Not only because of humiliation, but because he was unfair to Stewart's character. (OK, weired example.) <br /> <br /> Yes, the focus of the movie is narrow and the plot is predictable. Nevertheless, I liked it very much. If you like Notting Hill, you'll enjoy the shop around the corner. in fact, Hugh Grant reminds me of Jimmy Stewart very much.
