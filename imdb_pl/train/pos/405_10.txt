I have been a fan of Xu Ke (Hark Tsui) for years. This film is the best fantasy movie for years. I do not think that "action" is the right genre, although there are many KongF actions and scenes. Wait, did I mention it's an ORIENTAL Fantasy fantasy? Please remember that you DO NOT use the Hollywood formula to rate this movie. And for a guy who "buys" I do not blame you because you're still young and you need to know more about "culture".
