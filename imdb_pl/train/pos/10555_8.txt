The premise of this film has been tickling my imagination for some time now. We've all heard or read about it in some text. What would you do if you were alone in the world? What would you do if the whole world suddenly disappeared in front of your eyes? In fact, the last part is what happens to Dave and Andrew, two roommates living in a neglected house in the middle of the highway system. Andrew is at least a nervous wreck, and Dave is considered one of the biggest losers in society. Only this is the main reason why these two guys are doing well because they just have to convert each other when they need a baby. Dopóki ... <br /> <br /> There are many problems going on straight from the beginning of the film. Both are involved in crime, Andrew suffers from paranoia and simply does not dare to leave the house. Dave is ineffective in his work, and his colleagues do not treat him very well and with the respect he deserves. The number of problems they face increases until the day they may be forced to face the unavoidable and deal with it. It's too much for them and they want everything to disappear ... And of course this is what's happening. <br /> <br /> The rest of the story places Dave and Andrzej in this world of nothingness. At the beginning they are surprised and have problems understanding and dealing with the characteristics of this crazy environment, but later they find out they can do almost anything they want because it seems that they are the only ones who have remained. <Br /> <br /> There is nothing incredibly small casting - in fact, apart from the first few photos from the movie, we only see Dave (David Hewlett) and Andrew (Andrew Miller) throughout the movie. It is obvious that to do this, the cast must be more than ready to do the task because in a world where nothing exists, there is nothing that can distract the viewer. Vincenzo decided to use a reasonable amount of shots up close to make him more interesting and actually works quite well. The director of photography, Derek Rogers, also has a nice way to annoy the audience by stopping visual information, especially in times when the character sees something and reacts to it, but we do not see it right away. <br /> <br /> Of course, this can not be an event driven movie and it is not. A large part of the action happens outside their home as they move in the void. And that's where some of the most fun scenes take place, especially when Andrzej discovers a candy bar. <br /> <br /> You'd think, "How does nothing look like?" Well, it does not really look like it. The whole world is nothing white ... white no matter where you look. This is the weakness of this movie ... After an hour or less it is very boring to look at it and there must be events to make sure that the view is more interesting. Thank God there are those. For example, when two boys, due to the properties of nothing, are able to jump really high, as if nothing was done with ... tofu (as Andrew says). It's great to see how they can use everything to become the gods of their own small society. <br /> <br /> One of the best parts of the movie is set ... Production designer Jasna Stefanovic has done a beautiful job in this film, the house where these two guys live is so unnaturally funny, yet it seems right that you two lived in such a place. In conclusion, the production project is without a doubt one of the most powerful aspects of this film, because it really makes the film worth watching ... <br /> <br /> However, the best part of the movie is acting. Both David Hewlett and Andrew Miller really look like professional actors. The camera is placed on them for every second of the movie, and as has been said before, there are hardly any props in the film, they are really on the naked stage. With a lot of character development and decent single lines, clever dialogue (sometimes stupidly fun), everything works for this - and it really moves the movie from a low budget area to a well-done manual work. > <br /> Let's talk a bit about visual effects, because it's definitely worth mentioning them. Nothing offers digital visual effects and prosthetics that would equal every modern horror movie. The film has a rather frightening sequence of dreams, and although The Drews completely spent this scene, it is still cool to watch. One of the best visual effects in the movie is the end, in which Andrew and Dave suddenly discover their powers in this environment - they have the ability to wish everything, so what if they can do it the other way round and do things? <br /> <br /> "Nothing" is a bright and well-lit movie, it really helps to promote the idea that they are probably dead (this is actually one of their theories), but "Nothing" is a comedy and slowly destroys its own theory. We do not know where they are or what happened to them. We do not know if they'll ever get out because the movie ends before we see something like that. By the way, the ending is not as good as it could be. It is fairly easy to predict what will happen, but the authors have come up with several incidents that make it a bit more interesting, and at the end is quite satisfactory. <br /> <br /> Take "Hollow" Man, "Kill Bill", "Cube", "Epoch" and many other movies and you have "Nothing". It's really a mix of different styles, but there's still no other movie (at least I know it) Nothing really is. For those who remember the original Cube Production Commentary on DVD, he may remember that Vincenzo Natali talked about how he came up with the Cube story. He talks about him and André Bijelicu, who were roommates at the same time and they were both in this incredibly boring room without hope of going out, "Nothing" could very well be a screened version of Cube origin, and for this purpose it is almost one of the Cube prequels. <br /> <br /> What can I say? I liked "Nothing", it's a great movie, and the different parts of the movie are amazingly well done with lots of smart ideas, but I feel something is missing in the movie and I have problems finding out what it is ... Maybe if we have " Nothing 2 ", I can answer this question. "Nothing" is a great movie, but not as good as I expected. <br /> <br /> Final rating: 7.5 / 10
