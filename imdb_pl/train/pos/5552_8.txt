I waited until July 4 to write it because. . . well . . . because it just feels good doing it that day. <br /> <br /> In 1924, D.W. Griffith needed a hit, he had not had much since ORPHANS OF THE STORM (1921). He has been working steadily since then, but his films have had less range and he has failed to hit the right chord of the audience. He planned a movie about Patrick Henry when he was contacted by the Daughters of the American Daughters (DAR) who asked if he could extend his ideas to embrace more of the American Revolution. This movie is the result. Before he finished, he had a 14-drum history lesson and there was no trace of Patrick Henry. <br /> <br /> We all know the story of the Revolutionary War, but Griffith threw in a love story with Farmer Patriot Nathan (Neil Hamilton) falls in love with the aristocrat Torah Nancy Montague (Carol Dempster, a leading lady of Griffith for many years). A complicating matter is that Nancy's father hates Nathan. . . not only Nathan, he hates all rebels. It does not matter when someone is shaking Nathan's arm during a skirmish on the streets of Lexington, causing him to unload his weapon and accidentally hurt Nancy's father! <br /> <br /> The parallelization of love story is (mainly true but partly embellished) the story of Captain Walter Butler (Lionel Barrymore), a British renegade officer who feels he is not to blame. With Thousands of Indians forming the Six Nations on his side, he hopes to destroy the colonists and become the monarch of his own empire. <br /> <br /> Comparisons with the NATION NATION (1915) are inevitable. The Montague family may very well be Cameron from an earlier movie, while Nathan may be part of the Stoneman family. The sequence of the Battle of Bunker Hill is very similar to the scene in the NATION OF THE NATION with an attacking army, in this case with Redcoats, storming ditches with the Patriots. The only thing missing is Henry Walthall, who is charging over no man's land to push the flag into the cannon's barrel. Amazingly, battle scenes in America seem to lack the energy of battle scenes in BIRTHDAY and do not attract audiences. Something is clearly missing. This is not the range, G.W. "Billy" Bitzer's camera work is quite good. Maybe it's missing. . . I dare say it. . . sincerity? <br /> <br /> Brutality captain. Butler and his people are well underlined, although many of them happen over long distances or off screen. Do not expect any heads to be detached in close-up, as we saw in INTOLERANCE (1916). In one of the scenes, deputy Butler, Cpt. Hare (Louis Wolhiem), he picks out the eyes of a slave. We only see the beginning of the act, the rest of the camera focuses on the Hare's face, because it apparently does good. Lionel has worked with Griffith since 1912. History says he turned to Griffith for a job, and D.W., knowing the reputation of his famous family, he said, "I do not employ stage actors." to which Lionel replied: "And I am nothing like that, sir!" He creates a very good and quite reliable villain. Louis Wolhiem appeared with his elder brother Lionel, John three times; at SHERLOCK HOLMES and DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE (both 1920s) and later in TEMPEST (1927). As Captain Hare, his wild, staring eyes and tousled hair not only mean him as a villain, but also make him think he's crazy too. <br /> <br /> Neil Hamilton later noted that America was his first horse and I was scared to death. ". He hides his dissatisfaction very well and we can believe that he was quite riding until he was shot. Mr. Griffith was very much in love with Carol Dempster and at one point asked her to marry him. She refused and soon left her joint-stock company, after which her star status gradually faded. <br /> <br /> Speaking of horses, one accidentally funny moment, which had to be crossed out, appeared during the presentation of Paul Revere's journey. He drives a horse on the porch of the family to announce "To arms! The regulars are coming! "But when he tries to leave, the horse can not move backwards and stumble, spilling his rider to the ground! I'm amazed that Griffith did not do anything else. <br /> <br /> Is America Classic? YES! Do not wait until July 4 to see it, it's enjoyable at all times.
