The show is really fun. Nice theme. Jokes and one line are really good. With a small additional tuning it can become a very popular program. But the only serious negative point of this show is the cast. David Spade does a great job as Russell, Megyn Price does a good job. But who the hell, he cast Patrick Warburton, Oliver Hudson and Bianca Kajlich. <br /> <br /> Technically, Russell and Jeff are the main characters of the series, which makes viewers want to watch the program. Russell is a playboy, and Jeff is a kind of frustrated man from the family. A magical relationship ... with the experience of all the problems facing marriage in a relationship. <br /> <br /> Patrick Warburton - he does a terrible job as Jeff is not suitable for this role. It's like a robot, there are literally no blows in the delivery of dialogues. <br /> <br /> The cast is very important for viewers. Bad acting will certainly come down ...
