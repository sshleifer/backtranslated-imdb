I lost my father at a very young age. Really young, I do not remember him. I have learned many things about him over the years. One of those things was that he loved Westerns, and watching Bonanza every Sunday night was an absolute ritual for him. I, myself, remember the end of the series, which was 8 years old, when the show ceased to produce in 1973. Watching this program over the years makes me closer to my long lost father. It has everything you need to succeed in the performance: laughter, tears, extreme tension in the chair and even angry at times. the memory of the original run of the show came soon after the death of our beloved "Hoss" Cartwright, Dan Blocker. One particular episode and the end of closing captions, flashing the image of Blocker and disappeared in black, and I can also Recall my eldest sister with a tear in my eyes at the sight of this. I remember it as if it were yesterday. On behalf of my late father, who is not here to say it alone, we love Bonanza. .
