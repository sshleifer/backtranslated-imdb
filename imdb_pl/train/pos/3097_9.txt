This program was fantastic. It was intricate and well written, and all the characters were nice and not terribly sweet. Even Jonathan Cake, a Filipino boyfriend, was sympathetic. Because our radio waves are filled with nonsense such as American Idol and Dancing with the Stars, it was nice to see a drama that was not too much of a soap opera. It was always intriguing to see how each character would be connected to the next occasion. It's really annoying that we finally get a program that makes you think a bit and throw it out because of a mysterious number that most of us do not even pay attention to. Some of us are not sheep. This show will not be overlooked by many people, but by a few loyal fans.
