Mystery Men is one of those films that becomes more fun with time. There is naive innocence and "kindness" for heroes. It has become a part of our "culture" of the family and we often quote characters. This is my favorite movie from the last two years. My children are 13 and 11 years old, and all three of us love this movie. Great acting and comedy. We also love Galaxy Quest and Monty Python. Okay, we're not talking about intellectuals here, just family bonds!
