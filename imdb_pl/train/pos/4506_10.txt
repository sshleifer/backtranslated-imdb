I would like to add to the praise for the production of this film, especially of luminous cinematography. The glow of the smooth and muscular skin creates stunningly beautiful images. The film was nominated for (and won) a single Oscar - the first one he received for editing. Mali's performance is moody, penetrating and powerful.
