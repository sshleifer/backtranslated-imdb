Jeremy Brett is simply the best Holmes in history, narrowly supplanting the great Basil Rathbone, and probably the best adaptation of Conon-Doyle's story. <br /> <br /> The length adaptation includes several new storylines that fit well with the surrounding drama and intensify hatred for Milverton. <br /> <br /> Excellent performances all the time, especially from Robert Hardy, and both Brett and Hardwick, fully rounded and comfortable in their roles, make this a great drama.
