This movie is pure Elvira and shows it on her breast ... I mean the best! The story (co-author of Cassandra Peterson, Elvira's alter ego) is inspiring and captivating, and animates her wit and Elvira's charm. The viewer has the opportunity to see Elvira in a completely new light when she struggles with the prejudices of the people of Fallwell, Massachusetts (where she traveled from Los Angeles to study Great Auntie Morganna's will) and at the same time tries to help suffering teenagers who have been deprived of play through the matriarchal Pariah Purity and the rest of the city council. He also has to deal with the attraction for Bob Redding, the owner of the local cinema, and another woman (Patty), who has an eye on Bob, but is not as worthy of his love as Elvira. In the later film, it also has to do with complications resulting from the fact that it comes from an "important metaphysical celebrity", and accusations of witchcraft brought against her mean that she will be burned at the stake. Elvira manages to be both sexy and helpless, street and naive in this film, while at the same time ruining joking jokes and providing atypical lines with double meaning. <br /> <br /> This film is inspiring because it gives you a message without ever giving up on yourself and always trying to follow your dreams. In the end, Elvira's dreams come true, which is the best thing that can happen to this wonderfully unique and determined woman. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie countless times and will never get bored of it! There are no unnecessary scenes and I found myself enchanted by the whole movie. The review will not reflect the truth of the film, so I can tell you that I PLEASE look at it because it is one of the best films ever! In the meantime, I wish you "unpleasant dreams!"
