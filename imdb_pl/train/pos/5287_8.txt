This is one of several cartoons with Bugs Bunny and Marvin Martian - as well as a K-9 space dog. This episode of Looney Tunes is very funny, it has a fairly good animated animation (Marvin animation is very well made) and the plot is well done. The end is quite strange, so be prepared for it, it's a bit boring. <br /> <br /> In this episode Marvin the Martian was sent to Earth to catch an Earth creature and bring it to Mars. With his trusted dog K-9, Marvin sets out and soon finds traces of no other rabbit, but Bugs Bunny! He greets them with delicacies, thinking they are costumes or tricks. I do not realize that they are preparing to take this rabbit to Mars ... <br /> <br /> I recommend this episode to anyone who likes Bugs Bunny, Marvin the Martian and Looney Tunes in general. As for the beginning and middle of the episode, you'll probably like it. Enjoy "Hasty Hare"! :-)
