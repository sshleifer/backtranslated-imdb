If scientists behaved in the way H.G. Wells was sure that in the future, history would not have come to the end as in the case of things to do. It's been almost 80 years since Wells wrote "The Shape Of Things To Come" on which this movie is based, and is not closer to the world it describes than before, in some ways further. <br /> <br /> Although so well-known players Raymond Massey, Ralph Richardson and Cedric Hardwicke are in the cast, they are more caricatures than real characters. This is the main weakness of the film, devoted to Wells' philosophy of science will solve all problems, and the rest of us are backward fools. . Cedric Hardwicke is a skeptic who feels that he is running too far. And Ralph Richardson is a commander created by the destruction of the next Thirty Years War with modern weapons. Incidentally, as the atomic bomb was not invented, poison gas was considered a weapon that almost destroys humanity. <br /> <br /> According to Wells, learning and conquering will never get mixed up. Scientists as a group are too far above the world of politics to get involved in such things. In Wells's life, the scientists fled Hitler and Mussolini's right-wing fascist regimes. The same people, to defeat them, submitted to the Allies and shaped the atomic weapons that initiated the modern era. If they behaved as Wells would have them, someone like Albert Einstein would lead a junta of scientists who would set up a new order after the Second World War. <br /> <br /> Wells was wrong both in time and in development. Apparently, he never imagined a computer as well as atomic power. Computer programmers are much more often our rulers in a bold new world than scientists at the moment. Still Things To Come, supported by director William Cameron Menzies and created sets, give an interesting insight into H.G. Wells, certainly a respected thinker of his time, although he did not quite correct the shape of things to come.
