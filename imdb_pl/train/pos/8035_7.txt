Sunday would not be Sunday without an action movie, and when you want an intense fight, you turn to Tom Berenger (platoon). <br /> <br /> Here he plays the sniper in the jungle, chasing rebel and drug lords. Life is a bitch, so he gets a green office (Billy Zane) to help in the mission. <br /> <br /> The film is in the hands of Luis Llosa, who stuns Anaconda. it does not do much better here, but Berenger makes the film valuable. <br /> <br /> Sure, it may be a bit too long - who wants to see a lot of walking in the jungle, but it's a good, tense action when the time comes.
