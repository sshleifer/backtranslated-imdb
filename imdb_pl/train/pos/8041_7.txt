Despite some of the negative comments that this video collected on IMDb sites, it is still worth seeing, because it is a story of survival and camaraderie between two different men with different mentalities during a difficult mission in the Panama jungle. /> Peruvian director Luis Llosa takes us to see this thriller taking place in Panama. The film has some good moments when Beckett, a marine veteran, takes a newly arrived man, recently sent to try to eliminate the notorious head of the drug cartel and the corrupt general of the army who may be the next president of the country. The only problem, Miller, has no experience in what he has been entrusted with. <br /> <br /> Miller, an arrogant newcomer to the jungle and a guerrilla war between the army and drug lords against the infiltrated American intelligence men, learn a valuable lesson from Beckett. What looks good in theory does not matter in the jungle. <br /> <br /> Tom Berenger is an actor who does not record much, as he proves in this film, but in the context of the film he is like a man with a few words. Billy Zane playing at Miller does what he can, thanks to the role that does not give him any glory until the decisive end. <br /> <br /> For the lovers of the action movie "Sniper" offers 112 minutes of action, which with a little pruning would be a more satisfying movie.
