I love this movie, I watched it over and over again. I do not understand why anyone would think that this movie is not good. Maybe you've seen better, or whatever it is, I personally love it. This is one of my favorite movies and I'm not Hindi at all, but I love it. It may be a bit like "Pretty Woman", but I have not seen it and I do not think it would be better. I do not know why you all talk about it, but maybe you have a good reason, but I think I said it enough, but I love this movie, and those who say it is not good at all, I wonder why I looked at it and what movies you think are good. As for everyone else, I watched it with pleasure, so it surprises me that many people do not like it. As for Rani Mukherjee (I think you write her name), she is very beautiful and my favorite actress!
