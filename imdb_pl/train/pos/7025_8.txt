I think it is a charming adaptation, very lively and full of fun. With the exception of a few serious mistakes, the cast is great. I must repeat some of the earlier comments - Chynn Phillips is a terribly loser as a teenager. At the age of 27, he is simply too old (and yes, it shows) and there is no singing "chops" for Broadway-style music. Vanessa Williams is a decent singer and is suitable for a non-dancer. However, she is NOT Latina, and her character is definitely. It is also very STRIDENT all the time, which becomes exhausting. <br /> <br /> The girls from the Conrad Birdie fan club with Sweet Apple really shine - with a special appreciation for Brigitta Dau and Chiara Zanni. I also liked the performance of Tyne Daly, although in general I'm not a fan of her work. Finally, the dancing Shriners are riots, especially dorky three in the bar. <br /> <br /> The film is suitable for the whole family and I highly recommend it.
