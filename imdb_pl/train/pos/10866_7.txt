Johnnie's CHOICE has cool music on the initial subtitles and a nice project that opens subtitles, a kaleidoscope of Chinese characters and those Asian gangsters solemnly swearing or uttering some sacred things; in fact, all traffic is well-rated. I found this to Bishop Seraphim Sigrist and I really wanted to see the movie To. The one I started with, CHOICE is exciting and interesting, and currently moderately violent - moderately and dramatically; the story of Asian godfathers 'intrigue, uses elemental puzzle, violent facts from gangsters' life, scepter race, real details, and like Coppola it is expected that we will believe that some morally charming gangsters are legitimate and nice and nice. The performances are quite fun and colorful. ELECTIONS are well done in the pleasant, slightly careless style of the Hong Kong tariff; the ending is bitter, real, simple and scare the children.
