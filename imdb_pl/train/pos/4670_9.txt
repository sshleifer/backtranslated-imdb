Those who remember the late Sir Peter Ustinov, like Hercule Poirot or a professional storyteller, would do well to look for this charming piece of satire from the 1960s. Ustinov appears as a condemned embezzler (first we see him during his last day in prison, where he prepares a tax return of a prison governor) who, sensing that the future is in computers, puts (using a clever piece of identity theft) like a computer expert and embarks on infiltration American international group. <br /> <br /> Ustinov (who was the co-author of the script) is in great shape, just like the charming Maggie Smith, here extremely thrown as an accident-prone cockney -sparrow dolly bird. Bob Newhart also performs a funny performance as a suspicious performer who has designs on Maggie Smith. What's more, Karl Malden is as satisfactory as Uzinov and the female feminine head. <br /> <br /> What makes me particularly happy about this film? This is not only a well thought-out "caper movie", but also a touching, small love story; Ustinov and Smith are very persuasive when the two maladjusts fall into love (the whole scene with the card deck is particularly effective.) <br /> <br /> So what do you dislike? Well, the screenplay is not more computer-based than most films (i.e. almost at all), although it quite well reflects the impressions of the late "big iron" business. There are also some minor bugs that you will not notice for the second or third viewing, but I consider them minor injuries. <br /> <br /> As I said, this is a movie worth looking for, and when you see it, you'll want to see it again at regular intervals. <br /> <br />
