Pushing Daisies is just a charming fairy tale with shades of aesthetics and romanticism "Amelie". It has a beautiful palette, well-thought-out and detailed shots, and the names and dialogues are capricious and bizarre to be true, the imagination is magnificent and romantic. on you, because blue can not be found in the rest of sets or shots (with a few exceptions). <br /> <br /> Watch an oddly natural and completely satisfying song that breaks off the stage. > <br /> His score is great, his cast is exceptionally nice, there is great music, and two leading romantic stars can not touch, otherwise he will die. How much sexual tension do you need? (Actually, I regretted that they did not find a way to get around this, but c'est la vie). <br /> <br /> It's just a show that it's nice to spend an hour and recommend it highly. There was no other television similar to this one and I would like to see more. It made me survive one bad week of flu because it is a good company. <br /> <br /> Bring it!
