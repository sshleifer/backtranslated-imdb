I saw this movie a few years ago and I have to say that I really love him. Jason Patric was perfect for the strange role he played. Director? I do not have much about him ... the script is good, that's for sure. In a few words I have to say about this film, which is strange, strange, even dark, but it is good. I saw it a few years ago and I have never seen it since. I want to see it again and again. I know I will not have enough to watch him. Scenes, atmosphere, actors, history ... everything is fine. The film should have been longer. I think 120 minutes should be perfect. I was hoping for the second part of this movie. It did not happen badly. Dandilion Patric: You are a human! very good movie. end. :-)
