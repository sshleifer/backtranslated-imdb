Reese Witherspoon, the first performance on the big screen was unforgettable. It looks like the freshly chipped face of "Tween", light and wiry, but undeniably Reese. <br /> <br /> I always liked her as an actress and I had no idea that she started this young career. Actually, I've gained respect for Reese to know who she is so early. I say this because every time I watched her performances, heroes up to now, in each performance she seemed to have her own personality that lived with this character, quite in fact. <br /> <br /> Anyway, my first film experience with Reese was a parody of Little Red Riding Hood, which Reese did with Kiefer Sutherland, somehow I assumed it was her first time in life "in a bat". No, well done Reese
