I was a kid .. crazy about Michael Jackson. His music, his dance ... He was and is the best of all times. A friend of mine gave me a present a few days ago .. DVD "Moonwalker" .. I just could not believe it! So I devoted my time and watched the movie again. After many years and it kicked me in time. I almost cried. Not because of Michael Jackson, but from the good old days that I remembered when I went to his concerts, enjoying music and dancing. The film gave me a different perspective than when I was a child. You can really see the parody Michael experienced in his life. Thank you, Michael Jackson, to bring me back to this wonderful time, to your wonderful music and dance. It is a pity that people have forgotten about you. I did not do it because you gave me great moments with your music. All the best for you, wherever you are.
