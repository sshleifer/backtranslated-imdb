I loved this movie. you must respect dwarfs who dress up as little Martians. Sure, the story can sometimes be thin, but it can not be rejected. I was 8 years old. I watched it over and over when I was 8 years old. It was a movie for children, and besides, it has some of the best quotes in history. The "Home on the Range" version of Blanzee is amazing. <br /> <br /> very well done if you ask me, 8 out of 10.
