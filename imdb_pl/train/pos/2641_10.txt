Green Eyes is a great movie. In today's context of supporting our soldiers, it is interesting that this film showed the disrespect of the soldiers received from carrying out their duties during this period. Historically, the end of the Vietnam War left us all to remember and learn. Gene was very proud of this movie and he deserved the subtitles he received from writing Green Eyes. I agree, I do not understand why this film is not shown more often or not at all. This film is a kind of film that should be screened on TV every year, just like the Wizard of Oz. The dedication of one man to a missing son is completely moving. I was a friend of Gene Logans and I was proud to know him. Rocky
