The first two-thirds of this biographical Betty Page fetish model are very interesting. Betty, portrayed with immense sincerity by Gretchen Mol, turns out to be a nice type of girl from the neighborhood who did not see anything wrong with what she did (and there was definitely nothing wrong with that). Director Mary Harron, who also performed "I Shot Andy Warhol" and "American Psycho", plays Betty's America, combining old black and white recordings with new, degraded, black and white material. When Betty landed in Florida and started working with Bunny Yeager, the color was introduced. Betty's publicity was mainly the result of her collaboration with Paula and Irving Klaw (Lili Taylor in a great performance and Chris Bauer), as well as John Willie (Jared Harris). The scenes in which Harron recreates Betty's captured photo sessions are fascinating and cleverly performed. Early suppliers of fetish materials are not presented too patronizing and we feel that these people were part of a close "community". Betty has never had a big problem with her fame, although we have the impression that her reputation prevented her from gaining legality in a simple world of acting. Because the third act of the film is practically non-existent, we still have the impression that we were watching a full-length documentary about Betty Page, not an organized drama. Apart from the disadvantages, it is a film worth catching and is another great addition in the cap of producer Christine Vachon.
