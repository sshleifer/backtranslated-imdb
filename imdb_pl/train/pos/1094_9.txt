This is one of the few comedies I can watch again and again and still laugh. In other places I read complaints about racism and sexism from saints, politically correct rogues. There is not one here, unless you define sexism as a woman as a housewife and racism as a family employing a colorful maid. <br /> <br /> The lines are fun and all the tips have never been better. Melvin Douglas is especially brilliant. <br /> <br /> If you've ever thought or tried to build a new home, you will feel relieved knowing that no matter how annoying this process is, no matter how much the wolf is a wolf you can feel, you are not alone!
