For the Danish film, I have to say that it is a very good movie. <br /> <br /> It's a class in itself, but it has international potential. <br /> <br /> The movie has a big budget and plays with famous Danish actors and some newcomers who play very well. It can be watched by anyone who likes adventures and some "ghosts" movie. <br /> <br /> Do not be afraid, be delighted!
