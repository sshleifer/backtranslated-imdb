There are two things that I like in Elvira, and both are bigger than she and keep them covered: her wit and talent. The film is the best thing to show how fun it can be or how it pays attention. It looks like a combined clone of Morticia Adams and Anna Nicole Smith, he inherits the property of a distant relative to discover that he is the heiress of occultism. The comedy in this movie is the best thing, but it could have been a lot more frightening and chilling in your veins. It is mainly a camping event with so many bad references to horrors, like a rebellious mob or a fleeing heroine who stumbles and stumbles on his heels. My favorite part is that she uses her wonderful equipment to break the chains that keep her in the graveyard. The ending is sweetly sweet, as if written by Bradys, but the Las Vegas act at the end seems too great for this type of film.
