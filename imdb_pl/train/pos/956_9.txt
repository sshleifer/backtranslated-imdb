A simple hand-held camera gives some of this documentary feel and also refers to dogmatic movies. <br /> <br /> Have you ever got bored of this Hollywood movie of policemen with robust guys who get James Bond's job jealous? Are you fed up with a married policeman, a divorced but family man, a personalized donut and a hard hunter? Have you ever wondered what the real police job looks like? <br /> <br /> Well, this movie is showing in Germany. Located north of western Germany and eastern Germany, the former East Germany, a dismissed postal clerk begins work, freshly after policeschool. He quickly finds his way to ordinary clients and gets used to life as a policewoman ... but it is not too funny. <br /> <br /> Other German crime movies, such as Derrick, Der Alte et cetera, have distinguished officers to talk calmly with suspects. These cops are dealing here with the lowest on the social ladder. Good dialogue and realism make it an interesting sight, even if you know this part of Germany a bit.
