After reading a few other comments I was expecting something really terrible, but I was pleasantly surprised. REALITY CHECK: The original series was not very good. I think that some people remember it with more affection than it deserved, but in addition to car chases and legs Daisy Duke scenarios were weak and badly working. The boys from Duke were too smart and smart to sneak in the woods, the shrunken Boss's Staff was too stupid to be bad, and Rosco was just hyperactive on every screen. It's amazing that the series lasted as long as it was because there were no feature lines during the first series. <br /> <br /> Return to the movie. If you are watching this movie alone, not as a direct comparison with what you remember from the TV series, it is not bad at all. The real star is of course General Lee. Car chases and acrobatics are excellent and this is what D.O.H. the point is. Johnny Knoxville is his usual eccentric "me" and together with Seann William Scott as Cousin Bo makes this movie really fun in a fun way the TV series has never been achieved. The charming Jessica Simpson is inspired like Miss Daisy, Burt Reynolds creates a much improved Boss Hog and M.C. Gainey really does nasty Rosco P. Coltrane, as he always should be. <br /> <br /> If you do not like slapstick humor and crazy car tricks, you still do not watch this movie, because you should know what to expect. Otherwise, if you want a fun car action movie with some good laughs that are not too burdensome for your brain, go and see how pleasant it is with an open mind.
