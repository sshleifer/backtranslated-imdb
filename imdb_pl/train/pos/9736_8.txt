Pegg has had several hits in the last few years, starting with "Shaun Of The Dead" in 2004, and ending with "Hot Fuzz 2007", in early 2008 released "Run Fat Boy Run", and now comes "How to lose friends and offend people, "which is in many respects one of my favorite comedies of the year. <br /> <br /> The film is about Sidney Yound, a man who writes an unsuccessful magazine that pokes fun at the stars. because he is not one of them. In any case, one of the most successful magazine owners (Played By Jeff Bridges) invites him (except nostalgia) to work in his magazine. Sidney is of course excited and moves to America, where he meets a girl who is currently writing a book, and cheerfulness is born. <br /> <br /> This movie is great and I hope that more will be released in the near future. Pegg once again gave people a good movie everywhere and I am looking forward to the third part of the trilogy on Paul's blood and ice. I Rate this movie 81%.
