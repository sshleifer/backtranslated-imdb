John Thaw, from the renown of Inspector Morse, plays old Tom Oakley in this film. Tom lives in a small English village in 1939 and at the beginning of the Second World War. A hermit, Tom had not yet recovered from the death of his wife and son when he served during the First World War. If you can imagine that Inspector Morse was old and retired, two times more derisive than when he was a policeman, you have the character of Tom Oakley. <br /> <br /> However, the heart of the flint will dissolve soon. Children from London are evacuated from lightning attacks. Young William (Willie) Buk is woven into the protester Tom. Willie is well-played by Nick Robinson. <br /> <br /> This boy needs care from the big C. Behind him at school, still wet and unable to read is the smallest of his problems. He comes from a terrifying background in London, with his mother who can not deal with it, to put it mildly. <br /> <br /> Slowly but steadily, man and boy warm up. Tom discovers his ability to love and care again. And the boy learns to accept this love and care. See how Tom and Willie build a shelter at the end of the garden. See Willie's joy from what is probably his first birthday party that Tom threw out. <br /> <br /> Do not give away the tip, but Willie is adopted by Tom after many struggles, and the couple begins a new life much richer for their mutual love. <br /> <br /> In this film, Thaw and Robinson follow a long line of films in which a man meets a boy and develops mutual love. See the late Dirk Bogarde and Jon Whiteley in "Spanish Gardener". Or Clark Gable and Carlo Angeletti in "It Started in Naples". Or Robert Ulrich and Kenny Vadas in "Captains Courageous". Or Mel Gibson and Nick Stahl in "Man Without a Face." <br /> <br /> Two interesting places. This is the only appearance of a thaw, about which I know where he is singing. Only the verse of the hymn, New Jerusalem, but he sings. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the young Robinson also played in the second film with "Tom" in the title "Tom's Midnight Garden", which is based on a classic novel for children.
