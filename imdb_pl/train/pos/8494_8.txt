I saw this movie again as a task for my management class. We mainly commented on different management styles and ideas about quality (product). I rented it in the eighties and I remember that it was a good (but not great) movie. I've always liked style and delivery of Michael Keaton. It was perfectly suited to the film. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised to see the low ratings of this movie. I give you this, he is not an Oscar winner, but he has a decent comedic value. It's a more subtle comedy than the ubiquitous comedy farce. I also find those who thought it was an inaccurate film about cultural and business differences. I beg to differ. Again I admit that there is a lot of general information and dramatization, but then again it's a Hollywood movie, not a documentary. From what I read about the differences between car manufacturers on both sides of the Pacific at the time, many basic ideas were accurate on time. <br /> <br /> Some of the basic differences were that Japanese employees felt as part of the company as a whole. Team work was emphasized. Perhaps they made the company above all else. Where US employees had more leadership than the type of work. The unit was more important than the company. I will probably get some hate for this comment. I'm sure. <br /> <br /> Another difference was how you viewed the quality and what you were asked for. In many Japanese factories, defects or problems are investigated and repaired when they are detected. Rather, as one character in the movie says it's a "dealership problem (car dealers)". <br /> <br /> Many of these things are probably outdated, but I'm sure some are still around so many American cars manufacturers are still struggling to keep pace with the Japanese. If you are more interested in the subject of American, European and Japanese car manufacturers, I can recommend a book that explores this topic in more detail and was done in the same period. The book is called "A Machine That Changed the World" by James Womack, Daniel Jones and Daniel Roose. It's about researching car makers during and before the period that this movie covers. The parts are a bit dry, but I think you'll also find that the film is also very supportive.
