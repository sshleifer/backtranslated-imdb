"Convicts" is a very third film. The whole dialogue and interaction of the character that takes place in it arises from the long end of the late southern day. And, hence, the life of the main character, Solla (Robert Duvall). <br /> <br /> This is the first collaboration of director Peter Masterson and writer Horton Foote. Six years earlier, they worked together on the film "The Trip to Bountiful", which seems almost full of action compared to that. Masterson is not necessarily a good director. In fact, he is barely enough. The slow pace leaves a lot of space for the operator, Toyomichi Kurita, who gives the film the right feel for soft light and warmth. <br /> <br /> Because it is basically filmed art, with a slight hindrance to editorial or director's efficiency, it all comes down to acting. As for me, there are no disadvantages here. Robert Duvall and James Earl Jones, two of the best American actors (both born in January 1931), They make characters completely real, not interested in anything other than life. Lukas Haas, a young actor whom I knew from the "Testament" and "Witness", plays a character very similar to his other early roles. He is somehow quiet, withdrawn, a bit scared and sad. These are the features that seem natural to him. <br /> <br /> Perhaps a title like "Convicts" is a disadvantage of this movie. This title, together with the opening scene, seems to create a picture of a much more balanced western image. If you are not interested in slow stage productions, you also want to transfer them. Otherwise it can be exactly the movie you would like to do more often. <br /> <br /> Enjoy.
