I once lived with a roommate who tried to commit suicide, and our apartment was in a building where you could get fifty dollars for noise for sneezing after midnight - so, of course, I can easily refer to Polanski's "Tenant." <br /> <br /> But I also like this movie for other reasons. I'm not sure if it works, in general - the descent of Pola≈Ñski's hero in paranoia and madness, which takes about half an hour, seems rather shocking and bizarre. Ebert, for example, was completely unconvinced, and he hit the movie with a furious, one-star review. But I think that the individual scenes and moments work beautifully, so even if I do not fully understand the whole movie - what, for example, is dealing with Egyptology? - I still have a general positive impression. <br /> <br /> I love an unbearable friend, like Bernard Fresson. God, how many times have I decided on such stupid friends and not on any friends! I love the cinema scene - the funniest moment to "invent" in the history of the film. And boy, do I love Isabelle Adjani - she is so foxy in this movie, it's almost unbelievable. And as always gives a great performance. <br /> <br /> Polanski is also a good actor; I do not agree with occasional disrespectful comments about his performance here. His character is supposed to be low and thoughtful, so his low performance fits. I, for example, found him very compassionate - though he lost me a bit when he started to get dressed in fuel for no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie is unclear. And slowly. But it captures the features of alienation of the apartment - something that I have done too much - so give it a copy. The funny thing is that everything you need is a common point of reference and suddenly such a bizarre movie becomes very important! It's definitely worth picking up pocket money on DVD.
