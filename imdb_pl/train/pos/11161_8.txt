It's a very funny movie! I have no idea if it translates well into other languages ​​or not. However, I believe that people all over the world can identify with "Frank" and his thoughts to some extent! These thoughts are extremely funny and women will love this movie! <br /> <br /> All cast members are doing well, and this movie could have been a huge hit all over the world if it were made in England or the USA. But for those who are lucky enough to understand Swedish, you are having a good time! <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it.
