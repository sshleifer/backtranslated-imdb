I have not read the novel, although I understand that it is a bit different; the fact that I liked it, combined with the fact that it really is not my genre, leads me to decide not to continue reading the book. Without reading a single word from Austen's magazine, I can not compare it with any of her works. I can say that almost every line of dialogue is clever, witty and well done, as well as the largest source of comedy. It made me laugh a lot, with excellent British and verbal material. Every act is on site, and Paltrow takes on the role of a matchmaker. Characters are well-written, reliable and consistent. However, a few of them were very annoying, and although I think that at least some of them were to be fun, it was often repeated and to be honest, it was not fun when they appeared. Editing and photos are wonderful, and everything looks great. The plot and tempo are great, you never get bored. It ends in a * really * obvious way, but maybe that's what the audience prefer. I can not claim that it did not amuse me from the beginning to the end, and I will watch it again. There is a short language in this. I recommend this to every fan of romances. 7/10
