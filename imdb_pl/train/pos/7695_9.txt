Good Times is a groundbreaking comedy about the first black nuclear family living in Chicago projects. Regardless of whether you live in the city centers, ghettos, in the suburbs, or in the countryside, this show is still a treasure to watch and observe a family that is only a family, not a show about a poor black family. But they do not think about it. They find humor and have strong family and moral values. Despite the story behind the scenes, this program was worth keeping in the air, except that I did not like the fact that they killed my father, which I agreed with Esther Rolle, who fought to keep the family together. But despite all the fighting behind the scenes, the Good Times was a show about the family. We all loved JJ's dynamite and his antics. We've seen how Penny Janet Jackson grows up a bit. This program was a breakthrough to show despair in drugs, gangs and alcoholism. Without being preachers, Evans always tried to do the right thing, instead of doing something wrong to get out of the ghetto.
