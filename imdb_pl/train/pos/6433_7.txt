Several posters quoted Renoir expressing the desire to make a film in which Ingrid Bergman smiles at the camera. The short answer is: are we all, while the harsh reality is that only a few can not do it. At this stage of his career, Bergman could not be arrested; in 1949 she left Hollywood to take a picture in Europe, she was the director of Roberto Rossellini and she never expected. After five turkeys in Italy, she was probably ready to open the vein, but within a year, after doing so for Renoir, she returned to where she belonged and with Oscar to get to Anastasia. This is one of the three films that Renoir has done in color at the time and in total is better than The Golden Coach, which is not difficult, or even the French Can Can. Renoir probably guessed that thanks to such an effort, Bergman could escape with some of the wooden front men, and Renoir chose two doo-carts in Jean Marais and Mel Ferrer, in both cases solid mahogany. The plot is based on a real incident in the history of France, but Renoir is content to give it a light character and focus on reproducing his father's images in settings after setting. In pastel colors it resembles another film from the Les Grandes Manouvres period, which is not bad. In total, it remains a pleasant trifle presenting a beautiful and charismatic actress.
