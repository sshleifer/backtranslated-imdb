I like the movie. Twisted Desire had Jeremy Jordan, one of my favorite and one of the sweetest actors in history. Melissa Joan Hart is a good actress. I've seen most of her films, but all of Jeremy Jordan's films. What I do not like about Twisted Desire is that "Nick" is arrested and "Jennifer" spoils him. Twisted Desire is my second favorite movie. My first is The Goonies. But I still love Jeremy Jordan.
