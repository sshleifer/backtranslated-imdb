For 60 years I have learned that when we watch a movie, we have to identify (whether we like it or not) with a specific character. <br /> <br /> Sometimes because a character performs a certain gesture, sometimes because the character says a certain word or sentence? which we use or which we would like to use? in a specific situation. <br /> <br /> This movie should be seen from this point of view. Who now finds a parking space? in a shopping center, in the city center or on the street - taken by a car whose driver can not remember that he is not the only driver in the world? <br /> <br /> Who does not want the "gum" badly raised spat? <br /> <br /> Przysta≈Ñ said that I asked: - Did you identify with DELLA (played by Kim Bassinger)? If the answer is: YES, try not to find absurd details? compared to the reality of life? in the movie, because you will definitely find this movie absurd. <br /> <br /> Taken abstractions, you'll see that the movie has moments of surprise, such as: 1- In the order in which Della grabs a box of tools in the trunk (does this box contain a pistol and does he have the courage to use it? ); 2- In the order in which Terry dies during a fall; 3- In the sequence in which Della is attracted by Chucki's "siren". <br /> <br /> If you have seen a movie or are planning to see, remember that there are "realistic" films, "fictional", "political" films and films that can "wash your soul"? To illustrate the last one, we can quote "Tropa de Elite". <br /> <br /> According to the newspapers, the BOPE fighters took certain positions. (As I saw the movie on DVD, I could not determine the reaction of the audience) ?? <br /> <br /> When it comes to directing (Susan Monford), interpretations (Kim Bassinger, Lukas Haas, Craig Scheffer, etc. Edition (William M. Anderson "Dead Poets Society", "The Green Card"? The unique edition, "Robocop 2", etc. It is well positioned in the context, in scale 1 (Terrible) to 10 (Master Piece), I rate "When She Was Out" at 7 (Regular).
