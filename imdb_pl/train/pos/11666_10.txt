MYSTERY KELLS can be the greatest movie I've seen since TRIPLETS OF BELLEVILLE. Although stylistically very different, KELLS shares with TRIPLETS and (the stunning opening 2D sequence) KUNG FU PANDA, an amazing direction of art, production design, background / layout and richness of colors that are a feast for the senses. KELLS is so rich - almost gothic in its layout (reminiscent of Klimt), wonderfully flat in the general general perspective, decorative in Celtic and illuminated design, but the characters are so simple and appealing - and everything works beautifully. You will fall in love with heroes from the moment you meet them. You are so drawn by every detail of history and by every stroke of a pencil and brush. What Tomm, Nora, Ross, Paul and everyone at Cartoon Saloon (and their extended teams) have achieved thanks to this small budget / VERY small crew movie is absolutely amazing. The huge support among our animator community is phenomenal. This movie is breathtaking, and the noise among our colleagues recommending this movie is spreading like a fire. Congratulations to KELLS because of many awards, Anna's nomination and the current Oscar qualifying run. They are all very well-deserved nods, really ...
