McConaughey in horror / thriller? I had to see it. I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> The story has been told in flashback mode and concerns an otherwise normal and happy family consisting of three bizarre situations. I'm sorry, I can not say anything more without spoiling the whole movie. Just know that if you decide to watch it, you will be surprised at least. <br /> <br /> All the main players are very good. Bill Paxton has done a great job of guiding these children, and his acting is amazing. Acting McConaughey is solid and fits the bill perfectly. <br /> <br /> This movie is a challenge to think. Is Dad crazy? Is God? Are there demons? How far would you go to fix the evil. And what is "right"? I still think. <br /> <br /> And that's why I recommend "Frailty". 7/10 and this is one of those movies that deserve a reward for a second or even third look.
