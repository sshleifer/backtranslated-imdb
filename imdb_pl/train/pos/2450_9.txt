I have watched this program since I was 14 years old and since then I love it. I love this program because it's just fun! You'll love this show because it shows something new and more fun, and my favorite part is that Benny always has his last comments about George after each coup about his thick giant head. with my friends at home it would be like watching a funny movie, but short. I love George Lopez. Fun, talented, funny, spectacular. This is a comedy series fun to the whole family, which will certainly appeal to everyone - I did it! And if you have not seen it yet, I suggest you start watching because you would not want to stop watching it. Although there are no more new episodes, I'm still happy about the replays. Still funny. She never wears. <br /> <br /> 9/10
