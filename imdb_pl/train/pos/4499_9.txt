This thrilling story of intergenerational love, jealousy and revenge was even more enjoyable when she was watched on DVD a few years after her PBS broadcast, with a sharper picture and clearer sound. My only caveat is that the plot has some unbelievable moments and that some of Manchester's stronger touches are sometimes difficult. Fortunately, even the lack of words here and there will not spoil the fun: the main actors are perfectly manned. Robson Green brings an enigmatic smile, reflexive temperament and athletic physicality to the role of a young surgeon who hopelessly falls for the wife of his boss in the hospital where he just started working. Francesca Annis is one of the most striking women of 50s imaginable; her acting competes with her beauty. (Love scenes between these two characters better than words show how little difference in age matters to them!) Each of the background characters is sharply drawn and perfectly portrayed. The combination of a distinctive dialogue and passionate excess makes it a charming miniseries. As Russell Baker notes in the introduction, you may not be morally improved by watching "Reckless" - but you will have a lot of fun. (Sequel, part of a set of DVD boxes, provides a wild but satisfying two-hour conversation, you will not want to miss it if you liked what it was before).
