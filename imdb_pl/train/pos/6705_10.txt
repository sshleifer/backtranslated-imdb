And it's not because from her days in "Clarissa Explains It All" I fell in love with Melissa Joan Hart, who at that time was already popular at the age of 20, but she was still able to play the role of teenage girls. "Sabrina, the Teenage Witch" was another great leap from Hart after her "Clarissa". Based on Sabrina Spellman's comic book - you guessed it! - a teenage witch who tries to balance his spell antics with the requirements of everyday teenagers' lives. Her two aunts and a smart black cat, who goes from high school, to college and finally to a journalistic career, help her. <br /> <br /> As usual, Hart is a serial heart soul. "Sabrina, a teenage witch" is quite moving and very funny, and it's a pity that it took me so long to realize how wonderful it was. I just wish there were some newer episodes that we could all enjoy. <br /> <br /> 10/10
