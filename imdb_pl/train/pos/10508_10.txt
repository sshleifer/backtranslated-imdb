Mario is invited to Princess Peach's castle for cake. When Mario gets there, he learns that Bowser kidnapped her! Mario must save the day again. Unlike 2D games, Mario can discover everything he wants. He can simply wander, climb trees, look for 1-Ups, find secrets at levels and more. You can spend four hours on one level. No time limits. There are 16 worlds with many stages, and there are also doors with stars, which require a certain number of stars to enter. After entering these stellar doors, you have to go through the stage and fight with Bowser at the end of the stage. To get to certain worlds, you need a few stars to get there. You are entering the world by going through the picture. There are so many things to do and many hours of gameplay, I do not see how anyone could dislike this game. Great. This starting title is a game that assured players that N64 will have a good life. Every three-dimensional platform game we know about has something to do with SM64. Banjo Kazooie and Banjo Tooie are examples that are widely used. Super Mario 64 is one of the best games in the history of 3D games. 10 out of 10. If you have N64, buy this game. It is difficult to find a used one because nobody sells this child for 5 bucks in a pawnshop. Excellent 10.
