I saw this movie at a college movie festival in the seventies - I waited for this movie to come out on video (it's finally outside). It was produced in Brazil, so I assumed that's why it has not yet reached the video. I've been checking video stores for 15 years, waiting for this unique movie to come out! This is one of my favorite of all time - but be careful, it's weird, like the weird Werner Herzog - his eccentricity is due to his superrealism. <br /> <br /> The film is based on a real incident several centuries ago, in pre-colonial times, when Europeans met tribes in the Amazon for the first time. The white man is confused by the wild tribe of cannibals as their enemy, so they intend to kill him. Before they send him, however, they become part of his tribe (their custom). The whole film is like watching a National Geographic documentary which becomes an accepted member of their tribe. this is it! Space plot? No. Intense insight into the diversity of human life? Definitely. <br /> <br /> Oh yes ... be warned ... this movie has a definite nudity - it's not a Hollywood movie about noble savages ... this movie says it was like that (re-read above: National Geographic , superrealism) <br /> <br />
