The early career of Abe Lincoln is beautifully presented by Ford. Not that anyone would ever see material from real Lincoln, but Fonda, dressed in a fake nose, is amazing like Lincoln, with voice, delivery, walking and other manners - just as Lincoln would imagine. Ford, in the first of three consecutive films that he made with Fonda, is at the top of his form, perfectly recalling America from the early nineteenth century. The story focuses on a couple accused of murder, which Lincoln defends, and the scenes in the courtroom are quite well made. The supporting staff includes many regular customers of Ford. This was Alice Brady's last movie because she died a few months after the premiere.
