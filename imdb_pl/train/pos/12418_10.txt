This film and its continuation, Barry McKenzie, are his own, the two biggest comedies ever made. A great story that a young Australian comes to England to apply for his legacy and meets with friends who are just as nice and innocent as he is. <br /> <br /> where else could you find someone who needs a drink so bad that he is as dry as a dead dinger? great characters, the best acting game, and she has great sheilas and more Fosters consumption than the other three combined films. On the highest level. <br /> <br /> And some of the funniest songs you'll ever hear and full of great stars. Definitely my two favorite movies of all time, I watch them at least once every two weeks.
