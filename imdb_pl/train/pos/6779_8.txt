George Cukor directs a deliberate and cynical classic. The iconic Ronald Coleman is in the best form in this Noir song about an actor who loses his roles. Recognized Anthony John (Colman) drove his wife Brita (Signe Hasso) with her strong temperament and inconsistent behavior. But the two manage to continue cooperation to please the audience. Everything begins to change when John begins to get bored with his career; reluctantly agrees to play in Othello. He delves into the figure of a jealous and murderous man. He begins to walk a thin line between illusion and reality and ends up confusing his role with his own life and ultimately kills his lover (Shelley Winters), but does not remember the wretched deed. <br /> <br /> Colman seems flawless in this role. Winters makes a big impression when a young woman decides to escape from a miserable life. Also in the cast: Edmond O'Brien, Ray Collins, Joe Sawyer and Whit Bissell.
