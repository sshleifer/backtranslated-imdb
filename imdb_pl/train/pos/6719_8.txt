I like this film because it is a great work of cinema, created by people who care about it being a work of art, not just home movies. It is filled with home movies, the Super-surfer Gregory Nolla and the load of an amateur film from others who match his 50-year passion. Nevertheless, it has been expanded to the point that it is approaching the aesthetic glory. It is full of artistic talent and sporting talent, however trivial one might think that surfing is athletic. Surfers are not astronauts or test pilots. Nor are they surgeons (maybe) or Ph.d (maybe). He believes in the search for a surfer. He believes in the beauty of human folly. He believes in the great gift of peace that comes from the end of the war. Surfers are celebrating the end of the war on the northern beach of a Hawaiian island attacked by Japanese zeros fifteen years earlier. In this way, he watches the time of a country that fought against the cold war - instead of a hot war - with the Russian socialists. Surfing is the highest narcissism. It's dangerous, but only a little bit historical. I suspect that Alexander the Great will not be celebrated for his surfing technique. He had to go out and conquer several dozen countries to receive the favorable press he received. This film has no military heroes. There is no weapon. The only beach surfers have a beer stand and a surf shop. It is not a problem. The room is not desperate. It's a joy to exhale.
