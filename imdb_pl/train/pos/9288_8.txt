It turned out to be a surprisingly light touch in the film about the clash of cultures from the 1950s. John Wayne would certainly not be the first choice as a cultural attache, being as diplomatic with his good intentions as the bull in Harrods. But this time he had to play a part that was much more passive than his usual bluff personality, and he did his job with style. The prince was a guy who really could work well. His facial expressions and body language can be extremely subtle. <br /> <br /> Despite the significant presence both as an actor and time on the screen, he did not dominate this film. Many of his good intentions were effective. He had power over anyone, and the interrupted narrative was assured by the titular geisha he was a barbarian. <br /> <br /> The history of the American attempts to exclude the isolationist favors of Japan was a political plot rather than a fight for fights or hell on the skin. I can not comment on the accuracy of his research, but the strangeness of oriental culture towards Western sensitivity has been well demonstrated. There were many meticulously directed ceremonies involving what looked like an authentic costume and props to this observer. The tracks were complex and detailed. Many money and thoughts have been used for this. <br /> <br /> The broken romance between Wayne and his geisha added some extra element and stopped the film from political or waving flags. The script was good without being too verbal. The Japanese dialogue was very large, but long periods of translation did not interfere with the narrative. It was nice to see lots of original oriental objects on set. No matter if they were Japanese, I could not say. But in any case, they looked like a part. At least the lead did not play Caucasian cross-dressing, unlike other efforts such as "Blood Alley" (yes, I know they were Chinese) "The Inn Of The Sixth Happiness" and even "The King And I". /> <br /> To be honest, I liked it more than any other movie. The script was better at the beginning. I never liked songs in "The King And I" and I was not impressed by the heavy anti-communist subtext of Blood Alley. I admit that I have never seen this work before and it turned out that it is very beneficial compared to many of Duke's popular trips. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
