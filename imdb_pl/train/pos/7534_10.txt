I totally disagree with the other reviews. Basically negative. I took a chance in this movie and I was glad I did it. Actually. I could not find anything wrong. Nothing of the period. The script is original. Actors are everything is nice and convincing. Smart reminded me of Marcia Brady from Brady Bunch. But this gal can really work. The setting in the Australian Outback is perfect. Amazing scenery. Great soundtrack, like Paul Kelly. also here. I've seen this movie twice in less than 24 hours. I will probably watch it again. This is very interesting. It makes one think. This is (was) probably better than nine tenth of the so-called Hollywood hits Back Of Beyond is sympathetic. A well photographed movie. I could not find anything wrong with that. Check it out! My first review!
