Many people have a problem with this movie because it seems that the story should be more fun (ignoring it based on a real story) or talking against a movie that glorifies Che (which really does not exist). This film is very close to the final biography of Jon Anderson about Che and is right. Soderburgh does a great job setting the mood for the disintegrating defeat, which was the Bolivian adventure of Che. You really have the impression of complete shyness and bewilderment from the Boliv peasant to the revolutionary ideas of Che or the difficulties faced by his people with hunger and terrain. I'm sorry that I was bored with film fans, but that's exactly what happened. So do not go in this movie, expecting to shoot with Rambo, that's the real story!
