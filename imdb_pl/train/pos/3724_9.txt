Tigerland follows the fate of the newly appointed men to the army, who were called to fight in Vietnam in 1971. <br /> <br /> At this point, America knows that it fights in a lost battle, and the director takes us through a 16-millimeter documentary about the lives of several recruits at the Tigerland training camp in Louisiana. <br /> <br /> The movie is more a study of the characters, there is no real plot, but the focus is on the figure of Roland Boza, who is a steadfast but intelligent man who only wants to escape from the camp. We were picked up by several characters in the unit, waiting for the story to unfold. <br /> <br /> I must say that this is a great story about Vietnam and more importantly about the army in general. and very unforgettable. Also movie and style directors work so well because it looks similar to the old footage that you always see in Vietnam. It's great to see how the movie shows that all conflicts and problems were so important to the problems associated with the fight. A special scene in which Boz leaves the training mission, in which the instructor shows how to use the radio as a tool of torture, in short summarizes everything about the war ... and it is futile. <br /> <br /> Fantastic movie. Not only about us, but about who must decide what is morally right, being "in the army." <br /> <br /> Rating 9 out of 10.
