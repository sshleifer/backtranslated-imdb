Ever since I saw Anchors Aweigh for the first time in 1945, watching it on film is a lot of nostalgia for me. At the age of 15, it was easy for me to get involved in the first of the great MGM Technicolor musicals. Now I am probably the most interested in thinking about the future careers of the leading players. Although Sinatra did some non-significant films shortly after his appearance after Dorsey's days, as a solo singer, it was his first major film performance. As another viewer remarked, it seems to be a warm-up for On the Town. Sinatra had to work hard, but his dance with Kelly is credible, and he will do better in the next pair. However, observing his figure, it's easy to understand why he was caricatured as green beans. Who would have thought that within a decade he would win an academy award for acting and he would play many roles as a tough detective or leader in battle. Although the personality and dance of Gene Kelly dominated the film, his captivating performance did not suggest that he would become the main creative force, an almost iconic figure, for the MGM musicals, where he developed a dance style complementing the style of Fred Astaire. After all, it was strange to see Dana Stockwell's fresh-looking and remember that he would later play a "thriller" in Compulsion, based on Leopold-Loeb's 1920s murder. Additional note: one reviewer praised the performance of Betty Garrett for his interest in Sinatra's love. She later played opposite him in On the Town, but Pamela Britton appeared in this film.
