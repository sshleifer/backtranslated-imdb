"The Ladies Man" is a common problem among films based on "Saturday Night Live" sketches. This means that a sketch that usually goes in five minutes will not produce results in ninety minutes. Although this movie has its own laughs, like Tim Meadows as Leon Phelps, sex-maniac straight from the seventies, and Will Ferrell as husband obsessed with wrestling, which Roger became Leon. So this movie is quite funny, but it's not Wayne's world!
