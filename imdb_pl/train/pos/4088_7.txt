this one is there. Not much to say about this subject, except that it deals with a rarely discussed topic in films about bestiality. I can see why this movie has been banned for so long, the topics discussed in the film are still a bit taboo for most of the world, that eroticism in the film is well-deserved and matches the mood of the movie. It's a good movie that is well-preserved and serves the purpose ... to shock the viewer and cross borders that we often do not see in movies. I came across this movie on the web that I thought I could check. I liked the film because it is provocative and at the same time slightly erotic. Something you can rarely see in movies today.
