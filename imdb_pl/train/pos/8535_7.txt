This job is a bold look at the thinking of men who are in wheelchairs. This film never attempts to tone it, nor do cotton candy, nor a soft soap of anxiety, confusion and pain with what those guys live with. I think that's her strength. <br /> <br /> What's more, the performances are fantastic, with a well thought out and delivered dialogue that attracts and makes you feel part of this experience. The heroes never try to block the audience from knowing what they think - what is in their hearts. <br /> <br /> I found what I liked, but pleasant. <br /> <br /> Ocenia siÄ™ 6,6 / 10 z ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
