Marjorie, a young woman who works in a museum and lives with two roommates, Pat and Terry. One night he gets into the car and is attacked by a masked man with a knife. His plan is to rap her, but she manages to escape. The man has her purse. The police can not help her because the actual rape did not happen. Until one day, when Marjorie's roommates are at work, her assailant comes there. His name is Joe. this man. But then she manages to spray her eyes and mouth with the insect repellent that will kill him if he does not get help soon. It binds him and makes Joe the subject of the same kind of physical and psychological attacks that he Extremities (1986) directed by Robert M. Young. It is based on the controversial off-Broadway play of 1982 by William Mastrosimone. Farrah Fawcett, who unfortunately lost the battle against cancer last year, is great like Marjorie. James Russo, who played the striker in the game, is convincing as Joe.Alfre Woodard and Dia on Scarwid are great as Pat and Terry. James Avery is seen as a Security Guard. She was nominated for the Golden Globe. This is not a movie that has to entertain you. He asks if the question is vengeance justified. This is not the perfect movie, but I recommend it.
