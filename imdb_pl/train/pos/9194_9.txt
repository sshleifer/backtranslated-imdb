I first met with this show when I was in Japan for six months last year. I found it on the Internet when I was looking for subtitled dramas to help me with my Japanese. My host mother warned me to stay away from her because she thought it was weird, but I thought it was great! Koyuki showed such conflicting character traits, and the spirit of Matsujun made my day every time I tuned in! I saw him in "Hana Yori Dango" for the first time, but I like him much better! <br /> <br /> Although the characters are interesting and well-developed, I was disappointed that they did not change much throughout the concert. Their relationship was growing, but not really. Nevertheless, everyone had time to play (even in Fukushima!).
