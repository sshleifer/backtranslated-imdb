Actually, I'm surprised that there were so many comments about this movie. I saw it as part of a Slavic film festival at a large American university. But no one in the US has heard about it, which is a real shame! The dynamics between people makes it both amusing and sad. They stuck together in a long bus trip - somewhere most of us were !! But I've never had such a thing !! <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is the one where they stop at a funeral. Then the man and the woman sneak into Lovemaking in the forest, but everyone follows them to watch without their knowledge! Just as he lifts up his skirt and he walks all the way to it - consumption begins to hack and they realize that everyone is watching! Talk about surprise! But ... you really need to feel them, even if it's fun! When you see the ending, it's ironic that they were having fun when they did! Serbian humor at its best!
