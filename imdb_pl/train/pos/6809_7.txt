It was a good movie. I'm not sure if this is considered a spoiler comment, but I did not want to risk it. In any case, at the end of the movie the prosecutor reads a verse from the Holy Bible, and then quotes another from the memory. I do not remember the first passage that reads, but the second is Genesis 9: 6. He says it is Genesis 9:12, but in fact he quotes verse 6. This is a common passage that many use to defend the death penalty. It is a pity that prosecutors will not dare to quote the Bible today. Has anyone ever heard of John Jay, the first Supreme Court court in the country's history? He said the Bible is the best of all books. It is a pity that we have lost this view in America.
