This is one of those movies / pilots that, if you know BattleStar Galactica, helps, but it is not necessary. What makes this story even more credible than BSG is the fact that in the future it is not something so far away. It has such depth that it is quite amazing that it was not released theatrically. It was not possible to choose better leads in such experienced and talented actors. Eric Stoltz is excellent as a father who will do anything to reunite with his daughter, regardless of whether it is true or not, and he will do it regardless of the cost. Paula Malcomson from the fame of "Deadwood" is just as great as his wife. You are not entirely sure of its motives, whether it is love or money, but that's what makes the pilot even more intriguing. I see a star in the creation of Zoe played by the unknown Alessandra Torresani and her performance. Esai Morales is wonderful in her desire to see her beloved again and how wrong she is, even considering what she wants more than his moral reservations. I did not think it would be a good idea when it was announced, but from the pilot I was delighted to see how we got to BSG stage history. It is great to see Adam as a child already affected and under the influence of various types of robots that are beginning to permeate life at this stage. I just hope that they will be able to follow the stories so that we can learn even more about how they got robots with Humanoid. This is an almost perfect pilot and I hope that they will be able to continue the fantastic story. Even visual effects are better than most of the trash visible on the big screen. If you did not get to BSG, @ try this the least and bet you will become a fan and you will want to see how the history of BSG was created.
