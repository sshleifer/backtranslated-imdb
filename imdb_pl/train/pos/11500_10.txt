If Mulder was looking for his real father here, it's Darren McGavin, the first X Files, it's a pity that it was only one season, because the producers of the show did not know that they had the makings of classic hands and in 1993 Chris Carter came in, what I call the continuation of Night Stalker, The X Files. Both will go to classics, I think, two shows take viewers to the level of experience that appears only once in a while, and who should appear in X Files later, Darren McGavin, as the agent of Arthur Dales helping our favorite hero, are solving matters. Paying tribute to the man who I think so, I did well to Chris Carter, who brought back the forgotten television program in the form of David Duchovny as Darren McGavin, if not to watch X files and this particular program that I would never recognize the Stalker.
