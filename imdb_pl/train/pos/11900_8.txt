Stunningly visually and musically. A feast for the eye and ear. The quintessential Victorian element of the opening sequences was completely charming, helping to create a Christmas scene from which Dickens would be rightly proud. Technically, production is visually stimulating, and special effects are both inventively developed and creatively achieved in traditional scenery. The dance of many leading artists is stunningly good. Photography and lighting are first-class, and the sound recording perfectly suits the general high level of technical skills. A great movie for the whole family during Christmas and the most delightful discovery that will withstand repeated viewing.
