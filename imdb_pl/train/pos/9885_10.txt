Young Erendira and her cross-border grandmother provide a wonderful fantasy from the new world. This interpretation of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, "La incréible y triste historia da la cándida Eréndira, ..." may not rub Marquez purists in the right way, although the story remains intact and still carries with it the whole strength of the work. The strength of this movie is his acting, especially Papas as Grandmother. Marquez fans and Marquez novices will enjoy this movie because of their real witt brand.
