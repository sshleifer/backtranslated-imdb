I would just like to say that it may be biased because I am the producer of this movie. I will, however, retain some sense of dignity. <br /> <br /> The movie star, Oscar Ovies, gives a brilliant performance to Jeff Grinderlin, a nebbish hypochondriac who spends more time worrying than living. He brings a certain character to his character, which really allows the audience to connect with him, often defining his mind and sensing a fierce comedy. His mother, played by Christine Haber, is a fixed support beam that would have crumbled without him. His friends also help Jeff in life, often making choices for him instead of letting him use his free will ... which is often neglected. <br /> <br /> Writing is great, and conversations flow like scenes from Kevin Smith's movie, with half of the smaller Ben Affleck boo-hoo festivals. <br /> <br /> The work of the camera is a bit tacky at some points, and the sound can also use the impulse, but the performances shine with fine details. It is also supported by a beautiful soundtrack with local talents and an exceptional composer. <br /> <br /> All in all it was a treat. A rare gem among many gems.
