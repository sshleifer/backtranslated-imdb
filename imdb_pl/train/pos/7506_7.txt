I'm not going to lie. Although I looked interesting, I watched The Notorious Bettie Page, because I heard (and it was pretty obvious, just looking at the summary or whatever about the movie) that Gretchen Mol got naked in it. I've never been a fan of Mol, but I can not resist seeing an attractive woman take off her clothes. Yes, it can be perverted, but it is a central theme and ideal for the very core of the film, and helps to make a movie much stronger than it should be. <br /> <br /> Bettie Page's (Mol) film chronicles life from her physical and sexually abused days as a child in high school in the south, and her new life in New York. She wants to become an actress, but she also has to pay bills. After taking some seemingly innocent photos on the local beach, Page slowly becomes a sensation of modeling and quickly jumps from suggestive photos to sexually provocative pin-up pictures. <br /> <br /> I feel the shortness of the movie (only over ninety minutes) is both a curse and a blessing for him. On the one hand, the film never exaggerates with satisfaction. You get to know the page in a few short minutes, and then it goes into her modeling career and does not look back. But it also curses the movie, because we never really have the opportunity to understand everything that's going on. She simply jumps between the modeling shoots and the controversy that they form before going into the main investigation of the senate, which takes up most of the final act of the film. You sit there and try to absorb all this, and more comes to you. It seems that the filmmakers wanted to summarize too much material in a too short film. He begs for longer sequences and begs for more for even longer explanations. He does not feel hurried; you just do not feel everything there. <br /> <br /> Another piece of fumble, though a bit more interesting, is the use of color throughout the film. Most are black and white, but often there are spots and color sequences. But although it can be done as a symbolic gesture early, it becomes a bit of a distraction, because it still appears later, before it goes back to black and white. It's getting confused and becomes more boring interference than anything else, because the movie is rolling. <br /> <br /> Although he may argue a bit with the action, the film remains dead in its subjects. A website that I know very little about is not innocent and its world is exactly the same. With the exception of a few suspect characters during her teenage years, everyone she meets is innocent, and everything he does is innocent to him. I never thought that I would look at full nakedness as something that was different than vulgar and depraved, but here is really something to be surprised. At one moment she is beautiful and innocent. Even the most sexually distorted moments in the movie (although tamed compared to today's standards) have an innocent and angelic feeling for them. There is something about the way Mol's naked body is portrayed that hits a different chord than naked bodies in other movies. He feels so natural and so wonderful that if there was any reason to watch a movie, he would see spectacular portraits of Mol's body when he plays Bettie Page. <br /> <br /> Another reason is Mol. As Page is an example that the southern belle of the 1950s knows everyone (or at least they can imagine). Despite his profession, he is still a normal person and is still considered a religious person. Mol plays her exactly the right amount of high purity needed to make this figure feel real since the 1950s. It plays with such kindness that it would be hard for you not to think that Mol was actually Bettie Page herself. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the supporting cast has very little time to shine and is completely eclipsed by the wonderful performance of Mol. None of them does anything particularly pleasant, and none of them has the same strength in their role as Mol. This is not the guilt of the actors, but rather the fact that they have nothing to work with. Many of them are completely recognizable, such as Oscar nominee David Strathairn (a bit too close to one of his better performances), Sarah Paulson (recently nominated for the Golden Globe at Studio 60 on Sunset Strip) and actress Lili Taylor, but it would be difficult really put their show in something other than okay. Neither of these characters is really developed, and they just stand as cut-outs of characters that Mol runs in the loops when he collects a pair in his great performance. <br /> <br /> Really, this movie is worth the role of nudity and perfect performance of Bretie Page by Gretchen Mol. Everything else is a little too confused and uncomfortable than it should be. If more work was done to develop supporting heroes and not just pass the whole story, this movie would be a much better biographical film. In its current form, this is just a tool that makes Mol really become a popular actor in the stratosphere. <br /> <br /> 7/10.
