The only remarkable thing about this movie is that it was Steve McQueen's first big role. <br /> <br /> The talent of McQueen is undeveloped and raw, but refreshingly honest in this camp sci-fi book. Steve turns out to be an anti-establishment actor who loves hot families, which will become a polished icon of the film industry for only five years. <br /> <br /> Later, McQueen would say he hates the movie and it "was a drop". But everyone has to start somewhere, and The Blob is sweet, fresh and innocent. Would we all remain that way. <br /> <br /> The plot is fast and yet predictable, still entertaining. And it's really cool to see Steve McQueen before he became King Koola (and Anita Corsaut, before becoming the girlfriend of Andy Taylor). A close friend sent me a DVD some time ago and this is a valuable addition to my Steve McQueen movie collection.
