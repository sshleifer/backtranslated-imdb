It was a very good historical drama. John Turturro is perfect as a tortured Luzhin genius and shows off maniacal feelings of the character, such as his strange dance. Emily Watson is doing well as a supportive lover Natalia. <br /> <br /> The relationship between chess and close madness is well explored by Gorris and Nabokov's known interests, such as "eternal innocence" (ie "Lolita") are visible in this film. I think I will read the novel now. It was a moving and tragic ending and it was hard to keep a dry eye. A brilliant movie!
