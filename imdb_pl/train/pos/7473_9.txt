Oddly enough, this version of OPEN YOUR EYES is more mature and more polished. Crowe's screenplay, supported in retrospect, is much more tight and more elaborate than the original Amenabara. A Spanish filmmaker should be recognized for having first thought about history, but there is no doubt that Crowe has improved on it - if only slightly. Note that you have no idea what lead he did in OPEN YOUR EYES, but you know almost everything about lead in VANILLA SKY. That's what I mean, saying "more."
