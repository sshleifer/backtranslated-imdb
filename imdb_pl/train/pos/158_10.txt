I've seen this film more than once and always complains about the "obvious construction" of the story. But then - this is part of Petzold's game: he plays according to the rules of the genre. <br /> <br /> It is very nice how the unbelievable story of the meeting of two girls (Timoteo / Hummer) is again reflected in another, even more unlikely story that the girls are catching up with the casting. This film is a journey between fact and fiction, more about potentials, things that may have happened in the past or may happen in the future rather than real actions. It's a dream, something of a sort - so apt that there are many motifs that Freud could find interesting for his analysis of dreams, like all the constellations of the "double." <br /> <br /> I also think that "Gespenster" may be interesting to watch in comparison to the current Asian cinema of amazingness: Petzold's daily urban architecture is also haunted in a discreet, strangely familiar way. This film is not obvious. To describe this as the story of two girls who meet and eventually become friends and lovers, or as the story of an orphan mother who is looking for a Europe in search of a missing daughter, clearly does not say much about the nature of "Gespenster" in general.
