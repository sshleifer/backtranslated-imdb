I know that originally this movie was NOT a box office hit, but in the light of recent Hollywood releases (most of which were decidedly based on formulas, less plotless, aimless, "save-blond-chick-meaningless" as "drivel", Feast of All Saints he certainly deserves a second opinion in this unpleasant context, the film - like the book - loses some anchoring in the historical background, but presents a unique American dilemma against the extremely terrifying American institution of human enslavement and some of its tragic (and funny and moving) consequences. <br /> <br /> And it's worth distinguishing young Robert Ri'chard, cast in the role of the main character, Marcel, whose idealistic enthusiasm is truly universal, when he sets off to the beginning of his "maturation", only to be cruelly disappointed what turns out to be his true education in the world of the southern plan At the peak of the pre-World period, when I saw the announcement with terrified blond Ri'chard, I was expecting a buffoon, a fop, a caricature - I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, late Ben Vereen, Pam Grier, Victoria Rowell and even Jasmine Guy give vivid images and great skills as actors in the background of tapestries, voodoo, Creole "aristocracy" and Haitian revolt woven in the story of human passion, hatred, love, family and racial confusion in a society that has allegedly gone, but is still with us.
