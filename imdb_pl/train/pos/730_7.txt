I liked this movie. I remember that in this movie there was one very well done scene in which Riff Randell (played by PJ Soles) lies in his smoking pot and then starts to imagine that the Ramones are in the room and she sings song "I Want You Around" ... very cool stuff. <br /> <br /> It was fun, energetic, bizarre and good. Yes, I admit that the ending is far up and far-reaching ... but it does not matter, because it's fun, it's a very nice movie. To Sex, Pot and Rock n Rocll forever <br /> <br /> I have read that Cheap Trick was the band that originally appeared in this movie. But I do not know if it's true or not
