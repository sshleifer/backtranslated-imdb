It is a charming parody and horror with Cassandra Peterson aka Elvira: Mistress of the Dark, the most infamous horror housekeeper of all time. It was supposed to be a pilot vehicle for Elvira and it was so successful that it was picked up by the NBC network. They filmed a pilot for the TV series to present busty babes in black, but unfortunately sit-com never crossed the pilot stage because of his sexual references. This film, however, is very funny. Elvira is contemporary Chesty Morgan and queen of single-layers. After this film, a few years later, the grim movie "Elvira's Haunted Hills" appeared, which was supposed to be the departure of Roger Corman's old films, but falls on his face. Watch this movie to get a lot more excitement!
