I think "Blackadder the Third" is the best in the series. <br /> <br /> All episodes are fun, I personally like the episode with the "French invasion", but the one with the superstitious actors in 'MACBETH' is also really funny, the way the Rowan is still playing with them is really ( English) Humor at the highest level. <br /> <br /> Play; Blackadder: Oh, so you want me to say Scottish Play? Actors: YES Blackadder: Instead of MACBETH ...! <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of Rowan and I have most of his work, but I think he made the Blackadder series especially well. <Br> I hope the Rowan will continue his great style, but I think we can count on him because he is already working on the Bean 2 movie, which will be released this year, I can not wait. ... <br /> <br /> I will give this third viper 9 out of 10 ratings.
