I admit that I create great expectations before watching, because some friends have mentioned it (and they are not pervs!), How to see. And that's a must see! Just do not expect to see something explosive. <br /> <br /> Freudian psychoanalysis is interesting in many parts of the movie, but it's just too much perversion and does not stop at the end. <br /> <br /> Some of the good things are Blue Kie≈õlowski's analysis, most of David Lynch, some of Hitchcock and maybe a few that I missed (I just reminded ... Dogville), and I usually do not miss things, I think that they are too obvious or loose in the air. <br /> <br /> Besides being repetitive, which makes it too long, the document is pleasant in the sense that it perceives some perversions fed by our unconsciousness, hence the commercial success most of the thrillers studied and used as the basis of this theory . <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the energetic tone of Zizek's narrative and efforts to revive Freud's theory that was too numb, especially in North America. Again, this is the top and I think it is not a complete waste of time because I believe most people have dark recognition of death and blood.
