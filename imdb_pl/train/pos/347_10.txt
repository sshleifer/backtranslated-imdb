Valentine is now one of my favorite Slasher films. Death scenes are sophisticated and most actors are good. Marley Shelton did a great job as a leader (much better than Jennifer Love Hewitt in "I Know ..." films). David Boreanaz, who is the main reason I saw the movie, had a small role, but he played well. The exception to the list of good actors is Denise Richards. She was terrible. The only scene in which I was glad when I saw her was * SPOILER * her death scene. All in all, it's a good movie to watch. Surely, you should watch it before watching "Scream" or "I know ..." again.
