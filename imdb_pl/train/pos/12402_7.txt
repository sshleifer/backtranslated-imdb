**Warning! Spoilers in advance! Because we already know this story, the plot itself is not a surprise; and short is not as much fun as information. But this is how it is presented as a file in historical archives. Graphics are better than average, and generally cold colors help in short. <br /> <br /> Some problems. The violence of the story is somewhat unjustified and, combined with the sporadic dose of political correctness (the UN scene), it reduces the simple short narrative. Besides, you have to see it when the second part is complete. <br /> <br /> The Animatrix concept is brilliant and despite several problems, this short one still fulfills its task. It would not fit in the original movie in style, content or flow. This is an excellent method for revealing history. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Good information. I could say a little better, but still a solid 7 out of 10.
