"Pandora's Clock" is a thrilling suspense / thriller, which is a cross between the movie about viruses and catastrophic film. This film, which was broadcast in two parts on the NBC channel in the debut shown in 1996, concerns the flight of an aircraft, which is infected with a virus when one of the passengers simply bears this disease. The US government is debating whether the plane should be destroyed or not, while the pilot (Richard Dean Anderson) and the virus expert (Daphne Zuniga) are trying to come up with something to avoid a catastrophe. I'm not a big fan of TV and miniseries, but I liked the "Pandora's Clock". It's one piece of thrill. Jane Leeves (television "Frasier"), Robert Loggia and Edward Herrmann (as president) also play in it. <br /> <br /> *** (out of four)
