"A really nice story with a moral about brotherly love" describes this strange movie by David Lynch. This was especially "strange" because it was not the movie that Lynch had published in the last 15-20 years. They were dark and shocking films (Blue Velvet, Wild At Heart, Mulholland Drive) and the opposite is true. I know that many of his fans have been disappointed. Others were delighted with this. Count me as one of the latter, and I am the owner of all three of these "dark" films. <br /> <br /> It was another alleged real life story describing the journey of an elderly man sitting a mower from Western Iowa to Wisconsin to see his sick brother whom he had not spoken to for years, but wants to see before the latter dies . Well, I think this premise - an old man running a mower 400 miles - still makes it a "weird" movie, so Lynch stays like that! <br /> <br /> Richard Farnsworth plays the title role. He is the type of a guy, a wise, wise voice, with a low key personality that almost everyone likes. The wrinkles on his face tell a lot of stories. It was so sad to hear what happened to him in real life a year after this movie was released. <br /> <br /> The first 25 minutes of this movie are not very much and it is not always pleasant, because it shows the main character of an adult and a mentally challenged (Sissy Spacek) and her tragic past, but when Alvin Straight (Farnsworth) begins her journey history is rising. I played for a few friends and thought that the film NEVER picked up, but I'm more generous. I think it's a hidden gem. For them it was a sleeping pill. <br /> <br /> I think that his journey is very fascinating, but you have to realize in advance that it will not be an embarrassing crime of Lynch. It's slow, and if it's okay, you can like it. The charm appears in the image of some people Alvin meets along the way, such as a recalcitrant young girl escaping and some nice townspeople who help the old man get out of trouble. (Henry Cada as "Daniel Riordan, is unique in this respect." Harry Dean Stanton gets a third settlement, but it's a joke: it's only in the last few minutes of the movie! <br /> <br /> Iowa Scenery It's nice, I live there by a few years and I can testify in the hills and rich soil, it is a nice state with nice people ... like this movie.
