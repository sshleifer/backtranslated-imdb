This is the second movie based on the life and times of ultra hung porn star, John Curtis Estes, better known as John Holmes. Boogie Nights is also approximately based on his life. Maybe someday someone will make a movie about the life of Tommy Byron. <br /> <br /> The problem is that history is not well told. There are many episodes of Law & Order that have more twists and turns than Wonderland, and the director never does a crime with any enthusiasm. Val Kilmer has two problems - he is not as much suspended as Holmes (and this time he has no prosthesis, unlike Boogie Nights), and is much better than mope Holmes. <br /> <br /> The director does not present one nice man among the cast. The racist, immature halfling he meets, or his wife, and the police do not have much to characterize. <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie is Eric Bogosian, who tells Paris Hilton to "get lost". <br /> <br /> Having said all this, anyone who is interested in the ugliest part of the porn industry in the 1980s or a real crime should not miss it.
