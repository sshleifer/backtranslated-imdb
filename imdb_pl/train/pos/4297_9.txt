Every now and then, the filmmaker creates a unique group of people and lets you see things that make us human. Lawrence Kasden did it again. I always felt that BB Cill was the hymn of this century and he managed to do it again in the Grand Canyon. Every now and then we are at the point where we have the opportunity to choose life and we blow it up so often. It is a film about people who have the courage to choose and experience life thanks to this choice. The juxtaposition of small and large events that allows us to see how basically trivial most of the things that we worry about is really brilliant. I have watched this movie many times and I am very surprised how deep the emotions of this movie are. Danny Glover and Kevin Kline perform their roles with great tenderness, and the portrait of director Stever Martins is priceless. Thank you again, Mr Kasden
