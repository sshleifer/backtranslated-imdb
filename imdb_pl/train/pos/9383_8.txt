From the director of the films "Last Seduction" and "Kill me again" another noir style movie appears. John Dahl created a niche for himself, making films about adultery, blackmail in the early 90's. Although I did not have much opinion about the last seduction. But now Mr Dahl is resorting to television programs. It's a pity, because this man had talent. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS ** This is quite an impressive movie that revolves around the spear. to the city of Wyoming for work. He fails, however, and the owner of the J.T Walsh bar is confused with the Texas smash. He receives the task of killing his wife (Boyle). But Cage decides to share after downloading in advance without doing so. On the way out of the city accidentally goes a guy on the road, who then takes him to a local hospital. At this point, Cage accidentally meets Walsh, who also appears to be the local sheriff. After this Cage escapes from his claws, but meets the real attacker, who is Dennis Hopper. <br /> <br /> John Dahl is the co-author and director of this film. Therefore, it turns out that the project can be decent when the director puts his thoughts on the screen. The direction is good, but while watching the movie I have the impression that I feel like in the TV. There were too many closed frames. However, this does not stop the film from happening. The film had a good pace and the structure was perfect. Dahl wrote the script with a good duration. <br /> <br /> Cage presented the role of drifter realistically, although for me his performance seemed a bit restrained. His facial expressions were clear. Lara Flynn Boyle was hot and fared well as a femme fatale. Her hairstyle was far away and could make every guy fall on his knees. Hopper played his role well. But it seems to me that he was unsuccessful in this role. He did not convince me that he had the characteristics of a man striking. The role has not been recorded for his personality. <br /> <br /> While watching, you will receive deja vu from previous films such as "The Hot Spot" and "A Perfect Murder". Due to the fact that some charts are similar. In general, if you're a noir movie fan, this one is for you. Worth recommending. 7/10
