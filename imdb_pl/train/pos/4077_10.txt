I saw it for the first time in the early 1990s on British television, then I liked it, but missed the opportunity to record it, many years passed, but the movie was always in me and I lost hope that I will see it again, the most important thing stuck in me, it was the end, part of the leaky castle really moved me, it's easy to watch, it has a great story, great music, the list is long, it's good that I say how good it is, but everyone will take their own best pieces with them, when they see it, the animation is of the highest class and beauty to watch, it shows its age in very few parts, but now it has become part of its beauty, I'm glad that it came out on DVD because it is one of my top 10 films of all time . Buy or rent it simply, the best view is alone at night with drinks and food at your fingertips, so you do not have to interrupt the movie. <br /> <br /> Enjoy
