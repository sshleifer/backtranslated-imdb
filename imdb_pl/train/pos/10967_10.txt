I saw this film for the first time at a course of plays and playwrights in Tulane. I was amazed at how beautiful and raw this document was. It is a sincere look at the unedited reality of living in loneliness. The family is fascinating and I thought she really showed Little Edie in her core. ** In passing, my professor even told me that during the entire movie, Little Edie fell in love with one of the cameras men. ** Beauty, as I say, comes from the naturalness of family dysfunction. In the relationship between mother and daughter, it is clear that neither one nor the other could function in society, and you begin to desire Little Edie's rehabilitation for society. All in all, the film impresses with its aesthetic quality and presents surprising beauty. Two thumbs up!
