"Radiofreccia" is still a good surprise in the Italian cinema. The film is based on a book by the Italian songwriter Luciano Ligabue, who also directs the film and writes music - of course. <br /> <br /> The film is a portrait of the province of northern Italy in the Emilia-Romagna region. We are in 1975, the time of the first free radio - one of the boys of the film creates "Radioraptus". Youth wishes, friendship, love, sex, individual dramas and unemployment are one of the topics, but the film also talks about drugs - The heroine Freccia is a victim of heroin slavery. <br /> <br /> Without boredom and moralist, history flows very well; spontaneity of the actors is strong and the way of directing also. Of course, Luciano "Liga" Ligabue is neither a Fellini nor a filmmaker, above all a musician. But he manages to create a good product. Unfortunately, he will not repeat his success with his second film "Da zero a dieci" - he is not good at all. <br /> <br /> In "Radiofreccia" actors are not usually too famous, the only star is Stefano Accorsi - one of the most popular young Italian actors. See in the small role of another Italian composer - Francesco Guccini, he is a nice communist bartender and football coach!
