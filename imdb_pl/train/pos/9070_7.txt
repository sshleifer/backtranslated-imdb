It started slowly after a great animated intro, because the director had several characters and scenery for development. However, after the start of the bet the movie picks up the pace, because it is a race against time to see if a certain number of worms can be eaten until 19:00. We had a good opportunity on the way home to discuss some things with our son: bullying, helping others, mind over matter when you do not want to do something. <br /> <br /> Particularly noteworthy is the girl who played Eric (Erk): Hallie Kate Eisenberg. The director sneaks at her unexpectedly, and when she is on the screen, she captivates. He's one of those "Hey, she looks familiar" and then I remembered that she was a little girl that Pepsi introduced about 8 years ago. She was also in "Paul," a movie about a parrot who is trying to find his way home. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Eisenberg made many television and film appearances in the years '99 -00, but for many years to come he did not see much. He is now 14 years old and grows up to be a beautiful woman. Her smile really warms the screen. If she could get more good roles, she could have a good career (or better?) Than Haley Joel Osment, another three kids, but hopefully without some of the problems that Osment was in lately. <br /> <br /> Anywhozitz, according to my 8 years old son who just finished reading the story, the movie did not seem to follow the book so well, but it was still fun. The end of the movie seemed like a great setting for some of the sequels (How to eat cooked snails? Escargot Kid style?), Which may not be so bad. It was nice to take your family to a movie and not have to worry about language, violence or sex scenes. <br /> <br /> Another good aspect of the film was the respect / fear born by the director of Mr. Burdock (Heating plate). These days films show adult authorities as buffoons. Although he has one stupid scene, he rules the school with a strong hand. It was nice to see how Andrea Martin started working.
