I do not think she'll ever be happy. But she gives her fans a new Barbra (for now) with live singing, a young, fresh look and a very heavy acting game. <br /> <br /> This story is rough, but exciting and interested in you through. The extended "finale" of one frame is difficult to survive for the majority of fans other than Barbra, but it is evidence of those who admire her talent. <br /> <br />
