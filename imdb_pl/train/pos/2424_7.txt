Three scum receive their empty deserts after wasting their lives in greed, drugs, ego and bad attitudes. Interesting and well done; this style of film always makes me wonder where the reality ends and the imagination takes control. Even though these people were scum on the earth, I still took pity on them. They never really had a chance.
