Have you ever read Jim Thompson? It is a hard noir with the most extreme fatalism and misanthropy I have ever encountered. In his work there are rarely private detectives - only losers, psychotics and dear artists. Thompson is nailed to this film: "If God made some real mistakes in this world, he gave us the will to live when we have no justification for it." Every character in the film balances on the edge of the razor between surreal and terrifying realism. He is a nasty uncle Uncle Bud, played by Bruce Dern and terribly benevolent Dr. Goldman played by George Dickerson. Jason Patric gives a wonderful, often overwhelming performance, as Kid Collins, a not-so-keen, shy former player who is more afraid of himself than anyone else. Rachel Ward is Fay, sexy femme fatale, which we can not understand ... This is not your standard film noir, nor is it supposed to be. After Dark My Sweet, along with The Grifters, are two great adaptations of the novel of one of my favorite writers, Jim Thompson.
