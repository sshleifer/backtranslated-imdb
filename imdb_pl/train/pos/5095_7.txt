King's Solomon's Mines brings us Patrick Swayze (who plays Allan Quatermain), who spent a lot of time in Africa, but decides to return to England and become the father of his son. He states that his wife's parents take care of his son and that he has very little chance of looking after him with a lot of money for a lawsuit. Alison Deedy (playing Elżbieta) arrives, whose father is in Africa and is being held by an African tribe for a ransom for a map that her father Elżbieta sent her. Elizabeth is looking for Quatermain to take her back to Africa to find her father. <br /> <br /> There is a good cast of supporting characters that go hand in hand with Quatermain and Elżbieta, and of course there are some enemies (Russians) who want a map too. <br /> <br /> The movie keeps your attention to the end. Patrick once again plays a strict handsome, honorable man who comes to the rescue of a lady in danger. Patrick is a great dramatic actor who can easily portray passion, loss and despair, rugged quiet good man, anger and strength; In the Mind of King Solomon his character smiles several times. I would really like to see Patrick Swayze again in a nice live story in which he does not have to tighten his jaw and be so strong. Maybe he is dancing a little. But it's a good movie for the whole family and it's worth watching.
