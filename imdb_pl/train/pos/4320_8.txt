This very underestimated movie is for me what good writing in a movie should be. Kasdan is looking for meaning in our lives and insists that everyone should see and think about it. The film tells about the divisions that people create to isolate themselves from the violence, hatred and fanaticism of everyday life. <br /> <br /> On the way, we ask a question for a question about life. Davis (Steve Martin with a big beard) asks himself: "Is my film brutal (and what follows with our pleasure) causing violence in society?" Claire asks: "What kind of world is throwing away something as valuable as human life?" Mack is not immune, as he asks: "Is it possible to cross the limits of the race and (even more difficult) financing? Of course, they are not quoted from the film, but in general. Others also ask their questions and honestly raise more than they answer. <br /> <br /> But this is the nature of life. We try our whole lives to find answers to questions that we will never answer completely, and in some cases we have to answer our own questions of needs and desires. As people we feel good for questions that we can not answer. Some answers are true, Claire and Mack realize that even if they could go the easy way and let you take the child, their discovery became the responsibility of Davis `Sees the Light 'and decides not to make violent movies, but turns the next day and rejects his revelation as subordinated to his play . <br /> <br /> We're all looking for an answer. This movie does not answer them, it just reminds you to look for answers. <br /> <br />
