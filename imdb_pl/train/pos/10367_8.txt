When I saw "A Cry in the Dark" for the first time, I had no idea what a plot was. But when I saw it, I was shocked by what I presented. When I saw it for the second time in the Australian cinema class, I realized the second issue: communication problems. You see, when the dingo caught Linda Chamberlain's baby (Meryl Streep), she and her husband Michael (Sam Neill) were saddened, but they did not show it. As Seventh-day Adventists, they believed that God wanted that to happen, and they could not mourn for it. But when people across Australia saw a lack of sadness, everyone began to believe that Lindy did it herself. <br /> <br /> The point is that the wrong message was made public and turned people against Linda. Even though it was a pure accident, it still happened. This may be one of the greatest disasters caused by the existence of mass media, regardless of the political views of the media. <br /> <br /> When it comes to performances, Streep does a very good job with an Australian accent (no surprise there), and Sam Neill is just as great. You will probably be surprised by what you see here. Definitely one of Fred Schepisi's best films ever.
