Recently, I had the opportunity to watch the screening of this film. I believe that it will be in cinemas in Canada some time after Mother's Day. If it's in a theater nearby ... GO! This is not a funny movie in which you feel good - it's more like a movie about feelings and thoughts. <br /> <br /> The director is great at character development - he lets you into the heart, mind and Hagar wounds gradually. Initially, her attitudes and behaviors do not make much sense. As her story unfolds, she becomes someone you understand. As in life ... understanding brings empathy. I found her sympathetic at the end of the movie - especially when she opens her heart to a young man in a hut by the lake. <br /> <br /> Hagar's relationship with her two sons is painful - and it reflects many of our own experiences in this world. Her youngest son, John, who is full of life and adventures, takes the viewer to the edge of his place - and to the kind of raw emotions that are so authentic and rare. <br /> <br /> It's great to see Ellen Page working in this movie. She is very different from the young woman she plays in Juno. It gives me even wider recognition for her acting ability. If you loved her at Juno, you'll love her at The Stone Angel. <br /> <br /> Of course, Ellen Burnstyn is Hagar. There is probably no way to express the power of action as much as the actor's ability to forget about any other character he has ever played. I never thought about Ellen Burnstyn during this movie - I always thought about Hagar. She drew me into her character - hook, rope and weight. <br /> <br /> The ability of Kari Skogland to capture this famous book on the screen of one of the most-respected authors in Canada is impressive. Brilliantly depicts on the screen both the petrified and angelic parts of this complex woman, Hagar - a stone angel.
