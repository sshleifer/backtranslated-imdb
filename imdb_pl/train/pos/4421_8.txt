Gojoe is part of the new wave of Japanese cinema, adopting very creative directors, editors and photographers, and working on historical themes, which the Japanese call "pieces of the era". Gojoe is extremely creative in terms of color, photography and editing. Even genius. A new wave of Japanese samurai films allows you to look at traditional beliefs in shamanism, demons and occult powers that were certainly part of their ancient culture, but were not really explored in the Kurosawa samurai epic or Zaitochi series. Another great example of this species is Onmyoji (2001). I would like to put the director Sogo Ichii as one of the most interesting and creative Japanese directors of the new wave. Other recent songs from the Japanese period, which I highly recommend, are Yomada's Twilight Samurai (2002) and Shintaro Katsu Zatoichi: The Blind Swordsman (2003).
