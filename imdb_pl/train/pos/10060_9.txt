Wang Bianlian is an old street performer known as the "king of masks" who mastered the art of change in Sichuan. Liang is a well-known performer of the Sichuan art opera and respects Wang as an artist and person. Liang worries that precious art should not die with Wang, so he sows the heir's seed in Wang's mind. The film tells about prejudices, male domination, state of art, values ​​and, most importantly, warmth. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this movie. The whole movie is in the loops. Everything matters. It's a long story that has been so well edited that the length of the movie is only 91 minutes. Total satisfaction. For five minutes it's an artistic film, another five minutes is a sad movie, the next five minutes is a thriller. He simply changes his mood as his hero changes his face. The last scene on the rope is phenomenal. The story and the script are impeccable. The actors are brilliant. Both heroes are artists who can be told how they performed. Very impressive. He has not even been nominated for an Oscar. This year, the "English patient" received the best movie Oscar, and in the category of foreign films won "Kolya". "Kolya" was just fine and about the "English patient" the smaller said it was better. Watch it 9/10.
