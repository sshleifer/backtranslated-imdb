It was the first PPV in the new era of WWE, in which Hulk Hogan, The Ultimate Warrior, Ric Flair and Sherri Martel left. A new talent was needed. It all started with Lex Luger, a former world heavyweight champion NWA, who was awarded the title against Yokozhna. Lex traveled all over the United States with a bus called Lex Express to inspire Americans to gather behind him, trying to defeat the Japanese monster (who was actually Samoan) and get the WWE Championship back to American hands. Therefore, there was very much waiting for this match. <br /> <br /> But every good PPV needs undercard and it has some good things. <br /> <br /> The night started with Razor Ramon defeating Ted DiBiase in a good match. History says that DiBiase chose Ramon, and even offered him a job as a slave after his defeat because of a 1-2-3 child failure on RAW in July. Furious Ramon joined forces with 1-2-3 Kid against the Money Inc marker team from Ted DiBiase and Irwin R Shyster. To settle the differences, they both received one on one match DiBiase vs Ramon and Shyster vs The Kid. Razor was able to settle his case after hitting Razor's Edge. <br /> <br /> Then Steiner Brothers appeared, putting WWE Tag Team Titles on the line against The Heavenly Bodies. Depsite the interference of Jim Cornette, the manager of "The Bodies", who hit Scott Steiner in the throat with a tennis racket, were able to win the victory in a decent match. <br /> <br /> Shawn Michaels and Mr Perfect fought from Wrestlemania IX, when Shawn Michaels faced Perfect after losing Lex Lugera. Perfect then cost Michaels the Intercontinental Championship when he turned his attention to fight for the title from Marta Janetta. Michaels won the title back and put it on the line with Mr Perfect, but Michaels now had a powerful ally in his corner in his 7-foot Diesel bodyguard. Micheals and Perfect had a great match here, but it was Diesel who proved the difference, pulling out Perfect from the ring and throwing him in steel steps for Shawn to win by counting down. <br /> <br /> Irwin R Shyster avenged the loss of his partner from the tag team earlier in the night, easily counting on a 1-2-3 child. <br /> <br /> Then came one of the big games that night, when Bret Hart prepared to fight Jerry Lawler for the title of undisputed WWE king. But Lawler went out with his crutches, saying that he had been injured in a car accident earlier that day and that he had arranged another opponent for Hart: Doink the Clown. Hart and Doink had a good match, which Hart won with the sniper. Then he was jumped back from Lawler by the back. It bought WWE president Jack Tunney in the ring, who told Lawler that he would get a lifelong ban if he did not deal with Hart. Hart then destroyed Lawler by winning with the sniper, but Hart refused to let go and the referee reversed the decision. In the end, Lawler was named the undisputed king of the WWE. After this match Ludvig Borda destroyed Marty Janetty in a short game. <br /> <br /> Undertaker ended a long competition with Harvey Wippleman, which began in 1992, when Undertaker defeated Wippleman's client Kamala in Summerslam and continued when the last Wippleman monster The Giant Gonzales destroyed Taker in Rumble and then again in WrestleMania, with a decisive victory over Gonzales. Gonzales then turned to Wippleman, chokelamming him after a bad match. <br /> <br /> Then it was time for six-piece action as The Smoking Gunns (Bart and BIlly) and Tatanka defeated The Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu) and Bam Bam Bigelow with Tatanka pinning Samu. <br /> <br /> This brings us to the main event with Yokozuna, accompanied by Jim Cornette and Mr. Fuji, putting the WWE title on the line against Lex Luger and it was all aboard Lex Express. Lex left attacking, but Yokozuna took control. Lex returned, however, because he was able to avoid falling from banzai, and then hit Yokozun's body before he threw him out of the ring. Luger then attacked Cornette and Fuji when Yokozuna was counted. Luger won a great match !!!!! The balloons were falling from the ceiling. The heroes left to congratulate him on his victory. Yokozuna could retain the title, but Luger proved he could be beaten. The only question was: who would defeat him in the ring and deprive him of this title?
