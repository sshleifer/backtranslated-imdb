For a long time in my life I did not like this movie or I liked this film, but not so much. I watched it recently (in a sleepy, funny) and I liked it more than I did since I was less than six years old. Now I appreciate it more, as in the case of several other Disney classics that I have recently watched (including "Sleeping Beauty" and "Pinnochio" or whatever you spell it). <br /> <br /> Now I really appreciate the animation, clever storyline "Disney", humor of mice, expressed emotions and story. The animation is very well made, it often seems that you are there, where there are other characters, watching them. The animation well reflects also the background styles, including the city (which is shown twice briefly). Disney changes this from the original fairy tale in a surprisingly good way, introducing clever twists like mice making clothes and a key part (I usually do not like Disney movies if they are not similar to the original story, but I do not care too much about that. that they've made the necessary changes to make this a good Disney movie, I often do not think that Disney has changed the book a good way in some of his movies. <br /> <br /> You know this story, Cinderella is a girl working for her horrible stepmother He goes to the ball with the help of his godmother and loses the glass slipper ... <br /> <br /> This is a movie that you should watch with other people. The immediate family is not good enough. I recommend watching it with friends (and your closest family if you like. :-)). <br /> <br /> I recommend it to people who like a bit of Disney, people who like fairy tales and people who like mice. Enjoy! :-)
