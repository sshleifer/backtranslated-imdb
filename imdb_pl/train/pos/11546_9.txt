First viewing: July 21, 2008 <br /> <br /> A very impressive screenplay and comedy acting and time in this film. Now, at the age of 40, he has lost nothing of his power. Neil Simon presents a perfect insight into human nature and relationships, as well as how to create a real comedy from unusual situations. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau give great comedy performances. Neil Simon was inspired by the actual events of his own life to write the play on which this movie is based. <br /> <br /> One of the best-written and played Hollywood actors of all time! Surprisingly, he was nominated for only 2 Oscars: "The best adapted adaptation" and "Best film editing". Hollywood rarely rewards comedies, no matter how good it is.
