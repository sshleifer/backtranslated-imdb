A great gangster movie. Sam Mendes directed this beautiful film, showing another friend with his father and son. The brilliant cast of stars with Tom Hanks (Michael Sullivan) did a great job. acting from Paul Newman, Jude Law and Daniel Craig. Tasting is simply too good. The plot is quite good. The movie will appeal to you. A great portrait of a gangster from the 1930s. as the zenith of all gangster movies from that era. Soundtrack is pretty good for the movie. A great video showing what a father is doing to protect his son.
