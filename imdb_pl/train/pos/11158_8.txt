A shocking, well-made aggregate is an underrated tale of horrible murders and evil forces. <br /> <br /> A small doctor in the town is trying to find out who or what commits a series of brutal sexual murders. <br /> <br /> Incubus is a narrow mystery, with a few terrifying sequences of murders that build an unusual and amazing atmosphere. Scenes of murder are intense and bloody, so it is not a movie for those who are nasty! Directed by John Hough, along with a bizarre musical score, they combine to create a dark atmosphere of fear that permeates the whole movie. It also carries a kind of gothic atmosphere. There are also nice film locations and stylish camera work. <br /> <br /> The cast is not bad either. Great John Cassavetes makes a good performance as a new doctor in the city. Kerrie Keane's performances as a local reporter, Helen Hughes as a city historian and Duncan McIntosh as a tormented psychic teenager, are also good. <br /> <br /> Everywhere around Incubus is a forgotten horror, which must be re-discovered and re-evaluated. <br /> <br /> *** with ****
