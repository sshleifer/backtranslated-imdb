Well, after a long wait after watching a few clips about the 100 innermost moments of the Bravo movie, I've waited a long time to watch this movie. The plot was simple, the beautiful model Alison Parker (Cristina Raines) moves to a residential building, which is the gateway to hell. Sentinel is an unpleasant movie, even if it's a bit slow. It's a mix of Omen and Rosemary's Baby. Acting is fine, and some really disturbing passages, such as an awkward orgy scene with a dead father and a plump woman in the middle of an orgy, eat cake and laugh. It's very strange, camp, but in the end I really believe in a great movie! One of my favorites from the 70s, even if it's not original. It's weird and scary! Probably one of my favorite times. 9/10
