It's written in stone that Disney's animations just have to be musicals. Well? Where? Show me. Because I think this rehearsal is much more enjoyable for ~ not ~ containing a hakey-made standard Disney music tariff for five years. <br /> <br /> Although the story was not as fascinating as it could be, it was still quite good, pleasant and full of adventures. I was hoping for a bit more, yes, considering the subject, but this movie is not a bitter disappointment or a total failure that turned out to be. <br /> <br /> The quality of the animation is average, but the dialog box is quite convincing, as well as the plot, storyline, sub-story and incredible creativity that I found in this production. I will refrain from plotting the story of how it was done and done, but this movie is worth watching if you're a fan of fantasy. <br /> <br /> This is, in my opinion, THE BEST Disney animated full-length movie. <br /> <br /> Ocenia jest 9.4 / 10 od ... <br /> <br /> Fienda :.
