"California" is a good Hollywood odyssey of uncertainty and terror that tells two couples who drive around California to share gas costs: A pair of losers (Lewis and Pitt) and two would-be artists, photographer and writer (Duchovny & Forbes). Pitt "nails" his character, which focuses on this somewhat predictable thriller. A good watch for psycho-killer flix.
