Several young Iranian women dress up as boys and try to get into the World Cup qualifying match between Iran and Bahrain. When they are caught, they are placed in a place where the match stays within earshot, but out of sight. Prisoners demand a departure, but rules are rules. <br /> <br /> Considering the pedigree of the director, Jafar Panahi, disarmament consisted in the discovery that Offside is a comedy and often comic. In The Mirror in 1997, Panahi presents two versions of Iranian girlhood and leaves the audience wondering which one is "real". In 2000, The Circle, several Iranian women go outside the system; their offenses are different, but all end in the same tragic place. <br /> <br /> However, now thinking about Offside, it's hard to imagine it as anything other than a comedy, because the situation it presents is so apparently ridiculous. Because women are demanding an answer to the question why they can not watch a football match and their hijackers can not answer, the only possible result is a comedy. <br /> <br /> What makes Offside the most influential is that young women are not presented as activists attacking the system. They are simply football fans and patriots, and despite the fact that they are clearly treated unfairly, they never lose their focus on the match and the historical victory that is within the reach of their nation.
