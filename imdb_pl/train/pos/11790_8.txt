The new David Lynch movie is a very "Lynchian" song, full of darkness, tension, silence, discreet but very textured music in the background. There are two beautiful actresses, a blonde and a brunette again, a recurring theme in his work. > <br /> Both characters create a very intriguing relationship of the slave mistress, which can be seen as a direct continuation of the same type of relationship described in Mulholland Dr. <br /> <br /> Beautiful. For Lynch fans. <br /> <br />
