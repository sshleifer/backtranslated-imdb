Like others, I've seen and studied most of the books and movies about the killing of clutter, including some dramatic thematic work based on the actions and psycho-mythology of the crime participants - including the Capote himself. As for Capote, I can not forgive him for deliberately refraining from Perry Smith's testimony, intimacy, and even the defenders. I believe that the truths and facts that Capote "reserved" for his "book," which required two Capote sentences and the death penalty, would almost certainly sustain the successful defense of madness for Perry Smith, even under the old rule of McNaughton. Sam Capote could never write another large literary work after "In Cold Blood". Shame and wine. In my opinion, he willingly encouraged and planned a brutal death penalty to ensure the spectacular ending he demanded for his book / drama. For him both men had to die to make his book a success. The book had to be justified, pretending that it was about the horror of the death penalty. His actions and silence provided cold conclusions. <br /> <br /> The Capote book is not true. This is not real or journalistic. It's a drama and a melodrama spiced with your own creative psychotic imagination. What most people consider the advantages of the modern first film are the sharp images of the Capote mind, which may have been the coldest aspect of all. No wonder the viewers ironically but necessarily prefer Blake's performance. This actor is a nightmare of the dishonest imaginations of Capote. <br /> <br /> So who has to say, how should you play with two killers? Who is to assess what a poetic psychotic shot can do with excessive courtesy and killing? I agree with the few who see the great performance in the work of Eric Roberts, Shakespeare in his range, yet playing with heartbreaking honesty. Anthony Edwards has a much safer "attitude mode" to create a slender Hickok; but it is one-dimensional and boring, with a few notes in its television coverage. Roberts is almost four-dimensional, adding physical weakness and agony to a powerful animal body, Frankenstein, who thinks with poetry and knows exactly what NOT to do. Like Leopold apropos Loeb, Perry Smith Robert is hopelessly in love with a bad man. Without Hickok or a man with his peculiarities, Perry Smith would not bring his psychotic mind into the world of horror movies. He is afraid of himself more than he is afraid of anything else in life. <br /> <br /> Given the freedom from the mortal grip of Capote in the awareness of the killing of clutter, Roberts and Edwards can freely create original personalities and psychoses to create a different and new drama production. The same facts, some of the same case recordings, but deeper, more complex, with clearly titanic psychotic stresses - indeed, Roberts is so good in this fluent madness that he physically and physically demonstrates at every moment, how little consciousness he has where or who he is. <br /> <br /> What many of our reviewers do not like about this film, in particular Roberts, is that cold-blooded killing is not shown as expected and manipulated on demand. This is because here we see a much more realistic "interpretation of life and death" than Capote could ever create - a real tragedy. <br /> <br /> A real cold-blooded killer, Mr. Capote, and his hypocritically artistic "non-fiction novel" does not control those interpretations and performances. <br /> <br /> If "In Cold Blood" and the impact of Capote on life, literature and the truth have the same meaning as the scholars say, it takes courage as well as the talent for presenting the truth, or the version of truth that is not a rank, cowardly lie drawn from the depths of Capote's abyss.
