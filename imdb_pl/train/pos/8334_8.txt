It was a double interesting experience. For some reason, the greatest scientific mind of the twentieth century has never been the main character in the film *. The closest I can imagine as films with Einstein is CHAMPAIGN FOR CAESAR, where (like "deus ex ma-china") you hear the big man explain the point in the radio quiz program to prove that Ronald Colman still gave the right answer and in BULLSHOT, where the great Albert is one of a dozen leading physicists and scientists who are intoxicated with cannabis drugs by villains who intend to steal their machines. It is worth noting that in these two cases and in IQ we are dealing with comedies. So far no one has tried to make a serious film about Einstein's life, like John Hustin's attempt to make one on FREUD with Montgomery Cliff. It seems to me too difficult to introduce the world of mathematical equations or the mysteries of electromagnetic field theory into an exciting dialog box. But it was only three years ago that Russell Crowe and Christopher Plummer made a BEAUTIFUL MIND. Maybe nobody really tried. <br /> <br /> (* Then, after writing this, I remembered the successful comedy YOUNG EINSTEIN from Yahoo Serious about ten years ago, but this is an exception and it was a trick.) <br /> <br /> Another surprise was actor playing the great Albert. It was Walter Matthau, who broke away from the series of films he made with Jack Lemmon in the last decade of his career. Matthau was a very talented and talented actor, both in comedy and drama, but usually his comic personalities were variants of his "Whiplash Willie" by Gingrich from THE FORTUNE COOKIE. There were conniverss and gonifs. Later they would get rid of their criminal tendencies because we grew up on them, but they remained in a bad mood. But his Albert Einstein is really sweet. More like his Kotch than Willie Clarke. <br /> <br /> Albert's game as an old good uncle, Albert. It seems that Ethstein Matthau lives in Princeton with his niece Catherine Boyd (Meg Ryan), and she meets the stifling professor James Morland (Stephen Fry). But Fry's car needs repair and takes him to the store where Ed Walters (Tim Robbins) works. Robbins falls in love with Ryan, who is attracted to him - but he lacks the mental equipment he admires. Good old uncle Albert, assisted by three friends (Lou Jacobi, Joseph Maher and Gene Saks), decides to help Robbins and make him a seemingly unrecognized genius of physics. It will open the door of romance between him and Ryan, provided Ryan is impressed, and Fry does not spoil things (he hopes). <br /> <br /> The atmosphere is sweet, just like Matthau and his equipment pick up a super physics quiz that they help Robbins (changing the positions of their bodies). The conspiracy ultimately leads to a blatant lie that the brilliant Robbins has constructed an atomic rocket ship - which brings the interests of the nation into the form of President Eisenhower (Keene Curtis). <br /> <br /> It was a lovely comedy and an interesting episode for Matthau, because it was not as hip as normal, but much more subdued.
