It's really fun, airy, light romantic comedy. You can not mistake the sweet attractiveness of Meg Ryan in combination with the genius of Albert Einstein. Usually, I'm not a fan of completely fabricated fictional stories about real people, now dead and unable to defend, but I think that the late Einstein could have giggled. <br /> <br /> It's the 50's ... Princeton, New Jersey in the spring. This story revolves around a beautiful, young, scattered mathematician, Catherine (Meg Ryan), who is ready to marry a stifling jerk, a behavioral researcher named James, simply because he has the brains that the children are looking for in their future father. However, it's love at first sight when her car breaks down and she meets a car mechanic named Ed (Tim Robbins). Because he does not consider Ed to be smart enough, her uncle, no one else but Albert Einstein, plays a match machine, assisted in his undertakings by three mischievous buddies, all theoretical physicists. Uncle Albert must make Ed look smart enough, so he'll come up with a charade showing him as a physicist ... naturally with funny results. efficiently. Together with three professors, Kurt, Nathan and Boris, there is a lot of laughter. The real Einstein had a real human side and this movie just makes one (scandalous) step further. If you hang all the logic, you can almost imagine the stupid story that's going on! <br /> <br /> It may not be rocket science (despite the main character), but it is a wonderful sweet, refreshing movie. One of the best genres of comedy romance.
