Good luck finding this movie for viewing - it's not released on tape or DVD yet. I saw on the release in the early 70's, I was lucky that I managed to catch him thanks to the conservation efforts of American Cinematheque, and still has some tangible moments that have remained with me for thirty years. <br /> <br /> There is no reason to repeat rwint's exact comments here. As the Nominated Director shortly after the huge success of the Five Easy Pieces, Jack N said that he managed the lowest budget outlays as best as possible, and this certainly proves the wandering and meander that could have used some changes. . But it is also a memorable icon for this time: all very intense clashes in student sports from the late 1960s, student movements, sexual revolution and many more. <br /> <br /> Why watch this movie? In some sceneries it was most likely a ground switch: a brawny male connector in the shower after the match; Karen Black's scene with Tepper in the car will catch you a bit at a distance - but this is the first use of a word I have not seen before in the movie; and the free and unexpected use of nudity in general. I probably skip the others. <br /> <br /> Look for a nice surprise for young Cindy Williams in one of her first films; thin David Ogend Stiers; Mike Warren with a fresh blue UCLA uniform and prepares for a dark blue TV uniform; Robert Towne - Actor; and many people just play alone. <br /> <br /> Now: any relationship between the name of Harry Gittes, Robert Towne and a character in Chinatown and Two Jakes? <br /> <br /> Receives "7" based on Karen Black. You'll see why.
