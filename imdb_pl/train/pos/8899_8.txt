The film "60s really" (for those of us who have snarled in America during this time) is the turbulence and diversity of the decade. Despite exaggerated, stereotypical figures, the authenticity of the problems remains clear. <br /> <br /> Not only these radical times of change, but also very confusing times. Two basic things changed our world: the Citizens' Rights Act of 1964 and the overwhelming influence of the media. These two new freedoms began with social changes that soon became institutionalized. <br /> <br /> Sensitivity came from chaos, values ​​came from disorder. Remember, however, that most Americans did not take part in it ... they worked, played, watched the news ... and slowly began to act thanks to the efforts and struggles of minorities ... civil rights, workers, political activists, anti-war efforts, war against poverty ... .. <br /> <br /> The representation of the power of the press and television in particular has been well reflected, although the conflict between the attitude of the general public and those who seek to change things was ignored at best ... and in the worst case, wrongly presented. Americans from the middle class did not stand around angrily holding baseball bats or denying their wayward daughters. They were also confused. Let's not forget how the Folk Singers suddenly became Protest Singers and how the Beatles started the attack that killed the Folk-Protest movement. There are no Beatles songs in the film, or even any mention of them. <br /> <br /> I think that if you do not survive a decade, you may have no idea what the movie is about, in general the picture is a bit dark. At one point, I stopped my regular job while my sister lived in the Hog Farm commune and went to Woodstock. At another time, I was in Haight Asbury and Detroit Riots while she worked and played at a housewife in Maine and Connecticut. The roles were constantly changing. <br /> <br /> The film presents three middle-class siblings. They represent a child of a hippie, political activist and active military personnel. Dad represents typical attitudes, and mum represents the voice of reason, tolerance, and sometimes compromise ... for the sake of peace. <br /> <br /> The black family consists of the minister and his son ... disproportionately, I think. I assume that producers knew all the variables and had to limit themselves, because otherwise the film would become a long, boring, documentary film. Dad's message was that anger provokes bitterness and bitterness causes chaos. This was clearly a message addressed to today's youth. <br /> <br /> We are looking for a unique solution to social problems, as well as how we divide issues ... The 1960s were so unusual and only Roaring. Compare 20s. In other words, this movie eventually has morality. In the end, our collective individualism will survive. Put this on your oxymoron list. <br /> <br /> Everyone was God, Guru, or a free genius in the 1960s. It was a time of magic and madness. Nobody will ever push the 1960s to the right ... it was too diverse (this movie is close). At least we can say that we are not ashamed of it, that we have learned it and have grown up, and that once generation has shaped and changed America ... for the better.
