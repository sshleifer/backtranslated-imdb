Una giornata particolare is a film that has made perfect use of closed spaces. It is in these boring, empty spaces that viewers see the emotional turmoil and noisy explosions of Ettore Scoli's two main characters. Marcello Mastroianni and Sophia Loren play two frustrated people who decide on short moments of their apathetic life. This element of sadness associated with the narrative makes us believe that people will be on the side of relatives. All men will really regret the character of Sophia Loren. women would certainly be crying because of the existential fate of Marcello Mastroianni. Hidden sexuality is also one of the key issues of this grim, moving film. Most of the heroes are struggling with problems related to their own sexuality. Giornata particolare can not be described as a pro gay movie, although it has been well presented that a homosexual guy fits well with women. This is a film for which Italian director Ettore Scola created quite a good mix of facts and fictions. His idea is to show how the arrival of Hitler changed the fate of ordinary Italian people. A word about a brave personnage played splendidly by the great Marcello Mastroianni. He acts as a real man who does not beg for mercy. He happily accepts his fate and prepares to face the worst period of his short but meaningful life. A real masterpiece of cinema !!!
