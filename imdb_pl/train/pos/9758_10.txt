Personally, this is one of my favorites of all time! no, I'm not 10 years old. I am 30 years old! I am the owner of the old, original VHS of the one I bought at the rental company. I've watched it countless times ... <br /> <br /> while it's a fun movie for kids, it's an intriguing movie for adults. I saw this movie once, which was ... not sober. my eyes were open to things I had never noticed before. I saw that morals are strongly encouraged, both explicitly and somewhat subconsciously. be sure that there are TONS in the film, things mentioned in the whole movie. if you have a chance to see it ... do not be sober .. do it, you will not be disappointed ... in fact you will probably feel rather happy and warm. great!
