Film as entertainment is very good, and Jimmy Stewart is perfect as Chip Hardesty, with well done roles with Very Miles and Murray Hamilton. But the film, directed by the legendary director Mervyn Leroy, was constantly verified and approved by the script, as well as every aspect of the film, up to the clothes, was carefully watched and controlled by J. Edgar Hoover. Not that J. Edgar Hoover had nothing to be proud of. His office management from 1924 until his death was based on the best investigative services in the world. But by 1959, Hoover had already begun to worry that he would be denied and began to collect documentation about powerful people to ensure and protect his small kingdom. And he was determined to make sure that no film would show even one nipple about the office. The films show only continuous successes and glosses over the failures that took place, as well as the role of the office in the witch hunts in the early 1950s. Enjoy the story, but with the tongue firmly in the cheek.
