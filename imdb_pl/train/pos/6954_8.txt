This movie was one of the funniest movies I've seen for years, and the laughter of audience members supports me. Ever since My Big Fat Greek Wedding (2002), the laughter was so spontaneous and intense. It's easy to have complexities like last year, Mr. and Mrs. Smith (2005) in using parody (espionage with Mr. and Mrs. Smith and sex in My Super Ex-Girlfriend). Director Ivan Reitman balances between comedy and drama, is crazy between crazy and outright ridiculous. A shock and a dramatic, serious crash never rule comedy. At the same time, this predictable romantic comedy never loses its touching emotional elements, even if the ending is broadcast in advance. In some respects, it's so obvious that it's great to see how to play. As in real life, sometimes the truth is so obvious that you can not really see it. Eight to ten stars easily in the Tootsie ranking (1982). Probably nine (depends on how it looks at the second watch).
