I must say that I loved the Vanishing Point. I saw the original and it is quite a good remake. Although he did not follow the original story (which is why I gave her 8 out of 10), he was still quite good and it is probably a better plot. <br /> <br /> When it comes to the car, good DJ comment on the 185mph Challenger in bulldozers is quite unbelievable (and if you look, the speedometer's needle is swaying at 145-150), but even though I have not seen it go on the engine in one of the initial scenes in which they show the engine, the original story had a topped Hemi, so it's possible. For those of you who claim that aerodynamics does not allow it, today's Chrysler 300C with a naturally aspirated engine can travel 168 miles per hour, and if you look at it while driving on the highway, it's like pushing the wall by 70 mph. Additionally, in the test in the wind tunnel, if you place an air barrier on the Challenger, it will probably be more aerodynamic.
