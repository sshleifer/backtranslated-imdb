Thelma Ritter stole the photo. I just finished watching it. I could not resist the emotions in her last scene. She did not get an Oscar. Therefore, you should not believe too much in the Oscars. Richard Widmark never had a better role and was an excellent cast as a three-dimensional, flawed man. Jean Peters was great as a clumsy, hard-working girl in his best role. And Richard Kiley had to be very good; Why would I hate him so much? Yes, it was difficult to convey patriotism; but without it you do not have a lot of film. Observe their faces! The three best stars did not need too much script. I would like to see them in this film without dialogue. If you've ever seen Ray Milland and Rita Gam in "The Thief", maybe you know what I mean. When I was a kid in 1956 on my first trip to New York, I forced my uncle from the Bronx to take us to the foothills of South Street in search of No. 66. Then I learned that Hollywood can not be trusted. But I found the river. <br /> <br /> I do not give away too much history because I hate it when I know what's going on before I see it myself. If you saw it, you do not need to explain. Maybe someone who reads these comments did not see "Pickup On South Street". You will like it; just do not look for 66 South Street in New York.
