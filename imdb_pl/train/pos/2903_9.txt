Tiempo de valientes is a very funny action comedy. After his great film called El fondo del mar and the spectacular television program Los Simuladores, Damian Szifron made another wonderful work. Tiempo de valientes looks for a while in a film made in Hollywood. Diego Peretti and Luis Luque are two great actors and they have great performances here. The film is very funny and funny, it has great moments. Tiempo de valientes is a very fun action comedy, which I totally recommend, if you want to have a great, I must thank Shifron for all his talent. <br /> <br /> Mark: 9
