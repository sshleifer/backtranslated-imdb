Larry Burrows has a clear feeling that something is missing. Ever since he lost a key baseball shot at the school that cost the championship, he was convinced that his life would have been better if he made the shot. One night his car breaks down again. Going to the nearest bar to wait for the truck, Larry happens to the bartender Mike, who without Larry's intention is going to change his life forever ....... <br /> <br /> Alternative life cinema no is nothing new, reaching for "It A Wonderful Life" and shows no signs of weakness with a completely new Sandler's vehicle, which was Click. This is a genre that brought very mixed results. In 1990, the production of James Belushi was conducted, rarely mentioned, when the mentioned topic appears, it seems that it has been largely forgotten. It's a pity, because it exudes charm and lacks humor. We know that we are bringing us to the final message, but it is a fun and pleasant path that must be overcome. The film also serves to find out who the great comedian James Belushi was. I mean, if his style of smart quipping and lying irritation is not your thing? Then there is a chance that you will avoid this movie anyway. But for those involved in Red Heat, K-9 and Take Care of Business, Mr. Destiny is on your street. Linda Hamilton, Michael Caine, Jon Lovitz, Hart Bochner, Jay O. Sanders, Rene Russo and Courteney Cox are waiting for the ride. <br /> <br /> Mr Przeznaczenie, pure escapist fun with a kicker of messages in the heart. 7/10
