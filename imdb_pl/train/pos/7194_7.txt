I emphasize the best of the Zorro chapters. An exciting musical score adds a punch to the exciting game on the screen. There is a great supporting cast and a mysterious villain who will make you guess until the last chapter. and his alter ego Zorro. Last, but certainly not less, is a great director team, Whitney and English.
