Diagnosis Murder is one of the few programs I regularly watch on TV. The way all the main characters have something to do in each episode makes it so different from today's shows, where it focuses on 1 or 2 people per episode, and everyone else is pushed aside. The way Marek's brain works is also so vague that you never really know what he's thinking, and if you think so, you're wrong. <br /> <br /> Diagnosis The murder has dealt with various topics, not only in cases, but in each of the personal characters. Everything from racism and adoption, to terrorists and technology. <br /> <br /> When it comes to older people? I'm 24 years!! I do not think I can still be classified as old. <br /> <br /> I just want to know when they will be spending all 8 seasons on DVD (not NTSC) to be able to watch them all in order. They seem to be doing so with many other programs from the same era, so they can hurry up!
