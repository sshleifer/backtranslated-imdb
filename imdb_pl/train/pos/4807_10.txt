I really thought this movie was great. The story is not only correct, but the style is sumptuous and at the same time intimate. I was a fan of the portrait of Victoria Emily Blunt and how she kept her spirit, despite being forced into virtual exile in her youth. Blunt depicts the charismatic and sometimes dogmatic manner in which Vicotria became famous (perhaps infamous). The romantic elements of the film are so authentic and delicate that at the end of the film you really understand why Vicotria decided to live the rest of her days in mourning Albert. <br /> <br /> Technical aspects of the film deserve attention. I appreciate the beautiful score, which moves brilliantly with the dramatic movement of the story. I also decided that the photos are unique, some scenes leave me breathless because of the luxuriance and glamor they portray. <br /> <br /> There were so few movies this year as beautiful and sensitive as this movie and it is considered one of the best in 2009!
