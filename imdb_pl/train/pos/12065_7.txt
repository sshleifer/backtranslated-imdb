"Nieznaczność" is a film far from the splendor of stage art directed by Nic Roeg. In the Roeg film scheme, this is above the level of most of his post - "Look Look Now", which is characterized by the sensible use of Theresa Russell as the main actress. It is really very good here and far from the problem in other Roeg movies, such as "Bad Timing" and "Cold Heaven". As "Actress", who is Marilyn Monroe, Russell is very effective, presenting her as a completely depressing, but nice siren. He plays well with Michael Emil as Einstein, who is at least perfect. He looks at this part with admiration, and though Theresa Russell does not look exactly like Monroe, he is certainly attractive enough to make this part real. Other players are adequate if not quite arrested like Emil and Russell. The fully functional, intelligent script is well directed by Roeg, but it is certainly not brilliant, like "Walkabout" or "Performance". As with other subsequent Roeg movies, he tends to rely on vague, unimportant flashbacks that add little to the movie. In many respects, the movie would work better as a shorter (say 60 minutes), more modest. Nevertheless, quite acceptable, passable film. Sometimes very good, but generally missing. Rating: - *** 1/2 / *****
