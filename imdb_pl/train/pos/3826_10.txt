I love Korean movies because they can really (quietly amazing) capture real life. Because of this, I watch Korean movies. I've seen other directors before. The one that is the closest to the feelings I received from this is Oasis and another amazing movie entitled This Charming Girl. <br /> <br /> However, my summary of the title should be from the perspective of Chrstian, so I will start doing so instead of simply praising him with praise. <br /> <br /> For the non-Christian director, director Chang-dong Lee captures the impartial and almost amazingly real image of a modern Protestant church (irrespective of religion) warts and everything. I have always been waiting for a Christian film that really presents the darker recesses of church life. Because Christian films tend to speak in a language other than the language they want to share. Many films with religious undertones, though with good motives, have a habit of resonance in Disney's film or in a special school. They must show life as it is. Real people are cursing, real people are craving, real people are falling down. And although Christians believe that salvation is available to those who seek it, we are still challenged by the daily horrors of this life. And the character "Do-yeon" by Jeon is a completely honest and almost brutal portrait of a woman who has found God, but because of the bitter realities of life she loses the love she once had. She does not deny the existence of God. He simply refuses to accept life in the idea that he is a God full of love and forgiveness. <br /> <br /> In its decency on the edge of morality and madness, its character asks questions that are in the minds of everyone, a religious or not. <br /> <br /> "If God is Love, why does He allow such horrible things to happen?" This film does not answer that rightly. And I believe that the last 10 minutes of the film, although open to interpretation, leave us with hope for the future for our main character and bring closer the idea of ​​the "secret sun". <br /> <br /> Do not believe for a moment that this movie tried to be religious or in any way tried to do it. The lie is the reason why even more worked. This is true, it's honest. For this reason, it is by far the best summary of the real Christian life that I saw in the film.
