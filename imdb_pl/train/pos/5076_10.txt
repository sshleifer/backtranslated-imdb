Almost 5 years have passed since the launch of this stylish action movie. I watched the movie almost 10 times and it was Gautham's great effort. From my perspective, I believe that this film is practically flawless. Surya as ACP Anbuchelvan - no doubt ... class.Jyothika played her role as Maya very well. The character suits her very well. The character that attracted the attention of film viewers is Pandia.Jeevan played the role of Panda very well. .Eevan deservedly received the Best Villain award at ITFA 2004. Supporting cast of Daniel Balaji, Devadharshini and others performed well. <br /> <br /> Racy's script, perfect dialogues and Gautham's brilliant narrative. Harris Jeyaraj is all the tamer of charts, while BGM fits the film very well. Rich graphics by RD Rajasekhar. Peter Hein developed the stunt choreography well. The edition of Antoni is precise. action and romance. <br /> <br /> Even a Hollywood movie can not compete with Kaakha Kaakha ... no doubt.
