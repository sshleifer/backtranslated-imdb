I love this movie! The animation is great (for a pokemon movie), cgi looks so amazing. I love music in the film. So great that they kept Japanese music. <br /> <br /> When it comes to history: great. He has a great feeling of friendship. Celebi is a very sweet and powerful pokemon. Ash is great in this movie and I like his friendship with Sam. The only thing I did not like is the appearance of Suicune, he just suddenly pops up, helps Ash and something and goes out. They could increase its share in the film. <br /> <br /> But overall, an amazing movie! I can not wait to have a US version on DVD!
