Domestic imports were a great movie. I was laughing all the time. It was fun on many levels, from crazy costumes to funny situations. Acting was great. Alla Korot, Larry Dorf, Howard Hesseman and everyone else did a great job. Because it is an independent film written by the first writer, there are no stereotypes that can be expected from other comedies, which was such a relief. It was unique and interesting, you fall in love with the heroes and the warming story. I hear it's based on a real story? If so, it's fun (and amazing!). I highly recommend this movie.
