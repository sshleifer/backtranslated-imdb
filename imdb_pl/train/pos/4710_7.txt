When it comes to parody movies, there is little worth of time and energy. but after the recent revival of terrible parodies such as Date Movie and The Comebacks, there is a breath of fresh air to come back and discover a really funny farce like Johnny Dangerously. <br /> <br /> After his mother has no end to health problems, little Johnny goes to work for the crowd. What is fallow is a series of gags, most of which work, but there are occasional flip-flops. But a foreign gangster who can not master the American language (at least vulgarity), a rival gangster with a penchant for mouth shooting (... once!), A younger brother from D.A. who is going to get Johhny Dangerously, and the hot young star warming for his feelings is occupied by Johnny. <br /> <br /> And the viewer will be busy laughing, for the most part, when every gangster film trivia is skewed with a talented cast and decent writing. <br /> <br /> Not perfect for a long shot, but definitely good for a smile on a bad day.
