"Margarity i Cock ..." <br /> <br /> This extremely entertaining movie takes you from the initial stage and never ceases to deliver laughter, surprises and unexpectedly moving moments. I had more fun watching "Matador" than almost any other movie from 2005. This is a crazy movie about an unforgettable character, played to perfection by Pierce Brosnan. <br /> <br /> Julian Noble (Brosnan) is a moderator (hit-man) who specializes in high-end corporate events (killings of rich guys). He also experiences something similar to the midlife crisis. After realizing that there are no real friends, a stable home and a planned future, one evening he rushes into the Mexican hotel bar and falls into Danny Wright (Kinnear). <br /> <br /> on-the-luck family man who is on the verge of losing a big deal who can change it. He loves his wife very much, especially since he lost his son a few years earlier. <br /> <br /> The two men are chalk and cheese, almost no common area except that they are in the same abandoned bar night. And somehow there is a conversation that triggers a chain of events that will change their lives forever. <br /> <br /> The friendship they make reminded me of many Laurel and Hardy. One is a simple man and the other is a persistent fool who gets them into trouble. The interaction is perfectly timed and tuned, largely thanks to the brilliant performances of Brosnan and Kinnear. <br /> <br /> But do not be wrong ... This is Brosnan's movie. It cuts off one of the most memorable and worst figures of the decade. He could have shot your mother and immediately apologized, and you would probably forgive him. Brosnan may be the greatest charm of the cinema, but it is his most endearing and complete performance. I would not be reluctant to see the Oscar for this role. <br /> <br /> Consider one scene in which the girl from the high school openly fools unclean thoughts and utters the poem: "All blush. .. No sucky fucky. "He does it with the smile of the well-known Bond and manages to escape, he manages to tell the young boy," Tell my mother to lose 30 pounds and 20 years, then come back to me "without considering yourself unlikely In fact, it makes us like it even more. <br /> <br /> However, the film manages to surprise us with some really touching scenes, most of which are coming to an end when the film makes unpredictable turns. thumbs browses through his little black book to find someone to call his birthday, or when one evening Danny and his wife (Davis) comfort each other in the bedroom, the film reaches an unexpected depth of emotion. <br /> <br /> "The Matador" is stylish and energetic, it is always entertaining and it also includes the role that Brosnan describes as a career as a lonely hitman looking for normality, friendship and means to do things less than one good thing in your life. This is a missing gem in 2005 and you should try to watch this movie as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> TC Candler from IndependentCritics.com
