The information in this video is known to many people who have recently been paying attention to messages. Walter Reed scandals show a small part of the fact that we do not do a good job of caring for our wounded heroes when they come back. <br /> <br /> What this film shows next is the truth common to all wars. The psychic trauma suffered by soldiers during the war and the difficulties they encounter after returning to civilian life. They are not just changed or touched, they are different people and most do not know how to deal with it because they do not know themselves. <br /> <br /> Finally, the film shows what the army is doing with our young men to women in preparing them for war, and the policies and practices that they must follow in the pursuit of war leading to all psychological trauma. <br /> <br /> We have over 3,000 soldiers killed in four years of this invasion; but we have many tens of thousands who are physically and mentally traumatized throughout their lives due to this war. It does not matter which side you are on, you need to know how much the war costs to decide if we should be in this industry. This movie perfectly illustrates the costs for men and women.
