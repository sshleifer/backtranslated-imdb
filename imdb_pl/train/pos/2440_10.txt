OH WOW. I saw this movie at the Irish International Film Fleadh in Manhattan on March 12, 2000. Both stars were present and were available for questions later. WHAT WONDERFUL FILM! Although the action takes place in Ireland in the midst of Catholic / Protestant antagonisms, history could happen anywhere between two groups of people who hate each other. The horror of how fast people can get carried away, when they have a chance to free themselves from hatred and anger, has been beautifully entwined with a moving love story covered with humor and fun. If this is not picked up in the US, it will be really unfortunate. <br /> <br /> When it comes to celebrities and supporting players ... FIRST INSTALLMENT. I hear they call Orla Brady Irish Meryl Streep. In my opinion, she is BETTER than Meryl Streep. They should call Meryl from the American Orla Brady! And the constant and powerful portrait of Liam Cunningham, a simple and private man drawn into a political war, was brilliant. <br /> <br /> SEE THIS FILM.
