Wonderland is a fascinating movie describing the movie star in which X participated. John C. Holmes takes part in brutal murders in Wonderland. <br /> <br /> The promotion of the film is misleading, thinking that it is a romantic representation of the porn industry in the spirit of Boogie Nights, and this is not the case here. In fact, in addition to several references made by presenters that John Holmes is a porn star, and the short editing of true John Holmes movies, this film is just a drama about the involvement of a fallen star and murder and how it happened. <br /> <br /> Despite being misleading, the movie is really addictive. The acting of all actors is excellent and I would like to say that Val Kilmer is amazing in his ability to go down all John Holmes' manners. I was absolutely convinced that I was watching what John C. Holmes probably looked and behaved like in real life. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of John C. Holmes or you like stories about Hollywood, I think you'll enjoy watching Wonderland.
