My family watched Arthur Bach stumble and stutter from the first movie. We remember most of the lines. I watched him two weeks ago and I'm still tickled by the simple humor and view of life that Dudley Moore presents. Liza Minelli did a great job as a side kick - though I'm not her biggest fan. This movie makes me just like watching movies. My favorite scene is Arthur's visit to his fiance's house. His conversation with a butler and father Susan spits from the side. Line from the butler, "Would you like to wait in the library", and then Arthur's answer: "Yes, the bathroom is not an option" is my NEWMAIL notification on my computer. "Artur is really" funny "!
