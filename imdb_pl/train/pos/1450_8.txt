An excellent political thriller, played much more quietly and slower than other films with higher rankings in this genre. When people talk about Pacino and Cusack, how do they deal with skipping these amazing achievements in a career? A story of friendship, father-son relationship, corruption and deception. Both actors have a great relationship, and Aiello and Fonda's support is equally impressive, although Aiello is brilliant, especially when newspapers run into the press. Instead of focusing on a complicated corruption scandal, he creates wonderful characters that show the human side of failure as a political bribe. The last scenes with each of the main characters are wonderfully written and preserved.
