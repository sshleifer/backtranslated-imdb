Cross-eyed is a very original and funny movie. I think that Adam Jones brings a new genre of eyes to the comedy genre and really rediscovers it. This film is elegant, concise and consistently fun and entertaining. As a screenwriter and director, Jones has total control over her characters, both absurd and beloved. History is definitely something that you have not seen before, which is good. It is unique and funny. He manages to work with both fantastic elements and a long-lost slapstick genre, creating a generous comedy. <br /> <br /> A very promising first movie.
