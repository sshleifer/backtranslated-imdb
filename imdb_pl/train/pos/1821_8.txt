When I was a little girl (and my dad was the owner of a video store), it was one of my favorite movies. Since then I have not heard much about it, nor do I remember anything that has been forgotten after other, probably better, films of Don Bluth. However, I managed to track it down a few weeks ago and I was pleasantly surprised again. The film takes place in New Orleans in the 1930s, and the songs are unforgettable. There are a few errors in continuity if you look hard enough, but generally they do not lessen the plot, which makes you smile (and maybe even a little hazy if you're an animal lover). Characters are reliable (maybe even a bit too big for younger observers). Two paws up, and for those of you who have not seen him for some time, definitely worth a second look.
