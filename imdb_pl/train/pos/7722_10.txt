It is a movie that has everything, a great hero, a beautiful lady in danger, a noble figure with a tragic flaw and a really great job. Forbidden Planet maintains this special magic for years and does not lose its flavor thanks to repeated reviews (although the sex appeal of youthful Anne Francis significantly helps in this result). <br /> <br /> The fans of the film recognize young Leslie Nielsen, playing the handsome and heroic Commander Adams, although those of us who liked him in the role of comedians may be surprised by his serious role. Outstanding and noble-looking Walter Pidgeon is also a distinguished player as a scientist with a secret (Id). Other casts deserve a nod, especially Warren Stevens as a brainy and resourceful "Doc," and of course Miss Francis' charms, as mentioned above. <br /> <br /> This film was an early pioneer in using electronic music in the 1950s, not less. These subtitles call them "tonalities", but those of us who tried to tinker with the early versions of the "Theremin" device recognize the strange and terrible skits and screechs sometimes used in the soundtrack. Still, it is suitable for the image of an exotic and strange landscape of the mysterious and threatening world of Krell. <br /> <br /> The special effects are also quite shocking. I remember my fear as a young man waiting for the next manifestation of the invisible monster, "Id," and when he's finally pictured on one battle scene, he literally shook me in toes with amazement and admiration. The magic of matte art is fully utilized in the stunning scenes of the Krell science complex as the heroes break through various labyrinths and passages led by the mysterious Dr. Morbius. <br /> <br /> I remember feeling a bit jealous that Dr. Morbius would have such a nice toy in the form of Robby the Robot. Robby's character is quite adorable and in some ways seems more human than some other characters. Spectators of subsequent concerts, such as Twilight Zone and Lost In Space, recognize Robby's recyclable prop in some of these episodes, although I remember that he never had the "personality" of the original Robby. <br /> <br /> I must admit that I do not fully understand the complexity of the plot until I was old enough to understand the various references to Freudian psychology and the danger of freeing the hidden and usually contained fears and anger that we carry within ourselves, but we trained be submerged and controlled by adherence to social codes. Although the key to the story seems obvious after disclosure, it remains unknown (or perhaps deliberately overlooked) by Dr. Morbius until he is pointed out by the clear commander Adams, who forces Dr. Morbius to confront evil with himself. It still gives me goose bumps when Commander Adams pushes Dr. Morbius into the Krell machine, which gave him a higher intellect, which opened the flood gates of his subconscious to the power of the Krell machine: "Here. He was consciously still lacking the power to handle the Great Machine, but your subconscious was strong enough. Zowee! <br /> <br /> Forbidden Planet remains probably my favorite sci-fi movie in history and remains timeless and classic due to the carefully prepared history and great visualization and implementation on the screen.
