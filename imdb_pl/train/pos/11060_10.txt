This movie is wonderful. Writing, directing, acting are fantastic. A very witty and clever script. The high-quality performances of Ally Sheedy's actors are strong and dynamic and charmingly bizarre. Really original and cordially unpredictable. The scenes are full of fresh energy and really talented production.
