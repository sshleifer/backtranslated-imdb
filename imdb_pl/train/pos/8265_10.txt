The name of this movie alone meant that I wanted to see what this is all about, so I recorded this movie in the early hours of AM. If you ever wanted to see what miners had to go through the first days and see the dramatic scene when the mine fell apart on men. This film clearly wants to show that Germany and France can cooperate with each other and be friends after the First World War and how the Germans came with the help of French miners to the unbelief of the French city. All the actors were outstanding, with unusual scenes in the mine with a horse and a small boy who worked in the mine. There is an old old retired miner who changes to get down the mine ladder when the elevator breaks down. If you're a real lover of movies, it's a movie you do not want to miss.
