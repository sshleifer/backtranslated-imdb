There's a lot of nonsense in Hollywood lately. <br /> <br /> A friend from time to time sends me movies, which is a surprise, it's amazing. <br /> <br /> he could not stop watching, this is a drama, but with a strange twist of action. Imagine that Romeo, like Shakepeare, had great power. He is both sad and poetic. Hollywood should pay attention to the new Russian cinema, tell stories that do not concern great explosions and cgi. It requires a simple basic assumption and tells a story without a performance. It is very similar to an Asian film with a dark Russian accent. I admit that it is not perfect, but nothing is ever. You know what power is, but it is never explained or fully completed. It becomes secondary to emotions related to history. I do not want to watch the remake, it's too cool, because the Hollywood system will break it down as usual. Acting is at the highest level. Working with directing and camera far outweighs most nonsense. Kudos for everyone involved, and I will distort many people for this independent epic. A +++++ <br /> <br /> If you can find, look at it.
