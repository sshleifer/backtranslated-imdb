The American in Paris was in many respects the best combination of art and Hollywood musical. Made at the peak of the MGM powers as a musical power, the film features memorable music from Gershwins, which was rightly named the equivalent of the 20th century Beethoven and Mozart. <br /> <br /> Gene Kelly was also at the peak of his power in this film, though it was right to claim that this movie was just a warm-up for his best work at Singin 'in the Rain (1952). Both films are closely related. In addition to Arthur Freed's merger, the Broadway Melody segment in "Rain" owes its existence to the amazing American Ballet sequence in this film. Perhaps it was the only time that the dance number was specifically mentioned in the opening credits of the film. It deserves to present Gene Kelly's skills as a dancer and choreographer to the highest degree. <br /> <br /> The cast of the film is equally perfect. Leslie Caron, incredibly debuting in the film, shows the maturity that makes you think that he has been making films for years. Her initial dance sequence, and later her work on the Ballet, delivers surprisingly sexy moments competing in MGM Musicals only thanks to the work of Cyda Charisse in Singin 'in the Rain and The Band Wagon. Oscar Levant is funny as a stoic pal Kelly, who has two best moments in the movie: during the final sequence of the event (which I will not give to anyone who has not seen the film), and one of the most memorable music numbers that combines his amazing piano skills with the most modern (for now) with special effects. <br /> <br /> Less memorable are Georges Guetary as a romantic rival to Kelly, although he has several musical attractions, and Nina Foch as a romantic rival Leslie Caron. The May-December relationship between Kelly and Nina reminded me of the same relationship of "held man" George Peppard and Patricia Neal saw in breakfast at Tiffany's. <br /> <br /> There are a few elements of the movie that came to be less rewarding for me than Singin 'in the Rain. The Ballet, though sumptuous and well-made, does not fit the rest of the movie. Without giving out the story, the Ballet just happens without real rhyme or reason. And unlike the sequence of Broadway tunes, it really has nothing to do with the plot - in the best musicals, songs always have a reason to exist. <br /> <br /> What's worse, the film that happens right after the Ballet ends. Although the ending should not be a surprise (in the end it is a MGM musical), I was hoping for a bit more ... after the end of the Ballet. It is as if director Vincente Minnelli felt that he could not follow the Ballet with anything else. The movie literally left me on the ice. <br /> <br /> This negative aside, the American in Paris rightly ranks next to the best Hollywood musicals. He does not reach the height of Singin 'in the Rain, but he is approaching and remains a testimony to Gene Kelly's ability as one of the greatest dancers of all time.
