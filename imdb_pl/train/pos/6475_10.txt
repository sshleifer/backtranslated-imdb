It's only two episodes in a 5-part drama, but I can say that it's one of the best things I've ever seen. It's on TV, on the silver screen, and even in real life. <br /> <br /> As a writer he is so good that he almost demoralizes! As a viewer, it's so funny that I'm irritated that the episodes last over two weeks, not Monday to Friday. It is clear that all these negatives are actually positive. <br /> <br /> I am a modern guy who has previously gone from TV series. Compared to movies, television series always seemed outdated, quite tame and generally boring! "Five Days" really introduced the television drama into the 21st century, so at least it changes my mind for me. Go watch it.
