The film was very moving. It was delicate and funny at the same time. The scenery was absolutely beautiful! Peter Faulk and Paul Reiser rewarded performances. Olympia Dukakis was great. I understand that due to the plot, part of it had to be short, but I wanted to see her more - she is a real professional. seeing this movie. We were lucky to see Paul Reiser in Q and A after watching. He is a great man, wise, eloquent and "real Person." It was a really nice evening! It must see the movie. You will be so grateful that you went.
