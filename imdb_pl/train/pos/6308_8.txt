Stupid, funny, tragic, sad, inevitable. <br /> <br /> A group of outsiders connects with the "seasoned" cheater to get out of poverty. A great idea ... if you ignore the screw factor. <br /> <br /> Nice to see that George Clooney is doing something really funny for a change. The cast is excellent and the operating standards are very high. Although it can be said that the motif of a motley crew is not new, I think that this film handles it in an interesting and unique way. Sufficiently to stand out from the previous ones. <br /> <br /> Well done guys.
