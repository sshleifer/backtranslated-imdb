I watched this movie after watching it on Broadway. I love musical on Broadway and I love this movie. I watched this movie as if it was not connected to a Broadway show. I am an avid reader and I have seen what happens to most books when they are transformed into films, so I have developed a philosophy really early. Let's assume that the movie will be based on a book (or in this case music), but although the plot line may be similar, it will not be the same, it will be different, so watch it. > <br /> I danced for 12 years before I had to make a choice. I was a good dancer (I raised the choir in local productions as a child, etc.), but I was not very talented. However, I was very talented as a player. My dance instructor and my trainer (who spent several months in my farm outside the state) told me that I had to make a choice when I was 14 years old. I had to go from dancing two hours four to five days a week and riding 3 hours a day 7 days a week .. and dedicated to one or the other. So I love dancing very much and I love this film and many other ballet and dance films. I just decided to watch this movie because it is a great film about raw emotions and human interactions. It's about the power of anticipation and occupation when you work hard to get something you want, and you just do not understand it. I love that movie. I love musical on Broadway.
