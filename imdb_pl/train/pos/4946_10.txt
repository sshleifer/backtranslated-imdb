Bravo! Morgan Freeman is an actor who studies the character he is chosen to play before making a commitment. Freeman is a "good fit" to this film (similar to "Running a Daisy"), and he is not only credible, but has the chance to change his image, playing a character with restrained dignity and decency. Although there are no guarantees in life, it gives the actor a great opportunity to play different or exceptional characters that stand out in order to avoid stereotypes. And it must be said that stereotypes have hampered or completely ruined a significant number of acting careers. <br /> <br /> This is a low-budget movie that, surprisingly, was made in just two weeks. It is a film well directed and written by Brad Silberling. The location manager chose Carson, CA to set the movie, and the location helps set the tone and time of the movie. Editing is good to good, but a bit rough. <br /> <br /> Silberling was a "subcontractor", urging Freeman to make this film while the actor was between film projects. <br /> <br /> There is a good chemistry between Freeman and Paz Vega, a Spanish actress, and this opens up an effective dialogue between each of the cast members who are diverse and come from different cultures. The film also encourages communication between people who not only speak two languages ​​(English and Spanish), but come from two different worlds: ethnicity, race, gender, norms, customs, beliefs, customs, principles and values. The film seeks integrity and comes to a certain truth to preserve the integrity of the film. <br /> <br /> Part of the comedy is that Freeman plays an unemployed actor who has not worked for four years. In truth, Freeman is such a sought-after actor that he is constantly working. <br /> <br /> The film offers the adventure of bonding, care, sharing, change and exchange. And the results of the film give the viewer some things that the actor has to go through while preparing for the role. <br /> <br /> If necessary, tell your boss that you are taking a "mental health day" and go to see this movie. If you are able, take a significant person or family with you. I rate the movie on 10 out of 10. It is pleasant, interesting, informative, poignant and valuable.
