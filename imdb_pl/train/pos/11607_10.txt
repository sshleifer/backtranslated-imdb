Picture Bride has a perfect look of the past of Hawaii and the people who lived there. Time, money earned and hours that these people put into their lives to live and live gain a whole new meaning for blood, sweat and tears. <br /> <br /> The concept of dating / association is something like what we do today similarly through the web. It's just more snail mail. Very slow snail mail. <br /> <br /> The singing of plantation songs by workers reminds me of the songs of southern plantation workers about their deaths and future goals. <br /> <br /> The film shows the difficulties as well as the soft romantic scenes that Hawaii can bring. Like the silence of the storm and the sudden chaos of rain, and then peace.
