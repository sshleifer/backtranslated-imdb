This story is beautifully preserved. The journey of a young girl is sad and moving to discover where she comes from and where she is going. Stephanie was adopted by her mother's best friend after her mother and father died in a car accident, and since she was called a "miracle child", she is dyslexic and finds life a little difficult. Her discoveries affect her loved ones along the way. Her relationship with the carer and ex-boyfriend of her caregiver are treated very gently and sensitively, and the entire cast is true, three-dimensional and credible. Surrounded by a peach canning factory in a small Australian town, it is a warm, delicate, erotic film that leaves a pleasant feeling when the loans close. After reading a few other, rather shallow comments on Hugo Weaving, I would like to add that I think he was well manned and he was extremely sexy. No, he is not Brad Pitt, but that does not mean he is not attractive.
