ZP is deeply connected with this young dream represented by the hippie movement. The university debate at the beginning of the film presents the cultural situation that generates this movement. The explosion that Daria imagines represents the collapse of all social structures, and thus the development of all this huge transformation that society suffers, and in the end Mark's death foresees the end which A sees for the very movement. The film will be easier to understand if we return to that time in our lives. In the 1960s and 1970s, young people were the driving force behind a deep search for change. One of the more significant changes that were intended was to bring sexuality out of the closet, and I think scenes in the desert do not represent orgies, but sexual relationships that men and women could do in absolute hypothetical situations, where no one could hide. I watched a scene where couples would throw each other's sand and appreciate the wonderful way in which A represented the inability to hide this basic human instinct. Repression was a way to "control" social explosions at the time, and this is the method the police use to stop students. This society suffers from hypocrisy, which is obvious when students gain access to the weapon, bypassing all false controls. The dialogue between a policeman and a college professor who has been detained for no reason shows that part of society is interested in this feeling and some are completely uninterested. Presenting flying as a more accurate symbol of freedom, theft of the plane represents Mark's inner desire, but his (return or return (segun)) shows the difficulty of freeing himself from these ties and how I said that A depicts the death of sleep through these difficulties in winning the game . In my opinion, the movie to remember.
