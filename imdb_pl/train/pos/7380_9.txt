The three main characters are very well represented, especially Anisio after a rock musician who became an actor for the first time Paulo Miklos. He is extremely persuasive as an intruder / invader of a lower class. The film shows the snowball effect very well, engaging in increasingly shady business, contrast and similarities between the lower and upper classes. As everyone is being kidnapped by greed and ambition. 9-9,5 out of 10.
