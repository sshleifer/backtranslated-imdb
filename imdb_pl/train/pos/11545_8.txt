The original movie, The Odd Couple, has some great comics. The whole world seems to know the story of the neurotic neat Felix Ungar and the funny, disgusting Oscar Madison. This pairing of unmatched roommates has created one of the most successful TV series of all time, as well as innumerable, not so good, imitations everywhere. <br /> <br /> Odd Couple has great jokes about Oscar's apartment and his sloppy habits. He says, "Who wants food?" One of his poker players asks: "What do you have?" Oscar says: "I have brown sandwiches and green sandwiches." "What is this brown?" It is either a very new cheese or very old meat! "I also love the line on the Oscar refrigerator:" It was closed for two weeks, I saw milk standing there, which was not even in the bottle! "There is no doubt that Oscar Madison Walter Matthau is a joy to watch on screen, he is almost as good as the version of Jacek Klugman in the television series. <br /> <br /> The problem with the film is Felix Ungar by Jacek Lemmon. very sincere effort in this role. The problem is that he makes Felix so depressing and depressing that he becomes more irritating than comical. Lemmon Unger from Tony can of course be annoying, but in the TV series he refers to specific situations where irritation was needed in the plot Jack's Felix Ungar (note the other spelling) in the movie never seems be happy, funny or inter esting. Film Felix Ungar is a roommate who leads you through the wall all the time. <br /> <br /> The film still has great moments that stand the test of time, the "famous" fight on chops is one of the biggest. scenes ever! One of Felix's other great examples of "small notes" on the Oscar's pillow will be remembered forever. There are, however, darker sides in which Oscar goes up, his "crying" at the end after shouting Felix, and the scene with Felix Linguine's dinner (though lightened up with a funny line) seems more depressing than comical. br /> <br /> Perhaps there was not enough time to see the lighter side of those characters that made the series so memorable in the movie. The beginning of 20 minutes is very boring. The same problem occurs in Felix's conversation with the Pidgeon sisters. The end of the film is predictable and too easy. There is very little care and compassion for each of them by others. As a result, the darker side of the movie leads to depression and anger, not comedy, unless you're watching the wonderful scenes described above. It seems that the monotonous figure of Felix Jack Lemmon brings the film down instead of amplifying or embracing a comedy between characters. <br /> <br /> Really television series from the 70s made The Odd Couple the best one it could be. The original movie is still very good. However, the television series is much better.
