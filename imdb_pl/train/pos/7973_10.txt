Maybe I'm a juice, but it's the sweetest movies ever! I saw it for the first time when I was about 4 or 5 years old and cried my eyes. Between this and now (ashamed at the age of 15) I have seen it over 25 times and I have sobbed each one of them. Do not worry, it's tears of happiness! And that's not all SAP! There is also a lot of humor and comedy in it. Usually, the whole conversation about animals can be huge, but in this movie it is not. My only advice: even if you love it - you do not see the sequence! I suggest everyone check it out ... you will not be sorry, no matter how old you are!
