I chose this movie based on a summary of the plot and critics' quotes on the back of the box. I'm not a big fan of foreign films and I did not know what to expect. I do not care about subtitles either. But I loved it! It has a simple, nice quality that ensures well-being in life. I laughed loudly many times. I recommend this photo to everyone, even those who are disgusted with foreign movies with subtitles. This makes it worth the effort.
