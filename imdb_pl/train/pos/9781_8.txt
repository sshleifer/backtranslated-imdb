I heard for the first time about TEARS OF KALI and it sounded like something that I would appear in, but with all the films I come regularly, it has dropped somewhat from my radar. While wandering around the local WonderBook ... I noticed a box on it and picked it up. I must say that I'm happy that I did it. TEARS OF KALI is a strange, bloody, sometimes even frightening movie, which is somewhat limited by its obviously low budget - but it is still a fun and valuable watch. <br /> <br /> KALI WALES revolve around the fictitious Indian Taylor-Erikkson cult group that practices meditation and other rituals in an effort to face and drive out the "inner demons" of the individual - but apparently these techniques work either too well, or too weak (depending on the point of view ...) as dark forces are not only exorcised, but also released on unfortunate victims. <br /> <br /> The film is said to be "in the anthology style", with a short but unforgettable and "opening eyes" intro sequence, and then going to three stories that form the main part of the film. <br /> <br /> The first (SHAKTI) concerns a journalist who visits one of the members of the cult who is being held in a psychiatric hospital. The journalist is hiding to investigate Taylor-Erikson's cult, but it turns out that her real motives can hit a little closer to home. When the interview takes a sudden turn, the journalist discovers that she could get through her head ... <br /> <br /> The second part (Devi) concerns a brutal young man who was sentenced to psychological rehab in exchange for a prison sentence for beating a young man in a coma. We find that the doctor in question is in fact "Taylor-Erikkson graduate", and his rehabilitation methods are far from normal ... <br /> <br /> The closing tale (KALI) revolves around the charlatan "faith" -healer "and his an assistant who performs "miracles" for a fee. When the healer unknowingly helps one of his clients and actually expels the strength that possessed it, the demon can now roam freely and look for a new host ... <br /> <br /> I must say that I really liked the Tears of KALI. There are some errors in the film that prevent him from getting excellent quality - but it is an original and ambitious film for what it is. My biggest obstacle to production is poor and unremarkable dialogue with dubbing. The copying is below the norm and I would prefer to have the caption option with the original language path. Some reviewers claim that acting is weak, with which I do not necessarily agree. I think that dubbing is so uninterested that it makes the performances appear to be inhibited, which does not really happen. In fact, a few performances are damn chilling in their veins ("doctor" in the second segment, and the "client" in the third easily comes to mind ...) and remarkable. Gore FX are very well made for a low-budget film, with a few graphical scenes of eyelid removal using scissors, a pencil in the throat, suicide, some decent (but irritatingly "shaky") me - playing, and a few other gadgets thrown in for good. It is not as rough as some more extreme movies, but definitely stronger than the average horror movie. I also found an intriguing story about a cult group and a welcome change in the typical nonsense of horror. There are many scenes of real atmosphere and tension that I have not met for some time. Although in many respects it is flawed, I still think TEARS OF KALI will appeal to the majority of "underground" viewers of horror - some scenes may turn out to be too much for the more popular viewer. Definitely recommended - 8.5 / 10
