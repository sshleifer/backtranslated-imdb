Oh, it's cool to watch Silent Classic once in a while! Director Vidor is simply delightful, and even creates a long (at least in 1928) Episodic character. The story is about success in life and the way it changes you. Marion Davies plays a girl who leaves friends in a small comedy studio to become part of a larger dramatic studio. He becomes a big star, and the consequences are that he is truly alienated from the real world. For a moment he even denies his (poor) past! Scenes are just fun, certainly a scene where the main character (Marion Davies) sees ... Marion Davies in college and comes to the conclusion that it does not seem so special ... movies here and for real maniacs it's amazing to see the cameras and materials from those times. Be sure to see if you ask me !!
