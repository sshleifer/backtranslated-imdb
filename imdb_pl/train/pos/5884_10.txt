I really liked it. The assumption was good, the story matched the place where both series ended, and here is my favorite part. Mary and Valerie are not bitter! They are not like others who become synonymous with a series, and then refuse to talk about it or make possible conventions (the best example is Susan Dey, "The Partridge Family"). In fact, Valerie said she would be delighted to take another film, and then Mary would say the same thing later, so I would look for another ... but if it does not work, then I can run it again.
