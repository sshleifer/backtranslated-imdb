The assumption of this story is simple: an old man living alone in the forest accidentally stumbled upon a small child's murder and tries to convince the police that the murder took place. Although there are very few dialogues throughout the film, the visual narration, told only by the camera's eye, made the film quite addictive. Setting the gray wood gives a sense of loneliness, which complements the silence of the heroes. We can also feel the helplessness of the old man's inability to convince the police about the murder, which is analogous to the inability to silence the child to tell his own story. <br /> <br /> The real horror lies in a sense of hopelessness, helplessness and irrationality. This film successfully applies to these elements only through visualizations, instead of relying on cheap sound effects or blood and blood that other bad horrors use when the narrative is weak. <br /> <br /> Skilfully the story develops at a slow pace to build up tension for a few frightening and surprising moments. The ending is also unexpected and reliable. Recalling Japanese horrors such as "The Ring" and "Dark Water" or English horrors, such as "Lady in Black" and "The Innocents", this movie provides viewers with a real horror atmosphere. I recommend it to anyone who likes a good chill to fear the bones to try this movie. <br /> <br /> By the way, if you have not seen the films I mentioned above, you can give them a try as well.
