I saw this movement on ENCW for the last time for the third or fourth time. I liked it so much that I ordered a DVD. It's really special and of course the first Mann-Stewart pair. More here than the usual oater, although not as powerful as The Searchers. Lots of obvious symbols about the achievement of masculinity, but above all the acting of Stewart, his partner Millard Mitchell, Shelly Winters and Waco Johnny Dean-Dan Duryea. Steve Miller (not Joker) is interesting, because handsome would be a hero who is interested in Lola, but he is too yellow. Like Stewart in The Man Who Killed Liberty Valance, it is practically limited to setting up an apron and serving hostile coffee. Decaffeinated without any doubt. Tony Curtis from Bronx Cavalry and Rock Hudson acting like no other Indian I have seen on the screen have interesting scenes. <br /> <br /> Special performances by John McIntire as a too lucky card dealer / arms dealer who hangs on a very low rating of the western version of Rick's American Cafe. Nobody wants to spend the night there. Jay C. Flippens by Lola's kiss (Winters) and has some cool scenes with Stewart before he reaches Bend of the River and Far Country. Will Geer as Wyatt Earp and an Indian chief who takes Walter Brennan's teeth in the Red River, are pleasant observations. This is the western, which only Stewart, not Wayne and Scott could not tear. Worth the shot, I repeat. :-)
