I started riding very recently and like everyone who has ever traveled, I should have known I fell in love with horses and their world. I hired the Spirit for the whims, trying to pack my life full of horse-related materials as I could, and I was surprised by the results. <br /> <br /> I was expecting a good Disney movie with talking animals and stereotypes every five minutes. <br /> <br /> I got an amazing movie, full of beautiful scenery and animation, and an amazing story that has great potential to warm my heart. <br /> <br /> Spirit is a wild mustang in the Old West, whose whole world is falling apart around him, when he discovers that people slowly take over his homeland. The story takes place in a wide range of characters, some people, some animals, everything is well written, and most are pleasant to watch on the screen. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good story and who has an appreciation for history and animals. <br /> <br /> One thing I forgot to mention, but I think it is important, is that the animals in this movie do not talk. It was a really nice holiday from the Lady And The Tramp animated films that everyone is used to.
