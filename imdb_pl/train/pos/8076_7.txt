The family is about two families that are after each other. <br /> <br /> Viren Sahay (Amitabh Bachchan) is a don underground world, working in Bangkok. He has a family in India. Once she accidentally kills Shekhar (Akshay Kumar). Like Viren Sahay, he also has a family (brother, wife and parents). Aryan (Aryaman), brother of Szekhara, will take revenge on his brother's death. For the same reason, he kidnaps the Virena Sahaya family. <br /> <br /> The film has one turning point (Amitabh Bachchan). The second half of the film belongs to him completely, where expression is more important than dialogues. The small role of Akshay also gave him an equal position with Amitabh. I did not understand what Bhumika Chawala is doing in this movie. <br /> <br /> There were a few loose points in the script; like; Amitabh was recognized as the most wanted criminal in the city, and he is still free from damage in the city. Kidnapping his family also seemed unclear. How can a family of such a large don have no protection?
