Another excellent Arnold movie. This futuristic movie has a great action in it and is one of Arnie's best films. Arnold is framed in this movie as a bad guy and plays the game of death. This movie is perfect and a great science-fiction / action movie. I've always liked this movie and it has to be one of the greatest adventure movies of all time. 10 out of 10! PERFECTION
