** Note - this post may contain spoilers ** <br /> <br /> I got the Gamecube only in September 2005, and the first two games I bought were James Bond games, a decent Fire Agent and a blunt Goldeneye Rogue Agent . The next game I was planning was Everything or Nothing, because my friend told me that it was better than the two games I already had. I must say he was right. <br /> <br /> I bought it for ten times in HMV, and when I got home, I put it in my ankle and played it for hours. It was much better than in my other two games and there was a much better and more interesting plot. The graphics were one of the best I've seen (but now that the XBOX 360 has appeared, Farcry Instincts Predator has one of the best known graphics for a human). The plot was clever; a crazy man (Willem Dafoe, named as Nikolai Diavolo) and a beautiful woman (Heidi Klum, named Katya Nadanova), try to destroy the world with small nanobots, which at the beginning of the game, you, James Bond, you must destroy the Train. The bad thing is that one of them is hidden in Katya's tits. You must then thwart their plans and save the world. <br /> <br /> The great thing about this game is that actors express characters like Cleese's voice. There are 27 levels, some of them short and some of them quite long and complicated. <br /> <br /> Gameplay - 10/10 Graphics - 9/10 Sound - 9/10 Repeat Value - 7/10 Multiplayer - 8/10 <br /> <br /> I give this game a total of 90%
