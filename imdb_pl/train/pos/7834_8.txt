See also my comment for Die Nibelungen part 1: Siegfried. <br /> <br /> The second part of the gigantic production of the Nibelungen saga in the UFA studio is continued in a stylized, symphonic and emotionally detached way from the predecessor. However, while the first part was a dispassionate representation of individual acts of heroism, the second part is a chaotic representation of large-scale blood-letting. <br /> <br /> As in the first part, the director Fritz Lang maintains a continuous dynamic rhythm, with the pace of action and the complexity of the composition of shots rising and falling smoothly, as required by the tone of each scene. These photos should only be viewed with the perfect note of Gottfried Huppertz, who fortunately is on DVD Cinema. Now that the focus has been on mass action, Lang has more challenges in staging. Action sequences in its earliest elements were often poorly constructed, but now it simply makes them part of this rhythmic flow, with the level of activity on the swelling screen like an orchestra. <br /> <br /> But just as part one made us Siegfried's adventures matterfully and without excitement, the second part presents the war as a devastating tragedy. In both photos there is a deliberate lack of emotional connection with the heroes. That's why Lang usually keeps the camera out of action, never letting us feel as if we were there (which is important because the involvement of the audience is usually the distinction of Lang's work). That is why the performances are unnaturally theatrical, and the actors jump like lunaticists. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, Kriemhild's revenge constantly copes with emotions and is in fact deeply humanistic. The only moment of naturalism is that Atilla holds his son for the first time, and Lang really emphasizes the sensitivity of this scene, building it with wild, crazy huns. The point is, Lang never manipulates us on the side, and in this respect, this version has more in common with the original saga than Wagner's opera. The climax is the antithesis of the thrilling battle scene. Why, then, Hitler and colleagues? to be so broke that it wrongly damaged the reputation of these films? Because the unwavering racist ideology of the Nazis made them automatically see the Nibelungs as good, even if they kill children and betray their relatives. For Hitler, their fall will always be a nationalist and not a human tragedy. <br /> <br /> But for us, not Nazi viewers, what makes this picture pleasant is a beautiful sense of spectacle and musical rhythm. When you see these fully-developed silent pictures of Lang, you realize how much you have been wasted in Hollywood. Instead of saddling him with low-budget potboilers, they should have led him to work on some epic swords and sandals, images that do not have to be credible and do not have to emotionally move us, where there is a poetic, operatic tonality that embraces us.
