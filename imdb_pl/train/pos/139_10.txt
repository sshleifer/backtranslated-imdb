First of all, Riget is great. A good comedic and mysterious thriller at the same time. A nice combination of the strange style of "dogmatic" story telling with good music and great actors. But unfortunately there is no "end". It's unacceptable to me. I thought ... how will it be possible to continue the story without Helmer and Drusse? ... and I have an idea. I think Lars should change RIGET III a bit. I'm sure the third part without Helmer would not be the same. Here is my suggestion. Mayble a bit stupid, maybe not. I know Lars likes to experiment. So why not make a small experiment with Riget3? I think the only solution is to create a doll-driven animation (such as Trey Parker's "America America") or even a computer 3D animation. I know it's not the same as real actors, but basically I believe it can work ... only in this way is it possible to relaunch the actors. For Riget fans, it should not be so big differences - if the animation is done in a good way, the average "observer" will consider it normal after the first few films. History is the most important thing now. Understandably, you can not currently create Rigetu 3 with actors. So why not play with animation? And ... look for the opportunities that give you! Even marketing! The great director ends his trilogy after 10 years using a puppet animation. Just dreams? <br /> <br /> I hope one day I will see Riget 3 ... or even see the script. I am curious how this story ends ... and as I expect - everyone here does. <br /> <br /> pozdrawiam, slajd <br /> <br /> ps: I'm not talking about Stephen King's "hospital kingdom" ;-)
