Personally, I really liked this movie and it moved me particularly. The two main actors give us such great performances that in the end it really breaks the heart to know what has finally become their heroes. <br /> <br /> The alchemy between Barry Streisand and Kris Kristofferson is wonderful, the song is just great. <br /> <br /> That's why I did not feel surprised when I learned that he won 5 golden prizes (the most awarded film in Golden Globes), Oscar and even Grammy. This film is a classic that deserves to be seen by everyone. A great movie that was often criticized (perhaps because Streisand dared to engage him, certainly as a "co-director"). Her craft is the biggest and you'll love it!
