Summer was so full of hits and returns of movies, not to mention the disappointments of these returns, that I could not find a movie that I could just sit and enjoy. <br /> <br /> In case you do not want to read further down the page (there are no spoilers), I will summarize it here: It is more mature than Ella Enchanted (there are some brutally brutal parts, a lot of death and a handful of scenes with a bit of blood, not for small children), but they do not try to be too banal or exceed their limits. Think of it as a more serious, slightly more magical princess, and you'll be close. <br /> <br /> ------------------------------------------ ------------------- <br /> <br /> Perhaps I'm not such a wonderful filmmaker as others ... Maybe once or twice a month if I feel active. I'm also a big fan of Sci-Fi / Fantasy. I'm bored of repeating repeating feature lines and movies with more flash than filling faster than you can count to 10, and this movie is a raw diamond. <br /> <br /> Towards the end here (August), I was tired of broken expectations because of the big hits I avoided seeing Bourne Ultimatum in Star dust. Having my hopes completely mixed up by Transformers for my Fiction addiction, Star Dust's announcements seemed attractive, but I was certainly cautious. <br /> <br /> Like many others here, I was completely surprised. I was wondering whether to see another stereotypical fantasy movie from that moment until breakfast. Do not be fooled, it's definitely a fairy tale and it really has witches, magic and it absolutely requires suspension of disbelief ... But the most refreshing thing I've found is that it's NOT based on anything I've seen or read in the last 15 years and this is a really good movie. <br /> <br /> ((Unlike 90% of other movies that seem to persist in appearing like thorns on the side, maybe I can say that this year Hollywood ends the idea? I could read the book this year, and in two years the film will appear as another "epic fantasy tale, as in WP and the rest", says NYT and such and no doubt.)) <br /> <br /> Stardust did not make me pushed away in my place because of the crowded action at every turn, nor did I sweat myself with bullets because of the hook on the hook, which threatened to tear the dramatic tension and echo throughout the theater in a loud roar. He did not even use huge gusts of sound to draw attention to what's happening on the screen (Transformers, I look at you). He does not try to show the latest CGI techniques, nor does he offend my intelligence with dark dialog boxes and story lines that are quite simple. I could get them in the third grade (boy I hate). <br /> <br /> I just ... I watched. I watched and enjoyed the refreshing story unfolding in front of my eyes. Of course, I could know what's going to happen over most of the movie, but that makes you forget about it. It made my heart start to spin in some parts, but the most important aspect that I noticed is that I left the theater better than when I walked in. <br /> <br /> It really is a gem. After so many mud this summer, with so many alterations and movies that did not meet my expectations, it was like a cold sweet cup of tea that would stop all the hard work I had done while sitting by others, trying to get my money out of them. <br /> <br /> Probably not for everyone, but do yourself a favor; If you like fantasy movies that stand the test of time alone (Princess Bride, Black Cauldron, The Dark Crystal, etc.), you should really see this movie. This little diamond goes to my DVD collection, as soon as it hits stores, you can trust me. <br /> <br /> Just wonderful.
