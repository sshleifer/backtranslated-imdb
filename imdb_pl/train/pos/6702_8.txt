Even if there are no new episodes and they are rarely shown. I loved the magic of Sabrina and the teenage witch. I've never seen the last episodes, but I want to know what happened to Miles or Josh? And why did your aunts have to disappear from the show for good? I'm sure the ending was perfect. But there are many unanswered questions. And I want to see the last episode of S.T.T.W! Because I heard that he decides between Erin and Harvey on their wedding day! I really hope she will choose Harvey! And I can say that Nate Richart is HOTT !! It is a pity he is too old for me. Melissa Joan Hart has her own sense of attraction, which adds to the show, but there are many small "stupid" things on the show, such as how famous bands come out of nowhere and play songs, and the whole cast listens, it's kind of stupid. Besides, the cat starts really defective, as the show continued, the jokes started to be just stupid, and the things that the audiences controlled by the audio would laugh at would think that it is so bad. Do not get me wrong, in some parts it was fun, but I think the program just lost its "magic" to speak as it showed up. I pay homage to all the people I have, although I tried, although the girl Frye from the Moon Soleil did not have a taste, and she was a terrible actress. I wonder what Melissa is doing now or any of the cast, now that the concert is over.
