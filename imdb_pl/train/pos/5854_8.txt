This game is fun and has a story that you can expect in comics. Spider-man was framed by a mysterious cheater. The city is dominated by a strange gas, and symbiotes such as Venom and Carnage appear in the whole city. Who is behind these crimes? Could this be Doc Ock? It seems that he has turned the new leaf. Venom also does not seem to be involved because it is simply marked that Spider-Man apparently cost him quite a good opportunity to take a picture. Well scenarios of other heroes and a lot of villains later Spidey will unravel the mystery. The fight is simple, it's not easy to pick it up, fighting with bosses is rather fun. You can collect comics, you've run out of network and it's a bit of fun traversing the city. However, this is also a weak point. The swing is not as great as everything you do is float in the city when Spider-Man apparently attaches his nets to the sky. You also do not have too many phrases on the net, especially when compared to the Spider-Man 2 video game. Still, it makes up for the rather bad game with other elements, especially history. So get ready for Scorpion, Rhino, Venom, Mysterio, Doctor Octopus and Carnage for one crazy action.
