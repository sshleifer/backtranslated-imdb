I saw this movie for the first time in the 1980s and now in 2006. This movie is still one of the best movies I've ever seen! I recommend everyone to look at this movie. You will not be sorry. It is well-played, true and never boring. Acting is great, and the location makes the movie look like you're there. From the beginning to the end, this movie is the type that makes you lose your attention. The actress is great at presenting the girl who survived this terrible plane crash in the Amazon and shows how she managed to survive in the Amazon alone. It's unbelievable that someone can survive in such conditions. That's why this movie is so attractive. The fact that it is a real story makes the film even more interesting, and thinking that a young girl can survive this test is overwhelming. I find this movie that I can watch over and over and never tire. It's a compliment because I have hundreds of movies! I'd say it's probably my favorite movie and the best I've ever seen!
