I just watched Antwone Fisher on BRAVO. What an amazing movie and an amazing young man. This film is obligatory for anyone who overcomes violence and abandoning children in adulthood. Denzel Washington bets on an outstanding performance, like the young man who plays Antwone Fisher. Kleenex alert - Feel good and cry. The most crucial moment is that he finally meets his mother, who was taken at the age of 2 months. And one of the most courageous was that he stood up for his offensive mother and sister. I saw this movie on Bravo in 2008 and I would just like to know about it years ago. Definitely a movie to be added to my DVD collection.
