Huge multiple chills in the spine! I'm surprised that people did not like it! I saw it at 10 am and I was still afraid! I've seen hundreds of thrillers / horror movies! I am 22 years old for loud crying! I mean, OK, voice acting, not very good, probably even a b-movie. But a real expression of terror, sound effects, flow! From the very beginning, hitting you again and again with unyielding, merciless, terrorizing scenes! So many stereotypes, but none will surprise / scare you! You know it's coming, coming, coming, BOO! and you're still jumping off the chair. Grab your pillow and blanket, call your nearest friend and do not watch it at night! Hats off to the Japanese!
