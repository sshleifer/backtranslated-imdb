Pleasant history of the Pimlico community in London, which after the explosion of an non-explosive bomb from World War II, finds a Royal Charter stating that the area in which they live is part of Burgundy. <br /> <br /> This movie works because it appeals to the fantasy that many of us have about creating our own rules and not listening to them. A solid cast of British strongmen, especially Stanley Holloway, makes it more reliable. <br /> <br /> There are very nice moments in the film, for example, when people have exhausted their supplies and other Londoners, the other side of the barricade is starting to throw food and other things to them. <br /> <br /> Even if you always knew that Pimlico would become part of Great Britain again, the people from Plicice and consequently, the viewer does not mind when it happens, leaving a nice feeling of happiness. <br /> <br /> It's amazing that these low-budget films from a small studio in London are still so popular for over 50 years. The producers had to have something good.
