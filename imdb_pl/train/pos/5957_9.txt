The title says it all. <br /> <br /> I am not a film critic, nor will I act like the rest of the snobbish people commenting on this movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, this movie does not have a budget of millions, but the plot was very well made, the acting was amazing and the photos were great! It looked like everyone had a great time creating this movie! I voted for 9 out of 10 because the sound was strong only on one channel instead of on both, but I imagine it could be a bug in DVD recording. <br /> <br /> For sure I will check other films produced by Brain Damage Films! <br /> <br /> Dylan O'Leary, cast and crew, thank you!
