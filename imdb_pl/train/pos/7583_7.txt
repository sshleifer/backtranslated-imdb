The final chapter of the "Hanzo the Razor" trilogy ensures the proper closure of this fun series of stunts. Inoue replaces Yasuzu Masumura (Blind Beast, Red Angel, Manji) in the director's chair, but the style is almost the same, perhaps because of Shintaro Katsu serving as a producer, in addition to the titular antihero. <br /> <br /> Hanzo discovers the feminine spirit that watches over the hidden treasure at the bottom of the lake. Of course, Hanzo as Hanzo is not discouraged by the fact that he is a ghost, so he begins to rape ... hm, interrogate her using a now known rotating network device. The action takes place through a series of blind monks who also double as lenders, corrupt officials, dissolute wives and the necessary hack and slash. Higher officer Hanzo, Onishi and his two servants, deliver typical comedic notes, and in general, business as usual. <br /> <br /> Much less intricate and easier to follow than the first (which is everywhere and a bit of a mess), less stylish, dramatic and bloody than the second (probably the best in the Hanzo series), but still fun and valuable due to your advantages. Complete with training sequences on trademarks, compulsory rape, sword fights and the secret that Hanzo has to investigate, he will ultimately please the fans.
