You can only imagine a movie that Mr. Welles could have finished without the interference of the studio! This movie is defective Welles, but worth every minute because you can see the size of perhaps the best American movie director of all time! <br /> <br /> We see the harvest brought by Orson Welles while filming this movie. History has many holes in it, perhaps because of the studio's management requirements, which did not trust the director. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to read some of the IMDB opinions that compare Orson Welles with the Coen brothers, Roman Polanski and even Woody Allen, when all directors must be considered supporters of the Grand Master himself. No one was more original and creative in the history of American cinema than Mr. Welles. We're lucky that we still have his legacy in a retrospective look like the one that just ended the New York Film Forum, or his films on tape or DVD. <br /> <br /> Rita Hayworth has never been more beautifully photographed than here. If she was a beauty with red hair, as a blonde, she is too stunned for words. Everett Sloan and Glenn Anders made a great contribution to the film. <br /> <br /> The only thing that could make this movie another masterpiece that should be added to the work of Orson Welles was his own appearance. If he concentrated on directing and if another actor interpreted Michael O'Hara, he could achieve a completely different movie. Orson Welles must be considered a pioneer in moving the camera from the studio to the street. The visualizations in this film are so amazing that we leave the theater after seeing the film, really impressed by the work, vision and talent he gave us.
