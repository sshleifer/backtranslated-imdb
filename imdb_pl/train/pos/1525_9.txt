Seeing the latest version of Peter O'Toole, I was ready to admire the intelligent magazine in this version. I spend a little time fighting, which I prefer. Instead, we were presented with many motives underlying both French and English politicians (who had Normandy) and priests who killed her. Even the worst of them all, the archbishop, leaves us with the thought that "Of course she was innocent. The innocent have always had to suffer because of the ambition of the powerful. She had no idea what she was saying, she had no idea about the implications of blasphemy or going against the church. Not a scholar, she did not know what the church's position was in such matters. <br /> <br /> Preminger was faithful to the myths surrounding her death and I appreciated the preview on the tape showing the flames reaching and burning. Why? In the film, they used gas nozzles, and 2 of them were stopped. Suddenly the air pressure broke the downtime and the flames jumped on her. Fortunately for her, they did not have to repeat the shot because it was so realistic: it was burnt !! A pretty traumatic introduction for Iowa's girlfriend for her new acting career. <br /> <br /> John Gielgud performed excellently. He is an English politician who orchestrates the program. He also points out that by condemning someone to death, you do not want to be around to see how they die. The next time you can turn back from the "duty" ... not that such delicacies would disturb the soul of our would-be president. We Christians, even the most anti-Semites, have no problem with the Old Testament in terms of the death penalty, even though it has been replaced by the words of Jesus. Bring them to public executions, such as this little girl. Sucking the burned body can bring us esteemed people to the senses of our souls. <br /> <br /> The only small "choice" I have about this movie is that we have not been shown why the priest who was so adamant, insisted on burning her becomes so suddenly repentant, even madness. There should be more expansion of his character, more dialogue - how sudden "repentance" does not make sense. <br /> <br /> And whether Graham Greene does it on purpose or not, St. Joan is so self-confident, but almost, but not quite, I'm glad that she meets her favor. And when she rejected life in prison, for some reason I thought about Anne Sexton, the poet who accused Sylvia Plath of "stealing her death" when she committed suicide ... knowing that such action guarantees immortality. You have to think about it! <br /> <br /> If there has ever been a good example of obsessive thoughts and tight compartments, this is one. St. Joanna should have become a Buddhist and mute "voices in her mind."
