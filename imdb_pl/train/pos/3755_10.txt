I remember this movie from many years ago. Certainly the best film on this subject in my experience. The fact that I have remembered so much film for so long after such a long time testifies to its influence. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to comment on the level of performances due to the language barrier. But they were still very powerful. <br /> <br /> This topic still fascinates us, even over the years. And here it was treated most effectively, with an appropriate proportion of historical perspective and skepticism. <br /> <br /> I would like it to be shown at least once on television. Or at least be available on tape or DVD. Or is it? Does any archive of artistic films collect its copy?
