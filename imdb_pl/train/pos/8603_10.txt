The film is fantasy. The plot is thin, but it serves as a structure on which you can sing and sing great songs. (I still can not believe that such handsome and attractive people can sing well.) Some of the dialogues are wonderfully clever. The costumes made me feel like I was watching a haute couture fashion show from 1942. <br /> <br /> Movies are meant for different purposes. This one is intended for entertainment and certainly yes. If I had one negative comment, it would be that Nelson Eddy was a bit too old for a handsome count. Some close-ups made me feel uncomfortable. But he could still sing and sing wonderfully. However, Jeanette MacDonald was as brilliant as ever. He makes a spectacular angel. <br /> <br /> This genre is well before my time, and I'm new to Jeanette MacDonald / Nelson Eddy and related conversations. The music in this film is beautiful. Although I love classical rock music that fills most of contemporary movies, I have no doubt that this music is simply and clearly more memorable, more delightful, better constructed. The stars in this movie are more talented than the stars I see today in cinemas. And Jeanette MacDonald, without the benefit of the Beverly Hills plastic surgeons, was more beautiful than the stars I see today. I'm not sure why so many other posters apologize for liking this movie, and more generally for this group of movies. They say it is dated and try to explain why it is. And those who do not like it say that it is not very good, but compared to what? I think that this film will undoubtedly be entertaining when you forget about many other movies. There is too much quality in this movie so that you can not remember it and enjoy it. I recommend this film unreservedly to anyone who appreciates great talent, great beauty and great music.
