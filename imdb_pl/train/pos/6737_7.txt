The director and two LAURA stars (1944) were re-registered for this solid policeman: Dan Andrews is the son of a criminal who becomes a police officer who cuts all ties with the past, but can not stop inherited violent ways during interrogation of suspects and one night follows far; Gene Tierney is a detached wife of his victim, a war hero who got involved in the fight with the main city activist and Andrews nemesis # 1, Gary Merrill (who himself was Andrews Snr's protégé)! As usual with Preminger, it is a well-prepared film with a noticeable initial sequence and animated by a good cast, including Karl Malden (as the dominant Andrews superior), Tom Tully (as the taxi-driver Tierney) and Neville Brand (as the main bandit Merrill), significant support also coming from Craig Stevens (as a slimy, victim of beating his wife), Bert Freed (as a friendly partner to Andrews) and Robert F. Nolan (as a raw Andrews deputy). After he warned them to fix his actions, Andrews panics and impersonates Stevens for a few hours after his assassination, to put the police on (in this case) the wrong paths of Merrill; however, after Tully becomes the main suspect (at the time Andrews and Tierney are romantically bound), the policeman goes to Merrill's lair himself, fully wanting to push back and "frame" the investigator for his own murder! Apparently, the hero is a complex character, and Andrews faces a challenge thanks to the first-class characteristics that is usually complemented by Fox Noir's internal style.
