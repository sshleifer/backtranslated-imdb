I felt that I had to answer the comments on the first page of this video because some of them were somewhat misleading. <br /> <br /> I originally posted quotes from the original poster, but I was not sure if it was appropriate because it is an "comments" index, not a notice board (although we used them in this way before IMDb added a movie notice boards), so I will change it to make it unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Well, first of all, you may not be aware of it, but Gene Kelly became famous for playing the first time with "Pal Joey" on Broadway in original production. When Vincente Minnelli decided to shoot Gershwin's "panorama", he wanted Kelly to be more sophisticated than the "goody two shoes" he played in most of his films (except for "For Me and My Gal"). Alan Jay Lerner was instructed to build a new story based in Paris based on the story of "Pal Joey." This gave Kelly the chance to play his famous Broadway role, even though Warners broke MGM for the rights to "Pal Joey." In my opinion the WB "Pal Joey" movie is a wreck, although Sinatra was suitable for this role, but other problems have sunk the film (scenario changes and poor direction ============== ===== ================================ <br /> <br /> You complain that Kelly's photos are not well done, even referring to your art education to prove it, but you miss the fact that Kelly's evil art was clearly designed to be bad and necessary for the plot / character The pictures are so bad that the public knows that Kelly is not ready he even knows it even though Milo has something that he almost believed in. But it's important that the audience does not sit there saying "but he's a great artist, if only he had a chance!". You want the audience she was fully aware of his shortcomings. <br /> <br /> Then you complain that he is sabotaging his interest in the show, again you do not understand the structure of the recitation history ia, because you do not want to feel gigolo, and because he knows that he is not really ready for the exhibition. His enthusiasm for the exhibition is certainly not as great as Joey's enthusiasm to "set up a nightclub." But it fulfills the same function in the story. Remember that in "Pal Joey" (art) it is important that Joey quit the night club after he realized that he did not deserve it. The same with the art show. If Kelly's paintings were really good, it would undermine the whole point. ================================================== = <br /> <br /> Then you complain that Caron and Kelly do not have "chemistry". I think it is in the eye of the beholder. I agree, the chemistry between them is not as strong as it should be, but it was fine for me. Compare this with even worse "forced" romances, such as the romance between Cary Grant and Sophia Loren in "Pride and Passion." ================================================== == <br /> <br /> When you say that the grand finale of the dance has nothing to do with anything else in this movie, it simply shows that you did not dig under the surface of the film in its symbolism. Many elements in the dance sequence refer to the story and the characters, and through the dance the plot is solved through images and symbolism. It's about finding love, enjoying love and then losing love (he looks around and his love is gone). The movements of the symphonies are constructed in such a way that part of each dance scene reflects a separate phase of Parisian art as well as a separate phase of their relationship. If you have not seen it, it is not the film's fault. Certainly not a "shit load". ==================================================
