The first movie had small ambitions, so nothing was left on the screen. It was a bad version of "Back to the Future" with zero charm. After accepting the fact that Bill and Ted are filaments, the joke can be hit by the audience for so long before it collapses. <br /> <br /> This is a surprise. This is the only warning of spoilera ... <br /> <br /> According to today's standards, it is more fun. It was avoided after the release, sad, considering that there are more talents involved than the first time. We get a photographer "Face / Off", the editor of "Fugitive", the set designer from early works of Burton and the sound designer "Matrix". <br /> <br /> The writers made up their tiles for the first trip with something deep. Because the fanbase and the audience avoided it, the director probably decided that the style was too extreme. It is not, it suits the material. Like "Death Becomes Her" and "Catch-22", it dares to be wise, but we like our "simple" films, so we do not buy them. Probably because he dared to be different, that's why 12 manufacturers needed it. What is so good? <br /> <br /> - A good reference to Keanu; from the airhead to the Messiah. See also Arnold Schwarzenegger. <br /> <br /> - Joss hates his creations as much as he hates his counterparts, makes his own hatred. The Evil B & T and "good works" have the same vocabulary as their originals: smaller copies and depreciation of the language. <br /> <br /> - The theme of "duality". Nowhere else is this as obvious as in photographic styles, a lot of high and low angles. They even use Roy Brocksmith from "Total Recall" to emphasize the point. <br /> <br /> - The 'choices' theme. I do not know where it started in this genre (maybe "Ghostbusters"), but it's pretty well used here. It comes down to 7 games against death - Battleship and Club. <br /> <br /> - A reference to the movie, even present in the game against Death (Clue). It's smarter than Tarantino or Brooks. Look at the cover of the Premier magazine at the end: "Bill and Ted: The Movie". It is also ironic that Death and Nomolos were villains in the sequels of "Die Hard" and "Lethal Weapon". <br /> <br /> I still have some tiny nits, but nothing compared to the original. Music and film are different media, so it does not make sense why many scenarios revolve around the former - especially on the teen market. Carlin is a great comedian, but he is wasted in these films. Also, despite these bold shows, even breaking gay jokes can not kill a cat? <br /> <br /> So, although it looks like Nickelodeon's production, it's very interesting. We have Beavis and Butta-Head from this movie. "We are in Heaven and we just attacked three people." <br /> <br /> Final analysis = = Midrange
