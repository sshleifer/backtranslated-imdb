After tracking it for half a year, I finally found a copy and it was not disappointing. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed because I am one of those hard-working SMAP fans who have to see all their work and I finally saw the so-called Goro hot movie. But I could not believe that Goro was forced to make the film as such. I am sure that in his self-respecting "I" he takes pains to make this film. Nevertheless, they found the perfect person who most of the time looked embarrassed, relaxed and half depressed. <br /> <br /> Man, I still can not believe that he made this film ... eyes in many parts not believing that he really did such a movie .... hahahaha .... <br /> <br / > But I'm glad I watched it. Thank God he grew up ....
