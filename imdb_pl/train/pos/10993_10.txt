This film is a jewel because it moves with a gentle but decisive resolution. <br /> <br /> I warn viewers that although it is a corporate spy thriller, and Ms. Liu is there, she moves in a deliberately deliberate but calming pace. It's not about explosions, car chases or flying bullets. You must be patient and take note of the details here instead. It's calming because it's the main character. The viewer must watch him and think when this story develops. <br /> <br /> I will not give spoilers - because it destroys the viewing point. The plot is what you read from other posts: the average white-collar guy looking for change and adventure signs for corporate spy work. Just go somewhere and secretly record and send internal data. <br /> <br /> Take it from there. <br /> <br /> This film begins in a surreal walk - the ground of corporate disappointment, which intertwines with quintessence, underlying suburban paranoia. <br /> <br /> Then it starts to speed up. <br /> <br /> Acting on all parts is great - and yes, some of the acts are caricatured. But they all fit and play. And the light piano rhythm in the background is just perfect as a delicate, sinister subject: everything is not right at first. <br /> <br /> And finally: everything is not what it seems. /> <br /> Feel comfortable and turn off the light to watch this - and turn up the sound: This movie wants you to LISTEN.
