WINCHESTER 73 is a story about a man (Jimmy Stewart) who is obsessed with regaining a valuable estate, a repetitive rifle produced by Winchester. The rifle changes hands, and Stewart stubbornly holds it. This black and white effort by Anthony Mann in 1950 is more of a crime film than a traditional western, and cowboys often seem more contemporary gangsters than old-fashioned cowboys. Shelley Winters plays a woman of dubious power who goes to the ranch with a man (Charles Drake) whom he can marry. It ends for Stewart, but not in front of her. Winters is the most complex character in the film filled with unusual characters. Watch out for young Dan Dureyea as the killer of nuts and Tony Curtis in a very small role. Will Geer, pitifully ill-tested, plays Wyatt Earp.
