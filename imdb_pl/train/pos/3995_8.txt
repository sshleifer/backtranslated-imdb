Kureishi has not been thoroughly blessed with films that justify the quality of his writing. The recently adapted parody is "Intimacy" ruined great writing. But Mother surpasses all previous incarnations, even eclipsing My Beautiful Laundrette. A middle-aged woman defeats a widow, having a very carnal relationship with the boyfriend of her emotionally weak daughter. The fact that you believe all of this is due to the quality of action, as well as the finite gift of writing. And with Daniel Craig, we have a proud, brazen, rough antihero who denies the audience ever wondering why the young stud dog is considering the bedding of his drowsy grandmother. A beautifully filmed movie fails only in a poor image of peripheral characters, but as a study of inconceivable lust is a winner.
