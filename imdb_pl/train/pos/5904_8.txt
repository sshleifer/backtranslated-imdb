I've been waiting for this movie for a long time. This promotion gave a good idea of ​​the content, and when I finally saw it, it really happened well. Most conventional romantic movies end with the fact that lovers eventually get married or start a happy life after marriage, but there is really a great adjustment needed for this transition from old life to a new relationship and life. Here's what this movie is about when the newlyweds Fardeen and Esha get married in an arranged marriage and start their honeymoon. Acting is really binding, although I think that Esha was a bit quiet and could use certain lines for herself. The story was well sewn together, and the dialogues were more or less appropriate. The editing and the director were also good, Meghna Gulzar did a really good job. In conclusion, I would say it is a good romance drama, a real combination of what Bollywood can offer to a pure artist.
