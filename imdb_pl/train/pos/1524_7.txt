This film is a class that should be classical. Certainly not perfect. The tempo, although perfect for the stage, is in the form of a slow film like a turtle with arthritic knees. Jean Seberg is badly aimed at being too sweet and too mild. It fully shows enough talent for acting, skills and craftsmanship to convince in a wise, passionate and confident Joan, but unfortunately the director did not get to the heart of the character. George Bernard Shaw is my favorite playwright. In no other game his dialog was more sharp and the lines more musical. However, the processing of this movie requires you to look at him as a lawyer. This film is a coincidence and the viewer is a judge. In this way, you can enjoy this picture. 7/10.
