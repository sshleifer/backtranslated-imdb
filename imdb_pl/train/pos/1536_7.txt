The tighter the drama, the better the film of sisterly competition! This little gem was promoted mainly as a comedy after the premiere in Sweden, so I'm glad that it was not so full. Funny bits in quarrels in a small town will certainly enjoy, but the drama takes place in the spotlight, as the story progresses. And not only family drama, but also moving questions about respecting the differences in people's lifestyles. <br /> <br /> A great team of characters with many wonderful and moving dramatic scenes that gain credibility points; and they are not only scattered, but they keep everything in their place. It just makes me think that if Ingmar Bergman did it (drama would suit him!), International attention would probably be immediate. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 with Ozjeppe.
