The famous orchestra conductor, Daniel Dareus, suffers from a heart attack when he finished the concert. Suddenly, we watch him when he comes to a small town he left years ago. Because he has gone so young and changed his name, he contributes to giving him a new character. He bought an old school building where he plans to stay. The building requires a lot of work. One would expect a man in his position to have all the comforts of the world that he left to be installed in the new seat, but no, Daniel endures the harsh winter in his own way. <br /> <br /> The local pastor, Stig, whose church has a small choir, is calling to see if he can be interested in Daniel, but the conductor does not want to go back to the music. Daniel begins to explore his new universe. People from the city leave him alone. He makes an impression on Lena, who works in a local store, where he goes for food supplies. He gradually comes and decides to get involved in the choir. Lena will eventually fall in love with Daniel. <br /> <br /> Initially, the relationship between Daniel and members of the choir is not exactly what he expected. When they get to know him better, they come to accept him and make him one of them. His new position does not make him think of a woman who was in power. Members of the choir are passionate, but they are aware of the changes Daniel introduced in the way of interpreting different songs. A new piece composed for Gabriella, a battered wife, has a huge impact on her life and her singing friends. <br /> <br /> Daniel's ideas for the clash of the repertoire with his own Stig. The Vicar suddenly begins to see Daniel in a new light; he is a tormented man who likes to read pornographic magazines before he loves his wife Siv. His ideas conflict with dogma, as Siv points out to him. Stig decides to stop what he considers the unhealthy influence of Daniel by firing at the head of the choir. <br /> <br /> The choir, who was invited to participate in the competition, travels to Austria. Daniel, who has already completely fallen on Lena, has a chance to show his feelings for her for the first time in life when he begins to have doubts about their relationship. Daniel, who is late for his own concert, hears how he creates unusual music, although he is not among them. <br /> <br /> Kay Pollak, the director of this extremely interesting film, shows that he was a man, direct it. The story involves the viewer from the very beginning. A large part of the film's success went to the cast of the band that was made. William Nykvist, who plays the lead role, is the best pretext to watch the movie. Frida Hallgren, Niklas Falk, Ylva Loof do an excellent job for Mr. Pollak. <br /> <br /> Stefan Nilsson is the composer of most of the beautiful music he hears. Harald Gunnar Paalgard's photos make the film look better by capturing different seasons for the viewer in his beauty.
