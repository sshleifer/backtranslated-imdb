I saw this film as a teenager and was immediately identified with the portrait of Reese Witherspoon Dani Trant, a 14-year-old boy in rural Louisiana in 1957. She feels she will never be as beautiful as her older sister, Maureen (she rarely saw Emily Warfield) and she felt out of place when it came to her conservative Baptist upbringing. Then seventeen-year-old Court Foster (Jason London), son of a close friend of his mother (Gail Strickland), moves by, Dani experiences her first infatuation while Court enjoys her company and deliberate spirit. Dani manages to kiss her for the first time, but as soon as she sees Maureen, she falls behind her, leaving Dani behind. The closeness of the sister's bond is seriously broken by the rivalry that is exploding, which only deepens when the Court dies in a tragic accident. The girls realize how much they need each other. <br /> <br /> Sam Waterson and Tess Harper are just perfect loving parents trying to balance the individuality of their daughters while trying to keep the family together. Beautiful cinematography and a great soundtrack with the participation of Elvis Presley, The Platters and many others perfectly contribute to the atmosphere of the film in a simpler time. <br /> <br /> A moving film about maturity with a timeless message.
