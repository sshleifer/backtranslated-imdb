Watching how both brothers interact and feed each other throughout the movie, I personally am happy that I live in the countryside, just like in the movie. I have watched this movie countless times and have a book right next to my Bible. After watching the movie, I agree that this is one of the few movies that does book justice. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has a chance to go to Montana for fishing or outdoors to do so. This is amazing. I can not think of anyone else who could play this role better than Brad Pitt. Take care of yourself and watch one of the best films in the era of modern film. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND As a guide for anglers in Montana and Wyoming, do not try to learn to fly fish from movie scenes, because although it looks great on a movie, you have no idea how to practice and fish the skills it actually takes. Thank you for listening. Watch this movie if you want a long, sad movie.
