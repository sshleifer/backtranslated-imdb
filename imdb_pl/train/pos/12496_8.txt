For years, we've been watching every horror that comes out, from boring Hollywood like Saw 2, to horrible independent releases that are completely incomparable ... we're suffering through all the bad movies in the hope of finding small gems like "Dark Remains". <br /> <br /> We managed to catch the show of the film on Shriekfest 2005. The audience loved it and I believe that the win for the best film ended. <br /> <br /> Although it may not have the budget or power of studio stars, it is a serious blow in the category of terrifying atmosphere and terror. Acting and photography are at the highest level, but this is the direction that makes this film worth seeing. History and characters are developing at the right pace to provide fantastic horror. <br /> <br /> Editing and visual fx are also at the highest level. And although many horrors can not use music in their favor, the score for "Dark Remains" only adds to its quirks. <br /> <br /> I know that the movie has been shown at many festivals, but none of them was close to me, so I can not wait to hear it when it finally comes out on DVD. Trust me, even if you have enough of the current state of horrors, try this ... you will not regret it!
