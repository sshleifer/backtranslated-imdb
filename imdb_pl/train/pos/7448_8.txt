For a long time I did not laugh so much - although the movie also has some sad moments, especially when it changes from hyper-funny to honest and serious. The characters are very realistic most of the time, sometimes unhappy, but quite credible. I'm not a fan of the show Jerry Springer - I feel sorry for the participants. This movie is a satire instead and it's great. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that all curses were * emitted * while this movie was broadcast on public television, which takes a lot of fun. I will go to rent this movie to enjoy it. <br /> <br />
