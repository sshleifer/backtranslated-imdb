I've seen The Running Man several times because I'm a fan of Stephen King and I have all his films, but now it's even better because I did not know about this site until 2 days ago and I did not know that Paul Michael Glaser, who was involved in the movie, he was the same Paul Michael Glaser, whom I grow up watching in Starsky and Hutch. For me it is a pleasant surprise, because I can not tell you how many times I cried when Starsky or Hutch were wounded. The episode in which Starsky (Kill Starsky) almost died, I cried so hard that my dad had to turn his back on the show. What can you expect from a child at the age of 12? Now, I'm deliberately looking for movies and programs with Paul or David Soul and everything on which Stephen King has his hands. I'm just there !!!!!!!! I just have to say Happy Birthday Paul !!!!!
