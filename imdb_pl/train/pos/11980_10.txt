Full House was and is a great show. It's a good program for people of all ages, as well as a good family show. There are really no such programs anymore. The children are very cute and even though it's a bit cheesy, it's still good, especially for everyone who watched them when they were a child. I would like to see an interview with the cast. Anyone who would like to see interviews with the cast, in the type where they now write about special DVD features, should go to the Petition spot page and sign a petition entitled Full House Reunion on DVD, because asking for it in the hope that the cast can do it . Yay on Full House!
