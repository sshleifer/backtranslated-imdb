This delicate, beautifully made production deepened into a bitter sweetness in my being. Carefree students, a life embittered by the bus driver and the teachers' personality, present a subliminal debate when history reveals itself. All adult characters seem familiar, my teachers, my bus driver, each of their opinions is so reliable and well known. When the incident with the key on the bus happens, we are sent on the periphery of the viewpoints. All the time the chatter of teenage energy is only controlled by travel organizers. Mr. Harvey is experiencing a lot of pain. He reminds me of war teachers I did not understand when I was a disrespectful student. <br /> <br /> Rhidian Brook and producers deserve great recognition for this well-shaped British film. Acting flawless, appropriate scenes should be widely available, but it seems that they have not been given the right opportunity.
