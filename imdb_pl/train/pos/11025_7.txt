Cliffhanger is a decent adventure with crime related crime, with several drawbacks of director Renny Harlin, who can be admired in creating this film about an experienced climber who is taken hostage by a gang of dangerous criminals looking for suits full of Stolen Rocks stolen money. Sylvester Stallone is impressive as Gabe Walker, an expert in climbing, especially in action / fight sequences, but some of them definitely border with an unrealistic approach. For the sake of the movie, I wanted to suspend my disbelief. The rest of the cast, including John Lithgow, Michael Rooker, Janine Turner, Rex Linn, Caroline Goodall and Leon are respected as supporting heroes in the film. The action / fight sequences are well done, but as mentioned earlier, some of them are not very realistic, no matter how difficult you are. Climbing sequences, however, are very well made, because instead of making the entire movie in the studio somewhere chosen by them, they are very real, and the views of Ariel on the mountain ranges are wonderful, adding a bit of reality to the movie. Deaths are ingenious, while others are predictable. The villains are solid, but it would be better if they focused on the more central instead of on many of them. The pace of the film was a bit slow, but good exceeds what is bad. If you're a big fan of Harlins or Stallone, you'll probably like this one. Overall, Cliffhanger has character development with enough action, drama, some tension, excitement, thrills and good cast performances that make this movie worth watching.
