This movie could only be made in the 70's !! It is a bizarre action movie in a small workers' village in California. It's closing a mill or plant, so suddenly the streets are getting rotten bad! Residents of the city have enough! Ben Arnold (Jan Michael Vincent) goes to another city to hire his brother, Aaron, played by Kris Kristofferson. Aaron is a veterinarian from Vietnam who looks and behaves a bit uncomfortable. It hangs with a group of other surly vets from Vietnam. They come to the city to clean up (they are replaced), but under their good deeds they actually run gambling houses, asking for money for protection, etc. !!! People need some time to get along, and the biblical expedition of Cain and Abel must take over the elder brother. In this movie there is an interesting atmosphere of "blue collars", which makes it interesting (note the scene of cockfighting!). Vincent is almost too angelic in this role? he thinks so much about his brother, he can not imagine that he commits the wrong deeds he accuses himself of. He finally came to his senses? his girlfriend, Victoria Principal, is brutally shot in the back and he is beaten in his home. Kris Kristofferson is extremely effective as Aaron. He coolly denies any wrongdoing, and even gently coo and talks to Vincent's young daughter (he refers to him as "Uncle Aaron"), even when he threatens her father's life, smiling all the time! Vincent and Kristofferson have good contrasting chemistry with them. Bernadette Peters makes an interesting appearance as a saloon girl who attracts Aaron's attention. It's a good 70s action movie if you find it! Is NOT available yet on DVD ??
