Because the title is in English, and IMDb lists the basic language of this program as English, I will focus on the review of the English version of Gundam Wing (2000), presented in the Bandai DVD set. My actual review for the whole series is under the slogan IMDb "Shin kidô senki Gundam W" (1995). <br /> <br /> Very little has changed in terms of the plot, scenario and characteristics of his adaptation to English and it really depends on his own taste to choose the language to watch. Purists can stick to Japanese everything they want, but for a more "realistic" experience, I recommend English because all characters, except Heero Yuy, are not Japanese (most of them are actually white with a few Asians from outside Japan). First of all, the heroes' personalities meet more "directly" than in the Japanese version. The contrast between the characters is stronger thanks to some doses - or take performances, but a very well cast group of actors. <br /> <br /> Wing Gundam's pilot Heero Yuy is a highly qualified soldier who suppresses his emotions, but slowly learns the value of his humanity. deadly delivery can be criticized as "bad action", but it fits very well with the Heero personality. <br /> <br /> Deathscythe Duo Maxwell Gundama, always cheerful in the face of death, has behind him a difficult course of nurturing the values ​​of life and friends. He is probably the best character in the whole program, masterfully played by Scott McNeil. It may sound a bit old for its age, but the English voice Duo easily falls out of its annoyingly nasal Japanese. <br /> <br /> Trowa, pilot Heavyarms, is a lost lonely soul whose only goal has been fighting so far; in spite of his inner desire to establish contacts with people around him, he knows only how to kill and not befriend. Kirby Morrow gives a grim but realistic performance as Trowa Barton. <br /> <br /> Quatre Rebarba Winner is expressed by Brad Swaile who has no problem showing the caring nature of the character and the breakdown of his innocence when he experiences the horrors of war and firsthand death. A huge plus is that Quatre does not sound like a girl anymore (and this is expressed by a woman in the Japanese version), but she is a real typical 15-year-old guy. <br /> <br /> Impetuous but determined Wufei Chang, whose voice was Ted Cole, may seem a bit exaggerated, but plays in sharp contrast to the more subdued roles of Heero and Trowa. <br /> <br /> Relena Darlian sounds old in English, which expresses Lisa Ann Bailey. This may not match her youthful impersonation at the beginning of the series, but when her character matures later, her voice follows her example and fits well with character development. <br /> <br /> Zechs Merquise to be one of the more drastically changed voices compared to the Japanese version. Both voices bring out different sides of the same character. His Japanese voice is haughty, authoritative and awe-inspiring, consistent with high rank status and charismatic character. His English voice, Brian Drummond, is more subdued, sounds more cunning and "like a snake," emphasizing Zechs' mysterious nature regarding his hidden plans and staunch beliefs in his ideals. <br /> <br /> OZ members are a really mixed bag. Treize Kushrenada spoken by David Kaye receives a more realistic and down-to-earth performance compared to the Japanese style of speaking, which is larger than in life. However, Lady Une does not transmit her split personality as in contrast to the Japanese version, and Lucrencia Noin just sounds ... bored most of the time. Pilots with cannons and military leaders have nothing to do with any of them. <br /> <br /> I would be grateful if they would take the time to give different characters different accents reflecting their ethnicity. The voices of Maganac Corp. were generally uninspired, but could have been more interesting if they received Middle Eastern accents. The members of the Romerfeller Foundation would also sound better with a classic European accent that reflects their status as a gentry. <br /> <br /> Despite the clumsy play of the side characters, the main cast manages to perform the show and this results in a generally smaller and more realistic version of the Gundam Wing script. Very faithful to the original Japanese script, keeping all the basic ideas and topics about politics, war and human nature. Unfortunately, it also retains the disadvantages of the original Japanese script.
