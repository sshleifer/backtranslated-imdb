I consider myself a great film lover. I was sick on the couch and I fell into this movie. From the beginning to the end, I looked with admiration at those great actors I have never seen, let's say a great word. Filming was beautiful. That's what I needed. I hope this message will be heard about any bad comments written by others. The director has a heart and beats with the actors. Thank for making a movie like this one. Just wonderfully awkward, beautiful characters that are flawed and graceful at the same time. Just great. I can not send it without 10 lines, so I will just say that I wish more from this director, more from all the actors in this film and more from the writer. I did not want it to end. End
