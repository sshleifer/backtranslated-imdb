When I first saw it, we borrowed it from our local library about a year ago and watched it about 3 times. We just watched it again and I liked it MORE than I watched lately! :) :() <br /> <br /> The film is mainly about two dogs called Charlie and Itchy (with the voices of Dom DeLuise and I love Dom DeLuise!). Charlie is a half-gangster and half-fairy who I like. Itchy is his helper. Charlie is killed by his friend (NIE) and sent to heaven. When Charlie comes back to life, this is the beginning of an amazing adventure. <br /> <br /> Five main reasons why I am absolutely CRAZY about this movie: One: I love characters (except Carface). My favorite three are Charlie, Itchy and a little girl named Anne-Marie, who comes a bit later. Two: I love the history period in which this movie is set. It is determined during a ban in the United States. Three: The Don Bluth animation (as usual) is great. The backgrounds are also good. Four: this movie has a strange excitement that keeps me on the edge of my seat. Five: The songs in this are beautiful. My favorite song starts with "I need Brazil, pulsing, thrill thrills" ... <br /> <br /> So watch this beautiful movie, when you can, you will not be disappointed! :);) :()
