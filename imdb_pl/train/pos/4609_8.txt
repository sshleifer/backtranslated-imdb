Probably the best of Jackie Khan's movie in the 1980s and the one who put it on the map. The scale of this selfish police drama is visible from the opening and closing scenes during which the squatters' village and the shopping center were demolished. There are clear differences between the original Chinese and named English versions, and many jokes do not go to the latter. The latter is also hampered by stars that do not sound like their Chinese originals. In fact, the only thing that has improved dubbing is the lawsuit? At that time, Hong Kong's colonial trials were conducted in English, while the original had this scene in Cantonese! martial arts and martial arts choreography bring humor to where it's possible, so non-Cantonese audiences do not miss too much. After all, it is not a dialogue that makes the Chan revolve, but action and painful actions. The story is easy to follow: Chan plays an indestructible detective from Hong Kong chasing godfather gangs (Cho Yeun) and assigned to protect the witness of the stars (Brigitte Lin). The action is great from beginning to end and there is not much time to breathe. You will never think about it, but what a funny and well-connected movie. Probably one of the best martial arts films.
