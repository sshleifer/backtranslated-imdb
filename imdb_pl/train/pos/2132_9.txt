The cast really makes it a nice surprise and scares the normal Hollywood romance / comedy type "man-woman-quarrels-all-only-time-wind". <br /> <br /> I usually do not go for this type of movie and this tiring story, but it was refreshing, pleasant to watch and exudes charm. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullavan play everyone else well and make a very handsome couple. Supporting cast is excellent - from the always nice Felix Bressart to the villain Joseph Schildkrauta. <br /> <br /> Frank Morgan also plays one of the most interesting characters I've seen in his career. He takes the film and turns it into a completely different mood for a moment when something dramatic happens to him. This "turn" is another reason why the movie rises above others of this kind. <br /> <br /> Once again, when a movie has a good mix of categories, it usually goes well. This is a great example. In this film, it's an affair, comedy and drama, and it's well done. I will take it under re-make "You Got Got Mail" every day. There's no comparison.
