In my opinion, Sudden Impact was generally better than The Enforcer. It was a great movie, but then I saw the villains and I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> The sudden impact was different than in previous parts. The story went in this direction in a different direction, because Dirty Harry does not take a police approach this time. We also do not see villains for later, which means less time for them on the screen, which is better for all of us. <br /> <br /> Clint Eastwood is once again stealing the show as Dirty Harry, just say it. Pat Hingle was pleasant as boss Jannings, Harry's new boss. Bradford Dillman apparently changed his name to Captain Briggs, but he was different. Michael Currie is as decent as Lieutenant Donnelly, annoying Harry's boss. Personally, I liked Kevyn Major Howard as Hawkins, a young punk who has vendetta against Harry. Albert Popwell was perfect as Horace, Harry's buddy. Audrie J. Neenan was good as Ray Parkins, the famous lesbian in the city. Jack Thibeau was well manned as Kruger, pervert. Now really bad. Sandra Locke, Eastwood's longtime lover, was terribly misunderstood as Jennifer Spencer, Harry's love. And Paul Drake was just terrible like Mick. <br /> <br /> The film would be much better if it was not for better writing and playing on some parts. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
