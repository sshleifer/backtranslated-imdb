It's a strong movie from a historical and epic perspective. Although the story is simple, it is clean and simple. In fact, it is a standard story of a simple, honorable man, whose honor comes into conflict with the more educated and richer people of this period. <br /> <br /> A classic but well-told story without the glare of the Hollywood smelling screen. <br /> <br /> Extra points just because you almost smell the people on the screen. :)
