It was an absolutely captivating series and I was sorry that I managed to catch only a few shows when it was late in the UK. The style of this was so different from others of its kind, and the whole thing had a disturbing feeling of stylish fear. All you need to do is read all the positive comments (and not the negative one I see) to realize what the truly innovative series was and how it came to the imagination. Now, after reading the comments, I understand that it has been CANCELED, which is so unbelievable. What a handful of "headless, overpaid turkeys" that had to be (or maybe still) run to do it.
