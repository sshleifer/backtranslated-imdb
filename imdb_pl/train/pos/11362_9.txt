I believe this is the most powerful movie HBO Pictures has done so far. This movie should be released in cinemas so that the audience can watch it on the big screen. It's available on video, so search for it and check it out. Chris Gerolmo did a great job with direction and script. The performances of Stephen Re, Donald Sutherland and Jeffery DeMunn are impeccable. A masterpiece of the genre.
