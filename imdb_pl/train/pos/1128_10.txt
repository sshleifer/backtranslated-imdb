Although the recent repetition of parts of Homer's epic "Troy" with Brad Pitt was once fun, "Iphigenia" with the glowing Irene Pappas is breathtaking. The development in a natural setting with Greek actors speaking their own language gives such authenticity. Accidentally meeting this movie on one of the many movie channels DirecTV interested me despite the problems with concentration. In this film, there is no glare or "bling", just fabulously rich history impeccably told by actors, so the real person feels that he eavesdrops on the real family in the confusion. I think even Homer, if he really existed, would be proud of this story. <br /> <br /> JLH
