Joseph L. Mankiewicz is not today remembered by many as one of the best directors in Hollywood history, but this movie proves that it is. Mankiewicz has already succeeded in performing sophisticated American dramas such as the Letter to Three Wives and everything about Ewa, as well as successfully adapting Shakespeare to life in Juliusz Caesar, Mankiewicz, doing great work on the film on Broadway and stylistically. Marlon Brando is perfect as Sky Masterson, even if he can not sing well. He is the only actor who could perfectly stress him with his clear coldness and clarity. Frank Sinatra is a great singer, as expected, and does a good job as Nathan Detroit. Jean Simmons is also very good as Sarah Brown, and her scenes with Brando sizzle with great chemistry. All supporting actors perform their role, especially Sheldon Leonard as Harry the Horse in a very funny way. Even so, Mankiewicz should receive most of the credit for displaying a great musical in such a way that it is authentic in many scenes, but is still a story in his own world. To sum up, Guys and Dolls is a great musical and works on many levels that you normally should not have.
