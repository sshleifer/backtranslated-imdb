"If I sit down, I will never get up again," says the mother (this in title) to her son, when he tells her to rest (she is simply widowed). It means that resting is what a woman his age and her situation must do: rest in peace, neglect yourself. But he is not in the mood for "rest" yet, not yet. She also has a daughter who throws her away for every disaster in her life ... Suddenly there is a revelation: sex and passion in the form of a muscular carpenter 30 years younger than her (Daniel Craig, new James Bond) when "she thought that nobody it will never touch her again. " It's a story that makes you wonder about many things, especially what a woman has to do with her life when her husband dies. It does not seem that we have developed this in these aspects. I mean, no one is surprised when Sean Connery has an affair in the movie with Catherine Zeta Jones ... but what would you think if it were different? An old woman, a young guy ... no, you're not ready for that, right? <br /> <br /> The movie has intimate shades along its entire length, with the exception of 2 or 3 sequences in which the sounds burst and clear and disgusting dialogues appear. These vulgar accents and the way in which son and daughter discover their mother's romance (quite absurd - you'll know what I mean when you watch it) are the only incompatible elements in "Mother." <br /> <br /> * My stake: 7/10
