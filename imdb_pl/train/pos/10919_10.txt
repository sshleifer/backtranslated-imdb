Five Deadly Venoms is not as bloody and brutal as Story Of Ricky or Super Ninjas, but contains some of the best melee sequences in Hong Kong's film history. Director Chang Cheh creates what many consider his masterpiece. This film began the career of five men playing on the venom. Meng Lo is playing another bad ass. He would be in Super Ninjas. Kuo Chui, who is Philip Kwokiem, will go to Story Of Ricky and Hard Boiled. Every cutlet with chops can appreciate it. But I still think it is not as good as Super Ninjas (also by Chang Cheh). But all the chops are good, and this is one of the best.
