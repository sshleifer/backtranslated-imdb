"Zabriskie Point" (1970): It was particularly interesting for me on a personal level, because it takes place in identical circumstances, with identical peers, in my life? Counter Culture movement from the turn of the 1960s and 1970s on and off the campus. We follow two unrelated young people in separate stories who are slowly merging. One of them is a young man in Los Angeles, tired of an endless, pseudo-revolutionary bang in the classrooms and dining rooms of his campus, and the other, a young woman going to Phoenix to see his father and employer, and take up the "assumption" of work. The film is FULL of the visual notation of the American Italian director (Michelangelo Antonioni), and confused, the psychedelic madness of this hypocritical period, "we know everything, we will change everything for the better" youth. Who is the "revolutionary"? What does it really mean? Do you dress like one and marry around chanting? Do you "fly in under radar", but you anticipate your arrival? Do you keep your plans for yourself and deal with changes, without the need for group approval? "Zabriskie Point" is definitely "a piece from the era" - full of slang, uniforms, somewhat surreal moments of the film (in the end it is a film of a man who gave us an amazing "Blow Up" from 1966) and artifacts of the era, but more. It presents the options of the Cultural Revolution, and by walking through Antonioni (who seems to support her), the youth are too involved to see what is needed for radical success. For this reason, it becomes a powerful, frightening film that applies to everyone, at any time and place.
