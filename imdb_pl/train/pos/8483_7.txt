It is difficult to assess this or other comparable film from the early sound era in categories that could be used for ordinary film commentary. Sometimes there is almost desperation, because many movie personalities from this silent era are trying their wings to the sound, certainly fearing that they will be left by the road (as it happened to some), Rin-Tin-Tin. however, it was perfectly natural. In such a vaudeville of unrelated sequences, some certainly distinguished the monologue of John Barrymore of Ryszard II, who is certainly worth behaving. In general, only those with previous training on the stage emanated confidence. However, it is above all reasonably fun and necessary for "movie lovers", especially those interested in quiet passage to the sound
