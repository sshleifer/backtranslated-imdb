This film is about style, atmosphere and acting. That's true, I did not believe in all the plot changes, but it did not matter - terrifying acting, unexpected twists and a great atmosphere dragged me in, and took me on a ride, and I had a great time. Kenneth Branagh is not only a great actor, but a master of accents and proves once again a flawless accent from Georgia. He is surrounded by so many supporting roles (Robert Downey, Jr., Embeth Davidtz with Schindler's List and Fallen, Tom Berenger, Daryl Hannah and Robert Duvall) that I was simply amazed. I recently bought a copy of this movie and never stopped watching it. Just one of the best thrillers of the year. If you ignored this video (and you probably do), I suggest you check it out.
