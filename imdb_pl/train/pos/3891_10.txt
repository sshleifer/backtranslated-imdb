One of the best comedians in history. I have seen this program about 10 times and probably watch it at least 100 times. My friends and family quote from this DVD so often that one would think that we did nothing but see it. The initial part of Alcatraz is a bit slow, but it either breaks through it or goes through the part where Eddie is on stage. Watch out for the part "Cake or death" (joking about the Anglican church) and part of "Hitler / Pol Pot" (It's hard to explain, just look). The best part of the show can be Eddie's facial expressions. He can really say a lot with his eyes. (Mascara, eyeliner and eye shadow will probably help, right?) Honest warning: Eddie has a tendency to throw many four-letter words.
