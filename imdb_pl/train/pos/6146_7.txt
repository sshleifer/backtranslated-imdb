Perhaps Disney was hoping for another Mary Poppins, but this is a completely different story, and although Angela is delighted, she was a completely different performer than the great Julie Andrews. Having said that Lansbury is perfectly manned and provides magical performance. There is something wonderfully delicate in her character, and David Tomlinson has great support. Tomilinson can carry a tune, but he's certainly not a big cat as a singer. It does not matter that he was such a talented actor that you hardly notice. There are some great episodes from beloved stars from another period, such as Roddy McDowel, who gives a winning performance, and a very beloved Tessie OShea who does very little, but it's nice to see the old gala again. It is also great to see Sam Jaffe and the King of English television Bruce Forsythe in small roles. The score includes several beautiful songs, in particular The briny sea and The Age of Not Believing. A large number of Portabello Road is limited to the limit, but it has plenty of theatricality. The effects look a bit trite today, but the scene with German invaders attacked by the wildest army in the film is impressive. Children are not as annoying as other films, but it is difficult to understand what the youngest boy is saying. I loved the marching song of the home army. The home guards were very important for Great Britain and it is a warm tribute. The animation is delightful, much better than Pixar, which I consider to be grotesque. A warm happy movie and its miracle, which was not done on the stage.
