When Sabrina first appeared on our screens, I was about 12 years old and that's why I spent my teenage years watching the teenage witch fall into strange situations. <br /> <br /> It has always been one of my favorite programs, charming the sitcom of the sixties "Bewitched", but this time the character was cooler. I always liked Sabrina because she was smart. She was also friendly and easy to watch, which made watching her pleasant. The characters were great at first; Harvey, Jenny, Libby, quizmaster, Salem and Mr. Poole (my personal favorite, a shame that he left so early) Hilda and Zelda her aunts started ok, but then they became annoying. <br /> <br /> I liked Mr. Kraft too, he was always closer to discovering the secret of Sabrina. What I loved in the first three series were original ideas, the discovery of family secrets and the learning of new spells, but as time passed, it became more predictable. Too many characters came and went, such as Valerie, Dreama and Brad, and then they decided to make Sabrina in college, which ruined it for me. <br /> <br /> Sabrina absorbed herself in college, there was less magic, no book of spells, no aunts living with her and Roxie, Miles and Morgan were not nervous. <br /> <br /> The last series was boring, and I just watched what happened in the end. Without Hildi and Zelda, somehow it seemed that they were wrong, and Miles just disappeared. The last episode made me feel a lot better (SPOILER) when Sabrina finished with Harves on her wedding day so that Dullard Aaron would be great! Overall, a great program if you forget about the poor last two or three series that reminded me of many teen shows. Magic.
