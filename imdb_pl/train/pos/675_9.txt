David Burton (Richard Chamberlain, quite good) is a lawyer, more adept at corporate taxation (... and suffers from atypical dreams that prevent him from seeing this indigenous man covered in darkness), who is called to deal with a case involving a group of aborigines accused of murder of one of them named Billy. We see that he is trying to steal stones with ritual painting on them and he is killed when the leader of an indigenous tribe named Charlie (Nandjiwarra Amagula) uses the "bone of death" to stop his heart. In the meantime, rotating around David, bizarre weather patterns affect Sydney, such as rain hitting dirty dirt and hailed hail during a clear blue sky (no cloud views like the one that hits a school in central Australia), not to mention A "deformed" rainbow that is divided (!) Into groups. When David follows the case, it turns out that he is much closer to strange events than he would ever be aware of. One aborigine named Chris (David Gulpilil) appears to him in a dream, holding a stone with blood and discovers that this man is one of those he is to represent at the trial! He states that it is quite possible after a few strange meetings with Charlie and talking to Chris that he can be very connected to the spirit of Mulkurul and that his dreams are the real haunts of the possible horrors that are yet to come. <br /> <br /> The absorbing apocalyptic drama builds its story methodically and is completely original and unpredictable. Together with Peter Weir responsible for the film, he is visually delightful because we see these very overwhelming images of potential annihilation towards civilization, but the most interesting angle of the film is certainly David's journey to find this monumental truth that torments him when Charlie's countless questions and Chris, first help their people escape the crime they have not committed, and finally find out what's in common with whatever catastrophic thing is happening, or it may happen later.
