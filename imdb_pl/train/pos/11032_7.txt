Upset with guilt after a lot of things spread on this shelf, mountain climber from mountain aces Gabriel Walker (Stallone) returns for his girlfriend Jessie (Janine Turner), while over a cloudy sky, where the weather looks a bit scary, spectacularly unstable kidnap air in the air and 100 million dollars taken from the Treasury Department plane gets lost in the middle of nowhere, followed by an emergency landing? <br /> <br /> They left the snowy peaks and needed mountain guides to recover the stolen cash, highly trained travelers make an emergency call with the help of a rescue unit? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Gab and Hall (Michael Rooker) must join forces to arrive at the scene of the disaster, unaware that the call for help was false, and a band of merciless terrorists commanded by psychotic (John Lithgow), are waiting for them just to find out how far from the stormy mountain with sunken money boxes? <br /> <br /> With breathtaking shots, dizzy scenery, dizzy heights, dangerous climbs, freezing temperatures, "Cliffhanger" is by far the best adventure film of Stallone?
