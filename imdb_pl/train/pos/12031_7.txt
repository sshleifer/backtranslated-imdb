(WARNING: minor spoilers) <br /> <br /> I came up with it halfway and I watched from there, not knowing what it was or what the plot was. Certainly he drew my attention; Until the end I did not know that it is based on a real story! The guy from whom she did the dirty work came out looking seriously a nice guy who had just turned his head on a deceitful girl; I have to think about how faithful this image is. Anyone who murdered a husband and wife during sleep can not be quite nice. Nevertheless, I had sympathy for him because he was founded and used; a lot has been explained. <br /> <br /> My main complaint is the ending (here the biggest spoiler appears, skip this paragraph if you do not want to learn it). A few minutes before its completion, it was not possible to discover the truth. The way it was discovered consisted of a "sting" operation, but my question is: how did the police find out? The film did not show us this and it seemed a little too comfortable if there was no explanation of how they were convinced. <br /> <br /> I think the way they did it was done for dramatic purposes, omitting the explanation gave tension to the decisive scene that would not have existed otherwise (we would already know what's going on in the scene and what would happen with her). <br /> <br /> Otherwise, it's a pretty good movie; I give it 7/10. It made me think. Now I am interested in learning facts from a real case. <br /> <br /> One more thing: the film was made in 1996. Some of them seem to treat him as a newer movie. <br /> <br /> PS Meadow Sisto is adorable. I have not seen her before. She can also work a little (always a plus in her job, LOL).
