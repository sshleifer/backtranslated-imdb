Yes, I call it a great movie. Not one boring second, fantastic cast of mostly little-known actresses and actors, a wide range of characters that are well-defined and which have understandable motives that I could sympathize with, excellent lighting, clear black and white photography, matching soundtrack intelligent and harmonious set design and history that is addictive and works. This is one of the best quality photographs on which Hollywood's entire pride should rest, a sign that everyone should strive to achieve. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck is simply stunning. The actress could not do anything, and the melodramatic side was always easy. No hysterical outbursts with this lady - I always thought she was a better actress than the goddess of the screen, like Bette Davis or Joan Crawford, and this movie confirmed my opinion. Always as hard as nails and at the same time convey true feelings. It can be added that during her long career she has also won many good parts, and this is definitely the least interesting. <br /> <br /> The title fits this movie very well. It's about desires, human desires that I think everyone can understand. In fact, in this movie no one is plotting, all heroes are acting on impulse, everyone wants to be happy without hurting anyone else. The sad fact that it often leads to complications makes a dramatic content that I will not go to here. <br /> <br /> I liked what this movie has to say about youth, adolescence and the need for a compromise. The film that most associates me with this film is Shadow of a Doubt by Alfred Hitchcock, which creates a similar atmosphere of idealized and caricatured Small Town America. The story has a certain similarity to the much sharper film by Fritz Lang Clash by Night, realized the year before, in which Stanywck plays a similar part. I can also recommend it.
