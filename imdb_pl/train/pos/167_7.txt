"Dance, Fools, Dance" is an early Crawford-Gable vehicle from 1931. Crawford plays Bonnie Jordan, a wealthy young woman whose life consists of parties, alcohol and clothes to jump out of the yacht and swim. All this ends when her father dies and leaves her and her brother (William Blakewell) penniless. Bonnie gets a job in a newspaper called Mary Smith; her brother goes to work for smugglers. The main man is Jake Luva - he played the role of Clark Gable, who plays another cheater. Later, of course, it will turn into a romantic hero, but in the early 30's MGM used it as a bad guy. Not realizing that her brother is involved in illegal activities, Bonnie hugs Luva. <br /> <br /> Gable and Crawford have created a great team. Her facial expression is a bit wild, but this, along with dancing, is one of the things that make a movie fun. Look for Cliff Edwards, the voice of Jimina Cricket, like Bert. <br /> <br /> It's always interesting to watch pre-movie movies, and "Dance, Fools, Dance" is no exception.
