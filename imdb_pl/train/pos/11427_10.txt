I loved this movie because it felt like it captured so perfectly what I imagined that life in French colonial Africa must have been like in the 1950s ("my" generation anyway). But I was really delighted with his calm pace and glorious ending. In the last 5 minutes of this video you need to focus on what's happening. I've never been more impressed with the "summary" of the movie. I remember shouting "wow!" When I realized that it was over. On the other hand, my two daughters fell asleep on the couch !!
