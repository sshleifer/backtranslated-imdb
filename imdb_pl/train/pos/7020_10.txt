* I mark where spoilers are! General remarks: If you can make a serious movie, see this. Keep an open mind and you'll like it. Do not leave the theater because you are confused about what is going on! The film fits nicely in the second half. I will take my mother to see her again when the film officially opens. <br /> <br /> I was lucky to see it at the show a few weeks ago, when Will was revolving around promoting the movie. He was great - he spent a lot of time with fans. Thank you for the photo Will! On the performance of Villa: Many times when you see a movie with an actor really known from another movie / program, you always think about them in their current performance, just as you think about them because of their previous performances. This is not the case of Will Smith in this movie. I did not watch Fresh Prince (lol) when I watched the movie. He was completely and totally convincing in this very, very serious role. He grew up immensely as an actor. I think that at least he will get an Oscar for this performance. <br /> <br /> About his character: Ben is very conflicted and tormented. He is sad ... with guilt ... very determined, but very scared. Very faithful to myself. His character has a lot of depth ... and somehow Will managed to revive it. <br /> <br /> About Emily (Rosario): Rosario did a good job of presenting Emily, a woman who stood behind her taxes. Maybe he is not the shiny star Will in this movie, but she was very persuasive. I think her character just did not have as much work as Will. <br /> <br /> About the plot (no spoilers): I admit that I did not like the movie to the other half. I did not know absolutely anything about this film and it made no sense until the second part of the movie made sense. But when things eventually fit together, wow. Surprisingly well written and thought out. It is an extremely intense movie that really holds you. <br /> <br /> It really costs a lot. In the theater where I was, most people cried at the end - even adult men. When you realize what Ben is doing and why, it's a very powerful moment ... <br /> <br /> ******* SPOILERS ***** That's why it's very hard to talk about it without giving up bigger things. I feel like knowing too much about this film really spoils it. There were many symbols in the film that I liked. I will mention some of them here (without trying to give a lot). <br /> <br /> - The fish that Ben kept in his hotel room. At the beginning, it makes no sense. There was a lot of talk in the cinema when people realized the reality of the fish. <br /> <br /> - I hated Ben at the beginning of the movie. At the end I loved him and hated him. That's how Will found out. I thought Ben was a big jerk for Ezra, the blind man who is trying to reach the world. That's why he treated Ezra like that, it became clear later in the film. Wait. Everything in this video: wait. <br /> <br /> -Ben is basically a good man who made a big mistake for which he would not forgive himself. It is still not clear to me whether he was doing what he was doing because he tried to get rid of his own fault or whether he really wanted to help people. I think it's a bit of both ... I think he wanted to help people, but also to get rid of his past. I love his character. You love him and you hate him because you realize that what he does is unusual. You hate him because of what he does for himself (as a very good person), both physically and emotionally. Well done Will.
