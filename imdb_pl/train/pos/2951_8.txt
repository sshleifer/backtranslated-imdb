Yes, it's a chick and it moves a bit slowly, but it's actually pretty good - and I consider myself a male man. You must love Judy Davis, no matter what she is getting into, and the girl who plays her daughter gives a natural, convincing performance. <br /> <br /> The scenery of a small seaside place is beautiful and plays the main theme of the film. Unknown (at least unknown to me) actors and actresses give the film a realism that attracts and attracts attention. Overall, I give him 8/10. Go see it.
