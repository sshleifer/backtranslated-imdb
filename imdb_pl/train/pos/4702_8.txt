If this movie turns out to be just one thing, the fact that Keaton is, was and always will be a comic in his heart, even while avoiding bullets, going to an electric chair and going down to the wrong end of the information line in prison. <br /> <br /> But "Johnny Dangerously" proves even more. In the 1980s, ZAZ boys (Zucker, Abrahams, and Zucker) were the summit in the world of fake genres. But there were several contenders on the throne. This time Amy ("Fast times in Ridgement High") Heckerling tries his hand, and behind the scenario hides an amazing number of TV authors (go and check). <br /> <br /> This lucky slapstick parody of gags and gags from the thirties of the twentieth century causes movies to throw almost every cliche on the loop, and even adds a few phrases that were not in the past. br /> <br /> And not only the reliable Keaton at hand as Johnny of the title, but also such funny guys and dolls as Piscopo, Henner, Stapleton, Boyle, Dunne, DeVito, Walston and almost every other actor in Hollywood who he accidentally entered the nearest surroundings. You'd be surprised how many faces you recognize. I know I was. <br /> <br /> And jokes? When they start, they come to you quickly and furiously, like a machine gun. At the beginning there are too many of them to complete the crazy song Weird Al Yankovic. But you have to be careful when they load. And they have to overload a bit too often. <br /> <br /> Everyone is trying, it seems that they are having fun and I have been laughing for a good amount of time. In the end, however, there was a lot of time to think about how some scenes could be more fun - usually it is not the best thing to think about after watching a comedy. <br /> <br /> But for a slow night, when there is nothing good on TV, pop in "Johnny" and get ready for "dangerous" serious laugh. <br /> <br /> Eight stars. Check out "Johnny Dangerously" ... do not be "bastidge".
