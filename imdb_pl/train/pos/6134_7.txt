Some DVDs hold me until I just have to go out and buy. It was one of those movies. Like many others here, I remember that I saw it as a child and I loved it. I never knew that scenes and musical numbers were cut out, so I was intrigued to see what they could be. I agree that the sequence of "Portabellow Road" is now a bit long (like a football match), but otherwise I had no scruples about the other scenes that were placed in their respectable place. Perhaps Disney should have the original version (which is the reverted version) on the one hand with the restored version on the other side, then people can choose what they want to see. In conclusion, it is still a funny movie that can still recover some of my childhood memories.
