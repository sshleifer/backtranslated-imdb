Iry Levina's mortal trap is one of those mysterious films in the Sleuth tradition, which would be very easy to spoil, given the actual analysis of the plot of the film. Therefore, I will say briefly that it is about art, one man who is a famous playwright-mystery, another man who is a promising writer, a playwright's wife who is much younger and sexier than he should be a role and one German psychic For a ride. Director Sidney Lumet, who is not a stranger to the film, is mostly good at creating the tension the film needs. The dialog is fast, fresh and witty. Michael Caine excels in such roles. Christopher Reeve is fit and actually grows on you, the more you see him, the more he works. Irene Worth stands out as a funny psyche. What do you say to Dyan Cannon? I love how Lumet packed her back in these tight pants and wore her probably in tight blouses, but in this role she is terribly unsuccessful - a role that should be given to an older actress, and certainly less seductive. But why try to bribe male viewers when nothing changes now? Deathtrap is funny, sophisticated, witty and elegant. The mystery has some glaring flaws that somewhat lessen, and I was not completely satisfied with the ending, but watching Caine and Reeve under the direction of Lumet with Levin's raised vocabulary was enough to entrap my interest and keep them throughout the length of the film.
