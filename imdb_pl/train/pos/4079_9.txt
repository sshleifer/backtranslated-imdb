I saw this movie for the first time when I was about 8 years on television in the United Kingdom (where it was called "Laupta: The Flying Island"). I liked it very much and I had a broken heart when it was repeated a moment later and I missed it. I was charmed with history and characters, but above all with haunted and beautiful music. This would be the original English version of dubbed I saw - sometimes incorrectly referred to as "Streamline Dub" (dub was in fact Ghibli itself and distributed only by Streamline), which is unfortunately not available, except for the ridiculously expensive box-set laser disk. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I feel that the publishing house has been partially spoiled by Disney. The voice game is fine, but the dialogue does not have the same raw energy as the dub "streamline" or original Japanese, and I think James Van Der Beek sounds too old to play the lead role. They made some pointless changes, such as changing the name of the main character from "Pazu" to "Patzu" and added some dialogue. But worst of all, I feel they have ruined many scenes with intrusive music - for example, the initial stage of the airship was initially silent, but it was spoiled thanks to the Disney craving requirement that music will be played when someone is not annoying in many Disney movies. <br /> <br /> This movie still blows off the latest animated films and I can not recommend it. The plot is simple, but captivating, and the film shows talent, which unfortunately lacks in most contemporary mass, homogenized animations.
