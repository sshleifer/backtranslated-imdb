This delightfully pleasant and heartfelt continuation of the extremely successful "The Legend of Boggy Creek" is a continuation only by name. The stories abound in the sleepy, independent fishing community of the supposedly cruel creature Bigfoot called "Big Bay Ty", which is deep in the uninvited Boggy Creek. The two brother brothers and their older, more sensible sister-tomboy (sweetly feisty creation of the charming, striking star "Different Strokes", star of the comedy series Dana Plato) set out on the treacherous swamp to see if the essence of the local legend can actually be a real living creature . Trio is hopelessly lost in a furious storm and furry, bearlike, generous but very gentle and kind Sasquatch comes to the rescue of children. <br /> <br /> Intentional, no frills direction Tom Moore simple story in a calm pace, carefully captured the smallest detail of the village town in extremely accurate details, attracting various village figures with great warmth and cordiality and grateful developing sentiment into organic, restrained , unforced way that never turns into sticky -sappy mush. Adorable Dawn Wells (Mary Ann on "Gilligan's Island") gives you a captivatingly amusing portrait of the loving children of a single working class mother, while Jim Wilson and John Hofeus offer pleasant irritating support as a few quarrelsome giant scoundrels. Robert Bethard's robust, sunny cinematography depicts a forest setting in all its profoundly peaceful, painfully clean and fragile civilizations, untouched by splendor. The Darrell Deck score perfectly combines the annoying carnal tremor of the synthesizer and the joyful country bluegrass into banjo in a melodic brew. In addition, this image guarantees exceptional praise for the way in which it unpredictably predicts that in the 90's, Bigfoot's children's fashion has a good 15-year advance.
