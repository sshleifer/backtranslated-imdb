No Strings Attached is one of the best performances of Carlos Mencia so far. Mencia is known for poking and joking about racial problems. However, he does more than in this stand-up show that took place in San Francisco. In general, Menci's material not only makes you laugh, but also makes you think about what is really bad in today's society. <br /> <br /> In this hour's performance Mencia talks about things like illegal immigration women really mean when they ask for equality in the workplace, terrorism, his opinion about Mel Gibson's passion and the argument that came with a woman in whether Jesus is afflicted or not and how society should treat those who are physically or mentally disabled. Mencia even discusses whether to have the right to speak and joke. <br /> <br /> Carlos Mencia is not afraid to offend, which often causes him problems with his critics. For example, he goes a bit far (and admits) with a joke about Pope John Paul II and what he is probably doing now in heaven. <br /> <br /> The main message of Mencia in all his performances is that we all have a voice and that we should use that voice to speak what we feel and not be afraid to offend. It reminds us that we have the right to free speech and that we must use this right as Americans. <br /> <br /> If you like this performance, I definitely recommend watching Mind of Mencia, his program on Comedy Central.
