One of the best science fiction works, as a visionary and thought-provoking, like Blade Runner and even Brazil Gilliam. Willis gives his best performance here, but he overtook the incredibly crazy phrase of Pitt, which does not resemble anything he did sooner or later. However, even Stowe is not here from her league. The story is very layered and offers much to think about. The climate scene is beautifully beautiful, and the last lines fit perfectly. Scenes in a psychiatric hospital are terrifying and yet so fun in their own way. Lots of dark humor on display. Fantastic production design and appropriately bizarre photos. In my top ten.
