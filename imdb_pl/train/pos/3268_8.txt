Lovely romantic comedy. The plot is a bit too complicated - I tried to sum it up three times and I can not. Suffice it to say that it is worth seeing. The film is funny, beautiful - the story is completely unrealistic, but it works. Everyone in the movie is so nice and everything looks so great - it creates a sweet, romantic mood throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> Acting is great - Robert Downey Jr. and Cybill Shepherd are in top form and enjoy every moment. Ryan O'Neal and Mary Stuart Masterson are fine, but fine. If you're a sucker of good, sweet sentimental movies (like me), catch this one. Downey looks great in his underwear too! <br /> <br /> Additional bonuses - the title song sung by Johnny Mathis and another great song "After All" sung by Cher and Peter Ceter.
