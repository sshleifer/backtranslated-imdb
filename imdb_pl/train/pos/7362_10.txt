What a funny, sexy movie! They certainly do not like them anymore. 4 sexy au pairs come to London and experience all kinds of sexual adventures. The tone is strangely innocent because considerable nudity evolves from back-to-back farce situations, not from explicit sexual desire on the part of the character. It's only when the actress accidentally loses clothes that the male characters become crazy. Richard O 'Sullivan literally gets "Randi" (sic). The film surely reveals the genesis of the softcore function as lying in the films nudie cuties and the nature of the old school. My special interest in "Au Pair Girls" is that I am a big fan of Gabrielle Drake. If any actress ever looked better naked (she is slim, but wonderfully curved), or dressed, come to this (I loved her since the first UFO launch - who else could take the purple wig!), I will eat my hat.
