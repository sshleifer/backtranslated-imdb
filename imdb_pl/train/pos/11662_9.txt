The secret of Kells is one of the most unique, beautiful and amazing animated films I've ever seen. Before I watched the movie, I was convinced that he would not give up running for his money and that it was a shoo-in to win in that category, but in Kells I found a serious candidate. <br /> <br /> Kells tells the story of a young orphan named Brendan, who lives with his uncle, Abbot of Kell. The abbot is a loving guardian, but perhaps a bit too harsh and more interested in strengthening the wall around the city against the upcoming attack by the Vikings, rather than nurturing the boy's imagination. When the legendary brother Aidan (who looks surprisingly like Willie Nelson) appears and takes the boy under his wing, Brendan goes on a trip to the forest and meets a beautiful forest nymph named Aisling, which he likes (and saves his life more than once) . With the help of Aisling, he tries to save the city and help Aidan's brother fill up a mystical book that, according to legend, can turn the dark into light. <br /> <br /> See my full review of The Secret of Kells at: http://theoscarsblog.blogspot.com/2010/02/movie-review-secret-of- kells.html
