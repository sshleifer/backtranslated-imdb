A good movie about martial arts. The fighting scenes were good. Michel Qissi did a good job of directing his first film without Van Damme. History worked without disgusting language and too much blood. Screenwriter Jeanette Francesca has a good storyline that works. It would be great to see something else in the same genre. She likes art and has a strong woman walking. It was definitely worth a look. I recommend this film to all lovers of drama and martial arts.
