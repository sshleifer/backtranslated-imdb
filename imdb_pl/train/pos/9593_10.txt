Above all, I am butch, a simple white man. But even with this handicap I love this movie. It's about real people. Real time and place. And of course New York in the 80's. I had many gay friends growing up in New York in the eighties and the only thing I've always admired was their courage to live their lives the way they wanted to live. No matter what the consequences. It's bold. You must admire it. It's a great movie, watch it and see what it was like to be an extravagant African American or a Spaniard in New York in the eighties. It's real life. The conclusion is real life.
