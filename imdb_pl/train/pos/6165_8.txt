Yes, some threads are difficult to follow, and The Bill tends to be aggressive, but in reality it is an engaging program that I try not to miss. The vast majority of episodes are very exciting and quite tense, and the acting is quite good, although I miss Robert Taylor as inspector Gina Gold and Todd Carta after Gabriel Kent. I admit that I prefer older episodes from newer episodes and it is a pity that the program is now a breakthrough because I thought it was easier to watch at 8.00. Even so, why I like The Bill, it's not just that it's addictive, but in the end the cliffs make the next episode unforgettable. But the truth is that it's more melodramatic than it really is, but I really like this program as a program that does not try to take it too seriously. 8/10 Bethany Cox
