Russian emigrant director in Hollywood in 1928 (William Powell) casts his epic about the Russian revolution and employs an old former general of the tsarist regime (Emil Jannings) to play the film's general, and two experience the drama and memory of the woman they shared (Evelyn Brent ), 11 years earlier. <br /> <br /> Try as much as I can, I feel it is difficult to warm up to the "Last Command" because of all its advantages. "The Docks of New York" was undoubtedly a great movie, and "Underworld" is a movie that I've always wanted to see, but "The Last Command" is quite heavy. The premise is fascinating, but the operation really makes the script come alive, with the exception of the Hollywood sequences that show the line of possible add-ons and the machinations of great film production with the latest technology. br /> <br /> Emil Jannings is, as you might expect, a great Russian general, distinguished splendidly between the old and former ex-general, taken over by misery, and energetic, cordial former officer. <br /> <br /> The tip is great and worth the wait, but to get there, you have to get bored sometimes.
