The closest I've ever seen was the clip shown at the Gerard Philippe exhibition in Paris about two years ago. I was not interested in the remake and after only half of the half-century, when I did, I could only say that the incompetent fencing was intentional, aimed at debt, obsolete purpose. Hollywood has led realistic swordfights since the 1930s, when the biggest of them, Basil Rathbone, crossed foils with Errol Flynn and others, so the technique was available, so it leaves only satire. After a while, you do not notice and do not like the dialogue of Henri Jeanson reminiscent of Zenda Prisoner, both versions. Gerard Philippe was certainly present to play such a role, and Gina Lollabrigida was probably slightly better than Martine Carol, another obvious candidate at the time. The print I saw was particularly bad and at some point it completely broke down, so maybe the DVD version will improve it.
