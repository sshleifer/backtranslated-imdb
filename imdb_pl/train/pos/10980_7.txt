I saw this movie a few weeks ago and it has been in my head since then. He plays two charming characters in a unfortunately mediocre document. To learn about the true story of The Beales, I had to review all the bonus DVDs and comments and search the web. <br /> <br /> Although Maysles and their fans (not to mention Edith and Edie themselves) bristling with the suggestion that this film is exploitation, it is exploitation in the truest sense of the word. Very little effort is made to explain Beales or how they came to the state they found themselves in - the Maysles approach seems to be about turning on the camera and waiting for Edith and Edie to say something outrageous. The sound, even if Criterion is re-released, is weak and difficult to follow. Although I appreciate that this movie was made a little earlier in the history of the documentary, it is ironic to compare it to the (much better) Geraldo Rivera series on the sexual exploitation of mentally handicapped patients at Willowbrook State School on Staten Island from 1972, Four years before the film was shot Gray Gardens. <br /> <br /> To paraphrase a review in New Yorker, Edith and Edie needed a lot of things in their lives, and the document was not one of them. <br /> <br /> As for Edith and Edie, what I was thinking about watching the movie is "where the hell is their family"? They lived in dangerous, unhealthy, dangerous conditions. How is it that Jackie O, married to one of the richest people on Earth (or the rich family of Bouvier), can not afford a decent family Edith and Edie? Or at least hire a part-time housekeeper or guardian to come and watch them both? It is a shame and a lasting disgrace for the entire Bouvier family. <br /> <br /> Although this review may sound negative, I definitely recommend Gray Gardens to anyone who likes documentaries. Perhaps one day someone will come and make a documentary about this documentary - introducing the rich history (and history) of The Beales and the entire section of the Hamptons society in the '70s.
