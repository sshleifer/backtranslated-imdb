Tim Meadows must be the most underrated member of the SNL cast. What initially was a poor look at a dingy gigilo, turns into a completely entertaining, 90-minute run, though still low. Do not push it while waiting for beautiful pictures or performances worth an Oscar. Come in, expecting brilliant folly with Tim Meadows and Will Ferrell, who do what they do best - laughing the audience. <br /> <br /> Leon "The Ladies' Man" Phelps is a naive, friendly host of radio shows, who knows very little about anything except the wang roads. As a talented Ladies Man, he wastes the wives of countless juices that have gathered together to hunt him down. The director performs an inspiring work, leading the actors on a comedy tryst, which completely compensates for the lack of story development. How much plot can you expect from the SNL sketch? While some scenes are somewhat out of place, mostly one Meadows liner and absurd sexual comments go straight to a funny bone. For example, in one scene Meadows is compared to Mother Teresa, but to bonin. Sure it's stupid, but are we all in the comfort of our homes, we do not have a giggle with his advice for the whole city for "doing it in the backside"? In another scene, immediately after a heartfelt kiss with a female heroine, he suddenly remembers that his name will be a benefactor, a woman he slept years ago. He gets up in front of a woman who has apparently fallen for him and announces that "The Ladies' Man is returning", to her obvious disappointment. <br /> <br /> Billy Dee Williams hits the ball from the park as a bartender / narrator. Will Ferrell, a repressed homosexual, sums up solid performances. <br /> <br /> See this movie if you like humor for adults. If not, stay away from extreme prejudices.
