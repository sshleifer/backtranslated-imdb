When I was 17 years old, Bye Bye Birdie made the high school - which is not a big surprise, because it is an excellent school material and considered the most staged musical in the world. <br /> <br /> I was a student musician and kept strong memories of the production and her songs, as well as constant disregard for the film version of Dick Van Dyke, who (intentionally) obscured Elvis references and smashed it on the audience swing 60. /> So, when the 1995 version, in which Jason Alexander appeared, hit the screen of my cable television, I was delighted with what I saw. Alexander draws attention to the unique performance of Albert, which contrasts with his more well-known figure from a television series. The rest of the cast is fun and convincing in their roles (Chynna Phillips is probably the only one who does not look like her role, presumably naive and innocent student). <br /> <br /> But most importantly, the musical numbers known from the scene are preserved in this film and performed as stage music (allowing for the lack of a scene). <br /> <br /> So if you know a musical (and not many), then check this telemovie. It makes a scene that shows justice in a way that probably can not be improved, which is good enough for me. What is better than faithful dedication to the writer's work, color and style?
