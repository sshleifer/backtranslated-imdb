I had the opportunity to watch several movies in BluRay and HD DVD. This film is a continuation of great action and great history. Although if you're looking for a movie with a great picture, this is not it. The lack of this movie on DVD made it easier to buy. I have always liked intense action and excellent acting, which is not always going hand in hand. This is what makes it an excellent movie to play. Now on the Blu Ray scale. You get two things in many Blu Ray movies. The image is almost crystal clear, without distortion or film with a grainy HD image. I was disappointed when I made this my first Blu-ray movie. I almost started to think it was a blu ray standard. Although I know better after watching other films. I do not believe that they have spent as much time as they should move to HD. In general, the problem concerns some movies. And for the price of Blu Ray players and Blue Ray discs you should have only the best picture. That's why I consider this a profitable investment for people who have never seen a movie or bought a DVD version.
