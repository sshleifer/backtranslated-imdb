And Vow to Cherish is a great movie. It is based on a novel of the same title, which was just as good, though different from film. You really made me think about how you would react if you were in the role of heroes. Recommended for anyone who has ever loved a parent, spouse or family member - in other words, EVERYONE! <br /> <br /> Although the production is not quite Hollywood - without great special effects - still, the values ​​and ideals are more than making up for it. And the cast did a wonderful job, grabbing the emotional ties between family members and the devastation that happens when one of them gets sick. <br /> <br /> You do not want to miss it!
