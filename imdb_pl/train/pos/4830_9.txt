Although some reviews are clearly Luke-warm, I think the story is totally addictive and even if some critics have described the love story as "Mills and Boon", so what? It's good to see a warm, moving story of true love in these cynical times. Many in the audience sniffed and surreptitiously wrapped their eyes around them. You really believe that young Victoria and Albert are passionate, although for political reasons it was an arranged marriage. I felt, however, that Sir John Conroy, who was desperate to control the young queen, might be played like a pantomime villain. There are rumors that he was actually Victoria's real father (as a result of the affair with Princess Kent's mother) it would be interesting to study this theory. Emily Blunt is completely convincing as a young Princess, imprisoned in a stuffy palace with courtiers and politicians who manipulate her. Brilliantly depicts the strength of character and determination, which ultimately made Victoria the great Queen of England, who prospered as never before, under her long reign. I believe that verbal recommendations will ensure the great success of this most pleasant and wonderful-looking film.
