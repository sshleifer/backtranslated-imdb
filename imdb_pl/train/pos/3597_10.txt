(spoilery) <br /> <br /> I was delighted with this movie. I have been renting movielink for some time and decided to check this movie. Many boxing movies seem to be full of blood. In this movie, he shows it at the amature level. Although I wish for more attention to be given to improving her grades. The film shows the problems faced by some families in relation to gender. <br /> <br /> I was a bit worried about the ending. But the ending was not a disappointment either. <br /> <br /> I think the title was that he would win. It was unexpected that they both returned to each other at the end. <br /> <br /> They loved the music for some of the scenes. I would highly recommend. <br /> <br /> 10/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 9/10 <br /> <br /> Entertainment: 10/10 <br /> <br /> Reproducible: 10/10
