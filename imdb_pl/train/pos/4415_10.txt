Although some may call it the "Cuban Paradiso movie", the film is closer to the film "How green was my valley", a memorial movie about the memory of lost innocence. The film intelligently avoids falling into the political trap of taking sides (pro-Castro? Anti-Castro ?, focusing instead on the human weakness of the characters and the importance of the family. Filled with good acting, in particular from the Mexican actress Diana Bracho, a masterpiece full of references to classic films, from CASABLANCA to CITY LIGHTS by Chaplin, Gael Garcia Bernal plays a small role that is critical to the dramatic profit from history. TV director Georg Stanford Brown, in a rare return to acting (remember THE ROOKIES?), plays a homeless bum that works like the Greek choir, it is a pity that this film, originally titled DREAMING OF JULIA, was released in the States by THINKfilm with the horrible title of CUBAN BLOOD, which has nothing to do with the film.
