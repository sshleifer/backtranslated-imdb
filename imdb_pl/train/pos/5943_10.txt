This movie is really cool. everything looks as if it came from a comic book. sets, costumes and plot is great. Clark Bartram is our favorite batman. he looked a little better in a dead end, but it still pulls it away. Superman is great too. Flying effects are OK. but it's a fan movie, so we can not expect them to be the best. the shot with the superman who caught the car was VERY reliable. It was great. This is a movie that I would definitely see if it was real. has everything you want in the Batman / Superman movie. The only exception is that I would play a joker instead of a 2-face ... I generally give this film 10 because it's a great movie.
