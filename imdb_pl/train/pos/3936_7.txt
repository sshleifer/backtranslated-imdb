It is a suggestive and idealized portrait of Lincoln's early life (born in 1809 in Hodgensville-Kentucky- and died in Washington 1865). Ford's excellent film takes Abraham Lincoln (Fonda) from his youth. He studied law, customary law and started practicing as a lawyer in 1837. This Hollywood biography follows Lincoln from his days in the hut, the initial relationship with Mary Todd (Weaver), following the pair from their first ball and leaving for the congress candidate. But he focuses mainly on brothers (Richard Cromwell, Eddie Quillan) accused of murder, a later trial with amusing scenes of court debates and the protection of their mother (Alice Brady). Lincoln-Fonda as a lawyer attorney and prosecutor Donald Meek are nothing but brilliant. <br /> <br /> A remarkable performance by Henry Fonda as an idealist Springfield traveler who was scheduled to perform regularly for Ford from the movie, "Anger Grapes, My Beloved Clementine and Fort Apache." In addition to the mad act of Alice Brady as a sorrowful mother, she was a great actress from silent cinema, but this is her last film because she died of cancer early. The development of Lincoln's deeds makes him skilfully attract entertainment. His portrait shows the nostalgic longing for past and old values ​​and describes his goodness, honesty and intentionality. Lincoln, like John Ford, was a straightforward man who never changed the ideals of his youth. This American masterpiece is correct in both cases, as a great biography and as a great drama. <br /> <br /> Other biographies about Abraham Lincoln are: 1) Abraham Lincoln (1930) DWGriffith with Walter Huston, Una Merkel, talk from his birth to his attempt; 2) "Be Lincoln in Illinois" (1940) by John Cromwell with Raymond Massey, Ruth Gordon, regarding similar events in Ford's movie as a lawyer 3) TV version "Lincoln Gore Vidal" with Sam Waterston and Mary Tyler Moore as Mary Todd .
