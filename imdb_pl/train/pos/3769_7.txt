Oh, come on, learn to have some fun. When I was a kid, oh, this movie was a good Oscar for me. I thought it was absolutely hysterical. One of the best movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> Now it's a bit stupid, but give it a rest. If you liked "Excellent Adventure", you should have fun with "Bogus Journey". It was a movie before "Dude, where is my car?". Only this one is really funny. As I said, it's only a good time. Do not take it seriously and if you liked the first one, you should like "Bogus Journey". It's just a funny movie with unforgettable characters. Just for pleasure, watch, let go and remember that it's a stupid comedy. That's all. <br /> <br /> 7/10
