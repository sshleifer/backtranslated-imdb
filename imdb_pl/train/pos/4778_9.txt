Like his early masterpiece The Elephant Man, Lynch proves to his opponents that he can tell a simple story without losing artistic contact. This is the true story of an elderly retired man (expertly played by Richard Farnsworth) who decides to ride a tractor through several states to pay his last visit to his distant brother who is now at the door of death. A beautiful score from Badalamenti, an excellent photograph of rural life (I love these shots of corn in the air) and the crafty hand of the director, which reveals the basic humanity of a man, is a beautiful piece of a movie. Its extremely slow pace can put some viewers to sleep, but those who stay on the ride will eventually be rewarded.
