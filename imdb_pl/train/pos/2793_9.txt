It's such a shame that thanks to this title, people who hate football will be avoided. Bend it like Beckham is much more than a tacky sports flick. The plot is moving and intelligent, no jokes, jokes laugh out loud, and the characters are well-preserved. Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley are wonderful as teens Jess and Jules, great playing on and off the pitch. Anupam Kher is wonderful as Jess's worried father, and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, who was so incredibly angry at "Ride with the Devil", meets as well as a nice guy, taking full advantage of his wonderful Irish accent! Even if you do not like football, go see this movie. If anything makes you smile.
