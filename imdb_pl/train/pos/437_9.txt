Enchanted April is a tonal poem, an impressionistic painting, a masterpiece of message transmission in a few words. It was one of my 10 favorite movies since it appeared. I am still waiting, though less patiently, for a DVD movie. Apparently I'm not alone. <br /> <br /> If the Amazon parent company listings are correct, many people want this title in DVD format. Many people want to go to Italy with this cast and this script. Many people want to keep a permanent copy of this movie in their libraries. The cast is spectacular, photos and impeccable direction. The film is a definite guardian. Many have already asked about it. Add our names to the list.
