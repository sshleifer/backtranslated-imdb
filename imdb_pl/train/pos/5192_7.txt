I'm a fan of kung fu, but I'm not a fan of Woo. I'm not interested in gangster movies filled with the game on top. Now martial arts; *it is beautiful! And John Woo surprised me here, creating a very funny kung fu movie that almost * has too much * fight if that's possible! This is a good thing. <br /> <br /> Many battle scenes are very good (and some of them are less good), and the main characters are funny and friendly. The bad ones are a little too incredibly bad, but still funny. You must see the Sleeping Wizard !! He can only fight when he is asleep - it's hysterical! <br /> <br /> However, after a few replays, Last Hurray For Chivalry can be a bit boring and long-lasting, especially since many fight scenes are actually not so good. That's why I rate this "only" on 7 out of 10. But it really is "8". <br /> <br /> In total one of the best kung fu movies made at the heart of cinematic cinema's perfection. All really good kung fu movies are from the mid to late seventies, with some notable exceptions from the late 1960s and early 1970s (and early 1980s to be honest).
