Jeff Wincott is not just a handsome man, he can kick butt! This film has one of the best martial arts movements I've seen for a long time. Okay, so maybe Bridgette Nielson is not the first person I'm gonna play for a ruthless politician, but she did BIG work! And let's not forget that Wincott has a partner in this film played by martial arts expert / stuntman Karen Sheperd. So he is not Cynthia Rothrock, who is LITTLE ?! It's just as good if it's not BETTER! (just check her fight scene at the end of the movie, one word: OUCH !!). My suggestion would be to buy this movie as soon as possible, because if you have not seen it, you really miss some great martial arts action.
