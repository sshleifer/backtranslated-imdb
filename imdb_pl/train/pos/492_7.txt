Let me first say that although I have watched every episode of StarTrek at least twice, I do not consider myself Trekker or Trekkie. These are people who live in the basements of their parents and participate in conventions in costumes with pointed rubber ears. I gave this film seven by rejecting the historical mistakes of fiction. Acting was better than average, but the plot did not have any surprises. They tried very hard to change the technique, but the special effects were only a great temptation. Regarding historical errors, if you call them that way, the first captain to pilot the Enterprise was Commander April, then Capt. Pike, Jim Kirk, etc. According to a statement made by Riker and Kirk, we discovered the Klingons and taught them (and that's why the first directive was created), but as I said, there is no reason to discredit this beautiful series. I hope that the story will become deeper, and then the special effects can take place in the back seat.
