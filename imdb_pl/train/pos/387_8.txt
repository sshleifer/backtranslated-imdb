This movie is good. This is not the best of the best kung fu CG films, but it's pretty good. First of all, the story is really good. The whole idea of ​​cooperation between gods and fallen gods with super powers is quite nice. My problem is too many characters! It became very confusing when they changed scenes! The special effects were AMAZING! The battle scenes were very fast and complex. This video is virtually all computer generated. Acting is great, as is always expected from such well-known players. Ekin Cheng is a great hero, a loner. Zhang Ziyi did nothing for me in this film. I thought she would have a bigger role, but she made one fight scene and a whole lot of talk. The bad guy, the whole army of skulls and the cloud cloud is very scary. The music is also perfect. For me, this story deserves at least a mini-series, and not just ONE film. There is too much history to cram in 2 hours. Maybe if there was a book or something, I would be able to keep up with all the characters and details. This film dedicates the integrity of history to action. I recommend Storm Riders every day.
