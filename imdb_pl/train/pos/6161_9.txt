During World War II, Bedknobs and Broomsticks are a fantasy adventure for children with Angela Lansbury as a witch who, with the help of three evacuees and a "professor of sorcery", thwarts the Nazi invasion. <br /> <br /> Ingeniously ingenious, with lots of laughter, this movie will delight children of all ages thanks to its great characters, exciting history and catchy melodies. Lansbury is perfect as Eglantine, a not-so-perfect witch who takes three children on the adventure of her life, and her three young friends (Cindy O'Callaghan, Roy Snart and Ian Weighill) are just as impressive as Cockney bastards who help fight the nasty Hun. . <br /> <br /> The special effects are a bit outdated, but let's face it, children do not care too much about these things as long as they're entertaining. And they will have fun. With a few impressive scenes that perfectly combine live action and animation with a great effect and more authentic movie magic than a hundred Harry Potters, it would be difficult not to enjoy this wonderful blood of film escapism. In fact, only a fairly extensive music number embedded in Portobello Road determines the excellence of the movie, but with so many other attractions that you can easily forgive. <br /> <br /> And besides, every movie with British TV legend Bruce Forsyth as a "Flash" spy in the style of Harry guarantees me a good rating.
