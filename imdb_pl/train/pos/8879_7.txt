*** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> this film always seems very exaggerated, until I remember that my university camp was suicide of a former student who became a Nazi racist killer too: his name was Benjamin Nathaniel Smith . <br /> <br /> look at him in wikipedia - I added some photos to their article about him. <br /> <br /> it's hard to believe, but these things really happen. <br /> <br /> I'm not a huge fan of Omar Epps or Ice Cube, but Larry Fishburne, Kristy Swanson, Jennifer Connelly and Mike Rappaport were all good.
