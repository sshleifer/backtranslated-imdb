Recently, I was looking for a recently published Wide Screen DVD FLY AWAY HOME and came across an interesting title that I have never heard of: GRAY OWL. The fact that it was Richard Attenborough's movie attracted my attention (responsible for such great films as GANDHI, CHAPLIN and SHADOWLANDS). I noticed that the screenplay was written by William Nicholson (author of SHADOWLANDS). This "special edition" was full of interesting sound material, and the price was less than USD 10 - so I came across it and bought it. WOW! What a beautiful movie. Pierce Brosnan portrays Archie Gray Owl, a real trapper from the 1930s who loved and respected Canada's wild lands and worked on their protection. Brosnan (who starred in the James Bond movie) gives a shady, warm, powerful performance, just like Annie Galipeau as a young woman who loves and affects his feelings for creatures on earth - especially the beaver. The excellent result of George Fenton (THE CRUCIBLE) and the beautiful photo by Roger Pratt significantly increase the effectiveness of the film. And the additions on this DVD are something else! Includes two shorts made in the 1930s with real Gray Owl, as well as songs with audio comments by Attenborough and Producer Jake Eberts; 2 distinctions; and many other minor extras PLUS options for people who have access to a computer with DVD-ROM functions. GRAY OWL was released directly on DVD in the United States - the fact that Richard Attenborough ascribes Hollywood's lack of interest in the distribution of something that is not full of violence and sex. It's a movie that not only informs and entertains, but leaves you something to think about. I had a very warm feeling at the end of the movies - and a whole new love and understanding for beavers! GRAY OWL is a very good movie - it's worth checking it out! This is the one that I can share with others.
