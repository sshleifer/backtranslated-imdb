I have heard good things about this film and, as you guessed, I was a little disappointed. Reese Witherspoon is equally promising, surprisingly good, surprisingly confident, at a young age; really all (small) casts are quite solid, in their simple American style of the 1950s. The reason why I did not judge this film is, first of all, that at the end, the sadness shown by the older sister did not seem so real, and it drew me out of the movie. Perhaps we are expected to fill the storyline, or maybe the film had to be a bit longer. I think Maureen's character is quite poorly developed. It is understandable that Dani (Reese W., younger) would have suffered injury and anger, but why is her sister more nervous? Because she is a few years older? Did not the end undermine the rest of the movie? The pace of the film makes it seem that Maureen and Court have just met when it is lost (warning: this scene is surprisingly brutal, in retrospect it seems that she may have tried to shake a little.) Well, it works!). It depends on what you want - if you want a happy story of young love girls that you think you're going to get, you're surprised. Man in the Moon is both peculiar and dreamy, and the movie is sharp for age? rather an awkward combination? I liked the character of the Court, I see what the girls are watching. And I loved that they had the courage to both let him hurt his younger sister (most men would not do it, most movies would not do it) and be killed. <br /> <br /> 7/10 in my fairly strict rating scale. For some reason, I found Jason London on a fun tractor.
