I have to be 100% honest with other IMDb users. I wanted to see this movie for a very long time only because of the poster. Does not Charlotte Gainsbourg look exceptionally sexy and charming, smiling in this way? I'm in love with this woman! I have what I expected ... but only half. This film should provide the expectations of those who like all kinds of romantic comedies or stories with intelligent humor and light dramatic situations. <br /> <br /> Although I do not agree with another IMDb user who claims the video is overrated; I must admit that "Pr√©te-moi ta main" has many disadvantages. <br /> <br /> My main problem in the film is the lack of chemistry on the screen between the main characters. There is not a single scene preceding the culmination, which shows that the main characters share the moment of "romance" and even a clue suggesting that they are interested in each other. <br /> <br /> In fact, only one scene is divided into a moment is incredibly awkward (when both of them are on the couch) and does not help the audience understand the possible interest in love. I did not buy the dinner sequence. <br /> <br /> Despite this, the film provides very funny moments and has strong dialogues that support such an ingenious assumption. I mean, it's clever that in these days it would be very difficult to make such a farce by a 43-year-old man. <br /> <br /> I understand that this is a movie and that's why I accept it as a funny situation. In addition, humor is versatile. There are moments with S & M, fun lines with Chabata's best friend, some references to lesbians, funny situations involving women from the family and many more. <br /> <br /> Charlotte Gaionsbourg performance is at the highest level and is definitely the reason to watch the movie. She is funny, sexy, she looks very thin and good, and shows that she is a versatile and talented actress who can bring out comedy and dramatic performance in pure light. <br /> <br /> Alain Chabat is a great actor and gives a very decent performance. I think the support cast does what it can. <br /> <br /> The result, art direction and other technical aspects are really good and give the film a dynamic look. <br /> <br /> Those who enjoy this kind of cinema should be satisfied after the final credits. This is a good example of good cinema.
