I never heard of Robert Roy MacGrego before "Rob Roy" appeared, but the movie is definitely worth seeing. Playing the title character, Liam Neeson brings the same spirit to the role that Oscar Schindler brought, and Jessica Lange does a really good job as his wife Mary. Archibald Cunningham (Tim Roth) is one of the people who can make your skin crawl. <br /> <br /> In total it comes out as good as "Braveheart" (maybe even better). I laugh when I think about how Hollywood released two films almost in a whole, doing a coup in England. Very good. Also starred were John Hurt, Eric Stoltz, Brian Cox and Jason Flemyng.
