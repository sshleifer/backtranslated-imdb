Being a huge fan of Japanese singers Gackta and Hyde, I was terribly excited when I learned that they made a movie together and saw that my mission is in life. I was not disappointed. In fact, this movie far exceeded my expectations. Knowing that both Gackt and Hyde are singers, not actors, I was prepared for bold, but not very successful performances, but I am happy to say that both of them managed to charm me and believe me in this story. Moon Child has the right amount of humor, action, romance and serious moments. I can not say that I've ever cried more about the movie, and those more sensitive moments are, I think, perfectly played by a couple, definitely confirming their skills as actors. The battle scenes are absolutely stunning, and although there are a few moments of uncertainty at the beginning, you quickly enter the movie and start to relate to the heroes. I highly recommend this film to everyone, especially Gackta and Hyde fans.
