It's an amazing action movie with great Arnie lines! It is stylishly made, with lots of tight actions to please one. The characters were amazing, and Richard Dawson is very dangerous as the main villain. Yes, he has plenty of role-playing holes, but he is very funny, with a perfect ending. It was also a great story, and Arnie and Maria Conchita Alonso had great chemistry. Character development was also quite good, with some great performances. The director is great! Paul Michael Glaser is doing a very good job here, with amazing color usage, maintaining the elegance throughout, amazing camera angles and overall keeping the film very fast! good job. There is some blood. We get some bloody gunshot wounds, exploding head, slit throat, bloody slices of a chainsaw, skin-free corpses, blood and impalas. Acting is great! Arnold Schwarzenegger is AWESOME as always, he's great in the acting department, he has loads of fun liners, he's kicking this ass and as usual is a great physical presence! (Arnie's rules!). Maria Conchita Alonso is fine, she was really adorable and she had good chemistry with Arnie! Yaphet Kotto, he's decent here, with what he has to do, which is not much. Marvin J. McIntyre, he's good as a scientific guy, he was cool! Richard Dawson is amazing as the main villain and he was very dangerous and he had fun. Jesse Ventura, Jim Brown, Erland van Lidth, Gus Rethwisch and professor Toru Tanaka, do their best to make stalkers. Generally, you must see! **** 1/2 out of 5
