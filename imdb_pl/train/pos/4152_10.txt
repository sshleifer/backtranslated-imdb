Over the years, I've watched several episodes of Cold Case, starting with episodes of the first season in 2003-2004. And although most of them were good, this particular episode was not only the best of the best, but it also has very few rivals in the Emmy category. Although some may disagree with the content of the story (ie Romantic relationship with a man to a man), I doubt that anyone can see it without moving deeply in their spirit. <br /> <br /> The story is essentially a case that was reopened on the basis of the testimony of a dying drug dealer. The two main actors are two policemen from the sixties, named Sean Coop (aka, victim of a cold box, his name is called Coop) and his partner, Jimmy Bruno. <br /> <br /> In the story, Coop is a single, veterinarian of the Vietnam War, with a deeply embarrassed past. Jimmy, however, is married, with children no less. They are both partners of the police force and they create not only friendship, but a mysterious romantic relationship, which both must hide from the deep and obviously homophobic culture prevailing at that time. <br /> <br /> The flashbacks of their lives are mostly black and white, with pieces of color now and then sprinkled. An example would be the red car of the branch, the yellow curtains being gently blown through the window in Jimmy's bedroom, where Jimmy's wife watched Coop and Jimmy drink, fight, and then kiss in a state induced by alcohol. I found it interesting that only selected elements were stained in flashback scenes and everything else in black and white. I still have not come up with a scheme of colors and rationality. <br /> <br /> The clearly homophobic tension between patrol colleagues and the two main actors only increases the intensity of the episode. One of the key emotions was the situation in which Coop was confronted with his father after the baptism of the child of Jimmy. In this scene, Coop's father Sarge, who was a respected colleague in the force division, confronts Coop with gossip about Coop's relationship with Jimmy. At this point, you can feel sorry for Coop because the shame and disgrace of Father Coop has been dumped on Coop - "You will not dishonor our family ... and you are not my son." - clearly indicates hostile views on same-sex relationships in that era. <br /> <br /> An additional tension can also be seen in the police locker room, where Coop and another officer go on when Coop and Jimmy are labeled "Batman and Robin homos". <br /> <br /> When it comes to the relationship between Coop and Jimmy, it's obvious that Coop wanted more Jimmy in his life. One day he can see the tension on Jimmy's face, which he must choose between his devotion to his wife and children, his church, and yet his immortal dedication to Coop. <br /> <br /> Finally, Jimmy departs from Coop, realizing that he can not have both Coop and his family at the same time. Unfortunately, Coop is killed, perhaps because of his relationship with Jimmy, but Coop can also be killed for knowledge about drugs and police corruption, which has reached a higher level in strength. <br /> <br /> The most moving scene in the whole episode was when Coop, sitting dying of gunshot wounds in his patrol car, silently uttered his last words through the police radio to his partner: "Jimmy ... we were lucky. Do not forget about it. "<br /> <br /> The choice of the soundtrack was excellent throughout the episode. I liked the final scene with actor Chad Everett, who was still playing mourning Jimmy, who was much older and clearly still missing his former partner, Coop. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this episode. This is undoubtedly the most well-written, well-made and well-made of all Cold Case episodes I have ever seen.
