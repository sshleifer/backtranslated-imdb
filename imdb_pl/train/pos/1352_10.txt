I've never watched this movie and think it's a great classic with great veterans. In the period in which this movie was made, people in America were different, there was no television or all the modern things that we have today, except for the radio and the beginnings of great Hollywood movies. Sweet, innocent stories about a young romance between a young girl or a guy were seen differently than today. Ann Shirley, "Murder My Sweet", "44" played a young orphan who was called Carrot Top because of her red hair and was in the house of two older people who were like two wise owls and watched over by Ann Shirley. It was a small town and everyone knew everyone, and if something happened, the whole city learned about it in a few minutes. This is a film with decent and decent people who try to help each other in a very simple way. Today it seems very spherical and stupid, but believe me, in this way people were in America in the 1920s. & 30's and they were a great generation that loved good family movies.
