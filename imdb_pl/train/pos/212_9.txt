Like the comedy duo with the title, "The Sunshine Boys" became a forgotten classic 30 years later. There is no mention of it alongside other great movie comedies from the '70s. It makes no sense considering the uniqueness of this movie, perhaps the best Neil Simon ever wrote. <br /> <br /> Walter Matthau plays Willy Clark, once half of the legendary vaudeville comedy known as Lewis and Clark, now a bitter 73-year-old solo actor who can not find a job in advertising potato chips. His nephew and agent Ben (Richard Benjamin) are sure he can get a job if Willy agrees to reunite with his indifferent Al Lewis (George Burns) for the ABC-TV show business nostalgia. <br /> <br /> Nostalgia is what "Sunshine Boys" has had from the very beginning since a series of movie clips from the 1920s presenting various artists from olden times flared before us to the accompaniment of "Be A Clown" Cole Porter. Then there is today's film setting in Manhattan, where flared pants and wide polyester ties abound. Periods collide with the glorious mess of Willy in an apartment in Manhattan, where framed pictures and drawings of long-dead celebrities in tabloid headlines and empty bags with Zabar stores appear in the walls. If you lived in the '70s like me, you could even feel like in this apartment. <br /> <br /> Willy apparently lives there too long. He sleeps in front of the TV when the kettle in another room boils. Willy wakes up and picks up the phone. <br /> <br /> "Hello, who is this?" Break. "Never mind, it's tea." <br /> <br /> Old people living alone can be a sad material in almost everybody's hands, but Simon's skillful joke and the infallible feeling for character change this adaptation of his 1972 hit comedy of gold. The amazing thing about "The Sunshine Boys" is how much it rubs your noses in the almost existential state of Willy, not excluding you at all. "89 years old, he just dies out of nothing" Willy talks about one old friend of songs before deciding that the man probably died from writing a song that rhymed a "lady" with a "child". <br /> <br /> Burns won an Oscar for his unappreciated performances as a mild, but steel Lewis, but Matthau brings this house, his make-up and a proud but ragged media really sells you the idea that he was 73 years old when he did. Willy is nasty in the extreme, fully deserving description of Ben "crazy, weird" old man, but you will eradicate him all the time, enjoying his small victories, even when they come at the expense of others' patience. His lines also kill you, especially when he tries to kill Lewis, for whom re-meeting on television turns out to be a bad idea. <br /> <br /> "You have no contact!" Willy tells Lewis at some point. "I'm still in demand. I'm still hot! "<br /> <br />" If this room were on fire, you would not be hot, "says Lewis. <br /> <br /> Headmistress Herbert Ross spins everything in a very relaxed and discreet way, with low lighting and mid-range shots, even in emotional moments, to leave room for comedy and a general message of grace from the film through silent acceptance. You never feel that you are watching a movie, one of the many charms of "The Sunshine Boys", and Ross's direction, like the actions of three directors, is heading towards achieving this goal. <br /> <br /> Comedy is difficult, especially when subjects are people watching life passing them, but "The Sunshine Boys" makes everything seem like a pleasure because it is for us.
