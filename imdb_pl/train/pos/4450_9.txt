An old man who lives in the mountains wakes up one morning and loses a cat. He wanders the forest to witness the murder, but has he seen murder or is he losing his mind? Is he just getting old? The film is so great because the viewer has to decide what's going on. There are very few dialogues in this film, but you do not need words, the whole movie speaks for itself. You knew what was happening and I liked it. <br /> <br /> The second part, which I liked, are forest shots in late autumn and winter. They were pretty, but the only thing I did not like was the view of the old man in his underwear. He could tie the robe a bit harder, but otherwise it was quite a deep movie.
