The boy from the Aussie-Rules (Mat) goes to the city the night before an important AFL test match, where he is to be picked up by his cousin. And then everything goes wrong. <br /> <br /> His cousin, who has nothing to do, has been involved in a drug deal involving a local shark lender / drug dealer Tina (who looks like any gangster, but he is definitely an Australian). Needless to say, Mat is entangled in chaos and does not last long before the thoughts of tomorrow's match are brought to the back of his mind when crazy nighttime events have gone crazy. <br /> <br /> The excellent professional Shakespeare western Australian actor Toby Malone plays the role of a young naive boy from the country and successfully plays the role below his age. The best support comes from John Batchelor as Tina and the playful role of David Ngoombujarra as one of the cops who follow the events. The roll is fast, often fun and worth the hour.
