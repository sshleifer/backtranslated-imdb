"The House That Dripped Blood" is one of the best anthological films of the period. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Tracking the movie star, inspector Holloway, (John Bennett) states that the last reported observation was in a large mansion in the countryside. While looking through the house, he was told four different stories about the former residents of the house. <br /> <br /> Good story (s): Method of murder - Moving to a mysterious mansion to get some peace and quiet, while Charles Pens his latest masterpiece, novelist horror Charles Hillyer (Denholm Elliott) and his wife Alice ( Joanna Dunham) are delighted with a story that focuses on a serial strangler named Dominic. After a series of strange accidents and experiences at home, Charles begins to believe that the creature that has come alive persecutes him and his wife. This is probably one of the better entries in the movie, this is the easiest one. The atmosphere is what sets it apart. Scenes with a fictional character are really scary, and the mystery around him is really effective and there is always a classic creeping moment. The classic moment is murder in the psychiatrist's office, which is the highest from time to time. Compilation to him, with creaking sounds, quick flashes of a mysterious creature, thunder and lightning in the back works well in his favor. <br /> <br /> Sweets for a sweet-moving new home, widower John Reid, (Christopher Lee) hires former school teacher Ann Norton (Nyree Dawn Porter) for her young daughter Jane (Chloe Franks) while on the move business. Ann gradually begins to unravel Jane's dark secret from the past, which John denies. When she learns the true nature of what has happened, she is far more shocking than what she could think. With the most frightening story and the greatest turnaround, it's quite a pleasant entry. The secret of the family is wonderfully played, with small amounts of clues piled up here and there, and the final revelation is even nervous. This part is the main reason this works, and Lee does not hurt her either. <br /> <br /> The Bad Story (s): Waxwork - tortured by memories of his lost love, Phillip Grayson, (Peter Cushing) and his friend Neville Rogers (Joss Ackland) both are enchanted by the statue of a woman in the Wax Museum, when the statue takes their lives, they discover a shocking secret about the museum that haunts both of them. There is a clever premise here, which is a pretext to spend time in a wax museum, which is always terrifying. This is not an exception and looks amazing, which facilitates fluorescent lighting on sculptures. The sequence of dreams provides a great moment of tension, but what ultimately kills is a slow pace. It takes a long time for events to develop and most of the time they spend in the exhibition. It also builds at the end of a shock that can be seen from a mile away. These really lower it a bit. If this change changed, it would have a higher score, the rest is acceptable. <br /> <br /> The actor of the horror film about the veteran coat, Paul Henderson (Jon Pertwee), upset by the lack of realism on the set of his new movie, disappears and buys a new vampire coat from a special store. The coat soon turns him into a vampire, he goes crazy on set with the star Carla, (Ingrid Pitt) and other vampiric acts at home. Unconvinced that the coat is the cause, he does everything in his power to prove that it is only in his imagination. This is a pretty decent assumption, and there are many occasions for some decent terror, but that's what several factors do. First of all, it is too stupid when it comes to your own good. The return of the plot at the end is a perfect example that is so exaggerated that it is not a shock at all, it just is simply stupid. There are so few scenes of horror or horror that it's just boredom to sit. This is the weakest film in the film. <br /> <br /> The final verdict: quite a decent omnibus movie, there are several small problems scattered over each story that make it a less than perfect movie, but still highly visible. I highly recommend it for those who play similar films or like British horror movies. <br /> <br /> Today's rating-PG-13: Violence
