Dragon Hunters must be the best-looking animated movie I've ever seen. It was stunning. The film tells about a few rogues in search of cash, their bizarre, furry, blue dog that embraces fire, and a girl who dreams of becoming a knight, and they were sent on an expedition to kill a world gobbler, impossibly a huge dragon. But to be honest, it does not matter what the movie is about. Because it is stunningly gorgeous. Gravity in this world of fantasy is different, so blocks of architecture and the land sphere revolve around cathedrals, castles and villages, as well as floating daylily forests. The world is so creative, so very beautiful, with some silent look of the book. The world looks like a set of wonderful paintings. The monsters are also visually stunning, like a fiery dragon consisting of a swarm of evil red bats. Part of the plot is not very original, like the main characters who want to have a farm "Mice and men" and never seem to be able to do it in the world; but great graphics, some seriously sinister scenes and emotional dialogue make this movie spectacular.
