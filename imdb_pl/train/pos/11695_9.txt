It's such a great movie! No low ratings here. I really have no idea where it came from, then they have to discuss another movie. Because I loved her very much and discovered that it was a small hidden treasure. <br /> <br /> This story was so original and charming. I really can not think of anything bad. Maybe it must be "your type of thing," but I saw it with my sister and my mother, and we all did it. <br /> <br /> Acting was also very good and it's hard to do in such a movie. But all the characters were very intriguing and compassionate. <br /> <br /> I've always liked Dougray Scott and his new "dark" role was very interesting. It's really hard for me to make me like a bad guy, but this time I absolutely did not have a problem with it. I loved him all the more. <br /> <br /> Anyone who loves a good thriller / drama, who also has a good dose of love and tragedy, should definitely see this movie, no doubt! Anyone who would like to see a film with 80% bloodshed, should, however, rent something else ... But I think that's the title. This is a love story, not Saw 3. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 4 out of 5 stars !!! Good job !!! <br /> <br /> xxx Enjoy it!
