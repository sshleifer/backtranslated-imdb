"Stanley and Iris" show the triumph of the human spirit. For Stanley, the fight for the ability to read and understand its potential. For Iris, it's finding courage to make love again after becoming a widow. The beauty of the film is a dance that Robert DeNiro and Jane Fonda do together, beginning and ending before each of them has the skills and courage to completely trust each other and move on. In this sense, it gives a very good view of how often life is and is therefore reliable. Unlike other reviewers, the characters that each of them rendered are consistent with the whole image. The supporting cast is also carefully selected and adds depth to character that the heroes gain in importance through accompanying performances. All in all an excellent movie. The best thing I can do is Hope.
