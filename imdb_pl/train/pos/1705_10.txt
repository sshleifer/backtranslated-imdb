"Spaced Invaders" is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I do not understand why this film has not gained better critics, it is funny, harmless and sweet. I saw him for the first time when I was 11 years old and I really fell in love with him ... 2 days later, I got him on VHS :-P To this day, I showed it to many friends and everyone liked it, but nobody knew the film before. I think this is a problem, hardly anyone knows about it, so hardly anyone can like it ... This movie never had a real chance, it's sad, "SI" really has the potential of a comedy like "Monsters Inc. "Or" Space balls ". Ok, enough of dissatisfaction - what I really wanted to say is that if you ever want to laugh, watch it! Even if you do not come up with it, it's worth watching! -> Prepare for laughter, scum of the earth!
