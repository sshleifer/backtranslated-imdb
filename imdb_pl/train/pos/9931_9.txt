I rented a domino from a whim, not even knowing that it was inspired by a real story, and though it's the least likely and true biographical, you'll probably see. I think it is rather amazing. <br /> <br /> With Richard Kelly writing, he sets up a lot of threads and narrations in 2 hours of pure entertainment. And when you see it, you will get it and you will appreciate it. <br /> <br /> Domino is a model that has become a bounty hunter who leaves the perfect Hollywood life to pursue a less-than-subtle or excellent career. It has a style of acute, sour journey provided by director Tony Scott. Thanks to fast music and editing, it provides a visual effect that allows you to keep your attention, thanks to sleek performances and unexpected comedy, the film is well-made and pleasant and should reach a wider audience. <br /> <br /> I suggest this to anyone who wants to think and play at the same time for 2 hours.
