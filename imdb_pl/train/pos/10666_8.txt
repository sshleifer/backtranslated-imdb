When I really started to be interested in movies, at the age of eleven I had a large list of "must see" movies and I went to Blockbuster and rented two or three on weekends; some of them were not intended for all viewers, and my mother wanted to go crazy. I remember that one of the films on the list was "A Chorus Line" and could never get it; so now to see this, my dream has come true. <br /> <br /> Of course, I lost the list and would do anything to get it back because I think there were some really interesting things to see. I mean, take "A Chorus Line", a stage play turned into a movie. I know that this is something that we see very much today, but then it was apparently a bit different; and this movie has something special. <br /> <br /> Most of the musicals have made movies today, use the opportunity the camera gives them to create different scenes and take the characters to different places; "A Chorus Line" was born on the theater stage as an art and dies in the same place as the film. After the great interrogation organized by renowned choreographer Zach (Michael Douglas), Richard Atenborough directs a large number of dancers when they try to get a job. <br /> <br /> Everything happens on the same day: tension of ignorance, stress connected with the necessity to learn numbers, quiet competition between dancers And everything happens on stage, where Douglas puts every dancer in the spotlight and tells them to speak about your personal life and the most terrible experiences. There are hundreds of dancers and they are all fantastic, but the list gets shorter over time. <br /> <br /> Like the movie that I last saw, "A Prairie Home Companion", broadcast radio broadcast, Atenborough here deals with the problem of continuity. Something is happening on the stage or behind it, and time does not seem to stop. Again, I do not know if Atenborough cuts out a lot to do it, but it certainly does not look like it; and besides, it's a great directing and editing work (John Bloom). But at this small stage you are wondering what to do with the camera? Only one setting, Ronnie Taylor's cinematography finds its way, approaches certain characters, zooms in and out, shows the scene from a different perspective and also gives us a beautiful view of New York. <br /> <br /> In one key moment, Douglas tells those who have been: "Before we start eliminating: you are wonderful and I would like to hire you everything, but I can not." It made me think about a reality show, where only talent for singing or dancing counts, and the jury always tells the participants exactly before some of them leave (even if they are not good). It's difficult, you have to imagine; at least here, where all of them are really great. <br /> <br /> To tell some stories, the heroes use songs, and within one second the scene takes a new life, and literally is a "dream come true". Marvin Hamlisch's music and Edward Kleban's lyrics make the theater film a flawless passage, showing the feelings of these dancers and allowing them to do these great choreographies of Michael Bennett. The book in the theater also becomes an error-free and very short script by Arnold Schulman; which is sometimes very moving. So if it's not a song, it will be a word; but in "A Chorus Line" it is impossible not to be transferred. <br /> <br /> During one of the trial breaks at Cassie's interrogation, a special dancer played by Alyson Reed takes the stage to convince Douglas that he can do it. The words "let me dance for you" never sounded more honest and beautiful in music and lyrics.
