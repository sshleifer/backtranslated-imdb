I have not seen this for over 20 years, but I still remember it. <br /> <br /> This movie could NOT be made in color. Raw grays are what makes life so easy in the fifties? What distinguishes me most is Perry Smith riding the gallows. His breathing under the hood just before they came out of the trap. I do not think I can watch it again ... once there is a lot. It's like the unnamed guy at the beginning of the "Papillon" who is scared to the guillotine. The guy who said he was watching this on the dual account of "Dead Man Walking" should also add the last 10 minutes of "I Want To Live". <br /> <br /> Some of my ancestors, as "aristo," went to the guillotine in 1794-95, so my feelings about the death penalty are quite intense.
