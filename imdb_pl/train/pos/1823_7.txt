I remember watching this movie with my friends when we were 4, but it's strange that I never watched it. One day I looked after and my cousin never saw All Dogs Go To Heaven, so we rented both films and watched them together today, and he really loved these movies. So many memories returned, watching the movie again and I must admit that I even cried a little. I am 22 years old and I still like the ending. All Dogs Go To Heaven is one of the most moving animated films and I am shocked by this rating of 5.8, I thought that this movie will bring back good memories to others. I admit that the animation was a bit typical, but the story is so cute and fun. <br /> <br /> Charlie is a gambling dog who is killed by another gambling dog, Carface. But when Charlie wants revenge, he returns to Earth with a watch that can not stop ticking, or it's the end of his life. When he and his best friend, Itchy, look for Carface and spy on him, they find out how Carface gets all his money, he has a small orphan girl who talks to animals and finds out who will win the races. Charlie takes the girl, Ann-Marie, and makes false promises to get the money. But it ends with the teaching that maybe he should put Ann-Marie in front of him when Carface comes back to him with revenge. <br /> <br /> All Dogs Go To Heaven is the perfect family movie, it's not Disney, but it's a great family movie to watch. Not to mention that it's so sweet and touching. I know it's funny, and some call me crazy, but this movie for me when I was a kid made me believe that dogs have souls. How could they not? They are so loving and I think I will cry again. But in any case, I would recommend this movie to anyone, it's a fun movie to watch. <br /> <br /> 7/10
