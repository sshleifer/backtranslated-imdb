I was one of many who expected to see a glorified, Yankee doodle dandy portrait of the day, which (as rightly quoted) should live in infamy rather than in glory. How wrong I was. Those guys were there in the middle of it, and the pictures they came back are amazing and painful. And yet all this happened during an accidental trip to the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. <br /> <br /> Two French filmmakers composed a documentary about life as a New York firefighter, especially from the perspective of a young debutant passing through the ranks. At the beginning, we see the majority of this material to remind us that there was no question of producing a film about terrorism. It was supposed to be a film about ordinary people earning a fair life, helping others, and the beauty of the film is such that it never loses that advantage. <br /> <br /> When investigating a suspicious gas line (I think my memory is a bit foggy), suddenly we hear a plane overhead. The camera moves upward, revealing a commercial jet torpedoing into one of the towers. What does the operator need to imagine now? Recognizing the meaning of the recording, the camera stays on and probably realizing it, FDNY allows the camera to follow them to the building. <br /> <br /> Below is the real view from the front lines. We see the involvement of FDNY, their reactions (stunned silence after hearing that the first person falls to their deaths is chilling), as well as the fall of one of the buildings from the inside, while the other camera records events from outside. <br /> <br /> If it were not for the frightening event that they dealt with, the films themselves would be a dream come true for the young doctor. Simply, the material deserves to be preserved all the time. But what really sets this film apart is the real humanity it brings to the viewer. We see firemen charging without hesitation, people of different races helping each other escape the wave of debris, and even the care of filmmakers about each other (they are brothers), because they can not mix with each other. In this movie are amazing views, as well as amazing human stories, something that Hollywood can never duplicate (even if it tries). <br /> <br /> September 11 is not a film about politics. It is also not a film about religion, nationality or even jihad. 9/11 is a film about people and a true indication of the best and worst that we are capable of. 9/11 is just one of the most important movies I've ever seen and would be the only movie that was born from this event if it depended on me. You can not duplicate this.
