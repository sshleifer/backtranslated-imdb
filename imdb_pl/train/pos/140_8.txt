Normally, I do not like series. All are predictable and quickly become boring and boring. <br /> <br /> These series, however, are well played, the story goes through all episodes and even if you miss one, the story will continue to remember about it. <br /> <br /> All episodes have been filmed in the hospital and are getting closer to the secrets of dark and old secrets that lie just below the surface of a powerful hospital.
