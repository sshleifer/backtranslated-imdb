This film is perhaps the most moving and uplifting I have ever seen. I'm not a religious person, but sometimes a wonderful work of art such as this movie can give me almost a religious experience. Suddenly, we realize that life makes sense. <br /> <br /> I must admit that when I heard about this film for the first time, I was skeptical. I thought that the plot sounds like something invented and I was afraid that the story would be trivial. But being a fan of David Lynch, I decided to try. It took me about 30 minutes to completely capture the film, but then I completely lost myself in it. In this movie there is so much wisdom and warmth! I left the cinema feeling that I really learned something valuable about life. <br /> <br /> This is not a typical movie by David Lynch, and in some respects it was very surprising that he should make such a movie after discovering the dark side of human nature for so many years. On the other hand, it does not surprise me that he manages to convey deep emotions and a deep insight into a human being, because I also thought that he did very well in the Elephant Man. Lynch is one of the most talented directors and I think The Straight Story is his best game. 9.5 / 10
