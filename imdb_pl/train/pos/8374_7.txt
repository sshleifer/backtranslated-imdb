OK, this movie was cool. I do not think it was the best movie ever made, but it was definitely cool. My brother and I are still playing the scenes from time to time, and from time to time we take out the film from the cabinet, blow out the dust and throw it inside. It's fun all the way, but a great idea. It's a movie that you just have to forget about criticism and just enjoy. Judgment is the victory of Robot Jox.
