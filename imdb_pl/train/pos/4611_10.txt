Version: Universal / Hong Kong Legends R4 DVD release. Napisy kanto≈Ñskie / angielski <br /> <br /> Once upon a time, five years ago, the world was obsessed with the "Matrix", and I was perhaps one of the few fifteen-year-olds who still believed in "Terminator" was better than " The Matrix. " I was just a simple teenage boy looking for a good action movie, and then there was a shining light on the TV station I never really watched, a small station known as SBS. One night I noticed in a TV guide that a movie with Jackie Chan - "Police Story" will appear later. At fifteen and seeing only "Rumble in the Bronx" and "Rush Hour", I said ... "WOW AWESOME" and sat down to watch it, and I kept shouting "WOW AWESOME" as the movie progressed. Two weeks later, after SBS showed the "Police Story" trilogy, I knew that I found my new favorite actor. <br /> <br /> Jackie plays Chan Ka Kui, a policeman from Hong Kong who is destroying a great drug lord, Chu (Yuen Chor). Chu secretary, Selina Fong (Brigitte Lin), is being held by the police as a witness against Chu, and Chan is supposed to protect her. It's bad - the bad situation - when Chu's case is rejected, and he decides he wants Fong and Chan dead. <br /> <br /> "Police Story" is one of the best action movies, and certainly one of my favorite Jackie Movies Chan. It starts off strongly and ends one of the most amazing action sequences ever filmed. Everything in between is great. However, some fun parts may seem a bit unpalatable to a few people ... <br /> <br /> As a story, it's still one of Jackie's better efforts. In the action movie, the story is quite good, and Jackie is a much better actor than in the stage action "New Police Story". This is not "miracles", but maybe it is good. <br /> <br /> "Police Story" is one of the best works of Jackie. It made me interested in Jackie Chan's films and I should ensure a good start to any potential Jackie fan. The bad news for anyone who sees it first is that Jackie Chan's films do not come much better - 10/10
