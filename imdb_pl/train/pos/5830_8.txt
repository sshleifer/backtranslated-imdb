The boys work outside the recording studio when they hear the "angel's voice". That would be Miss Van Doren, interrogating and performing under the name Miss Andrews, because her father does not approve of her being a "radio singer." However, she hopes that a big wig, Mrs. Bixby, a friend of her dad will employ her, and then he will have to agree. <br /> <br /> He walks away, but in a few minutes the boys run amok in the studio causing havoc and have other musicians who kill them after they ruin the recording session. Finally, everything calms down. "We escaped them," says Moe. "Yes, we also escaped," says Curly. <br /> <br /> The boys then fool around in the studio, record a CD of Miss Van Doren, and Curly dresses in women's clothes and pretends to sing. Mrs. Bixby comes in, is impressed and rents "Seniorita Cucacha" on the spot! For an additional $ 500, she asked her to come tonight and sing at her party. The rest, as they say, is history, because Curly pretends to be an opera singer with some funny results. Oh, by the way, he was accompanied by "Senior Mucho" and "Senior Gusto". <br /> <br /> What happens at the party is that the truth wins, but not against a few slapstick eruptions. In total, quite a good episode. I liked it, but I would not rate it as nothing special.
