Legendary director Sidney Lumet gives us one of his best films in his historic career in this very tense and ultimately shocking story about a family that involves dysfunctional as one of the children. With the list of A-Lists led by Philip Seymour Hoffman (worthy of an Oscar), Ethan Hawke, Marisa Tomei and Albert Finney, Lumet won not only elements of unsuccessful crime novels such as the Reservoir Dogs, but also family stories such as Ordinary people. <br /> <br /> Many viewers may be confused and feel unappreciated when building a plot with which Lumet went. Instead of showing them in a linear way, he crossed the Tarantino route and shows the central scene of the robbery, which went wrong from different points of view, all out of order. Personally, I found this very satisfying and left me in constant guessing what would happen next. The screenplay is very strong, with some great scenes between husband and wife Hoffman and Tomea, and also between father, son Finney and Hoffman. All the actors are totally involved in watching, and Lumet is clearly enjoying the style of the game, which usually does not go deep. Plenty of action and tension to keep the audience for two hours, is a rare movie that does not disappoint you for a while.
