Indian cinema is characterized by cops in two broad categories: they are either honest or bad. Honest guys always shout at the top of their voices and fight the system, while bad cops enjoy most of the time, but suffer at the end. <br /> <br /> This film at least breaks the usual formula and gives a refreshing view of the cops and their lives. The direction has an internal view of the life of a young ambitious policeman who. Music is interesting, and editing is a determinant of trends in the Indian cinema. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the movie is slow, and the dilemma that Anbu faces when it comes to the Maya is sometimes too often played. Still, I would give this one 9/10 only because it has many first points on his account.
