It is good to see that Vintage Film Buff correctly classified its perfect DVD release as "musical" because it is this movie, clean and simple. Like the unofficial remake of Murder at the Windmill (1949), the plot of the murder is just a pretext for a sophisticated girlish show in which Kitty Carlisle and Gertrude Michael lead a cast of super-ornamental girls, including Ann Sheridan, Lucy Ball, Beryl Wallace, and Gwenllian Gill. Gladys Young, Barbara Fritchie, Wanda Perry and Dorothy White. Carl Brisson is also on hand to lend his strong voice "Cocktails for Two". Undoubtedly the most popular song in the film, you can hear it no less than four times. However, it is Gertrude Michael who steals the spectacle, not only thanks to the "Sweet Marijauna" version, but also thanks to the great performance as a rejected hero's girl. As for the rest of the cast, we could do it without Jacek Oaki and Victor McLaglen. The only good thing in Oakie's role is his poor run with the iconic Toby Wing icon. In fact, to give you an idea of ​​how far the rest of the comedy is overly indulgent and overly tense, the super stupid inspector McLaglen simply can not lay hands on the killer, although you would believe that in this case it is the person who is most suspect. Director Mitch Leisen really tries to point the killer even to the stupidest member of the cinema, giving the player a close-up after zooming in.
