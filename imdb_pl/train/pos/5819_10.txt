I've loved this movie since it first appeared. I was about nine years old and now I'm 27 years old. I remember playing the video game on Sega Genisis. I had so much fun, I would like to show my son this movie. He also likes Michael Jackson and I know that he will love this movie just as much as when I was a kid. Although he is much younger than me when I first saw him. I can not wait for it to come out on a DVD! I hope it will appear on DVD! Let it come out on DVD !! I'm dying to see it again !!! Well, this is my comment. I hope that one day I will see this movie again soon. I love all the movies from this movie. My favorite mini-movie is Badder!
