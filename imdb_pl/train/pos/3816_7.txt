"Secret Sunshine" reminded me of "The Rapture" (1991) with Mimi Rogers and David Duchovny, but this Korean production is a better movie. It presents super-religious Korean Christians in a provincial Korean city, and the experiences of the main character make contact with them after a terrible personal tragedy. Shin-ae is a widowed single mother who moves to the city of Milyang (in Chinese "Secret Sunshine") from Seoul with her young son. She chose Milyanga because her dead husband was born there (killed in a car accident) and feels he must start a new lifestyle in a new place. He does not respond well to the overtures of the local Christian fanatics, one of whom tries to convince her to come to their ecclesiastical and prayer meetings. Shin-ae is essentially irreligious and pushes these people as kindly as he can. In fact, from the very beginning she is brushing almost everyone in Milyang, but some of them stubbornly try to invade her world, and the consequences are often fun. To say more, to give a film, but it should be noted that the performance of the woman in the lead role (Jeon Do-yeon) is astounding. After reading that she won the Best Actress award in Cannes in 2007, I expected that she would get a decent job. But Mrs. Jeon is captivating and you can not take her eyes off her when she's on the screen. The film is a kind of shocking work by Evelyn Waugh-esquire, showing how a fate can feel just as insanely as it is strangely inevitable.
