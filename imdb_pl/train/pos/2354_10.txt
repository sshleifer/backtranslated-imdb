It was such a treasure when this concert was live, because it was such a fresh, innovative and original program. It makes every performance I've ever seen look boring. At the moment when the first episode was broadcast, I was delighted and attached myself to all the characters so easily (which usually does not happen, because I always hate a few characters). It is a pity that this concert will not have the third season, because it must be one of the best concerts I've ever seen, and that does not overdo my feelings. Nothing can replace Pushing Daisies, because what can ABC find to replace this show? This is the best program on TV. <br /> <br /> I came for Kristin Chenoweth and I stayed because I fell in love with the whole show.
