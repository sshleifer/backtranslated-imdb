I really like Star Trek Hidden Frontier, this is a great series of fictional movies and I can not wait to see more. I have already recommended this to other people, because it is worth watching. I have watched each episode many times and wait for the next episodes to appear. I've rated it in ten, but I think it deserves 12 compliments for Star Trek Hidden Frontiers staff for an excellent job. If you like Star Trek, I highly recommend watching this feature film "Star Trek". The details related to this series of films are excellent, especially the ships and planets used in it
