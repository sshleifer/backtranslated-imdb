This movie has one of the most stunning stories I've seen. For me it just makes it amazing! Fred Gwynne and Al Lewis are very good at what they achieved in the original Munsters series. While there was less slapstick, they still worked great "comically." It is a pity that Yvonne De Carlo, like Lily, would have no more involvement in the story. She showed that she could make a comedy in the original series, but in this movie she was mainly wasted. The film also features a wonderful Sid Caesar, but unfortunately he has no interaction with Gwynne and Lewis. I think it could result in a better job.
