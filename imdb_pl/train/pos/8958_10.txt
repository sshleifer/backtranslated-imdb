When you see Vertigo, look at Bell, Book and Candle, made within a few months of each other. <br /> <br /> My second favorite film Kim Novak, with Picnic, as the third. <br /> <br /> All three performances are great, Vertigo, being the best of all. <br /> <br /> They came to my place in Kansas Prairie, near Salina, Kansas in the 1950s to shoot the Picnic. <br /> <br /> Bell, Book and Candle's score, I think, is one of Alex North's songs. Perfect for this piece of comedy. <br /> <br /> After Vertigo, Stewarta and Novaku, they made this comedy, how funny it is to see the dramatic contrast. <br /> <br /> It's worth your time if you like Kim Novak. Greta Garbo, my youth.
