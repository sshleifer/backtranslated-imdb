Deaf secretary Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) is persecuted by her insidious male colleagues. <br /> <br /> When they suggest that they need an assistant, this seems like the last insult, but when the first applicant is ex-Paul (Vincent Cassel) he uses the chance to change his life. <br /> <br /> Carla hides her mistakes, and he, wanting to go straight, reluctantly helps her get revenge on her colleagues. <br /> <br /> When Paul asks Carla to reciprocate, he gets caught up in a criminal world, ruled by the ruthless lonely shark Marchand (Olivier Gourmet). <br /> <br /> Recognizing her ability to read lips as a weapon, no one will bargain, they both decided to do justice. <br /> <br /> The third film by French director Jacques Audiard "Read My Lips" is a song that undermines the genre, moving from a dark comedy to an emotional thriller. .
