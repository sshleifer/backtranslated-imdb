Have you ever had or have a pet who was with you thick and skinny, without whom you would be lost and whom you love, no matter what? They never thought they felt the same about you! <br /> <br /> A great, wonderful family movie. If you have a weakness for animals, it guarantees crying regardless of age. I watched the movie the whole time I was a little kid, and I find that now, at the age of sixteen, I love him as much as I did then. I could never decide on my favorite character and I still do not think I can! I love all three animals. Dialogue seems very real and comfortable, like a loving but disturbed family. I love Chance and finally says she finally has a family. Trashy, yeah, but you have to remember that it has to be a family movie and it perfectly fulfills this role. Sassy has just the perfect dose of "sassiness", and Shadow is a great role model for young, adventurous Chance. <br /> <br /> Animals are dim for people, but of course most moments of tears have them when interacting with them (eg rescuing Molly and the end). Not to mention the amazing soundtrack, which gives you even more emotions and the accompanying feeling of heart swelling. I give it 9/10. To be compared to (and even better rated) than Cats, Dogs and Babe.
