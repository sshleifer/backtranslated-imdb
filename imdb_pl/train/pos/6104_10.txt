I must admit that with EROS MOVIE COLLECTION, it must be the one I love the most, and also the one I have also reviewed. History is something that really watches you. Many EROS movies have a storyline that looks as if the hammer has broken it to pieces before you start production when you watch it. Everything is focused around sex, and who can find out how many different people come to the end of the movie. And, God, never watch any of these movies when someone pulls out a gun. It does not work that it's almost funny, but you do not want to lose energy to do it. <br /> <br /> "Losing Control" is exactly like the name. The main character, the main character (wonderfully talented and beautiful Kira Reed). Control is the control that a person has over the senses, body and feelings. And one man changes everything for her, makes her an almost different woman. But the mirror is broken at the same time. This makes it a great movie that I would like to come up with first! <br /> <br /> 10/10
