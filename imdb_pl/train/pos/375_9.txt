it was one of the most moving movies I've ever seen. I was about 12 years old when I watched them for the first time and when I was on TV my eyes are stuck. the acting and story are amazing. it seems so faithful to reality and touches so many controversial topics. I recommend this movie to everyone interested in good drama.
