Children between the ages of 7 and 14 have been so successful in this film that we have given a copy to all other children on our birthday list this year. Everybody liked it! Children from 2 to 7 years old watch them many times and often, and we are happy watching them with them. <br /> <br /> It is rare that a movie entertains children for so long and offers adult laughter too. Most enjoy it more than the first. <br /> <br /> The highest-quality production and outstanding cast, led by Christopher Showerman as George's superior - athletic, energetic and completely credible, with charming innocence and a special talent for capturing a tree in the face - well supported by the unique Christina Pickles as a bad mother-in-law, Thomas Haden Church as a bad rival and everyone else. This is cool.
