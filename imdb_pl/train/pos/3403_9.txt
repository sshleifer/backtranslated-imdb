Magnificent production of Techicolor telling an amazing story about a romance between a woman of strong religious faith and a Trapist monk who left his monastery, breaking marriages. The film opens in a monastery in Europe, where a former student is praying - a lonely beauty in black called Domini (Marlene Dietrich). The Mother Superior advises her to go to the desert and "find herself" and lose her grief over her father who recently died. In a carriage on the way to the Sahara, he sits opposite a very, very worried man (Charles Boyer) - our former monk. Soon, he is in a hotel near the palm oasis, where he again sees our mysterious, restless man who is embarrassed by what to do when he meets a very seductive dancing girl. Domini befriends him, although he knows nothing about his past - the affair will soon come. <br /> <br /> This movie is sentimental, melodramatic and different (in a sense, almost surreal, and even a little camp) - it turned out that it is quite fun and funny. Photography in this is really interesting - it is full of extreme close-ups of faces and beautiful color photographs of caravans of horses passing through the desert, silhouettes against the setting sun. Marlene Dietrich gives here a nicely performed, though restrained performance and looks great. Charles Boyer - usually not one of my favorites - is pretty good at it, I think his part fits him and he looks pretty young and handsome. Basil Rathbone is fine here, with very little to do. Another great orchestral score from Max Steiner helps keep the dynamics of the drama - all in all a very nice movie.
