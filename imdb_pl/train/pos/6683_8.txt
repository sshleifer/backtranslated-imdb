Forget the depth of meaning, leave your logic behind the door and have fun with this maniacally fun, totally absurd, ultra-camp movie live. MYSTERY MEN is a shipment of every superhero movie you've ever seen, but its unlikely superpowers are so interesting, diverse and well-mannered that they are unforgettable characters. Dark humor, even stupidity, bona fide action, and even a touching moment or two, combine to make this comic fantasy of beloved losers a real winner. Comedy talents of actors playing in Mystery Men - including one Mystery Woman - are for Wes Studi an excellent foil, which can only be described as Yoda, and Geoffrey Rush as one of the most unusual. the walls (and the weirdly cute) villains have ever walked the pages of the Dark Horse comics onto the big screen. Prepare for laughter, cheer and say "huh?" More than once .... enjoy!
