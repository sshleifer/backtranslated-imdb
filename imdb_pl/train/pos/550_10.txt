It's such a fantastic movie, a western with a selfish man (Jimmy Stewart) going to Klondike for gold. Along the way, he is harassed by a local sheriff in Alaska (John McIntire, which gives a wonderfully bad performance), which he does not want. McIntire threatens to be a dead man if he ever returns through his city, which unfortunately is the only way back to the States. The main part of the story is the peaceful city of Dawson with Klondike, turned upside down by the new residents of the city of McIntire. Ruth Roman, for example, who came with Stewart and his two companions (Jay C. Flippen and Walter Brennen, who plays Stewart's best friend), builds a salon (Hollywood front for a brothel) and tries to run a city restaurant and a place to spend free time outside the company . She is also paving the way for McIntire and his thugs. In 1953, Jimmy Stewart and director Anthony Mann created one of the peaks of the western genre of The Naked Spur. Far Country is simply the smallest piece and contains 99.9% of what made this movie so special, of course, feeling like a cheap copy. Like The Naked Spur, The Far Country prides itself on beautiful photos on the spot. The landscape is gorgeous. Stewart gives one of his best performances (almost equal to his greatest success in 1954, Rear Window). I suppose it can be considered a clich√© because it starts a selfish loner and learns how this kind of existence finally unfolds. Still, Stewart plays it so damn good that it makes this character very human. And the support shows are fantastically fantastic. In addition to the ones I mentioned, the charming French actress Corinne Calvet is very good. And I should also distinguish Walter Brennen. It seems that he specialized in playing best friends. His relationship with Stewart is very moving, because he is at first the only figure who can extract humanity from a cynical man. The script is very well written, and Mann's direction is impeccable. Masterpiece. 10/10
