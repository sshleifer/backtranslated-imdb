This film from 1947 was filmed and written by Orson Welles (with a characteristic Irish accent), and also the star of the beautiful Rita Hayworth with less attractive short blond hair. So I spent time with Orson before the Touch of Evil and Citizen Kane and the Third Man, etc., But this was my first interaction with Rita Hayworth. Our first meeting went well, it works great, playing terrified Elsa, married crippled lawyer-millionaire. Mike (Welles) and Elsa are falling into each other. He wants to run away with her, he does not know if he can live without things that can be bought with money. Elsa, her husband and his partner argue and bite, just like the sharks Mike describes when attacking each other, and his prophecy turns out to be too real. In this murder mystery there are several twists and turns when we reach the climax of a play house. (Think about the ending shooting in "Man with a golden pistol", which borrowed heavily from this scene). I was not sure who the murderer was until the end. <br /> <br /> This movie is like shrimp in garlic and lemon. The dish is focused on the sea, it is subtle, sour and spicy, and all this with great effect. They may not be the best, fresh shrimp, but good quality frozen shrimp from Costco. The aromatic sauce adds naturalness to the pink shrimp, filling a healthy but filling alternative to more mundane, common dishes. 7/10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
