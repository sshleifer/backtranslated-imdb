I watched the film joyously. <br /> <br /> This is probably one of the best films of all time. It has a timeless value, you can draw so much from it that it is amazing. There are parts that are moving, fun and just great. <br /> <br /> All aspects are in place, the portrait of history is perfect, every detail is 100% authentic, even the small Irish subtleties have been covered. <br /> <br /> The use of low and high shots gives you two great views of Cristy (look at this). <br /> <br /> Daniel Day-Lewis's performance is amazing. I've never seen an actor do it. It's really amazing. <br /> <br /> And it's great to watch, it flows so well, it's probably the closest thing you can achieve in real life. I love it. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen it, you should see it. There is no doubt about it, there is something for everyone.
