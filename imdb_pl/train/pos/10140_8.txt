Fans of the HBO series "Tales From the Crypt" will love this episode of MOH. Those who know the basic archetypal stories on which most of the classic EC comics were based, recognize it immediately. <br /> <br /> Underestimated favorite indie Martin Donovan (also an excellent writer - co-writer for the APARTMENT ZERO and DEATH BECOMES HER) is a kind of guy whose every good look can go both ways. He could play a really nice, incomprehensible guy from the neighborhood, or he could play the same role with the frightening note of the caustic monstrosity. In the case of RIGHT TO DIE, he accepts this second approach and it definitely works. <br /> <br /> Donovan is a doctor who recently had an affair with his freak in the office (Robin Sydney), much to the dissatisfaction of his disconsolate, merciless husband, Abbey (Julia Anderson). When both of them take part in a terrible car accident coming back from a failed weekend "catching up" and she is terribly burned in the fire, she reluctantly pulls the plug on her, not without some enthusiastic prodding from his even more mad lawyer and best buddy (Corbin Bernsen, looking for worse to wear these days.) <br /> <br /> But Abbey never gave up without a fight, and here comes the theme of the EC of this episode. Cuckolded husbands - and wives - have always been the favorite subject of the genre for some horrible (and OOKY) supernatural phenomena, and this matter is definitely no exception. If this were the case, an increased sex quotient and gore must make Bill Gaines go out of joy in his mausoleum somewhere. <br /> <br /> And not to mention that the original scenario of John Esposito gives the angle of adultery only slightly turn. You do not realize that you are watching that you only know half the story until the end ... (think WHAT USE, with more courage and gazong, and you are there.) <br /> <br /> It is not this is a bad effort, but not the best. At least Rob Schmidt shows here and there accents in this direction, especially in the scene that makes the mobile phone really scary! As with most MOH sections, this is a continuation of the dominant topic during this period of skinning and dismemberment, so extremely sensitive does not have to apply.
