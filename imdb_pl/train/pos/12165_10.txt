Frownland is one of those very embarrassing situations in which you laugh loudly at the wrong time; and just when you realize that you should not laugh, you have already reached the peak of voice resonance; and when you look around the ghastly white faces with open wide mouths and glazed eyes, you will feel a piercing pain beginning in the abdomen and suddenly rushing to the throat and ... well, you understand. <br /> <br /> But despite all its unpleasantness and bumps in the face, Frownland, really is an amazing work, which after seeing the inarticulate mess of the main character and all his pitiful troubles and mishaps makes you want to scratch your eyes and feel at the same time suffering for him. <br /> <br /> It would be much easier for me just to get out of the Ronald Bronstein movie, but for some madness. For this reason, I felt an unwavering determination to stay on course and experience all the grainy irritations the film has to offer. If somebody sucks you, you usually want to release him: Stop! Drop! And throw it! But thanks to this movie you want to see how the flame slowly absorbs your whole body. You endure the pain - perhaps in spite, or some unknown masochistic curiosity that I can not even explain. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the mainstream cinema will never let this movie reach the theater nearby. But if you have a chance to catch him, get ready: bring a dog bag.
