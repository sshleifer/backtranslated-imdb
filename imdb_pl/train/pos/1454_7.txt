I've been waiting for this movie for a long time since I saw the trailer that made it look like a political drama in which my three favorite actors performed; Al Pacino, John Cusack and Bridget Fonda. And although it was directed by Harold Becker, who performed uneven work, he and Pacino joined SEA OF LOVE, which is one of their best works. But the disturbances at a certain level (for starters, a few scenes in the original trailer does not appear in the film) and a change of tone (subsequent trailers make them look like a thriller) cause that while watching, you can not be anywhere nearby. <br /> <br /> Which is bad because I really wanted to like this movie. There was great potential here to be a film about how the government could be worth the trouble despite all the corruption, and to make a complex statement about this corruption, not about ordinary good guys and bad guys. And here is a good action. Pacino and Cusack are very good, and Danny Aiello gives one of the best performances in his career. But Fonda is wasted in her role, having nothing to do, and although the main story is meritorious, when he turns into a thriller, the film loses its importance, briefly returns in the last scene between Cusack and Pacino, and then finally falls completely Down. I would like to be able to like it more, but not.
