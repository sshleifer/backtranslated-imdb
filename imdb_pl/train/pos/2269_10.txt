I recently read the novel "mothers' night", for some time I am the owner of a DVD and watch it every now and then. Few movies that I have and seen, made me think and question as much as it does in Mother Night, I am amazed at the brilliance of not only Vonnegut, but also the translation of his text onto the screen. <br /> <br /> Do not rent or watch this movie on VHS, it must be done on a DVD, and it must be accompanied by the director's commentary on the film. To see how they adopted a fairly simple story, but composed in content and dialogue, and made it work so well, I think every viewer will be amazed. <br /> <br /> The omissions in the film are few with the text and do not diminish this, the film may well be a book and is the best adaptation I have ever seen. I highly recommend both a book and a movie together, that just saying "look at it" is bad. <br /> <br /> That will change you if you do.
