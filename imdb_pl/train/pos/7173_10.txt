I just watched the documentary "Fog City Mavericks" on the Starz cable TV network. This is undoubtedly one of my most pleasant experiences while watching! It is a chronicle of artists from the Bay of San Francisco and creative talent responsible for the best films ever made. In addition to well-known artists, t also includes segments with Irvin Kershner, Caleb Deschanel and the segment at Pixar Animation Studios. I hope it will be released on DVD - it is mandatory for every collection about the history of cinema and genius film production. If you're even interested in the movies and people who create them, you will not be disappointed.
