I do not look at soap. My grandmother is still watching this with an hourglass. I made a joke when I was ten (it was so simple). <br /> <br /> But this movie takes a parody and writes it in a new way. This story was damn funny to me. Fashion of the 80s - pads for arms, sequins and polyester - just fill them up. Huge hair, high heels and histrionics - what a combination. <br /> <br /> And all the actors just go to the city, chew their parts and spit them on a large, well-written stack. Sally, Kevin, Elisabeth - wonderful! Whoopi - great! Robert Downey - refreshing to see him back when he had such potential, in front of tabloids. And Garry: why did we have to wait so long to see him on film? Leesa Gibbons - did not miss her, but it was nice to include her as a real entertainment reporter (and where do you apply for this job anyway?). <br /> <br /> Admittedly, I could do without Sally climbing the gutter. Lucy Ricardo did it, how many times? Like any comedian with Carol Burnett, to whom I do not know who I am now, I could spit the nuts if I had them. Apparently what you do when you're funny in a high building in New York. I am grateful that they did not reach the mast with the flag. <br /> <br /> But it was cute, it was funny, it had twists and turns, it ended with the fact that it was common before, had clothes worthy of a second look, they had a great cast and they have personal memories for me. Really what do you need?
