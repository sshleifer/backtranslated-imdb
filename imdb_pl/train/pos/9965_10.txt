Perfect for families with young children who are looking for light movies that do not contain violence and are fascinating for the child and fun, though completely banal, for adults. This is not a bad movie for low-budget work. Children will be delighted with Santa's workshop and the "magic" that will allow him to enter homes through chimneys that seem too small, or houses that do not have chimneys at all! <br /> <br /> Children will be delighted with Santa's successes in frustrating the nasty devil named Pitch (complete in a classic red outfit with horns and a tail!). They will sympathize with a poor girl whose greatest wish is to have a small doll to love. And a poor, small, rich boy who wants to spend time with his eternally absent parents. And what kind of child does not know someone at school that is similar to the nasty boys who are dragged by Pitch to help catch Santa and destroy Christmas? After all, everyone, including the nasty boys, get what they deserve for Christmas! <br /> <br /> The film will satisfy the children of Santa Claus as well as the message of love that provides people all over the world. <Br /> <br />
