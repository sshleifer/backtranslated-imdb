I did not expect this movie to present a family so similar to the one you are hoping to live next to. They are ordinary people of flesh and blood, not like a typical Hollywood fare. They are facing an overly common problem - a devastating disease. But the plot covers the heart with a powerful lesson. Casting, script, direction and movement of actors along with a wave that draws the viewer deep into the story. Give this film your full attention and its message will inspire you.
