The assumption is simple. These films start to look like an average skinny chick about two attractive young people meeting at the airport, and then everything revolves around 180 degrees ... <br /> <br /> I, for example, really do not like the paralyzing mind of nonsense story that it pollutes the average cinema. And this is my humble opinion that Wes Craven, based on his previous meta-horrorach (Sceam), does it too ... <br /> <br /> Following this logic, it is not surprising that Craven sardonically takes his time he built a sickly sweet love story, only to have THE MAGNIFICENT wreck of Cillian Murphy, this whole world of dreams covered with sugar ... <br /> <br /> The scope of his character Jackson Ripner (Jack the Ripper, take it is lame, right?) in this movie is impressive, going from being completely charming to the twisted nihilistic meek, which is a plus in my book. As he cheats on his victim (apparently Jennifer Garner, Rachel McAdams, which I consider annoying by the way), you can not help but sympathize with the guy ... <br /> <br /> This is Wes Craven, embodied in Jackson Ripner , by Cillian Murphy, fighting with all the mindless movements of the chicks ... <br /> <br /> Mr Craven, I greet you. <br /> <br /> Best quote: <br /> <br /> Jackson Ripner (after defeating the brat with Rachel McAdams on the toilet): "Thanks for the quickie !!! "
