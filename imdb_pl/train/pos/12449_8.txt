Finally, there was a good film by Modesty Blaise, who not only tells the story, but in fact tells a "real" story. I admit that this is a bad movie if you expect an action thriller, but if you stop on your track and remove all your expectations. Then you will notice that this is a story very similar to the original by Peter O'Donnell. You have a cover story to tell how Modesty has become a great person. This is not a movie that attracts new fans, but a movie that tells a real story. Some things could have been better, but when you can not forget about the awful movie of 66, it's a great movie. So you're a fan, then sit back and relax, enjoying the real story there with the story, telling Modesty to tell her story.
