The literary genius of Vladimir Navokov appears again on the screen, and many in the cultural world will pay attention to it. The director puts us in check with the story of Aleksander, distracted, studying addiction to chess. Nastasya is on vacation in a center with marble columns, where chess championships are organized. He meets Alexandra, picking up a piece of the queen he drops in his coat pocket. Magnetic attraction appears, which she proposes the next day, mother alerted telegram to her husband. He comes and asks Alexander that we are going to the past, ala 'Godfather II, where we see young Alexander, a wonderful child. He is taken under the wings of a school teacher and uses his genius for 10 years, earning huge sums. Aleksander's thinking reached its peak, he abandoned it, but it becomes a legend. The old teacher returns, causing injury, trying to win Alexander's old rival. In a serious chess game in which world chess victory is one of the ways to immortality, the chess clock ticks, the match ends the next day. That day Nastasya's wedding is taking place, the old teacher bothers, and Aleksander is sent to a nervous breakdown. Nastasya, holding her belly and looking through her coat of love, finds her strategy for the match and follows the movements. Although the movie unfortunately sways with Russian roots, his low-cut dresses are beautiful, Alexander plays his lofty role. King of opponents with 3 paws and the king, dedicating the castle to a partner. Nastasya is a great match, but I feel that her application deserves more intensity, but maybe emotions were right, because chess meant more to her than she. Defense Luzhin elegantly gives Honor Navokov, the complexity of his work in the pictures is a global event that can not be missed.
