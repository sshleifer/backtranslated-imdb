Gunga Din (1939) is based on the poem by Rudyard Kipling. The film was directed by George Stevens. His action takes place in India in the nineteenth century, when three British soldiers must stop the evil guru and his murderous worship. Gunga Din is a wonderful war comedy adventure with lots of exciting moments. The three leading men are brilliant. Cary Grant is Sergeant Archeibald Cutter, Victor McLaglen is a sergeant of Mac MacChesney and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. (legendary son you know) Sgt.Thomas Ballantine. Let's not forget about other great players, including Sam Jaffe playing Gung Din in a brilliant way. Beautiful and talented Joan Fontaine is Emaline Stebbins. It's awfully funny to watch the difficulties with Tommy and Emma's wedding plans. Gunga Din is terribly fun. It can be fun, it can be exciting. It can be anything that a good movie requires.
