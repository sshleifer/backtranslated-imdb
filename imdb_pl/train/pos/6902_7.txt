This is a modest comedy about the character of the hero, shot in Brazil at a low budget. The premise is known, just like in Danny Kaye's 1950s movie. ** Outdoors **: someone who, as a joke, makes an impression of a celebrity and then impersonates a person. <br /> The contrast between the two leads is very effective. Raul Julia as a German-paradian secret policeman is tall, cold, menacing and Latin. He practices deliberately obvious work in a blonde dye. Richard Dreyfus, an animated, short, New York Jew, is playful and sympathetic. There are many references and jokes about show business. <br /> <br /> The setting is clearly modeled on Paraguay. Paraguay was actually ruled from the early fifties to the late eighties by Gen. Alfred Stroessner, an unmatched military dictator whose father emigrated from Germany. But the writer / director Mazurszky reveals his ignorance of local conditions when he paints Parador / Paraguay as a typical Latin America's tyranny, with huge differences in wealth and an active partisan insurrection. In this spirit, Mazursky throws Jonathan Winters' comic book as an American pensioner who is in fact C.I.A. head of the station in Parador and a figure so powerful that he can give the president of the country vulgarity. <br /> <br /> In fact, the United States has little influence on Paraguay, which is largely devoid of social and racial tensions observed in other parts of the region. This is due to the fact that the country waged long and costly wars against much larger neighbors in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The men's population was almost completely destroyed, but the resulting society was patriotic, racial and strongly unified. <br /> <br /> On the other level, feminism is bowing in the form of a Madonna character. Madonna, played by Brazilian actress Sonia Braga, is a former dancer of the night club, which at the beginning of the film is a girlfriend with presidential pleasure, but at the end she is seen on television as the president herself - now politically and cosmetically correct, without make-up, modestly withdrawn , changed into a velvet revolution. <br /> <br /> Once an event in Latin America occurred, the administration of Argentine Isabel Peron (not the beloved Evita who never held office) lasted two years after the death of her husband, the legendary ** supremo ** Juan Peron.
