This movie is one of those nostalgic things with me and I never REALLY expect anyone else to "get it", but I'm happy when I recommend it and someone likes it. My late father HATED Arthur Askey, but this movie was really liked, and his consistent enthusiasm for "The Ghost Train" and "Old Ted 'Olmes" moved to me as a child. Years later, I watch it every now and again, enjoying my knowledge. I always wonder if it will not be the same, but I'm never disappointed in it. There is a lot of joy. The sequence on the train is really inspired when Askey and Murdoch start to upset the arrogant male passenger. Then the whole section on the station is amazing, so many things happen that you have to keep up. Yes, it is obsolete and full of British accents and storyline from the war (based on the original play by Arnold Ridley from the famous Dad's Army!), But full of great character performances - including Kathleen Harrison as a shitty lady. The atmosphere is really as dangerous as Arthur Askey's vehicle. It's cheap because the chips in the UK are on DVD, so treat yourself. It is an ideal Saturday / Sunday morning or a light afternoon of entertainment. Dziękuję .... <br /> <br /> OLD FILMS CAN BE GOOD VIDEOS!
