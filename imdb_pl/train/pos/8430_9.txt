It's always nice to see Angela Bassett play a role that she can really sink her teeth into. She is sometimes intense, funny, and even sexy in her role of Lena, a "colorful" woman forced to make a home in the desert mud on the outskirts of Cape Town in South Africa. Danny Glover is also good at not quite a nice role as her partner Boesman. Willie Jonah gives subtle nuances as a stranger who discovers a new salon by Boesman and Lena. It's not uncommon for you to see a smart movie about mature topics. Although based on art, the late director John Berry (who also directed Claudine) opens the material by making a film in the Cinemascope panoramic format. He also makes sure that things are interesting visually due to the creative blocking of actors and showing us things mentioned only in art. Like Diahann Carroll in Claudine, John Berry could have directed Angela Bassett to an Oscar nomination. This is definitely a movie that is worth looking for.
