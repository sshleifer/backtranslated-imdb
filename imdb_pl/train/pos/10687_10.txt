I must admit that this movie completely shocked me. First of all, I went to see it with a whim, expecting something mediocre, but considering this, the most shocking thing was that it was at all in populist American cinema. It's a British comedy at its best - dark, bizarre and funny in a way that American movies simply are not. However, I must stop recommending it to everyone with all my heart; I went to see him with a few people, some in English, a little bit of European and some American, and some of us loved it (mainly from the first two groups). If you think you're like that, then go. If not, do not do it. 10/10
