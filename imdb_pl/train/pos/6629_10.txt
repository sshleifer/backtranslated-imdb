The best treasure island ever made. They just do not make movies anymore <br /> <br /> like never before. Nobody makes such films. More <br /> <br /> than new, this movie is funny, honest and fascinating, but moody, <br /> <br /> mysterious and gloomy. This is one of my favorite photos. The director <br /> <br /> had to have some idea of ​​what this is all about, but <br /> <br /> certainly leaves room for his own impressions and interpretations, leaving little imagination. Why <br /> <br /> did not make such films anymore, I have no idea. <br /> <br /> remembering about the best noiras, is one of a kind. But <br /> <br /> is not for lazy or simple people.
