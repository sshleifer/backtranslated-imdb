One of the things about Hollywood is that someone has succeeded and always have to copy it. Another thing is that players give their best performances outside the home studio. <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson has won such recognition for his performance in the Texas Giant movie about which the heads of Universal had to think, quickly go in another modern Texas neighborhood. <br /> <br /> Similarly, Robert Stack has great reviews for The High and the Mighty as a pilot who burst under the pressure of flying a damaged plane, it's only natural that he gave him another crack up. <br /> <br /> Both of these goals have been achieved in Written on the Wind. Before Hudson was a great owner of the ranch, now he is the son of hunting companion Robert Stack, who took Hudson under his wing. In other words, part of James Dean without the racism of James Dean from Giant. <br /> <br /> Lauren Bacall is the executive secretary of an advertising agency used by Stack's Hadley Oil Company. Hudson likes her, but she is stunned by millions of stacks, and when she has a girlfriend, she has the resources to really carry out the campaign. She marries Stack. <br /> <br /> And last but not least, in the mix, we have Dorothy Malone, who is Stack's amorous sister, who has a yen for Rock, but Rock is not about to get entangled in a wild child. <br /> <br /> Dorothy Malone spent over 10 years in a whole array of colorless movie heroes before she landed in this jewel. For the role of Marilee Hadley, she received the award for Best Supporting Actress and deserved it. <br /> <br /> If you like a funky soap opera from the 1950s, this is a movie for you.
