I just found IMDb and searched this video, and I almost moved to tears through the comments of all the people who saw the movie like me when I was 6 or more in 1967. I saw it before the Jungle Book, so for a few hours I was Eagle Boy, and then Mowgli for the next year. I fell into tears in the cinema when the boy turned into an Eagle and always wanted to see the movie again. When we got home, we had a dinner with fried chicken and I got bone wishes and guess who I would like to be? My dad said, "I bet you wanted to be an Eagle," and of course we all know that wishes are broken if someone guesses more tears and a bit of resentment until today that he can not fly ...
