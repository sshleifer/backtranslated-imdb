When I saw this movie a few days ago, my eyes were completely attached to the screen. Its size focused my attention on such a degree that I focused all my attention on him throughout the entire duration. I recommend to see it not only to anime fans, but to anyone who likes a great period of movies (or who likes really weird things). The style of art is beautiful, the sound is perfect, and the symbolism in it is breathtaking. I have heard complaints about the strange insertion of English text into a movie, but I think that the way it was made is a complement to the strange style of the movie. The self-assigned description of "Hello Kitty on acid" does not reflect this movie with absolutely epic proportions. I would like to find more work for who did it and see it.
