I rented this movie for the first time many years ago and I was completely fascinated by it. Recently, feeling the strange need to re-watch a few too few movies that I liked a lot in my life, I decided to give "Erendir" another look. And I'm glad I did it because I soon discovered that even the passage of time did not suppress the glow of the film in the slightest. <br /> <br /> The story is about a teenage girl (Erendira, played extremely Claudia O'hana - in some respects reminds Winona Ryder!), who accidentally burns his grandmother's estate, after which grandma, even hypnotically played by Irene Papas, forces a girl to live in prostitution on the way to pay compensation. <br /> <br /> Watching is fascinating and fascinating at the same time - although, despite the basic assumption of prostitution, it is tastelessly devoid of free, steamy sexual content. The story focuses more on the interactions between the girl and her grandmother, and the various other colorful characters with whom they make contact during their stay - which, incidentally, is in the harsh rural part of Mexico. > <br /> The film is very romantic, extremely enigmatic, with a decided, dream quality. Sometimes it borders with the bizarre, but not, for example, with David Lynch's movie. It is also worth mentioning that the film has a very allegorical character, read the comments of previous viewers below ... <br /> <br /> Often in the background you can hear the sounds of a lonely accordion, quiet and melancholy, adding only appropriate musical accents to emphasize the Mexican environment. The cinematography of rural places, many of which are in the desert, is quite outstanding. <br /> <br /> The movie moves at a pleasant pace, neither too fast nor too slow, and after each scene I felt that I have to rewind the tape and play it again just because you want to do it. In any case, it is really convincing for me. <br /> <br /> I hope you see a movie in Spanish with subtitles. I studied Spanish both in high school and college, and I was happy to understand a lot of this dialogue. Por ejemplo: "El mundo no es tan grande como pensaba". ("The world is not as big as I thought" - i.e. Is a small world.) This movie reminds me how to stumble over a dusty old bottle of vintage wine, which after drinking is, however, extremely satisfying, you are left with some sadness after realizing that there are no more bottles like this one.
