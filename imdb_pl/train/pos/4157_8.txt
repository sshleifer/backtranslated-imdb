This early anime movie was a pretty good movie that I once caught in the Science Fiction channel when Anime was popular in America, not the crash rating that adults think about swimming in a cartoon network. Honestly, I think it has less to do with the fact that it is less popular, and the more that people would now prefer to buy DVDs, watch episodes that are not cut out on the Internet. This film probably did not have so many songs, and the work on the voice was fine for the dubbed movie, although I would prefer to watch the original Japanese version. Americans tend to use rather annoying voices for children in whatever they call. This video shows a young boy who gets on a train called the Galaxy Express in the hope that he will get to the planet that has the technology to turn it into a robot. I want to be a robot to avenge my mother who was brutally murdered at the hands of a robot that hunts people for fun. During her adventures, she befriends various train workers, as well as a woman who resembles his dead mother, a beautiful woman named Matel who, like most women in anime movies, has a secret that can be really good for our young hero, or very bad. He also travels from planet to planet, when the train stops in various places and finds a cosmic pirate named Captain Harlock, who apparently played in his own animated cartoon series, so essentially Galaxy Express takes place in this universe. All in all a very good ride with a rather strange and unexpected ending. It would be a continuation of this, but it was not as good as this, but the ending was a bit more final than here.
