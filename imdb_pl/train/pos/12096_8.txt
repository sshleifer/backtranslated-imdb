I watched the movie several times and found it very good. This film is also known as "Castle of Terror", "Coffin Of Terror" and "Dance Macabre". Barbara Steele, she is usually a beautiful / frightening person. George Riviere, the male leader, performs his role well. The whole film is dripping with atmosphere, and the tension is very high. Camera angles are good and the action is not bad at all. This movie is suitable for a rainy day or evening. I have a uncut DVD version, which is much better than the edited TV version. Grab the popcorn, turn off the lights, sit back and enjoy. John R. Tracy
