The arrival of White Men in Arctic Canada challenges the freedom of the fearless hunter ESKIMO. <br /> <br /> W. S. Van Dyke, MGM Periphery Director, was responsible for this fascinating view of life in the Arctic among the Eskimos. His production was shot on a film set from April 1932. Until November 1933 (Although some annoying effects of the rear projection show that some of the photos took place in the Studio). Recognized as a document at that time, we would probably call it "docudrama" because it is written with an intriguing story and plot. <br /> <br /> The film shows the daily lives of Eskimos, both winter and summer, and really begins in the warmer season without visible snow or ice. It presents a continuous quest for food, and the viewer can watch exciting hunting for walrus, polar bears, whales and caribou. The mother tongue is used at all times, using the title cards; only English is used by fishermen and highlanders encountered by Eskimos. In fact, it is the appearance of the White People, both good and bad, and the change they bring in the Eskimo society, which is the main element of the narrative. <br /> <br /> This film before the code deals with a refreshingly honest way with Eskimo's moral code, especially with their practice of sharing wives, which was an important and completely innocent part of their culture. In fact, the whole movie can be appreciated as a valuable look at the way of life that quickly disappeared even in the early 1930s. <br /> <br /> No cast gets a screen loan, which is a shame because there are some notable performances. The most important of them is Ray Wise, playing the main role of Mala the Eskimo. Wise (1906-1952) was a native Alaska of Inuit origin and is absolutely wonderful and perfectly credible in a very demanding part. As handsome as any Hollywood star, he would continue the game, using the name Ray Mala, in an occasional film career, often in small, unfilled roles. <br /> <br /> The charming Japanese-Hawaiian actress Lotus Long plays the loyal second Little wife; the names of great actresses playing his two other wives are now unclear. Director Woody Van Dyke stands in front of the cameras as a North West police inspector. Two decent Mounties who must deliver Mala to Canadian justice, plays Joe Sawyer and Edgar Dearing, both longtime actors. The Danish writer Peter Freuchen, whose books the film was based on, has a short, living role as a bad wooden captain who unreasonably arouses the cold anger of Mali.
