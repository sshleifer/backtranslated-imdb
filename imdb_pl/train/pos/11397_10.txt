A timeless musical gem, with Gene Kelly in top form, stylish Vincente Minnelli direction and great music numbers. It's great entertainment from start to finish, one of those movies that people watch with a smile and say, "they do not do it like they used to be!" But they never made it that way. The culminating 25-minute music sequence without dialogue is one of the most beautiful in the history of the film. The magic of the film, clearly derived from the heart and soul of all involved. You must see!
