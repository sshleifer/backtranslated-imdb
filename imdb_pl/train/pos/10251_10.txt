I'm surprised that many viewers are more respectful of the sequel to this genius movie ... I've seen all the guinea pigs and this one is certainly the best. <br /> <br /> Although I've seen "creation", I still have doubts, watching these 35 minutes of pure torture: it's so powerful. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10, because this movie has achieved perfectly what he intended to do: be the best false snuff film made.
