Everything I hear about is a weak animation. This may not meet the expectations of everyone, but look at it this way. Would you expect perfection in hell? In my opinion, the animation was deliberately dried and rough. It was great to see her character transformation in this movie, considering that she will probably be as close to live action as possible. I hope to continue very soon. If we want live action, I think we can be better with Chastity or Purgatori. I do not think that Lady Death has moved well into the movie. Anyway, it's my personal conviction that everyone who is naive about this movie is wrong. The word game is not intended.
