Reading another user's review, saying it was a terrible game, I could not stand idle and do nothing! <br /> <br /> Well, this game is great, with information clips (with two real people, full of sense of humor and credibility!), I find this to be a very good story! I only complain that the enemies begin to blink when they die until they disappear; and some frustrating situations during the LEILA VR mission, when I ride a bike, here and there ... <br /> <br /> Besides, it's a great game with great story, good graphics, great characters, great soundtrack ... . I recommend it! Certainly! It can be a bit old but still pleasant! At least on Dreamcast ... but the PS2 version will be the same.
