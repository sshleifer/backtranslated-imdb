Another one is that it does not make em like this category. This family story with a few real skeletons in her wardrobe still qualifies as good cleanliness, sometimes great fun. Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone are at the top of Hadley's distraught siblings and they really took roles and ran with them. Malone won the Oscar, and Stack was nominated in auxiliary categories, both honors were well deserved. They are a counterweight to slightly bland tips. Neither Bacall nor Hudson could ever be called bad actors, but they both had better parts and played them more convincingly than here. It's hard for me to accept Rock Hudson playing a red-blooded heterosexual like him here, but it's more personal than anything else. But it does not deviate from the overall entertainment value of the film, which is significant and this film is extremely visible. If you fancy an evening, and this movie appears, I'd say you watch it. It is worth it.
