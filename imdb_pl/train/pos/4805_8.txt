When I heard about this movie for the first time, I thought it would be like The Duchess (2008), but when I saw the first 30 minutes of The Young Victoria, I knew it would not just be a solid movie. Almost everything in this movie is great, the costumes are really amazing, and the settings are also beautifully made. <br /> <br /> The only thing that really failed me is the performances. Emily Blunt (The Devil Wears Prada) is the star of the movie, enlivening Victoria and this movie shows that she is a great actress and she may have chosen the first Oscar nomination for the role. Rupert Friend is almost bland like Prince Albert, but he has great chemistry with Emily Blunt. Paul Bettany is also as solid as Lord Melbourne, although I expected him more. Jim Broadbent and Miranda Richardson have secondary roles, but you can not forget them. <br /> <br /> For me, the movie seems unfinished. Maybe the writers have changed too many things in the script, I do not know, but that's what I think about the film. <br /> <br /> But overall, it's a great movie about the early years of Victoria with a great performance from Emily Blunt.
