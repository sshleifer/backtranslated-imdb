I saw this movie for the first time when I was about 6 or 7 years old and I did not think it was something particularly special. As time passed, I watched it a few more times and began to grow on me when I began to understand the morality of the film to which I will come later. For a moment I left this movie alone and did not watch it for a moment. Looking for an old classic movie to watch a few weeks ago (currently 15), I dug VHS from home. After seeing this, I was on a natural level that I could not explain. The film gives you an overwhelming sense of joy that you never expect. Films about three completely different animals working together to find a way home really send a message home that no matter how different you are, you can always find a common ground, something you all need. The way of choosing the characters' heroes is really fantastic. Having an old, wise golden retriever, caring or leading a "casual" young American bulldog who loves fun, though somewhat clumsy, with a sassy clever, vulnerable but self-confident cat. The film follows these three friends or companions during the journey, which is so realistically impossible that it creates magic because you start to believe that this journey can happen. <br /> <br /> I do not want to sound like a tissue gripper when it comes to movies, I assure you that I am the other way around, but the most uplifting part of this movie is undoubtedly the back of the shadow when the shadow desperately tries to escape, and chance and sassy, ​​painfully make him go. When both animals return to their beloved owners, silence falls, until the shadow rolls over the horizon to everyone's horror. There is a thin boundary between sympathetic and banal nonsense, but this film is pure magic even at the age of 15. This movie may not be the Lord of the Rings, but Disney will produce such a fantastic movie, using animals and will be rebuilt as it deserves at 10/10.
