Nick Nolte gives a great performance in the dark story of Kurt Vonnegut. Notel plays Howard W. Campbell, who was a double agent working in propaganda during World War II. After the war, he lives anonymously until the competitive factions want to dig his past. As with many of Vonnegut's works, it is a meditation on the absurdity of war and those who use propaganda for their own purposes. Nolte is fantastic - confident and confident as a younger Campbell, and then broken and haunted as an older man who is forced to repent of the sins of his past. (7 of 10)
