Although I generally do not like making alterations, I believe rework is a waste of time; this movie is an exception. Actually, I did not know until now to read the previous comment that it was a remake, so my opinion concerns only the actual film, not a comparison. <br /> <br /> The story and the way it was written is no doubt: this is Capote. You do not need more words. <br /> <br /> The game of Anthony Edwards and Eric Roberts is outstanding. I saw several films with them, each in one or the other. I was sure they were good actors, and in Eric's case I always wondered why his sister is the number one celebrity, not her brother. This time this certainty has been raised to the fact, no doubt. His game, just like Mr. Edwards's game, is without a doubt the height of their entire profession. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie on the top 50 films to see and save on DVD shelves.
