I remember this movie when I was 12 years old, it was amazing ... I remember it until the day when I did not watch most of the things that I watched, I even tried to buy them, but it's like a rocking horse sh * t! In any case, the game is a bit difficult, but the story is amazing, considering that it was a real B movie with a low budget and an event in which the battle scenes were amazing to watch, I had to watch them about 20 times. It was a very well made movie and I loved the idea of ​​fighting giant human-controlled robots, it's a pity they had to mess it up by making a crappy "Crash and Burn" spin, do not watch this movie the way it is! If you're a real fan of Sci-Fi movies, watch this if it was re-made today, it would be a winner. I would really like to see a remake and even release a DVD.
