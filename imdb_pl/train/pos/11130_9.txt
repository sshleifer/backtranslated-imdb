Jon Voight is brilliant at Midnight Cowboy, but Hoffman's performance, though reminiscent of his later turn in Rainman, is a kind of performance that makes me watch movies. As a portrait of a New York character, only the portrait of Bill Butcher in the New York Gangs by Daniel Lewis reminds the mind, and Day does not give his character the emotional depth that Hoffman gives Ratso. <br /> <br /> This is typical for Hoffman's behavior that Voight is the actor we most often identify with Midnight Cowboy. I think that Hoffman is one of the 4 or 5 best actors in film history, playing people around him in such a way that he raises their performances far above the normal level. <br /> <br /> Voight's Buck is na√Øve enough to completely disappear from the movie, except that Ratso pulls him down - he pulls him down, but also teaches him a lot about how to survive, and more importantly , how to live. <br /> <br /> Midnight Cowboy is a film about the escape, which turns into a movie about finding yourself. I think that such a fragile movie, as it is, has a very beautiful message that no matter how losing you are (Ratso clearly defines the "loser"), if you can find a way to be true to yourself, you are in possession of the mystery of life and you can even be able to share this insight with someone else. <br /> <br /> I can not help but compare the Midnight Cowboy to Klute from a few years later, which I think is more like a movie about finding yourself, which turns into a movie about escape.
