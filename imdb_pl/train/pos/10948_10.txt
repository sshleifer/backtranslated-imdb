Following the plot of the sitcom is so easy that the simultaneous operation of its characters both inside and without the context in which the rest of the cast lives, is a kind of experiment that they can really use sitcoms. The supporting heroes presented the series in reality a sitcom, which is a contextual counterpoint to Sarah's inconsistent character, which, in addition to general insensitivity, has no specific repetitive features on which behavioral expectations could be based, making it a smaller figure than the canvas to repaint each episode, if not stage. Sarah's ability to see everything from an outside perspective allows her to parody aspects of social behavior that are so subtle that they usually go unnoticed. Each time he speaks, it is an independent 5-second sketch. A lot of overestimation, demonstrating innumerable things that can mean a smile or a change in the pitch of a voice, but never stick to one idea long enough for you to feel comfortable and formulate expectations that will be satisfied. It can be the most creative, original and experimental television program in history.
