There are many films related to World War II, but Mother Night is quite prominent among them: in this film, we meet Howard Campbell (Nolte), an American living in Berlin and a married German, Helga Noth (Lee), who decides to accept the role of a spy: more specifically CIA agent Major Wirtanen (Goodman) recruits Campbell, who becomes a Nazi propagandist to enter the highest levels of Hitler's regime. But the thing is that the US government will never recognize Campbell's role in the war for reasons of national security, so Campbell becomes a hated figure in the United States. After the war, he tries to hide his identity, but the past returns and persecutes him. His only "friend" is Wirtanen, but even he can not do much for an avalanche of events that have fallen on poor Campbell ... <br /> <br /> This story is deeply moving when we see the tragedy of Campbell who, although a great patriot , treated by contempt by anyone who surrounds him. Not only this, but gradually realizes that even people who are closest to him have many of their own secrets. Vonnegut provides us with a moving atmosphere, with Campbell's despair building and almost choking the viewer. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Nolte plays the role of his life; it is even better than in "Affliction", although in both roles plays tragic characters whose destiny is self-destruction. Sheryl Lee is also excellent and the same can be said for the entire cast. <br /> <br /> I have not read the book, so I can not judge how the movie compares with it. In any case, it does not matter: my criticism concerns the film itself, and the film deserves 9/10.
