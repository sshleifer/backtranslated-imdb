Why a stupid, boring, boring, overrated series of movies like "Star Wars" takes on all the noise, and a really amazing movie like this is completely unnoticed ... it's beyond me ... This movie will really open your eyes to dark, disturbing, sad and scary world in which we live ... <br /> <br /> In contrast to the boring "elephant", this movie is not one of those "ordinary days, until someone pulls the trigger" . ... this movie focuses more on what's happening AFTER the event ... <br /> <br /> Dean, played by a very hot and very talented Erika Christensen, is a happy and healthy straight student with great friends and a wonderful life ... up ... will be hurt on the day of shooting, shot in the head ... Fortunately, she was not killed, but she is badly injured and must be in the hospital for some time, causing her to ache emotionally, in addition to the physical ... <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Alicia, also played by the very beautiful and talented Busy Phillips, is a nasty, cold, rebellious, anti-social gothic girl who has no positive qualities ... and there is nothing wrong when it happens to be shooting .. because it turns out that she was a FRIEND with a gunner and she knew that he would do what he did ... which means that she is taken to the police station and asked a few questions. When she refuses to tell the cops that she knows that shooting will happen, they still come to her house to convince her to say something ... and she still does not do it, so the headmaster tells her to attend the funeral of one of the deceased students, and after he decides to do so ... the director decides he's enough, and forces her to go to visit Dean in the hospital ... Of course, she does not want to, but the director says that if Alice does not do it, the cops will still try to get her to say something ... and she really goes to see her ... <br /> <br /> Lonely, wounded and physically and emotionally hurt Dean is more than happy to be visited, but of course Alicia is something that is happy for her ... Diana tries to give her a friendly welcome, but of course Alicia only responds with sharp and painful comments and a harsh statement of how she is only here because she is tired sewn up and she is not going to be friendly with her. But sooner or later this intention will change ... (and that's all I'll say :) This is really one of the most moving films in history, and also one of the darkest and most disturbing .. Actually, I think it would involve "American History X" as equally disturbing and moving at the same time ... <br /> <br /> ATTENTION: Watch this video at your own risk !! Contains VERY graphic scenes and images! A PERFECT and unappreciated movie! I feel so embarrassed that I am the only one who knows about it!
