At the time I am writing this, I see over 15,000 votes, which have a grade of 5.8. Something is wrong with this image. Personally, I give him 10. I see 7 on the lowest or possible 8, if it was rated by people who see this movie, what it really is. It's a movie based on the hero of the comic. This film won more than just part of the awards. He won three Oscars. Another 5 wins and 26 nominations ... tells me that he is better than 5.8. Great acting from a few very good actors, some great special effects and in my opinion will be, if not already, a classic for many years. If you're looking for pure entertainment, check out Dick Tracy. Definitely a movie that you can watch more than a few times. Al Pacino is great as Big Boy Caprice.
