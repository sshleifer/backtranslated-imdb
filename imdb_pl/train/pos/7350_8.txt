Well, I was a teenager when I saw this movie. The songs were a big hit, but the elite class skipped govinda films, and coz watched the govinda and karishma movies (aka karizma), but they were not in this class, but many people liked it because the series of these films won the 90's, and most of them were successful ... today I watched this after a long time and I remembered that there was a long queue of people and riots that they created when the song appeared on the screen aa e uo o o .... the dresses govinda and karishma were mutually mutual complementary (the worst duo of those times), and the Karisma in the late 90s changed, but govinda was still very loyal to his designer, because his sense of dress remains the same ... but then everything merged, everything was fine. everything was working and the slowly elite class realized what kind of fun is missing, and then ... there was no turning back for Jodi, how did it happen, n when these Indians continued They were a series of few, but loved by the masses. <br /> <br /> if you are looking for a good moment, there is nothing to rent or watch on TV, I do not think you will regret it ... but remember is the worst at its best ... <br /> <br /> I still watch these movies when I have time because I can not stop laughing ... so I say go and have fun because there are times when everyone loves stupidity, and especially when the kings of their time do it, it is certainly possible to watch ... I recommend to all movie lovers ...
