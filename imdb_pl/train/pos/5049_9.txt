I had to see this gem twice to really appreciate it. When the widowed father of the two interrupts the sleep of both sons with a shocking revelation, they are torn between believing and not. When the horrific events of this story develop, we learn a lot about the father, about his two sons and their fate. With a shocking twist of action after shocking phrases, this movie never lets you break into the storyline. Bill Paxton plays father, but the most notable are the performances of his older son, Fenton, played by Matthew O'Leary and his younger son Adam, played by Jeremy Sumpter. This is one of the best thrillers I've seen for some time, and you'll want to watch it a few times to appreciate every intricate aspect of the story. I give this movie 9/10.
