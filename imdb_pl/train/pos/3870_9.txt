It is an extremely dense, grim and complicated movie that develops quite slowly, revealing tormenting details, such as the attention devoted to the novel, and watching the movie "IS" like watching a developing novel. While I did not care for the narrator, because I felt he was out of balance with the rest of the shows, this movie contains some of the best acting bands I've ever seen, and the lead, Summer Phoenix, is fantastic. Her innocence and naivety may turn out to be unbelievable, a kind of cross between Cinderella and Alice in Wonderland. I can buy this criticism, but she is still fantastic, partly because it is not like anything I've ever seen before. <br /> <br /> This movie is unbelievably beautiful, filmed by Eric Gautier, and part of what's so special about this movie shows how it never shows what to expect. It's always surprising and despite its length, the film never reveals more than it should. After 163 minutes it is extremely concise, with some disadvantage, as I would say, which is one of the wonders of this film. It is full of short moments that are simply stunning, some of the best that can be seen throughout the year, and all these moments make up the extraordinary movie experience. Family moments are special, Ian Holm is brilliant, and what this movie has to say about the theater was not seen in Cassavetes's "Opening" films, or Chaplin's "Limelight". But believe it or not, this movie is much less conventional. I never knew where this movie was going, and now, seeing it, there are still many possibilities. It's a powerful, incredibly provocative movie.
