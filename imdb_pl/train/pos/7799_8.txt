Very slow but intricately constructed and ultimately very moving. Nice, very realistic look of a small Florida town on the beach in the middle of winter - I was there, and this is absolutely accurate. <br /> <br /> It's also the debut feature of actress Ashley Judd, and makes a big impression here. It's hard to believe that this movie is 12 years old - I remember seeing it in cinemas, and recently I've rented "Ruby" again. In addition to the clothes from the 80s, he was very comfortable. Ashely is so radiant and touching here that it's hard to think about her future career without shouting. Boy, talk about not fulfilling your early promise! Anyone who sees Ashley here in "Ruby In Paradise", would assume that this elegant, natural beauty has become a part of many interesting artistic films and serious acting - instead she became a girl "go to" silly action movies and cinema movies! Very disappointing, but at least we have this wonderful performance preserved to present her early promise. <br /> <br /> As other commentators say, this is not for everyone, because it is very slow. This is not an action movie, nor is it an affair. The director (Victor Nunez, "Ulees Gold", another excellent character study) treats the life of this ordinary young woman with deep respect, letting her story build slowly and with a lot of detail. In this way, I think that this is one of the most moving and respectful stories about the maturing of young women, which I can recall - it is not about Ruby's sexual awakening or "how she lost her virginity", but about her life choices and her growing maturity. <br /> <br /> Lovely movie, if you take some time to watch ... I think it would be a really great movie to show teenagers and young girls (or boys) and give them a chance to think and discuss it. <br /> <br /> Special recordings for director Nunez, who wrote a script that is so realistic and nicely detailed that I made up the whole movie for being based in a novel or a diary written by a woman, but it's really an original work Mr. Nunez. Rated 8 out of 10.
