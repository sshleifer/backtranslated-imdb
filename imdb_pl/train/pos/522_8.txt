A great film by Powell and Pressburger, whose work I want to explore now. The film tells what we perceive as real and what is real, and how difficult it is to distinguish them from each other. Beautifully filmed and played, although David Niven does not seem to be 27 years old, as his character claims. It's nice to see very young Richard Attenborough. This movie made me think when I watched him and then.
