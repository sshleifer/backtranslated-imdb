Like others in this forum, when "Fobidden Planet" was offered in 1956, I rushed to see it. This story is an interesting phenomenon that I suggest because young, old, male, female, science-fiction specialists and people who found such a way out of the way can all follow and enjoy the story of this film and its story very well. set on a planet other than Earth in the 20th century, other than series such as "Flash Gordon". Leslie Nielsen was a bit weak for his role, but Walter Pigeon, Marvin Miller, Anne Francis, Richard Anderson, Earl Holliman, and especially Warren Stevens, did a great job: there is so much visual splendor in this movie that it's hard to pick a favorite from the stage film: approach to Altair-4, the spacecraft alone, landing on a foreign surface of the planet, going down by the rectifiers, the first view of the landscape, approaching the rocket sledges, Dr Morbius's house seen from outside and inside, the underground complex and its wonders, setting weapons , the fight with the monster, the final approach of the invisible destroyer, the escape from the doomed planet - all these scenes are engraved in the mind of the viewer, because we discover them together with the participants. A readable script by veteran Cyril Hume was filmed by longtime director Fred McLeod Wilcox with clarity and imagination. it is a shock to realize that there is no music at all; the film is carried with words, actors and a plot of mystery. It can be viewed many times with pleasure - I have been doing it for almost fifty years. Until this famous and beloved movie was made, no film attempted to imagine a world beyond Earth; and then, for decades, the ships crashed on the planet - as if the imagination of the writers failed and caused catastrophes. Still the best, as many say. This says something negative about the so-called imagination of the intellectual leaders of this nation - and something really positive I suggest to those who created this gem.
