This movie was my first contact with Mr. Saty, so I really did not know what to expect. But what I saw just broke all my expectations - in a good way. <br /> <br /> The plot is not complicated and shows us the life of a found orphan boy, especially his relationship with the poor people community, who together built a hood from simple houses made of metal plates. This small city in another city lives its own life and everything goes well. But one day there is a water resource and a wealthy nobleman is interested in buying this place. But as the title of the movie indicates - there is a miracle. Our character gets a wonderful dove from her dead mother. What is he going to do to protect his friends and all built city? <br /> <br /> It was just a masterpiece of natural comedy. It shows the behavior of poor people and how money and property can talk and play with people. Also included are many funny moments and scenes - at the beginning in a place where the sun shines and many more. <br /> <br /> So, because I'm not a comedy fan, you should see this movie because I really liked it <br /> <br /> me
