it's the best comedy I've ever seen! but not everyone can understand this, you must be from Georgia to understand this amazing movie! :) in general one of the best movies I've ever seen ......... Vachtangi (Benjamin) and all the actors playing very well, but playing Kote Daoshvili (Father Germogel) is in my opinion the best actor in the supporting role in the history of films :)) in this movie playing many Georgian stars like ipolite xvichia, Zakariadze sergio, sofiko chiaureli, verikoan djafaridze, Sesilia Takaishvili, Dodo Abashidze .... all are stars of Georgian cinematography :) in this movie a great russian star Evgeni Leonov plays and of course the director of the film Georgy Danelia is one of the best ... I recommend this film to everyone, but remember that you must know the good Russian language to watch this movie
