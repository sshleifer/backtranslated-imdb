I do not know who could find the guilt in a simply human and fun movie like this one with a lot of pleasure for your heart. I enjoyed every minute and guessed the end in the middle of the movie - but it did not disappoint me. It will not only affect your heart, but it is such a good family friendly movie - we need a lot more like these!
