The second in the series "Why we fight" focuses on Hitler's grip in the Sudetenland and beyond, when he breaks free from Neville Chamberlain and sets off to conquer Europe. <br /> <br /> Clearly understood as propaganda in its time, this series in the test of time became an information document, as well as the majority of "bias" turned out to be a historical fact. The FÃ¼hrer rises to his own torpedo with happy statements before his people and the world, as he says, and does something else when his army moves east. Czechs and Austrians are quickly capitulating, but Poles are taking a heroic fight against overwhelming opportunities. <br /> <br /> The difference between Hitler's military power and Chamberlain waving the Munich Treaty like the white flag, declaring "Peace in our time" still has permanent propaganda properties. Here, in its original context, it resonates even more when the darkness of World War II enters Europe, leaving the American viewer with two options, freedom or slavery. In 1943, this simple truth was not avoided, and the strike by the Nazis effectively emphasizes this.
