I like Ralph Bakshi's films ("Wizards", "Cool World" and the underrated animated "Lord of the Rings") and I am a collector and fan of Frank Frazetta. I am also a fan of sword and spells, who loves the worlds of Edgar Rice Burroughs and Robert E. Howard. <br /> <br /> I missed the movie version of "Fire and Ice" in 1983 and can not wait to see it or revive it for some time. That is why the 2005 edition was a dream come true for me. I bought it, however, with some anxiety, because I was hoping it would be worth only to see it once, and then put it on the shelf as a "collector" collecting dust until the day I die. Fortunately, my fears were unfounded and I was impressed with this film. <br /> <br /> Like Frazett's art, it's a clumsy movie whose physicality and sexuality are hard to find in most fantasy / sword and sorcery movies without being cheesy or dirty. Art is good, and you see Frazeta's flashes at its best. Even my young boys loved watching him and asking me to watch him again and again. However, my wife has some reservations due to the scantily clad princess (very Frazetta-esquire). It does not bother me because it is reliable and there is no sex scene. <br /> <br /> I use roto-scoping, but personally I like roto-scoping. It gives more fluid and realistic movements to heroes who are difficult to find in animation. <br /> <br /> Despite some problems with continuity, I recommend this movie to all fans of Bakshi, Frazetta, Conan and sword and spells. Enjoy!
