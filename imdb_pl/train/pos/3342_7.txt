If you like romantic comedies, you'll find the story of two 30-year-old singles who fall in love with the American League pennants. On the other hand, if you're hanging around waiting for Kill Bill Volume 3 or Sin City 2, you probably should stay away. The plot contains a compulsive guy who meets a girl's girlfriend, a girl meets guy's friends, and the guy meets the girl's parents' scenes. There is even a guy who meets a girl with a dog scene. All this is equal to the course in such a film. However, I like the fact that the story goes deeper into the decision making process that people take when they realize that their romantic interest is not perfect and is actually a bit bizarre. The plot focuses on answering questions; how much eccentricity is too much and how much love do you need to overcome these quirks? It is interesting that the characters work on it because deep down (if we admit it) we all have quirks. Barrymore does a very good job in his role, and Fallon surprised me - he's good too. I rate it on 7 out of 10 as a romantic comedy. Add one point if you're a baseball fan or romantically related to one. Add another point if you're a Red Sox fan and subtract two points if you're a Yankees fan.
