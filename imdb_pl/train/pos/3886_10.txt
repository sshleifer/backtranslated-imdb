Eddie Izzard is brilliant with his non-stop humor. I could listen all day. His unique approach to life is quite logical. His understanding of the discovery (such as the Heimlich Maneuver) is creative. Eddie Izzard reflects the heart of what we think. I do not know when I laughed at someone's indulgent mind.
