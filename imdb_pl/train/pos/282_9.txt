This is undoubtedly the scariest game I've ever played. This is not an ordinary "shoot-everything-to-moves" fps (which I usually do not care too much about), but an acceptable gfx, interesting weapon and magic, great sound effects ("Scryeeee, scryeeee ...") and above all the amazing atmosphere . I love Scrye, who allows you, in some places in games, to see or hear events that happened in the past. The only game in which I had to make regular breaks after a few minutes of playing only because of the intensity of the atmosphere. I am a great fan of horror, especially thanks to the stories and films of Clive Barker, and participation in such a horror movie makes me miss other games that emphasize the atmosphere and more immersive history. 9/10 (-1, because I'm not a fan of fps, maybe the game was a bit short?)
