The film is very realistic. Absolutely not in the Hollywood Cinema genre, where each line must be pronounced in a perfect way, and every move is precise. Actors playing the role of lovers perform a GREAT job representing the characters' feelings and thoughts - their everyday adventures. In conclusion, the film shows the viewer in a state of depression. The realism of the whole story can be seen here. Not everything happens as we think it should happen. I can say that the film does not end with a bad note. We watch, learn, experience ourselves. This is probably the moral of this story.
