What can you say about Mr. Moore? He is the godfather of rap, the king of the blaxploitation cinema on level Z, and here he returns as his most famous character, Dolemite! Can you dig it? This film is one of the outstanding roller-coaster rides with politically correct humor, trippy kung fu, nudity, cheese, violence and many other things that you will never find in most modern movies (or movies, really, ha ha!). You can not miss the routine it gives you early! In any case, D2 is definitely a fun way to waste time. Dolemite: "He thinks he is angry and he has no class! I'm gon 'rock in this shooter * its sound * a **! "
