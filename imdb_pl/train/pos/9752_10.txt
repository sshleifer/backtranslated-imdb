I remember seeing it when I was 3, and then my parents accidentally recorded all but a few seconds with a different cartoon. Then I was about 8 or 9 years old when I discovered it anew, and because I was able to better understand things, I thought it was a good movie. Fast forward A few weeks ago (June 2006), when I rediscovered it thanks to some online articles / video clips, and this is not the same movie. I am sure that it is still good with children, but for us 20-30 something definitely has written "Cult Status". It is a pity that the original production has undergone a painful process; if Fox gave him enough time, he would probably be more familiar to the public. Maybe if they had to convert it with a completely different story and cast a whole star in it, but that would be Fox decided. I know I go here. And I still think it's a great movie, but it can be better than great.
