This is a perfect little movie about the solitude of a lonely man. Phillipe Harel as Notre Heros is a bit like Robert de Niro's amalgam in Taxi Driver, Inspector Clouseau (in his stoicism) and Chauncey Gardiner in Being There (also Peter Sellers). It is a single, but it has no idea how to attract the opposite sex - in fact, it really does not make any effort! <br /> <br /> He has stoicism and fatalism who opposes all hope of achieving coupledom - his friend Jose Garcia as Tisserand is in the same situation, but at least he takes a brave effort to transcend his extended virginity (he is 28 years old and he admits he never had sex). Rouen, where two people from the software are traveling on business. They try different nightclubs and places, but to no avail. My theory is that they try wrong places - they go to more or less "youth" night clubs; they should try a type that has older people, more of their age. a guy who pulled a pretty girl in a nightclub. <br /> <br /> It's worth watching.
