It could be 10 if it was not quite predictable and the Hollywood scenario. Daniel Day-Lewis confirms his position as one of the leading actors of our time (why it can not be the lead), and the rest of the cast is at a very high level. Personally, I was impressed by Hugh O 'Connor, who played Christy Brown as a child. The first scene where I watched him was really strong. Wow.
