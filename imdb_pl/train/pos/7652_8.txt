Acting fantastic. History - amazing. Scenario - wonderful. <br /> <br /> Several ways to describe this video. Yes, it's slow and mostly says, but the whole story of their lives and what's said in flashbacks makes you want to listen to every little thing to learn more about this haunting and tragic story. I read the book on which the film is based and showed me even more light in this story and answers some of the questions that remained unanswered in the film. I also have to read the Exectioner's song, which is the "second" part of Gilmore's story. This movie forced me to think about the phrase "driving in the other side of the mirror". In the film you hear the song Gary Gilmore's Eyes, which is a punk band who wrote a song about how it would have been Gary Gilmore's eyes (which is one of the things Gary gave as a transplant when he died) and when you listen to it what's the last time Mikal ever sees Gary, you look at the situation a little differently, if you were alone here. This film opened my eyes in this way and in many others. I highly recommend this film (and book).
