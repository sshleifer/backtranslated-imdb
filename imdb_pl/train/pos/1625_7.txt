A surprisingly good movie! There are a lot of good jokes in the whole film. The only negative thing is that some scenes go back to the extremes to show how stupid the main characters are. We get it, stupid blondes, do it! <br /> <br /> The plot barely avoids being called "corny". And boobs are always an additional advantage, although the movie for some strange reason does not play with this card, even if the feature line depicts two black-haired women who act as a bad opponent in our two blondes. /> So all in all a good movie to watch. I almost gave him 8/10, but do not go crazy.
