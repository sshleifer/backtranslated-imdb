I think that this film provokes thinking, and its ambiguity refreshes in the world of fast films where we manipulate to love a "good guy" and hate an "evil guy". Scott Cohen, a very handsome television actor, does a great job of presenting a family of black sheep / lost children who aspire to earn the love and respect of their father, and widowed sister-in-law, with whom he apparently has history. Judd Hirsch plays against his typical good image of his father, who triangulated his sons and now stays with the one he always rejected. <br /> <br /> When I saw this at the Tribeca Film Festival, I was enchanted by the beautiful way in which sawdust was used to present a family tradition, as the director explained. <br /> <br /> This is the right successor to the classic "Ordinary People". I just realized that Judd Hirsch also participated!
