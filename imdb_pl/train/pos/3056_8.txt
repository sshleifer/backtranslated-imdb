I put it on my TIVO for a rainy day because of the cast, some really hard working people in the industry, and when I finally watched, I was NOT disappointed. <br /> <br /> This movie has a taste similar to Altman (he finally wrote about it as a thank-you person), using seemingly independent, unrelated story lines that interwoven when the movie approaches the climax. Macy is clean, clean and honest, like a man who does not seem to get away from his "destiny", Sutherland plays and portrays how few can, Neve adds a splash to a deliberately subdued environment, add Tracy Ullman, Barbara Bain (remember Impossible Mission on TV? ), Not to mention the constant John Ritterie and you have all the ingredients for a good FILM. The script is clear, dialogue free from stereotypes and thoughtful (especially between Macy and David Dorfman). Suspend faith and enjoy, it's a really good time.
