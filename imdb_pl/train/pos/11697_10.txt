This film really opened his eyes. I've seen this movie several times. First of all, when I was four years old and I actually remembered it, and then when I was 12 years old. All the news the director tells is for everyone to wake up and make no mistake, leaving God out of our daily lives, or just an ordinary extra mile of insulting him. <br /> <br /> A great movie for unbelievers and believers!
