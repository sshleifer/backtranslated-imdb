I watched "Ice Age" in the cinema and liked the movie. Despite the fact that the "Ice Age" has many scientific flaws and errors, such as people, sabers, dinosaurs and mammoths living in the same period, and even a place where history passes (looks like North America, but has some features from Iceland) for example) we can have fun (unless you are very strict!) <br /> <br /> The planet is entering the ICEEA, and many animals emigrate to the south, where it is warmer. Sid is a stupid laziness that was left by his own family who can not take it anymore. Going in his own way, he meets Manfred, or what he calls "Manny" a moody mammoth who does not care about extinction or immigration and goes to the north. Worried that it's easy to catch him, Sid decides to follow Manfred, and in the middle of the journey, they find a human mother with their child. Mother dies, but Manfred and Sid decide to take him and give him back to the child. Diego, one of the saber, decides to follow them and help them to take a short cut to the human camp. Manfred and Sid do not know that Diego comes from a saber clan who hates people and wants to kill a child, and pretend that he cheats on both of them to become a saber food. What will happen depends on the behavior and conscience of Diego ... <br /> <br /> aka "A Era do Gelo" - Brazil
