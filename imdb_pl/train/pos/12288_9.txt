The House of the Spirits is a thrilling story about family intrigues, South American politics and super-natural powers. Meryl Streep, Glenn Close and Jeremy Irons revive Isabel Allende's novel with all their passion and tension. This is, in my opinion, one of the best films of the 90s. Jeremy Irons as Esteban Trueba ages and calms down very reliably, while Meryl Streep in the role of Clara maintains her gentle, loving warmth throughout a relatively short life. Winona Ryder and Antonio Banderas create a handsome couple fighting for the acceptance of the family in racist culture. Glenn Close, as sister of Esteban, gives a very moving performance. The landscape of Portugal is a reasonable substitute for the non-tropical country of Latin America. The settings of Clara's house and Esteban's ranch are effective, and American cars from the period fit nicely into the post-war atmosphere.
