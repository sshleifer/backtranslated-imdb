Let me start by saying that this is undeservedly observed by almost everyone! The fact is that nobody expected it, especially from Guy Ritchie. What everyone expected was cockney geezers and a good one liner, "do you like dagi?" Etc., but it is much more mature than his previous work. I would agree that this is confusing, but all the facts are for us, we just have to see them and listen harder, this movie requires your attention! Look beyond the cool and dazzling look of the movie, try to listen to the dialogue instead of watching performances and I think we'll all get a fuller understanding of the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, it has its influences from modern classics (fighting club, fiction pulp, etc.), but entirely in both directions and tempo with an unmatched musical score. I feel that if everyone were watching this movie over and over again, they would understand it much more and perhaps would appreciate it for a great piece of modern cinema that is and I hope that Ritchie continues this vanity, because I prefer it to his "masterpiece" mockery.
