This is one powerful movie. For the first time I saw that Scottish accents made it difficult to understand a lot, and that ruined the viewing experience. I quit, but then I bought a DVD, used English subtitles when I needed them, and really took care of the movie, discovering how good it is. It's perfect. <br /> <br /> The wide-screen picture makes it spectacular in part, with some wonderful rough scenery, and the story reminded me of Braveheart, the story of good versus evil. Here is Liam Neeson (good) vs. Tim Roth (bad). They both do their job well. <br /> <br /> Few actors are as mean as Roth. Man, you really want to hit this guy in his arrogant, annoying cat. (He's so nasty and despicable that sick critics love his character more than anyone else). Neeson is a man and a solid character of the hero, because Gibson was in Braveheart. Jessica Lange is strong here as a woman's lead. The film attracts you and makes you totally committed, so prepared to see it emotionally.
