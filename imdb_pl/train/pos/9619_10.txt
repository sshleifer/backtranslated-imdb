OK, so 10 out of a 2 1/2 movie stars that you ask? ... well, look at this and maybe it will make more sense ... Hitchcock never mixed scenes better together ... The movie intertwines the scene flawlessly from the very beginning and yet you do not feel the scattered impression that you sometimes get when the movie takes you by many characters who are trying to develop. You can feel that the characters will show you something extraordinary about themselves, and then they will not let you down when they do. A surreal story about the life of screenwriter / producer Phil Haya, combined with an absolutely excellent soundtrack, makes you think more about the six stages of separation in life than a movie of the same title ... I will be looking for more good things from this producer into the future.
