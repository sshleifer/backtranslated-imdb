This series brought me into Deighton's work and genre when I was younger and I love this presentation of this story. However, I do not agree with the above comment. From what I have read in the past, it is not Holma's performance that leads Deighton to refuse to issue a series, but to the massacre that all three books received in translation into the screen. A perfect example of this is the rewriting of the border crossing, which ended the career of Samson. There are no scenes in the book, a figure who dies on a minefield, has never been in any book, and the transition in Sinker was from East Germany to West Germany, not to the Polish border. This whole plot is a cloth. The changes in Set similarly damage the integrity of history. My perspective on Holma's performance was that he perfectly presented Samson's disorientation during his wife's defection and I believe I was doing well, presenting an aging field agent desperately trying to close the class division. Samson pays for father's idealism and suffers from his influence on his life. As Clevemore comments, if he was educated, the department would probably be running. I think that the real loss of performance results from physical appearance more than anything. Holm is a diminutive book compared to Samson - a physically impressive man capable of using his size to impose presence.
