Some may feel that the rating I just gave is a bit generous, but for this movie I think that the directors did a good job they had at their disposal, it is also a movie about the acquired taste! <br /> <br /> my immediate thought was a direct connection to the classic cult movie "The Thing", a parasitic alien from outer space, attacking the human host, and then poisoning the havoc wherever possible! <br /> <br /> You can see how this movie pays tribute to such a movie as other horror / gore genres, but it deftly retains its originality, it's good that these things are fighting for one thing and then they are still eating, and then rivals are falling! Only killing and picking a man when he needs a new host! To choose a different fight with another infected host! And this movie even throws a love story, but I will not say anything more, it gives me too much. <br /> <br /> WONDERFUL! But as I said about the acquired taste, so do not be surprised if you do not like the movie. There is a low budget and yes, he is thirsty of blood, with creatures / aliens / things transforming his limbs into primitive-looking weapons, i.e. saws, drills, blades, and even strange weapons for all but decimants there. I realized that I was hitting what I was showing, but at the same time I glued myself to the screen wondering what would happen next! <br /> <br /> So if you like gore, you like strangers, you like to fight, and maybe even some love, somewhere thrown in, then I have to recommend this movie as necessary. I just want you to hit it sooner than me!
