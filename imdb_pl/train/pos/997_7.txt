I have to agree with most other posts. Was it a comedy? drama? for me it bent a bit towards comedy. I could be a great movie without comedy and was terribly invented. Jamie still gets into Julio and what's his name. In New York, how many times do you meet someone you know in the center of Cleveland. And how Robert Pastorelli could have kicked the Yankee Stadium to hide gold. Again, comedy or drama? But he was still funny, especially on a Sunday morning. I liked the performance of Kimberly Elise, she was certainly a beautiful actress and seems to be taking her craft seriously. She is a younger actress who will be profitable.
