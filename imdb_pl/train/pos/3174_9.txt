Very rare is the indie comedy that leaves a lasting impression. Cross Eyed is a rare gem. The director not only faced the challenge of directing his own work, but also gave a funny performance as a bad roommate. The script looks interesting not only to the writer's difficult situation, but combines so many comedies with the writer's ravaged world that you can not help but support Ernie as a character. Very funny things. Despite the small budget that Adam Jones can give the film a serious look. He is not kidding when it comes to making a good movie. I can not wait to see what he will come up with. This guy can make people laugh and think; it's special.
