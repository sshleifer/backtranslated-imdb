Offside is a story about teenage girls who tried to sneak into the stadium to watch the Tehran World Cup final qualifying football match that could lead Iran to the 2006 World Cup in Germany. Women are forbidden to walk to the stadium in Iran, although many of them dress like boys and sneak in. Stadium guards search everyone at the entrance to ensure that no one carries fireworks and of course; no girl enters. <br /> <br /> Like most of Panahi's work, the performance of his cast was excellent. You really think you're watching a documentary. Dialogues between the girls and the ranks were made gently and amazingly. The film presents the interactions between prisoners and incarcerated guards, who themselves give mandory to their families and friends in a funny way. At the end, the audience realizes that there is no difference between girls and guards who only follow orders.
