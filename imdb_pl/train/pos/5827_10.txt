This three-part wave is in a draw with my other favorite movement "Disappearing in court." It is a scream of laughter for every Three Stooges fan. <br /> <br /> The boys are janitors in the recording studio when they hear the beautiful Christine McIntyre singing the great version of "Voices of Spring". She will be offered a recording contract, but she is shocked to be honest with her father because of her career choice and proving that she is a real singer. When she and others leave the studio, the puppets decide to have some fun and play her CD and dress Curly as Christine. The contractor who can do Christine's career sees Curly and makes mistakes against Christine and invites Curly to sing for her. Of course, there is a man they annoy at the party and they destroy his solo in front of the crowd, so he will find a way to get back to them. <br /> <br /> What a great flick of your fingers, you can not miss it! <br /> <br /> 10/10
