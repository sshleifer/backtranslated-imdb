The symbolic use of objects, the editing of forms, the position of the characters in the scene ... all these elements were used with such joyful abandonment by Hitchcock that you can really see what kind of genius he had. The way the wife moves from one corner of the ring to the other as the battle progresses, the edit when the wedding ring is placed on her finger ... while these may seem a little obvious in today's standards, in the silent era they spoke volumes about history without words. Even the title has at least four meanings that I see; boxing ring, wedding ring, bracelet that a lover buys, and a love triangle in the heart of the story.
