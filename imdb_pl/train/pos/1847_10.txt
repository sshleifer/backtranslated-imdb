Whatever you become in your life, never forget that you have roots. It's a story of real facts that have become a beautiful and moving movie! I dare say that this movie is underappreciated. This shows us the reality of life ... the more evil that surrounds you, the better you become. ... no injuries, no life "under the rock". The concept of the film is more interesting ... combining a story with real life events ... keeping us in the consciousness of everything ... from facts to emotions! Bless these people and make everyone happy! See this, I recommend it to all young people. It's not about racism, it's about how to live!
