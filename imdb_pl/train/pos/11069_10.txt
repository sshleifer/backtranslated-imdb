"Ah Ritchie made another gangster movie with Statham," thought the average fan, expecting another Snatch / Lock action; expecting perhaps a few temporary changes, but it is not too difficult for "me and the boys" after swallowing several beers. <br /> <br /> Ah, be careful, you have to watch this movie. No cups of tea, no additional diet cokes from the counter, do not "keep it" screaming when you're pulling into the fridge - watch the movie! No laughter except those that you can do with a lot of violence (and if it lifts your boat, so be it), but a sharp, solid direction, perfect dialogue and great performances. from The Sopranos, always a reliable hood.
