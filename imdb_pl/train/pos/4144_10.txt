For a time I fell into a trap in which I found myself watching independent and foreign films and lying to myself that I like them. Fatty Drives the Bus is an exception. This is true. This is the best "bad" movie in history. <br /> <br /> The "evil" of this movie seems to come naturally. In the middle of the opening monologue of Satan, the word "hell" appears at the bottom of the screen. Wonderful Bridget is an unshaven man in a wig and shop dress. You need an eccentric couple who try to kill yourself FOREVER to get down the stairs. Jesus approaches the funk soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Fatty gives the impression that someone has lost his term as advising a senior film project. But it is the sincerity of how bad it is that makes it so wonderful. One gets the impression that the creators knew that it would be bad, but they never forced it. <br /> <br /> Never be surprised, Fatty provides. I would highly recommend.
