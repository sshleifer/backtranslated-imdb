Mirage (1990) is a very rare horror / chiller from 1990, released in Great Britain on the label "New World Video". <br /> <br /> It's a horror movie about a group of young friends who are partying for the weekend, just to be killed by an unknown force that rides a dangerous black truck !!! This movie has some scary scenes and a little bit of gore here and there, but I have to say that acting was so bad, even at low budget standards! But the movie was strangely addictive and I liked it, and I never fell asleep or turned it off, which is always a good sign! I almost gave it to the 6/10 movie, but seeing the couple develop along the way, I had good moments of gore and uncertainty, I had good nudity and the fact that the blonde in the main female role was also hot! I'll give him 7/10.
