The best Cheech & Chong movie so far !! Of all Cheechs and Chongs, this is the best so far. I think I've seen them at least twelve times and I love them all. But this is definitely the best. In comparison to others, this one contains many topics and gives a lot of good laughter. Some of the texts are today part of our language after 25 years. I hope that one day they will be able to do another because they are still great comedians. I heard that they're writing a new script, so who knows ... I guess these guys are the only ones who managed to create decent movies in this genre. I wonder if John Ashcroft ever saw one of them ...
