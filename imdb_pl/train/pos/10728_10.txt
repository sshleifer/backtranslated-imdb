The perfect space fantasy movie. a group of children accidentally appears in space and must go down, but not sure, yes. It would not be a family movie if everyone died. Then everything will be sad. You do not want Kate Capsaw, the lead lady, to appear in the Golden Globe, but neither she nor Lea Thompson have won. This is so bad. I can not say enough, this movie is so great, Lea Thompson-lord, the perfect girl for this movie. This movie is definitely the best. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but better than Star Wars. Star Wars are so discounted and the space camp was so undervalued. It should be on the reverse <br /> <br /> excellent 10 / 10- 0r maybe 11/10. I'm not good at mathematics
