Braveheart Mela Gibson was a spectacularly made film, but left a sour taste in his mouth. Rob Roy, in contrast, is a bit less polished, but definitely a better movie. It is a historical film that combines timeless topics with genuinely historical values, while Braveheart gave the ancient story a thick and unpleasant contemporary gloss. What makes this movie a cast. Liam Neeson plays the hero, in a role he basically repeated (in a watered way) in the Phantom Threat. The character is heroic, but he is neither the greatest warrior nor the most demonic lover. Admirable, but human, he directs the screen. There are a number of human opponents against it, including Cunningham Tim Roth, the disgusting, but brilliant, and morally bankrupt Laird John Hurt. Also deserving of praise is Jessica Lange, Rob's pragmatic wife: also strong and noble, but 300 years from a modern heroine who is only what she should be. This is not the most original movie you will see, but it has the courage to own beliefs, and strong performances make you care.
