My 3-year-old loved it. I really liked it, my wife loved it. So 10 out of 10 of our family. What about the level of violence? Not aggressive, mainly due to the variety of the stick. No one really dies, no blood, no blood, no torture, so it is certainly suitable for children, much more than many Saturday morning cartoons. <br /> <br /> This movie really takes the idea for CG movies where it should go. <br /> <br /> First of all, beautiful graphics, wonderfully made textures, true depth, not trying to be realistic, but creating an artistic whole. Moss on stones, rust on metal, reliefs on wood and stone, everything is added to the whole. <br /> <br /> Modeling, unlike many modern CG films, is bizarre, not sweet in the artistic whole. Faces may look less plasty than in some other movies, but characters are more dolllike than human. I think it's good, it gives truth, how strange it may sound, it's easier to suspend disbelief. <br /> <br /> Hair, fur, clothing, equally, at least with people like Pixar. Pay attention to the initial scenes when Lian-Chu fights with the giant snail; Gwizdo is in front of the farmers, and everyone has the detailed clothes that made me stop the movie to admire him. <br /> <br /> Setting. Far beyond cars and even Wall ?? E. The space has been made many times, but the fantastic surroundings of Dragon Hunters are comparable only to some scenes in Never Ending Story and Lord of the Rings, but again it is an artistic whole and lots of good ideas thrown effortlessly. Great views like the scene at Monsters Inc., where all the doors pass through your warehouse or Wall ?? E, where we see the huge towers that he made, abounding in this movie, everything is great, but it never lived; it's just a background all the way! Interlude, where they walk around the area with fantastic falls. Chinese wall, islands floating in the sky. Broccoli in the sky? This is really a place where I believe that CG should go, do something that is breathtaking, and do it all the time. <br /> <br /> The sound is good, the music is varied and not only epic and fortunately without any vocals and purely original for the film. <br /> <br /> The animation is quite good. Gives inspiration to comics, especially good use of stretching and squeezing. Sometimes it's not as realistic, but 3D models are not realistic either. <br /> <br /> The characteristics are well done. Lian-Chu, a gentle and uncertain giant, gradually gaining confidence, basking in the mind of little Zoé. <br /> <br /> Gwizdo, the wily manager of Lian-Chu, finally repurchases, while Zoé does not really change at all, but who wants to change this cute child? At least I loved Lian-Chu more than any other character since Sulley in Monsters Inc. <br /> <br /> The inner struggle in the group is eliminated by external pressure, as it should be in the right fantasy story. <br /> <br /> The story mostly resembles the history of endless history, especially how the world is falling apart. Monsters are quite a standard fare, with the exception of flocking monsters. He lacks the emotional impact of Wall ?? E, which is really a strong point of the movie, but it is a much more fun ride and lacks the annoying replay of the music scene in the first and has the action from the first scene. This movie is what you want to watch for fun and exciting time. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is because I've mentioned the whole vision that seems to be rigorously followed all the time. <br /> <br /> It looks like the surroundings are ready for next adventures, and I hope so on the one hand. <br /> <br /> One remark, the French actor Lian-Chu sounded a bit like Jean Reno in the first place, but I'm glad it was not him, although he is one of my favorites. It's nice to hear a new voice for me. <br /> <br /> I give him the maximum rating, a little surprised by the mediocre and low grades of some; I tried to address some of the concerns raised by two of the lowest voting reviews. Approach this movie as an adventure and as a European film, not opposite Hollywood but different.
