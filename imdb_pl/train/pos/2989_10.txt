First of all, I would just like to say who I am a big fan of Bette Midler. Stella is a very good movie with a great cast (Bette Midler, John Goodman, Trini Alvarado, Stephen Collins, Marsha Mason). This is one of my favorite movies of all time. He deals with a mother raising a child on her own, she goes through many things that are not able to bring up Jenna's daughter, whom Trini Alvarado plays wonderfully. This movie is very good and I suggest that you collect a copy to view it. Roger Ebert gave 3 1/2 stars! And it deserves 4! GREAT! I give it 4 out of 4!
