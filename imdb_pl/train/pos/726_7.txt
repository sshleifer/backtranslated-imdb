Vince Lombardi High School has a new director - bad Mrs. Togar (Mary Woronov). He intends to ban rock and roll music together. He catches the head of Riff Randall (P.J. Soles), who loves Ramones. Also, the head of the school football team (Vincent Van Patten) can not connect with any girl - without realizing the sweet Kate Rambeau (Dey Young) is in love with him. <br /> <br /> Instant north movie. It was generally released and almost immediately bombed - but as a movie at midnight it was a huge hit and played throughout the eighties. I remember going to more than a few of them when I was in college - it was like a party! People sang along with the songs, laughing noisily at every joke and generally just having fun. <br /> <br /> Seeing it now as an adult, I can not imagine why I loved it so much. The script is young and full of groans that I could not believe I heard. Characters change randomly, and the movie jumps everywhere. They save really fun lines and great performances by Soles and Woronov (who REALLY enjoys). Also everyone is full of energy and plays their roles WAY over the top (as they should). Regarding Ramones ... I've never been a fan. I like the title melody, but the rest of the tracks never caught me. If you're a Ramones fan, you can give him a higher rating. <br /> <br /> SPOILER WARNING !!!! This is mainly for children (has a PG rating), which you will probably find stupid but fun. I especially think that they will enjoy the end when high school is blown up! SPOILER END !!!! <br /> <br /> So, if you're in the mood for a stupid midnight movie from the 80's, you can like it. Otherwise, stay away. I give him 7.
