This movie is well done on so many levels that I'm impressed that the result is as low as it is (5.9 / 10 (576 votes) at the time of writing this text). This movie has amazing special effects, a real epic story, great interaction with characters and amazing battles - you have to believe them! The only complaint I have is the subtitles in the HK DVD version I got (some lines have not been translated - ???). <br /> <br /> I just do not understand when I read and hear from various sources: "has a misleading story ...", "I could not follow the story ..." or "Figures came out of nowhere ...". From the first time I watched the movie, I understood him, followed him, knew why there were characters, and I loved it! I have watched it 8 times and it is pure pleasure every time. Oh, this is not just my opinion, because I showed this movie to many other Americans (people who have never seen the HK movie before) who feel the same. None of them followed the plot and each person declared their love for the film. Oh wounds, why can not we have such things that come from Hollywood? At least Lord of the Rings had a nice marriage with special effects, character development and story. <br /> <br /> This is not from a novice from an Asian movie. I have an extensive library of Asian films and I have to say that this movie is one of my biggest DVD movies. When you watch it, you will be amazed by the amazing special effects and the epic atmosphere of this film. You will be drawn into this world of fantasy and you will not want to leave! I saw both the 1983 and Jak 2001 versions (Both made by Tsui Hark) and 2001. It is much better compared to IMO. <br /> <br /> In addition to subtitles, I have one more complaint about this film: I did not want it to end ... I am begging you, Mr. Hark - can we ask you to continue?
