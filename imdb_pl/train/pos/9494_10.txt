WHITE FIRE was recommended to me by a guy who has it on two separate DVD and VHS releases. He claimed that this is one of the funniest and coolest low-budget actions in history. Generally, I do not watch movies knowing that they will be bad, but I made an exception for this ... and I was very happy that I did. <br /> <br /> It is filled to the brim with action (mostly surprisingly, graphically bloody), sleaze (isolated from nudity with a key female character, but there is so much in one scene that it becomes hilarious) and scandalously awkward dialogue, from which everything laughs - inducing the tone of the film. <br /> <br /> GINTS, the amazing star of THE EXTERMINATOR (and countless other low-budget turds) is fun at the forefront, giving you the best performance you can get. Williamson is better than usual, apparently he associates him with unparalleled joy (and does not go inside). The rest of the cast is also great to watch, especially villains, one of whom is a sadistic sexpot who speaks with an accent that seems to be a Spanish and Italian mishmash. It is priceless. <br /> <br /> Again, I can not stress enough how bloody it was. It is not so bloody that it is nausea, but it is extremely violent in parts where fleshy nasty scraps are fired and has an exhausting torture sequence that no one will quickly forget. In addition, when Ginta is swarming with a herd of bad guys, he comfortably catches a chainsaw and the next splashes that will follow will have all the action fans who cheer and spill their beers. <br /> <br /> Don Do not miss WHITE FIRE. It's crazy - if it's a stupid fool mind - a classic action.
