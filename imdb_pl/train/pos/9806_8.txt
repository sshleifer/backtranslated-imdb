I agree that the capital should be on DVD. I watched this program by accident in 1994 and fell in love with Rolf Saxon as Hudson Talbot. It was nice to see Americans who work abroad in London in the financial industry for a change. I loved Rolf in this role and I loved every other role he was in. I can not believe that the series lasted only 13 episodes. I liked William Armstrong as Hudson's extravagant charming friend in the show. When they broadcast this program around New York, it was always late at night or out of time. The show lasts less than an hour. I felt that this concert should have lasted longer, but the changes in the casting in the second season really made the program less interesting. I did not care about Sylvia, but I missed Actress Julia Phillips-Lane last season. I felt that this show has a chance and often works. Showing Americans who loved and chose to live in London. American heroes were not arrogant and did not try to outdo their British counterparts. I also liked the fact that they tried to internationalize the cast and not make them British. I liked watching Julia Ormond in an early role. I felt that this concert should last longer. Sometimes I felt that the announcements lasted as long as the show in less than an hour. They could transfer the cast to New York and it would be a hit in America.
