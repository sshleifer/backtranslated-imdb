I am a fan of both actors / singers, especially Gackta, and when I first discovered this movie and watched the trailer, I think it's stupid. After a long wait I watched him finally and here is my comment ... <br /> <br /> I think that everyone knows the story and will not mention it, instead my first applause refers to acting, generally speaking that Japanese films are not brilliant and do not work. Throughout the cast MoonChild is just wonderful and he got into it, especially Gackt very well reflects the emotions and changes of his characters, I like many of his scenes both dramatic and humorous, as in the case of HYDE, his acting is good, but he deliberately stays in background as an actor, as his character does, throughout the movie. I did not like any cinematography, especially lighting and some colors, but because of the small budget, it still has great moments, but the real jewel of the film is history. He has a few bad moments, but it's fine for me, and the subject of film friendship is very well developed and sometimes touching, on the other hand, the story shows a cruel world that no one guarantees life, and thanks to unforgettable scenes of death reflects this visual motive. Besides this interesting note, this movie has some similarities to the perfect vampire movie Intervention with the vampire, which also play the most beautiful (not handsome, beautiful) actors of American cinema, actually Moon Child is somehow seen as a brother with Interview, but it is original on its own. The only problem is that MoonChild is a bit slow sometimes, I'm a Japanese movie fan and I got used to it, but it does not change MoonChild has some useless scenes or characters. But all in all, this movie is really good and sometimes very emotional, just like in a duo of actors / singers I hope to see their other films in the future and I recommend it to anyone who likes vampire-science-fiction movies and romance 8/10
