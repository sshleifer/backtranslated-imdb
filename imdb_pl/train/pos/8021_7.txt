Muppet's third film is perhaps the most relaxing and enjoyable, with a gang that takes its modest college musical to bright (but elusive) Broadway lights filled with typically naive optimism. Of course, their first attempt will fail, and Kermit (group leader and author of the spectacle) blew up its peak; so everyone else goes their own way so that he does not have to feel responsible for them. Sam Kermit befriends a young fashion designer who combines the end to the end, serving food in his father's restaurant (the old man therefore has a line in particularly winding non-sequelings!). We usually perform in different stars: Art Carney (as producer), James Coco (as overzealous dog owner), Dabney Coleman (as trickster), Elliott Gould (who also was in THE MUPPET MOVIE [1979]), Gregory Hines, Liza Minnelli ( Having her portrait in an elegant restaurant replaced by Kermit, a sports false mustache, as a supposedly famous entrepreneur in a trick to attract attention to the Muppets show), Brooke Shields, and even director John Landis (probably the most fun scene of this movie as a producer on Broadway, before which Kermit appears playing street music and pals and entertaining shadows and Afro wig!). The rest of the Muppets are more or less going through their usual steps, this time Gonzo spends less space; while Miss Piggy is something of a taste I've acquired, scenes in which the latter is spying on what she thinks of Kermit's romance with the waitress? and especially her violent reaction to this? they are undeniably funny. However, the climactic performance itself is disappointing (after a rather unnecessary episode in the middle where Kermit gets amnesia and ultimately advertises Madison Avenue), which instead of the expected greedy procedures, gives nothing more original than the wedding ceremony Kermita and his eternal flame Miss Piggy!
