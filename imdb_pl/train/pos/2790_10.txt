Gurinda Chady's semi-autobiographical film (2002) is a delicate, poignant comedy set in an ethnically diverse community near Heahthrow Airport in West London. <br /> <br /> Like passenger planes that are constantly arriving and departing from above, we follow the ups and downs of the two main characters, Jess Bhamra (Parminder Nagra) and Jules Paxton (Keira Knightley), who make an unbelievable friendship that concentrates on their mutual passion for football and their technical passion with David Beckham. <br /> <br /> A significant part of the comedy arises from the misunderstandings of the families of these two talented girls, because they break all expectations and conventions of their different family backgrounds. <br /> <br /> Somewhere in the middle, as an intermediary, arbitrator and embittered sportsman, Joe (Jonathan Reece-Myers) - team coach at Hounslow Harriers - intervenes in times of crisis, while remaining the main object of sympathy of both main characters. <br /> <br /> Finally, and not without many obstacles and triumphs along the way, we finally see our devoted and beloved football heroines flying up to realize their dreams. <br /> <br /> Thanks to the great performances of Bollywood veteran Anupama Kher (Mr Bhamra), Shaheen Khan (Mrs. Bhamra), Juliet Stevenson (Mrs Paxton) and Frank Harper (Mr. Paxton) is really a film that captures the urgent passion of maturation and crosses all ethnic boundaries. <br /> <br /> Pinky Bamrha (Archie Panjabi) and (Taz) Trey Farley are struggling with their own struggles, but they still make a significant contribution to understanding the main characters in the film. <br /> <br /> In a special way, the film tells an important story of casual football. He is celebrating evolution in understanding ordinary people in ordinary families and the innate ability of young people to teach old people.
