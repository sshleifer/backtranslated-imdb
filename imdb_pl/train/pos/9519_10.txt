Tom Hanks has appeared in such hits as Forrest Gump, Saving Private Ryan and The Green Mile. For the most part, his roles were good guys for whom we support. On the way to perdition his character, Michael Sullivan, is slightly different. <br /> <br /> In Sam Mendes 'movie, The Road to Perdition Based on Max Allan Collins' graphic novel shows the story of a man and his son on the road during the Great Depression in Chicago. What makes this small trip different is that Sullivan is a hit man who is now being hunted by his former partner. His boss or former boss John Rooney (Paul Newman) loves him more than his son, Sullivan's partner, Connor (Daniel Craig). <br /> <br /> After work done in the wrong way because of Connor, the only witness to his mistake are Sullivan and his son who should not be there. So Connor tries to get rid of Sullivan and his family, but he gets a wife and another son, Piotr. Sullivan outwits the blow and rushes home to find Michael Junior sitting at the table ... just sitting. With his wife and dead child, Sullivan sets off to find answers. <br /> <br /> The story goes hand in hand with Sullivan, who is trying to commemorate his wife and child, and Michael, who wants to blame himself for all this. He feels his curiosity killed his mother and brother. Tyler Hoechlin performs an amazing job as Michael Jr. It brings maturity and the feeling that it is still a juvenile. His loss of innocence is well played when he travels from town to town, leaving nothing behind. <br /> <br /> The previous Mendes film is American Beauty, which received five Oscars, including the best film and the best director. This film did not fall out well with the Oscars, which won only one prize for the best pictures, but received five other nominations for music, sound and the best actor in the supporting role for Paul Newman. This is a great story that will take you on a journey through the Midwest and to the legend of Mike Sullivan: a husband, a successful and devoted father. This film is a sleep movie that should be watched for many years.
