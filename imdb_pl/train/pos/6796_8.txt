Zodiac Killer (2005) is an interesting film by German director Ulli Lommel. He directs, produces and co-operates in this latest production. He not only manages to make an interesting movie cheaper. But it reaches a new level when Herr Lommel is working on film material from almost the entire movie catalog. I've seen movie clips from Boogeyman I and II, War Birds, Tenderness of the Wolf, Brain Waves and Cocaine Cowboys (even Andy Warhol creates an episode off the grave thanks to this movie). Although he uses many old recordings, he works well with them (and I can add them very creatively). <br /> <br /> The film follows a young man who copies the original Ziller Killer. he also corresponds with the writer (Ulli Lommel), who originally wrote about a serial killer in the late sixties and early seventies. A writer's friend (David Hess) helps him find this would-be Zodiac. Can you kill this killer? Will the writer put two and two together and regain some of his former glory? Is David Hess still a man? You must convince yourself and watch the Zodiac Killer. <br /> <br /> This movie does NOT apply to the original Zodiac killer. I also heard people moan about the movie being shot on video. So what. The director's old artistic style is obscured by the fact that he is filmed on video. My only complaint was the excessive use of footage from earlier Herr Lommel films (but I understand why "blink" "blink"). This is a grotesque and street horror story. Like the statement at the beginning, this film does not glorify the murder. You liked the statement. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend for fans of Ulli Lommel.
