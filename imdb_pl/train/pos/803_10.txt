As you can imagine Star Wars: Return of the Jedi who knows that it's a good movie, but how can you see it on video M | can have a party At the end and they probably end the movie with the party with no ghosts or anything But on the original (Live TV) When they play But before I say more, when Obi-wan dies in the Imperial Ship or Death Star, they see him disappear, and Yoda dies from old age or internal illness But because Luke killed Darth Vader (real name: Anakin Skywalker), when everyone is playing late, when Luke or Someone stops ghosts in front of Ben and Yoda, playing at him and smiling when he appears another ghost, is his Darth Vader, but not as A Sith as an old plain Selve off Go and he started smiling with Ben and Yoda I think it made the movie a little interesting But producers or anyone should release the spirit of Padme And Mace Windu and the other Jedis who were killed by Younglings Under Tam in their arms back
