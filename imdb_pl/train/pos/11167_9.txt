My favorite movie is about two fabled New York "characters", Stevie Brodie (Raft) and "Chuck" Connors (Beery), who try to be the "main guy" in Bowery at the end of the 19th century. <br /> <br /> Brodie (1863-1901) and Connors (1852-1913) were real people, although it is a very fictional story about their antics (based on art). The film is legendary (did he do it? it's still the reason for the arguments!), the jump from the Brooklyn bridge (1886), for which he became famous, is shown here as happening at about the same time as the Spanish-American war (1898). Director Walsh clearly had great sympathy for this period, so beautifully reproduced here, and contains a wild, noisy ragtime number from the salon singer Trixie Odbray (young Pert Kelton). so hard, big heart, and sometimes even touching Connors. Pretty Fay Wray is a love interest that both boys carry out. <br /> <br /> Full of life and energy, "The Bowery" moves at a fast pace (unlike many early "talkies"). This is not an easy movie to find, but it is worth looking out for.
