This movie is an absolute classic for the camp. That's why it was a classic Elvira and MST3000. Everyone knows this story. The scientist keeps his girlfriend's head alive in a lasagne pan in his basement while he travels around the city and tries to find her body by checking the local chicks. In the end, he finds the real hourglass body with the head of a chick with a scarred face. The cut off head befriends the failed experiment in the closet, and the cone comes out of the closet and detaches the other "good" arm of the assistant (his second is not appropriate from the previous scientist's failure), and the whole place is burned. <br /> <br /> The movie frightened us as much as children, that my friend did not want to enter his cellar for a year after watching. As children, we rated the most terrible movies of all time, and this was number four. Only one of those frightening films was really good (original "The Haunting".) I had to give the film seven ratings for the enormous entertainment value it offers. Its amazing effect due to poor production and strange sexual angle, when the scientist searches for bodies (along with the porn soundtrack) terrifies the hell of innocent children, while the absurd aspects make it a material for watching conversations and laughter. I could watch this movie tonight and enjoy it, while I'd rather go to the dentist than see "Chicago" again. <br /> <br /> Seven is the most I can give him, because his entertainment value is just luck. Film, as a cinema, is a disaster.
