A great movie, rather demanding than really funny. Unfortunately, there are no memorable quotes, but this one is my favorite: Alexandre: If you leave someone you loved, you must say what I say to you now: "Farewell, I'm going." But disappearing, hiding as a criminal, is wicked. (I did not watch this with English subtitles) <br /> <br /> In my opinion, it expresses everything. There are so many tactics in the relationship between Alexander and the others, but everyone misses some more truth. However, knowledge of the truth can further hurt Alexandre. The common interpretation is that the film criticizes the ordinary possibility of "liberated love", presenting unwanted implications for the people involved. This really shows in a convincing way, but I would appreciate it if the reasons were treated a little deeper: it is not that liberated love is doomed to failure, but people (especially men, I think) should work on themselves and try to overcome the ruling morality before and not through the practice of liberated love. <br /> <br /> Having said that, the movie is realistic, but really worth watching.
