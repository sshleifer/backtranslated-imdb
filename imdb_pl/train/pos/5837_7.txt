With Oliver Hardy hated by the sounds of horns, bells, phones and trombones, his physician Finlayson advises peace and quiet and a diet of goat's milk. Partner Stan Laurel offers a great solution, living on a docked boat, so that salty sea air could help Ollie recover all the rest. This is a great premise for all crazy hats, because the boat is drifted by a hungry goat, and the escaped convict (Richard Cramer) hides for a ride. <br /> <br /> I got a kick from all the gags in the film, starting with this mark in the factory testing the horn - "Silence while the men are working". Early history in a boys' apartment contains a series of mixed up plumbing and hardware mishaps, and Stan makes a banana in a piece of banana. Laurel has some great lines in the picture, such as "We had to be unbound," but what made me turn over is his response to the criminal on board the ship - "Self-Defense is the last medium law" exactly! <br /> <br /> I am not such a great student of Laurel and Hardy's films, as many in this forum, I only know that I liked them as children and I think they are as much fun as today in my youth. In this respect, "Saps At Sea" provides a decent hour of hornoofobic fun, on the right path to hornomania.
