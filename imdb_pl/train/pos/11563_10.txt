I saw it many years after the television series and at first I did not care about it. Then, when my memory of the series receded with the passage of time, I looked again and found that it was absolutely fun. Based on the stage play of Neil Simon, he has not been too "open" to the big screen and this is one of his strengths. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are brilliant as Oscar and Felix, and the supporters are great, especially John Fielder as "Vinnie". Even now, some moments can reduce me to tears of laughter - Felix interrupts Oscar during a game of football asking for supper, Oscar smashes and chases Felix around the apartment, giggling "Pigeon Sisters" brought by Felix's hits and of course the legendary cafeteria scene (later cheated by "When Harry met Sally" Nory Ephron. Sharp dialogue. When the boys think that Felix has overdosed, Oscar says: "They can be vitamins! He can be the healthiest in the room! " Fantastic!
