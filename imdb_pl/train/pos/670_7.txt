The LAST WAVE will never win the main audience. It is a slow but fascinating movie for those who want to come to terms with it. The Australian Real Estate lawyer is asked to deal with the case of five aborigines accused of murdering one of them. There are all kinds of announcements and divinations, because the death of a man is connected with a tribal issue, which was not intended for the judgment of a white man, and soon the lawyer has problems with distinguishing reality from fantasy. It looks like the end of the world can be at hand, and he and the natives can know it, but no one else knows it. Richard Chamberlain as a lawyer is at the top here. David Guptil, a familiar face from several other Australian films and a decent actor, is one of the five aborigines on the trial. The LAST WAVE is no longer just for everyone, like MAGNOLIA (both have strange things falling from the sky). Check it out on a free Saturday night.
