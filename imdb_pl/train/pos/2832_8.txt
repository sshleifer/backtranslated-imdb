I saw this movie in 1969 when it was first released at the Cameo Theater on South Beach, now the famous Crowbar Night-club. It was the last year of the wild 1960s and this movie really came home. He has everything; generational gap, sexual revolution, striving for success and conflict between following the "family" traditions of the family and looking for their own way through life. <br /> <br /> It was a fast, very pleasant movie. Vegas was at the highest level, Sin City in all its glory. Beautiful women, famous episodes, laughter, conflicts, romance and even a happy ending. A very pleasant time. <br /> <br /> The poster from this movie rests on the wall of my bedroom. I look at it and go back in time; time of my youth and my time with my father, a wonderful time in my life.
