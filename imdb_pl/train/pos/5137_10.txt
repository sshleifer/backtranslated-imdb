Interesting, fast and fun. <br /> <br /> I am not one of those people who watch a lot of television. I came across this exhibition when one day I was sick with a bad case of flu, and it immediately surprised me. At John Burke, I've developed quite well. Both he and Claire did an amazing job, organizing the show together. You can really say that they both loved their work. <br /> <br /> Segments of super collectors were excellent. I became interested in things I had never thought about before. <br /> <br /> I would love to know what happened to Jacek? Has one of the hosts adopted him?
