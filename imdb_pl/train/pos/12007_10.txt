This is one of the most spiritual movies I've ever seen. I went with about 150 people to St. George, and we saw this movie in the center of the temple visit George. No person had dry eyes in the audience. In addition, there were irreligious and anti-Mormon people in the audience who felt the spirit of the film and were moved by the captivating music and reconstruction of the pioneers' history and the difficulties they had to face because of their beliefs. /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to understand more about JÃ³zef and the hardships the pioneers have gone through. After all, it's American history.
