This must be one of my favorite episodes of the Twilight Zone, mainly to show two lonely souls in a post-apocalyptic environment. <br /> <br /> In shops with cobwebs and streets full of rubble is amazing. this particular way in which Twilight does the best. <br /> <br /> Although the parable can be a bit heavy because of today's dramatic standards, it's perfect - using this setting to make a statement about human experience and geopolitics in a timeless manner. The whole drama is based only on the shoulders of Mr. Bronson and Mrs. Montgomery, who do not disappoint. (Let them rest in peace.) <br /> <br /> A real classic.
