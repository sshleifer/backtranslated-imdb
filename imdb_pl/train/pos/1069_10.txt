Two weeks ago I bought the seasons Dark Angel 1 and 2, after I caught a few episodes of season 1 on channel 5. Nothing prepared me for how brilliant this program is. I did not like anything since Firefly (also an amazing show). I admit that season 2 is not so good, but there are still some amazing episodes (see Set it, Bag 'Em, Berrisford Agenda, Harbor Lights, Freak Nation etc.), and Alec is great. I've heard about some plans for next season 3 and I have to say that I can not believe it has been canceled - I'm not going to ruin it - but that would have shaken! I also think that it has a lot of potential as a movie (although at the moment it seems very unlikely). As a proof of my obsession, the bar code of Max is 332960073452, and in the two weeks I have had, I have 3 episodes from watching both seasons twice. It is simply too good.
