I was impressed by Chavez's attitude against globalization for some time, but it was not until I saw the film at the Amsterdam international documentary film festival that I realized what he really achieved. The film tells the story of a coup d'état / conspiracy on the part of the Venezuelan elite, oil companies and corrupt Western oil regimes, to remove democratically elected President Chávez and Venezuela's return to a brutal dictatorship. This film must be for everyone who believes in freedom and justice and is a lesson for the rest of the world! I praise the Venezuelan people for taking matter into their own hands and saving their country from such as Halliburton and the Bush regime.
