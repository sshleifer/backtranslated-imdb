In the alternative 1950s, when an undead explosion (caused by the mysterious "cosmic dust") was stopped by the use of special electronic collars, the young loner, Timmy, finds a friend at Fido (Billy Connelly), his recently acquired domesticated zombie family. <br /> <br /> Fido quickly becomes the substitute father of Timmy, whose real dad is unable to express his love for his son (or his wife in a deed act played by the wonderful Carrie-Anne Moss) was mentally maimed as a child (when he was forced to shoot his own father who tried to eat him!). <br /> <br /> Timmy, however, gets in trouble when his rotting collar smoker begins to blink and he attacks and kills the older neighbor. With the authorities on the trail of Fido, troubles with mating with a pair of local persecutors, and his mother creates a bond with his undying domestic help, will Timmy be able to maintain his newly found friend? A refreshing approach to the entire zombie, Fido is a totally funny, wonderfully dark comedy that should appeal to everyone with a slightly twisted sense of humor. Taking Romero's verse from zombies and transplanting it into a small town from the 1950s, America is a genius, and the result is simply one of the most original films that cover the whole subject of "lively dead" that I saw. <br /> <br /> Connelly's Fido is a cinematic zombie worthy of joining the Undead Fame Gallery, along with Bubem Day of The Dead and Tarman's Return of The Living Dead; I often do not feel empathy for a walking corpse, but the performance of The Big Yin is so good that I really started to cheer on the big blue oil bag! The rest of the cast also give praiseworthy performances, with young K'Sun Ray (as Timmy) and Ms. Moss deserving special mention? Ray, because for one so young he puts a particularly sure turn, and Moss because she is so damn pride! <br /> <br /> This is the third zombie movie that I watched this week (others are a bit disappointing Planet Terror and a rather funny Lot Of The Dead Dead), to my surprise, it is also the best. Director Andrew Currie gave the fans of the genre something truly original to the treasure and is a talent that should be watched in the future. <br /> <br /> 8.5 out of 10, rounded to 9 for IMDb.
