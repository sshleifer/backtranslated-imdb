I recently saw I.Q. and although I'm not a type of romantic comedy, I think it was just a nice and sweet movie to watch. There are so many films in my opinion that there is no sincerity. Do you know this feeling when you watch a movie, and you just feel robbed because it takes something from history and it was as if the director just threw it together as if it were rubbish? The story between scientists is sweet and funny. How they got stuck together and tried to help Tim Robbins' hero become intelligent. I liked the love story of Tim and Meg because it was simple and brought a good point when it comes to love, "nothing is as it seems". I recommend it for a Sunday morning. <br /> <br /> 7/10
