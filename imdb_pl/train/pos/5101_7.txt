John Travolta, the biggest honkeyton in the world and a mechanical bull ... what more could you ask for! Yes, you probably will not get many surprises or profound meanings in it. But I always thought it was quite pleasant when I was watching this romance with a red ribbon. Bud (Travolta) and Sissy (Debra Winger) meet in Gilley's and fall in love. They have all the hardships you can expect from a hardcore pair. The honkeytonk scenes are fun with dancing, mechanical riding on a bull and of course the required brawls. He has a good, national soundtrack from 1980, including "Looking for love in all the bad places," "The Devil Went Down to Georgia" and "Hello Texas" of my favorite Jimmy Buffet. Take out your cowboy boots and take boogie with your shoes! <br /> <br /> *** (out of 4)
