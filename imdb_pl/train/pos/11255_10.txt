This is undoubtedly my favorite novel by Le Carre and is transformed into a silver screen with all the love and care you could wish for. I have read the review on this site, which seems to be abhorrent, but I believe it skips the point. All Le Carre stories are basically love stories and this is no exception. It is an exact reflection of the period in which it is set. Betrayal is the key to all for the good of anyone. Upbringing Pyma is so close to mine that I consider him chilling in my veins. Peter Egan is in his best role, and late lamentation Ray McAnally is unbelievably good. Even the smallest roles such as Andy de la Tour, Tim Healy and Jack Ellis are in place. This cast is the Dream of the Impresario Theater. The story should not be spoiled by a misinformed description, but suffice it to say that it refers to the young man's slow but inexorable destruction and descent into espionage and betrayal. All my sympathies are related to Magnus Pym and his only (not sexual) love for Poppy (RÃ¼diger Weigang - just as wonderful as ever.) His only true friendship, but by definition different in a long line of betrayal. EXCELLENT! I love it.
