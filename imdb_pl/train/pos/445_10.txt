I saw Enchanted April for the first time about five years ago. I loved it so much that my husband surprised me with a copy of the next Christmas. It's about two women who decide to rent a castle in Italy for the month of April, leaving their lives behind. At the beginning of the movie they are very sad women and you can not resist their rooting, because they plan this trip with two other women who invite you to share their expenses. This is probably the most noticeable good movie I've ever seen. It is "clean and simple, no car chases, no animosity and no death. It was made with care and very good taste. You can not refrain from smiling - unless you cry with happy tears!
