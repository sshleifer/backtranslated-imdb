It was a wonderfully funny comedy with a great cast. John Ritter and Katey Sagal were perfectly staffed as parents, and the kids were great as well. Kaley Cuoco was a good choice to play Bridget, which was a slightly subdued version of Kelly Bundy from Married with Children. Writing and appearances were first-rate. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, John Ritter died during the series, and it ruined everything. They had to struggle with the change of the program and the introduction of more cast members, which of course was an inconvenient situation, but they managed it well. James Garner was a good addition. It could take longer if Ritter lived. <br /> <br /> I especially liked it when they brought Ed O'Neill to a hospitable place. It was great. <br /> <br /> *** with ****
