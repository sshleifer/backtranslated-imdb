Running Man is not a great movie, in fact he is a bit stupid. But it provides what you want in Arnie's film, and it's action and entertainment. I do not see how anyone could enjoy this picture, it's so stupid and over that it almost makes fun of it. By the way, this is probably one of Arnie's best-known films.
