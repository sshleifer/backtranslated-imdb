The ultramodern house in a prosperous neighborhood seems to be the cause of strange (and fatal) behavior of its inhabitants. At least that's what Lara Flynn Boyle, Col Kennedy says. After a series of deadly events in a gigantic house next door, Col knows he has to give something. Mark-Paul Gosselaar also appears as a mysterious architect. <br /> <br /> My opinion: The House Next Door works thanks to Lara Flynn Boyle and locations (beautiful house) and stylish sets. Boyle is a talented and dynamic actress, not to mention absolutely stunning. He brings credibility to his character and makes the film alluring. Without it, it would fail. "He is so alive," declares the potential buyer with reference to the home. Yes, he is alive. But the story itself is not so much. <br /> <br /> With the exception of Boyle's presence, not much happens here because a huge part of the movie is spent watching or waiting for the house to affect the current owners. The results are predictable. But I liked it anyway. The photos give the film an elegant look. 8/10 due to Boyle, the establishment of a bad, ultra-modern home, location and cinematography, as well as decoration and dressing room.
