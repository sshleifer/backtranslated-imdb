I just do not understand why this movie is beaten here. Jesus. This is mindless, it is not polished and is (as I read) wasted on some. The cast of this movie is played by their heroes in "T" (if you watched Permanent Midnight and became a fan of Ben Stiller, then you will be disappointed). They are misunderstood, good people who are trying to save the city / world, having nothing but determination and determination. The problem is that they do not realize their limits until the big game and that's it! This is three times more than the movie in which The Spy Who Shagged Me was still recorded by the same demographic group. I just do not understand it. Jokes work on more than one level; if you do not understand it, I know at what level you are.
