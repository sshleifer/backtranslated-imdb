I loved this movie. I saw it for the first time when I was 20 years old (which was only four years ago) and I liked it so much that the next day I brought my own copy. The comedy is well played by everyone involved. I always have to scroll and watch the scene where Mr. Tsanders explains why he found water at a distance of 6 feet in one area and 227 feet in another area. Look for father Jason Robards who plays Mr. Retch. Talent ran in this family.
