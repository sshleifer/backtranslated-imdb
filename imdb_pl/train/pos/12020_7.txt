The Last Hard Men considers James Coburn to be out of the blue with a long sentence. Whether he and his friends go to the Mexican border with prison and security. No, they do not do it because Coburn has a vengeance mission. To kill the peace officer who brought him and killed his woman. <br /> <br /> This peace officer is Charlton Heston, who is now retired and knows what Coburn is after. Explaining this to his daughter, Barbara Hershey, Coburn was trapped in a booth and was involved in a battle in Waco. His Indian woman died in a barrage of bullets fired. This is not something she is proud of, she was a raider by-catch. <br /> <br /> In order not to sympathize with Coburn, he lets us know who a bad person really is. Heston is his usual, steadfast hero, but the acting honors in The Last Hard Men go to James Coburn. He blows everyone off the screen when it's on. <br /> <br /> Coburn has a great idea to make sure Heston slips through him, kidnapping Hershey and taking her to the Indian reserve, where the white authorities can not touch him. He knows that Heston must do it personally. <br /> <br /> Coburn's gang includes Morgan Paull, Thalmus Rasulala, John Quade, Larry Wilcox and Jorge Rivero. Heston has Chris Mitchum, who is his son-in-law. <br /> <br /> The Last Hard Men is one nasty and brutal western. It was managed by Andrew McLaglen and I think it could have been a project originally designed for Sam Peckinpaugh. He certainly shows many of his influences thanks to the liberal use of slow motion to accentuate violence. Of what are many. <br /> <br /> For the little Peckinpaugh, The Last Hard Men is your movie.
