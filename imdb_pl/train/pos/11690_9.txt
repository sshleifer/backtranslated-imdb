This movie I wanted to see. Until now, you had to decide to rent. It was worth it. This movie made me laugh from start to finish. Chris Rock is funny no matter what movie he is in. However, it should really be close to being his biggest. If you are looking for a family movie, i.e. Before and after teenagers, then you can not go.
