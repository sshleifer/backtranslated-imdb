Certainly one of the best films I've seen in a long time. Excellent direction and error-free operation make it a very entertaining and often moving movie. Denzel Washington plays one of his most immersive and emotional roles, and the rest of the cast plays beautifully. Christopher Walken is obviously great, although he did not appear as often as I would like. The story of ultimate greed, which adversities offset the innocence and love of the child. It is also a movie for action film enthusiasts because it has quite a lot of crutches, rockets and revenge. Location Mexico City adds a sense of dinginess and corruption, which in itself is the opening of eyes. To sum it up, it's really a thrilling movie from beginning to end. Highly recommended!
