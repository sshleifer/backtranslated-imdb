Paulie was sweet, cool, pleasant and quite satisfying. I went to this movie, expecting to see a typical "family" movie, one that would find me unconscious and drooling on the floor within a few moments. My frame of thought immediately changed when I was quickly charmed by the film's health. It is rare for you to find a family movie that is accurate and can be coined "healthy". Most of them are cheaply made, written and produced only to attract young family members who will then take the unfortunate older to a dull mind of 65 minutes of abused gags and conspiracies. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, Paulie the thread. He told the story of a young girl (Marie) and her best friend Paulie, a parrot who could talk unbelievably and often talked to her. Dorky, the moronic father of Marie, thought it unbelievable and he thought that Paulie harmed the mental health of her four-year-old daughter and quickly ripped it open. We follow Pauli's adventures (and misfortune), trying to connect with his beloved owner, meeting many unforgettable characters along the way. Oh yes, Paulie really (wisely) talked and had a quick New Jersey accent. Cool. The plot was thick and fun all the time, attracting me. Paulie is the best family movie I have found and I am happy with all my heart. Always. Seriously. Collect a copy and sit back and enjoy a real family movie with the whole family. Do not sleep. I promise.
