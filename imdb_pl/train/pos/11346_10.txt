I grew up with H. R. Pufnstuff and incredibly talented Jack Wild, and now my daughters also love fans of Jack Wild. This movie is exactly what films should be: entertaining and entertaining. This film is not limited to children. Many dialogues are aimed at adults, and Witchiepoo performance is something you do not want to miss. The music in this movie fits beautifully with Jack Wild and we have Cass. As a fan of Jack Wild, I would never miss the opportunity to see how she dances or hears her singing. The knowledge of the hard life that Jack has now makes this film even more wonderful, especially when he sings the song opening "If I Could". It makes me stay in loving adoration for him for giving me great childhood memories that I now pass on to my children. Let's all go to Living Island, where friendship and fun are! And keep the memory of Jack Wild alive, handing Pufnstuff to others.
