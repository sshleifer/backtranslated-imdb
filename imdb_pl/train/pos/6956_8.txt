I must say that Uma Thurman is the sexiest woman in the world. this movie was uber cute and i mean cute uber. It contained all the content of "sex" that most of Ivan Reitman's comedies have, but with something extra, CHEMISTRY. Uma and Luke have this amazing but credible chemistry that seems to permeate every scene. Both seem to create this strange, twisted and interesting relationship with a strong "sexual" tension that you laugh until you feel your face. Anna Farris and the rest of the cast seem to play their roles perfectly well, and even the small role of Wanda Sykes will make you laugh. Although this kind of comedy is not for everyone, but I have to say that I went with a person who usually does not like these movies and laughed like crazy. This film is certainly not for everyone. especially younger children, because some moments are too small ... let's say ADULTS for younger viewers. All in all, I was pleasantly surprised by this film, the difficult ending I found was a bit weak compared to the rest of the movie. (3 1/2 * from 5 *)
