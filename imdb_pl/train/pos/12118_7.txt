When I saw that this movie is only 80 minutes, I thought we were in trouble. The condensation of the giant novel by W. Somerset Maugham up to a movie whose clocks lasted less than an hour and a half seemed like a disaster that could have happened. But you know, the movie is not half bad, and even manages to retain much of what makes the book resonate with readers. <br /> <br /> I heard that many movie lovers complain that Leslie Howard was a wet pasta actor, and he was, but I can not think of someone more appropriate to play the role of Philip Carey than the wet pasta, because it's from Carey is certainly. Howard plays it well, which means you want to shake him and hit his head several times and then pull him out and buy him a spine. <br /> <br /> Ah, and then there is Bette, as a girl who Carey is obsessed with and who overwhelms his world. I did not know what Mildred's charm is about in the book, and the film remains true to this detail. But, as Davis plays, he becomes the most fascinating figure in this story, and if he is nasty and unlikely, he is the most dynamic person on screen at any given moment. Davis's performance is credited with changing the direction of the screen, just like Brando would have done almost 20 years later when he shouted "Stella !!" in this little-known Tennesee Williams game and it's not difficult to see why. Davis is very scary. She does not try to distract the audience, and she lets herself look ugly and the most messy. Her appearance when Carey enters her late in the movie to find her dead or almost dead because of an unnamed disease (though it does not pay too much attention to hide the fact that it is STD) is shocking. Of course, it helps that this movie was written just before the entry into force of the Production Code; if it was created a year later, it can be assumed that it would be a bit different. <br /> <br /> Yes, most novels and many of its most interesting parts are left on the floor of the cutting room, and the story really concerns Carey and Mildred, and not much more. I found this to be the least interesting and boring part of Maugham's novel, but it is the part that gives the novel its title and seems to be a part that readers are still interested in, so it seems to me a wise decision part of the filmmakers who decided to adapt the novel the way they did it. <br /> <br /> Class: B +
