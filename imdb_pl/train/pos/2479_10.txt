(I apologize for my faulty language, I'm not a native speaker ...) <br /> <br /> Yes, this is a movie that almost requires an overwhelming response. Personally, I agree with all the superlatives that are around. But I will not use it quite personally to describe the movie here. Because these "perfect! The one and only! Best-always! "- Reviews cause that some people turn away (including me). <br /> <br /> So if you are looking for another "Hamlet" that has the potential to compete with many cinema and cinema - do not miss it if you find it anywhere. (Unfortunately, there are not many people who could see it.) It looks like there is no DVD there, and the version in German - which is quite good - is not available in any format.) <br /> <br / > In case you decide to make a copy: List, which cuts out two hours (or less) of the video version. It does not make sense and is not fun, and gives a bad impression of a film that is interested in flow and architecture. And also paralyzed to the ratio of 4: 3. <br /> <br /> Greetings from Germany, F.L.
