He has a name, identity, some memories and a lost girlfriend. He just wanted to disappear, but they still tracked him down and destroyed the world he barely built. Now he wants some explanation and how to pass people, how he made him who he is. Yes, Jason Bourne has returned and this time he is here for revenge. <br /> <br /> OK, this movie does not have the most extensive scenario in the world, but its subject is very clever and ask some serious questions about our society. Of course, like every Hollywood movie since the late 90s, "The Bourne Supremacy" is a story of super-heroes. Jason Bourne is similar to the Captain America project, which went completely wrong. In the first film the hero discovered his skills and accepted them in the second. He fights now with what he thinks is evil after a person near him is killed (his girlfriend in "Supremacy"). It's all part of the superhero's story, including characters with (realistic, but still impressive, almost invincible) super powers. <br /> <br /> And the interesting thing is that the evil with which he is fighting all over the world (there are no limits in Bourne's films, characters are going from one continent to the other in the blink of an eye), as in the best seasons "24 ", An American enemy who believes that he fights for good, his country completely blinds him. Funny how "crazy patriots" are now the enemies of N.1 paranoia Hollywood stories. <br /> <br /> In addition to all these interesting topics, the movie is not without a flaw: the feminine character Nickie Parson is for now completely useless, and the direction is quite irrelevant when it comes to dialogue. But what really does not matter, because "The Bourne Ultimatum" is an action movie. And the action scenes are rather impressive. <br /> <br /> Everyone here talks about "Waterloo scene" and "Tanger chase" and everyone is right. I particularly liked the fight in Tangier, which reminds me of the exaggeration and madness of Tsui Hark's works. Visually ingenious scenes, many intelligent parts of the action and a good reflection of contemporary American themes: "The Bourne Ultimatum" is by far the best movie in the series and a very interesting and original action movie.
