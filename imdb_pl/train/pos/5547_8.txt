Strangler of the Swamp was made by the low-budget PRC studio and is certainly one of their best movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> A man who was hanged for a murder, which he did not give as a ghost for revenge on the people who accused him. He uses a rope to strangle his victims, and after a few deaths, including an old man who drives a ferry through the swamp, he disappears. Granddaughter old woman takes the ferry herself and also falls in love with one of the local men and decides to get married. <br /> <br /> This movie has a lot of foggy atmosphere, which makes it very scary. <br /> <br /> The cast included Rosemary La Planche, Blake Edwards and Charles Middleton (Flash Gordon) as Strangler. <br /> <br /> Strangler of the Swamp is a must for old horror fans like me. Excellent. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 and a half stars for 5.
