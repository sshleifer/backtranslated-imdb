THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI is proof that the great genius of Orson Welles could have shot a "mainstream" movie if he wanted to. In comparison to other, more artistic works, this film has only a moderate amount of cunning and almost no esoteric elements. he agreed to be one of the biggest scenes in film history. It is worth the rental costs. <br /> <br /> A beautiful surprise was the wonderful acting of Rita Hayworth. Her acting at the beginning and in the middle of the film is so perfect that she made other actors appear as caricatures instead of characters. Even the great Mr. Welles.
