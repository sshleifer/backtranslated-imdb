I watched the trailer on DVD after watching the movie and I think anyone who saw it before watching the movie would be very surprised and probably disappointed. Much of the fact that the film was "by the director Cube" and made it look like a horror movie, in reality is an absurd comedy (IMDB spelling does not seem to think that Absurd is a word, but it is), reminiscent of Rosencrantz and Guildernstern, are dead. <br /> <br /> I love the way history gradually builds up slowly and then gradually increases. I am also happy that no explanation of what is happening in the film is given. This and the fact that history takes place mainly in one set, are the only considerations in which this film is similar to Cube. I recommend it.
