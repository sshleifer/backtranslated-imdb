It has been so many years since I saw it, but I feel compelled to defend this jewel from those who condemn it. <br /> <br /> It is interesting and unusual to observe the diversity of opinions here. That's what I think is humor. This is subjective. Either it loads by your funny bone at 60,000 volts, or it leaves you cold and you wonder why you gave it time. <br /> <br /> This show has some of the best British comic actors gathered in a story that is stupidly disrespectful and the result is fun. Dialogue and visual comedy are beautifully released, and the two wires (Cleese and Lowe) are great together. This has been done for them. <br /> <br /> I can not really say anything else than to ask you to find it and watch it. You will not be disappointed, and in a world without dignified humor it is a classic, harmless and harmless piece of comedic splendor.
