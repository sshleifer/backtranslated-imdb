... this is a classic with many great dialogues and scenes that no one should miss. Nice story, funny situations rich in rags, Mel Brooks is not a bad trail, maybe not perfect, but it's fun; D Do not pay attention to the rating, this is BS. Watch it and then look at a kind of destination (2009) and tell me that Life Stinks deserves the same rating. If you do, I do not think we can be XD friends. At this point, I recommend to every Brooks fan the fourth season "Limit your enthusiasm";) Vote 10 against the ignorant opinions of crooks! I have to do 10 lines here to post a comment? I do not want to write a book here: P
