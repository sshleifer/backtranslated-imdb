Simply the best reality show ever made. The first two seasons (the only ones that matter) concern Hulu. I challenge everyone who watches the first three episodes of the first season and does not like it. I guarantee that you will finish watching the season. Then I guarantee you will watch season 2. <br /> <br /> Other quick reasons to watch it: 1. Anderson Cooper is funny 2. Locations in Europe are amazing 3. Games are difficult mentally 4. It's very interactive 5. In one episode, the player responds to the desperate other player: "I try as hard as I can!" With equally desperate "not necessarily". <br /> <br /> You can find out ... Who is the mole?
