Before I start, I must say that I know the editor of this film. We never met, but we belong to the same fanzine (those things that appeared in the discussion forums) and we talked on the phone, so I have bias here. Anyway ... <br /> <br /> Somehow ironic how the "Rat Pack" culture of the late '50s and early' 60s came back in the mid-90s, this movie from the son of one of the original Rat Pack, which was created in a similar way, was a flap. What's more, it was a critical flop; I believe that Peter Travers of Rolling Stone was the only one who did not take it (as I remember, he gave him a mixed review). And although I do not think it's the biggest movie in the world, and I'm not a fan of Rat Pack or cocktail culture, I think it's worth seeing. <br /> <br /> First of all, it looks stylish and moves. Secondly, the basic achievements are good. Richard Dreyfus is surprisingly moderate as the main gangster coming back from the sanatorium and has an advantage for him. Jeff Goldblum returns to the quietly ironic performances he gave on prehistoric days, such as THE BIG CHILL. And while Ellen Barkin is only committed to vampire in this movie, he's funny. Admittedly, this is not a great movie; dialogue consists mainly of puns, and many of them do not work (like the whole "Zen Ben"). And Gabriel Byrne and Kyle MacLachlan are terrible here. Even so, I was entertained, and if you like gangster movies, you can also be.
