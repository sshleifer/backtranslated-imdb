I must admit that the only reason I bought this movie was because I am a big fan of Gackt and * a huge * Hyde fan. I was expecting a good movie with many shots that, let's say, would please the woman's eye, but a bit of a bad story. I mean, the summary really sounded. And now that I have just finished watching - I feel the need to tell the world about its splendor! Hyde and Gackt both gave painful performances, and my eyes are still hot from crying, which lasted throughout the entire movie. You get caught up in this story and you really feel that the characters feel the end. An element of vampirism - which I love, but very easy to overdo or break a movie - is subtly blended into the story, to make it something exotic, normal to this setting, and not an accidental unnecessary addition to history. First, I scored 9 out of 10 ... and then I came back and tried to think why I did not give this last point. He disappeared without anything. So it's ten out of ten. In the end - I'm not much of a critic - the fact that I bother writing reviews at all, or really hate the movie, or I really love it. You can say which side I'm on with Moon Child.
