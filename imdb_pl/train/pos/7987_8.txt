The man on fire was hot. I love the classic tale of good revenge and a better cause of revenge than kidnapping an innocent girl. <br /> <br /> The writers have done a great job in this film of building a relationship between Creasy (Denzel Washington) and Pita (Dakota Fanning) to make the viewer understand and actually feel how Creasy had to rescue Pita. It was also good that Creasy was not the type of chorus trying to save Pita through the "proper" channels, but instead used tactics of torture and street cunning. Some may say, "Torture is bad regardless of this," and you may be right, but when you see Creasy's pain going through the loss of Pita and the pure passion she has to get her back, you can not help with Creasy and pull him away to make him even more merciless. There would have been no progress if Creasy had used diplomacy to deal with various wicked gangsters and criminals, and he knew it. <br /> <br /> Creasy's task ended with Pita returning to her mother, and Creasy, the bad boys dying in the vehicle. But Creasy's death did not diminish the effectiveness of the film, in fact it strengthened him, showing that Creasy was ready to die to recover Pita. His death was in fact noble. <br /> <br /> Denzel does a great job, just like writers. This movie deserves good grades because it was definitely a good movie.
