This film, criticized by critics, but adored by fans, has now become a classic. By combining allegedly "surrealistic" footage shot at John Lennon's home with, among others, live materials by Marc Bolan and T.Rex at their best, this film is not a must for anyone who likes Marc Bolan, but gives a fascinating insight into the era. <br /> <br /> These were times when Marc hobnobographed with stars like Ringo Starr from The Beatles [who directed him] and you can even find a short spot from one Reg Dwight [Elton John to you] crushing ivory in an amazing [and never officially released] version of Tutti Frutti and rock and ballad versions of Children Of The Revolution. <br /> <br /> There are also wonderful scenes with Chela Secunda [who was supposed to "create glam rock" with her use of glitter etc.], Mickey Finn, and even an actor from Catweazle !! <br /> <br /> The best scene is for me in the garden when Marc leaves the table, sits cross-legged with a string section and casts acoustic versions of classics such as Get It On and The Slider. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it !! FIVE stars [out of five]. <br /> <br /> Rory
