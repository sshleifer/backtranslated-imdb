I just realized that I've been using IMDb for years and have never reviewed my favorite movie. For the favorite, I do not mean something I like now, I mean that this movie is so supernatural that it will never be touched by any other animated experience. This is obvious because I will never be a child again; I saw this movie on ITV in the early nineties. I was 12 years old and it is the age group to which this film is directed, I am also the man for whom this film is intended (the majority of Miyazaki's heroes are women). Therefore, this film has inspired my childhood psychology in an indisputable way and I am forever grateful to Carl Mack (sp?) For producing the English dub of this film, which is much better than the production of Di $ ney, which is not even funny - never I was even able to watch this - of course, the subtitles are the only way, but ultimately the Macek version is so good (voices almost exactly matching the original Japanese actors) that this version is available on the Japanese DVD! It is not available in any distribution in an English-speaking country. Go to the figure. <br /> <br /> There are hundreds of competent reviews, so I'm going to put some curiosities here, not because I'm the final archive of information for this movie. <br /> <br /> First of all, I would like to agree with a reviewer who said that you need 20 out of 10 to review Miyazaki's films - they are in their own league so that they make almost the entire IMDb catalog pale to meaning. <br /> <br /> The fascinating story in this film is that Miyazaki settled in the Slag's gorge area (Pazu area) in Welsh mining communities. He visited Wales for several months in the early 1980s (maybe late 70s) just after one of the great mining strikes. Being a strong supporter of student socialist movements in the sixties he felt their difficult situation. The fight between the townspeople and the pirates at the beginning serves to illustrate this empathy towards the working man. Landscape and clouds, especially in this film, remind me of my growing up when his film presents a fanciful version of the British Midwestern Hills. <br /> <br /> The island is of course a brilliant satirical Swift novel of the eighteenth century - the story in Swift's book is deliberately ridiculous. In Castle in the Sky, Miyazaki entangles myths such as Atlantis and the Tower of Babel - I think that the architecture is based on Peruvian ruins, although I'm not sure someone told me that. <br /> <br /> Anyone who reads this review and who likes this movie will REALLY want to check the epic series Miyazaki Mirai Shounen Conan - Future Boy Conan - based on the short sci fi novel "The Incredible Tide" by Alexander (novel is available online). Conan is basically a prototype of Pazu and Shita Laputa. In addition, you may not be familiar with his earlier works for the Masterpiece Theater - some of his key frame animations. He also made a key frame for Sherlock Hound - he has some of the best backgrounds I've ever seen. See also the first feature film by Miyazaki and Takahata Horus Prince of the Sun (1968) - amazing by today's standards. What else ... Gauche the Cellist and The Flying Ghost Ship - although they are quite rare. <br /> <br /> This movie is such a present, I do not know what we would do without it, it's a different story about nonsense, it's like an oasis. Arigatou Miyazaki-sensei!
