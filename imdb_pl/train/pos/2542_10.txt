Thanks to a special telescope, Dr. Janos Rukh (Boris Karloff) successfully proves that years ago a meteorite landed in Africa containing an unknown but extremely powerful element. Dr. Benet (Bela Lugosi) creates an expedition led by Rukh to locate the element. Unexpectedly, Rukh discovers the "Radium X", even stronger than radium and very radioactive, and Karloff gets tainted and can kill anyone by touching him. Sparks really fly between Lugos and Karloff in this classic science-fiction movie in the post-World War II period. Director Hillyer used several permanent sets from the "FLASH GORDON" series, which were filmed at the same time, and also inserted fragments of electric machines from Frankenstein. Universal did not make the audience aware of the special effects used in this great classic film. Karloff and Lugosi were in the best shape, and both liked to work together and enjoy future generations.
