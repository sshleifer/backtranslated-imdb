Most people who have seen this movie think it's the best movie ever made. I do not agree, but this movie is very good. Tony is a bad guy and he knows he is intimidating and uses him to move forward. It's about him and how he goes from washing dishes to a big house and an office with cocaine on his desk. If you want to have a family movie, this is not a good way, but if you want gangsters, revenge and similar things, you'll like it.
