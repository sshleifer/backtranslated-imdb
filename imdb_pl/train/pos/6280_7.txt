If you like cars, you'll love this movie! <br /> <br /> There are a few great actors in the movie, especially Vinnie Jones, with his usual lack of nonsense and a hard look. Others are not bad either .... <br /> <br /> In this movie there are only two slight flaws. First of all, the story is weak, but people do not watch this movie for the plot. Second, the glorification of Grand Theft Auto (car crimes). However, if people really believe that they can steal Ferrari and get away from it, then look at them well, hope you are having a good time in prison! <br /> <br /> When I read for the first time that Nicolas Cage played the lead role, first I thought "... Sweeet." but then I thought "... naaaa, you are sucking!" but finally, after watching the movie, I realized "... yes, he is sucking!". Only jokes that it plays a very good role. <br /> <br /> I will end this extraordinary review saying: "If the premature death of the criminal enlighten the audience in a way with cinematography, that a gloomy finish below the shiny veneer of criminal life and inspired them to change their way, then this death carries with it an innate nobility. You should say "Poor criminal." I say: "Poor us." <br /> <br /> ps - Angelina Jolie Voight looks pretty good!
