In Suburbia, everything is idyllic when a small family moves in because a father has a new job in a computer company. But no paradise would be complete without his serpent. Strange things happen when the family joins a local village club without a husband, because it certainly has secrets. The father is not a carpenter, but he puts pressure on him to join, because everyone who is around and at work are members. A good part of Robert Urich's boyfriend is a bit lukewarm, but Joanna Cassidy as a good, natural housewife rotates in a nasty way. A tight and well-made aggregate with bizarre Susan Lucci as the club's chairwoman. Pay attention to the iconic Michael Berryman as a butler. The film captures a sense of paranoia, and the finale of special effects is worth waiting. I've seen this movie several times.
