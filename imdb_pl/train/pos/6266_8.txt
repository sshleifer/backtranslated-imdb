This picture is very valuable to me because it is a very pleasant and funny parody of the Alien Invaders of the thrilling city and many of its folk folklorists. <br /> <br /> The city and players are dressed in a sort of 50's style and the whole movie has a purposeful, tacky and kitschy atmosphere. Some scenes are fun, like the birth of alien beings. <br /> <br /> All the actors give full blood and serious performances that make the movie even more fun, and the special effects and the aliens seem to be at least intentionally 3. add to the entertainment. <br /> <br /> These types of films often deserve the following cult: <br /> <br /> 8/10.
