What can I say ?, ms Erika Eleniak is my favorite blonde ever and like an Italian American, number one female fan of beauty, I can not forget this movie. <br /> <br /> you know that you really do not remember a lot about the storyline, situations or other actors. I only remember about how the dead, great Erika fell and that in this movie it looks better than ever, I really do not care if it was a bad movie or a good movie. he simply contemplates Erika's beauty. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, if you're a fan of Erika Eleniak's beauty, like me, definitely this movie is for you.
