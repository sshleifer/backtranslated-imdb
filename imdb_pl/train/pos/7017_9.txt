You spend most of this two-hour movie wondering "what is the story of the main character?" <br /> <br /> Will Smith, as "Ben Thomas", will guess. The last 20-25 minutes is the moment you find out and it's shocking ... but you knew something dramatic would be revealed. Until then, Smith, the game is mysterious, almost persecuting people. You know he has a good reason to do it, but it's never really explained that we would guess until the end. <br /> <br /> All this, including re-enabling / disabling, but a moving affair with Rosario Dawkins ("Emily Posa") can make some viewers frustrated or want to give up this movie ... but not because that the last long segment combines all the elements of this puzzle. <br /> <br /> This is a two-hour movie, not a typical, action-packed macho Will Smith. In fact, the most shocking aspect may be to see Smith's drawn, sad face throughout this story. He hardly even looks like he's in many shots. It looks like he has lost weight and is ill. Smith does a great job of presenting a man carrying a lot of sadness with him. <br /> <br /> Just like a good movie it often happens, this movie will let you think long after the final credits.
