Pakeezah has a very interesting story (which is well documented in the "Trivia" section) about how it happened. It seems that fate has been plotting to test Kamal Amrohi (director), while secretly desiring to see how he finished his work. <br /> <br /> Pakeezah travels with metaphors, poetry and visual eloquence. As a result, the intensity with which emotions come out, reaches a dimension that may not be very real, but it is very effective and leaves an impact on the viewer. <br /> <br /> Meena Kumari lives the tragedy of Nargis and Sahib Jaan her own. Other film stars include Ghoul Mohammed (music director), Lata Mangeshkar, Naushad (background evaluation) and Joseph Wirsching (d.o.p). Their music and photos make you enchanted. <br /> <br /> Pakeezah is a classic in the world cinema. It reveals new layers each time you watch them again. Kamal Amrohi is one of the rare cinema poets and he left us a whole gift.
