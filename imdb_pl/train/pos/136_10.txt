This movie is a great way to end the series. Peter (boy from Puppet Master III) is already an adult and is now a Puppet Master. Well, this girl comes to destroy the puppets and learn the secrets of Toulon, but instead he listens to stories about marionettes. Most of this movie is material from Puppet Master II, Puppet Master III, Puppet Master 4, Puppet Master 5, Curse of the Puppet Master and Retro Puppet Master (sorry ... But I think that Paramount would not let them use scenes from 1). Personally, I wish Puppet Master Vs. Demon toys finally came to life, but the way this movie ends is basically saying, "This is the last movie in the series ..."
