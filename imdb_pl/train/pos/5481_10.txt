For me it was more a wake-up call and realizing that most of everything we see, hear, read and think about everything depends on what the media feed us. This is a classic example of high-level spin doctors who try to control the masses with controlled information. It is also a great example of how people who have a constitution they have freely bought will not be subjected to media controls or attempts to mislead information. Once again it shows that in the end, the needs of many outweigh the needs of the few. It is also instructive that in a country where there is no religious civil war, democracy is not difficult to implement.
