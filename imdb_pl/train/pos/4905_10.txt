"Album of songs so old that everyone thinks they are new." This film has an elusive combination of tempo and mood that distinguishes some of the films from the initial moments. Why not? High talent Dame Judith Dench as a widow who plays the saxophone with a street musician to help him pick songs, to Olympia Dukakis as a cheerful widow living in a Scottish castle on alimony support for many marriages, to Ian Holm as a drummer who loved all band members swing from World War II (more or less). But wait, there is more. Add Leslie Caron on bass and unmatched Clio Laine on lead vocals, and Blonde Bombshells is the hottest band in England since Beatles. Well, OK, not really, but this movie is the winner. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth (Dench) spends the whole movie trying to reconnect Blonde Bombshells to play granddaughter's school dance. And before you roll your eyes, imagine how difficult and bold it would be for a bunch of women from the sexesan to enter the stage before the Britney Spears generation, according to the "Open Morning" act. <br /> <br /> age, when the actress's career came to an end when he turned 30, the second album of most bands is a compilation of the greatest hits, and music over a month almost no chance to play, it's great to see real talent, real music and a really good movie from, BBC. <br /> <br /> I love this movie and I know that I will watch it much more and I will enjoy it every time.
