"Kolchak: the Night Stalker" is an extremely entertaining TV series in which an obtrusive, sarcastic, forty-something reporter is repeatedly dragged into a deadly battle with supernatural (and sometimes extraterrestrial) forces. Based on the very popular pair of television movies with the character Kolczak, this series died quickly in the mid-70s due to low ratings, but nevertheless maintains a strong cult until today. But will the average contemporary viewer be able to kick Kolczak and his weekly clashes with the undead? <br /> <br /> It's really a difficult question to answer honestly. The critics of this series argue that it is formal and hopelessly outdated. On the other hand, fans say it is cleverly written, well made, and sometimes really scary. And I? I have a foot in both camps. I really enjoyed watching all 20 Kolczak episodes on DVD lately, although I can clearly see that the series has serious drawbacks. <br /> <br /> I will first deal with Kolchak's issue as a fictional formula. Now I think we can all agree that most television programs have formulas - almost every segment of Columbo develops according to the same pattern, for example. Repetition in itself is not necessarily bad; in fact, critics have long recognized that audiences often enjoy and actively seek repeatable entertainment. However, the problem with Kołczak is that its formula is simply too stiff - it is too repetitive even in the case of the most generous standards. <br /> <br /> In almost every episode, Kołczak investigates the murder and learns that he has been committed by some form of a monster. He tries to publish a story about this monster, but his editor Vincenzo blocks him, always on the ground that Kolczak does not have enough evidence to support his claims that supernatural forces work. And, unfortunately, Kolczak is also hampered by the police. In the end, Kolchak carries out independent research on the monster, discovers how to kill him ... and then kills. No ceremony, no rewards, or writing a great story about it. <br /> <br /> You can see where this always-so-tight formula can get tired, right? I was particularly surprised by Vincenzo - if Kołczak always loves monsters, and Vincenzo never believes in it ... well, why did Vincenzo not shoot Kołczak, or did he? That's what any normal boss would do. But the series avoids such realism and prefers to keep Vincenzo and Kolczak as comic antagonists. As a result, many of their scenes are profoundly unbelievable - although they are also quite fun. <br /> <br /> The best episodes of Kolchak manage to overcome the limitations of this formula, but usually because they contain some unexpected twists. These selected episodes are so good that I think they are largely resistant to the typical series criticism. Some of my favorites are: <br /> <br /> Horror in the Heights - an episode that is noteworthy because of dirt, ingenuity and social awareness. Kołczak's dialogue has an extremely sharp and cynical edge. Although it is closely related to Kolchak's formula, the script (written by veteran Hammer Studios, Jimmy Sangster) is extremely literate and deep into the story of the monster. <br /> <br /> The Devil's Platform - possible inspiration for "Omen" films, this episode stands out for me, because the villain - very young Tom Skerritt - tempts Kolchak with a satanic contract full of favors (and, doing so, reveals a lot about the role of a reporter). <br /> <br /> Firefall - this episode seems to have a bad reputation among fans, but I liked it because it has a great red herring and a really scary, almost unstoppable monster. <br /> <br /> While singling out these three episodes for praise, I would say that most stories are at least entertaining. For my money, in the 20-episode episode, there are only two complete turkeys: Primal Scream, which tells about the crazy mad runners in Chicago, and Sentry, which presents the stupidest appearance of the creature in the history of filmed entertainment (and this rating comes from the longtime fan of Doctor Who and Godzilla !) <br /> <br /> In all, it's a good series. A bit repetitive, maybe a bit tacky, but it has elements of splendor. Even during weaker episodes, the wonderful performance of Darren McGavin as a caustic, weary world, infinitely funny Kolchak really shines. He carries the series effortlessly, in a way that Sarah Michelle Gellar, for example, never managed to "Buffy". McGavin was one of the great actors, and this series is worth watching just for him.
