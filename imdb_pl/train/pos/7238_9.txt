Small SPOILER alarm !!! <br /> <br /> Good movie ... VERY good movie. And I'm surprised that I said it myself because I'm not a big fan of vampires, and the sound of the Deran Seraphian's name usually means bad news. Most of his films are below average action films such as Death Warrant and Gunmen. It was one of his first films and maybe he should have continued to create horror films instead of action. This film really fascinated me. A good achievement was involved, not seeing famous actors or a large budget. It's really a story that focuses on you. Fans of the original Dracula myth will be especially pleased. The Sarafian illuminates another aspect of Bram Stoker's famous story and remains rather loyal and faithful to the truth. He explains the life of Count Dracula and how he scare the Turkish army away, wandering the dead corpse in front of his castle. Of course, reality ceases to exist and "based on real history". Drinking blood and all this came up with Bram Stoker. <br /> <br /> In this movie, the count (Vlad Teppish) emigrates to the USA and seduces a lot of women. And they're all pretty girls, I'll give it to him. In general, good game by unknown faces, enough blood and blood to satisfy the more morbid horror fans and an interesting plot. This movie is really unknown and has been hidden on the darkest shelf in my local video store. But it is certainly worth cleaning the dust from the cover and put it in the recorder. Heck, it's much better than the famous Nicole Kidman movie of the same title. These two films have nothing to do with each other, but I blame the film for stealing the attention from this nice little picture. Check it out ... my humble opinion about To Die For = 8,5 / 10
