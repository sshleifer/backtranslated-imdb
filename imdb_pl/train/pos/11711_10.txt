The story of Mrs. Patty Duke about her life and struggles with manic depression was like my life struggles. I saw myself playing like her. I was so amazed by the similarities in our lives that I included sexual abuse, which we both experienced as children. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie when it first premiered in 1990 and I loved this movie so much. Anyone who has struggled with manic depression can get so much from this movie. It does not matter if she showed her rewards or why. There is no problem here. The problem is, how Mrs. Duke had a disease and fought for her survival and defeat. Ms. Duke can boast of her achievements in the fight for the survival of the disease, which often leaves many victims without hope. <br /> <br /> Unless a person has struggled with this disease personally, they do not know what the hell they have to live with. The film was a success for me because it showed real problems and how a person with depression and mania. It was so real ... so real. It was like watching there on the screen. <br /> <br /> I would like to thank Mrs. Patty Duke personally for the courage to inform the public about her illness. Bock
