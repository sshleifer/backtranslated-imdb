People do not understand this film because it is not the beginning, the middle and the end, it's just a conclusion from 26 episodes of a long television series. So remember this when you all talk about how the world has not been studied enough. All this was done in a television program. <br /> <br /> As stunning and stunning as the visuals, I think the quarrel *** SPOILERS *** between Lian-Chu and Gwizdo at the end of the movie was what really made me love this movie. Seeing the characters I followed for 26 episodes, such a struggle was painful, and seeing Gwizdo walking sadly beside him among the floating ruins, while Lian-Chu sharpened his blade, he almost tears. <br /> <br /> Then we had a complete contrast with Lian-Chu fighting with these insanely amazing dragons (which was previously featured in the series), while Gwizdo mumble madly and indirectly threatening to kill Zoe. * Shudder * I am surprised that this particular scene has not been mentioned in the warnings. Any kid who has a bit of judgment will be able to see that Gwizdo was not himself and was completely strangled to strangle this little girl. It was enough to disturb me and I'm 15 years old. <br /> <br /> The world is amazing, the plot is much better than most multi-million hits, and it was a nice way to watch some of my favorite characters going. Check it out. :)
