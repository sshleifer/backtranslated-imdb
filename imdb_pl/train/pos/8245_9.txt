Even without a word, Billy Connely is wonderful as a zombie ... Carrie Ann Moss as "Mama"? Zombie girls? <br /> <br /> "... My father wanted to eat me ... I never tried to eat Timmy." <br /> <br /> And I thought Dawn of the Dead was good. It's a bit like Airplane meets (meats?) Night of the Living Dead, sponsored by Zomcom .. <br /> <br /> And do not forget about my head coffin <br /> <br /> And Fido in Aloha shirt is after Just cool! <br /> <br /> And yes, social comment is too great to even start commenting. <br /> <br /> Suffice to say it, it all really works!
