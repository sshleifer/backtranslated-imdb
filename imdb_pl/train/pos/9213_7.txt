Gómez Pereira is responsible for one of the most despicable comedies of the latest Spanish cinema (just look at his biography), so I did not expect so much from "Cosas Que Hacen ..." ... In fact, I do not know why in the world I decided to go view. In any case, that's what I did ... And what a surprise. It seems that Gómez Pereira has finally matured, and now he is able to make a good movie. He's been dealing with the middle-aged crisis, disappointment and looking for a second chance after you destroyed everything. The last half hour of the film (the more dramatic) is the best part and it's just worth watching the movie. The main role is also played by Eduard Fernandez, and I still think that he is the best actor of his generation (definitely). <br /> <br /> * My rating: 7/10
