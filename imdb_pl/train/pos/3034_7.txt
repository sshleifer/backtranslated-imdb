An underestimated addition to the Graham Greene film canon - its perceived errors can now be seen as advantages. Director Shumlin, a theater director, frames his action with oppressive stiffness appropriate to the material and seemingly inept compositions that convincingly suggest anxiety. Both the dark thriller and the story of moral regeneration (for a female character! In the 1940s thriller!), The film has a simple hero who is crazy and murderous (and perhaps a pedophile), perfectly brings the distant ideologies of the Spanish Civil War into a shocking dangerous reality, it has a frightening murder, an amazing look at class and capitalism, clever theatrical metaphors, a rare approximation of Greene's God and an ending that is happy if you do not know anything about history.
