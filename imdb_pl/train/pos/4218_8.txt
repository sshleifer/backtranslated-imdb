I really did not see too many Columbo movies ... actually, I think I only watched one or two, except this one. However, I have always liked Columbo without seeing him so much. Peter Falk is and has always been an ideal choice for the character because of his appearance, voice and charm. An excellent proof of this is that although the series began in 1968, the newest (and probably not last) film was made in 2003. It's 35 years. And Falk was 40 years old when he did first. The series consists of 68 films (unless my number is off), all of which are intended for television. Everyone knows the character, although no one has ever seen a movie with his participation in the cinema. It's a pretty good achievement if you ask me about it. The plot is quite good. The only problem I have with this is that the killer and murder are revealed at the very beginning (though it may be the same for all Columbo movies), leaving no secret, but how Columbo solves it, making it somewhat boring (because At the end of the movie, I can not wait. The pace is good, it's hard to get bored, the acting is very good, especially Falk and Ruth Gordon They have a great exchange of dialogues in the movie The characters are well-written and reliable The dialog and script are extremely good for In conclusion, the film is, yes, surprisingly good for the TV movie and definitely worth watching for every Columbo fan and / or crime fiction / secrets.
