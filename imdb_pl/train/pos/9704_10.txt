I can not believe it's been ten years since this program was broadcast for the first time on TV and delighted viewers with a unique mix of comedy and horror. This is a program that spawned a good part of modern British humor: The House of Horrible Dr. Terrible; Dark Gartha Marenghi's; The Mighty Boosh; Snuffbox. Many have imitated the style of this program and I do not deny that some have exceeded its quality. But Jermy Dyson deserves to start this trend, with the actors Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith. <br /> <br /> Together they created Royston Vasey, a sinister town in idyllic England where unsuspecting tourists and passers-by meet an obsessive couple who want to keep the city in place and free from strangers; where the unemployed are abused and abused at the employment office; where the farmer uses real people as scarecrows; where the vet kills all the animals he is trying to heal; where a gypsy circus kidnaps people; and where the butcher adds something secret but irresistible to food to accost people. <br /> <br /> It's just a breath of what the viewer can find in The League of Gentlemen. The three actors themselves give birth to dozens and dozens of exceptional characters. Makeup and prosthetics are so good that I thought I was watching a lot more actors than it was. But it's also great acting: the way they change their voices and body movements actually become other people. <br /> <br /> Most jokes start with something ordinary, from real life, and then break into something disturbing, sometimes jerking. Sometimes it is a pure horror without configuration, as in the form of Papa Lazarou. Imagine a terrifying circus owner who jumps into someone's home and kidnaps a woman to become his wife. No explanation was given. It's so scary. There are also numerous references to horror movies: Se7en, The Silence of the Lambs, Nosferatu, The Exorcist, etc. <br /> <br /> Horror fans will love it, comedy fans will love it. As every traveler knows, there is an inscription "Welcome to Royston Vasey: You'll Never Leave". All viewers who give this program agree. When you discover The League of Gentlemen, you'll never want anything else, you'll never forget.
