Perhaps there is a special reason why The Fox and the Child hit my special note. Saying goodbye to my new fiancee - oh ... one day - for an unknown period of time, I was a little overwhelmed by emotions and suffered from the rainfall on my face that she had to see. /> <br /> I watched a few films and TV shows, but my interest broke away from what I left, what is there and what I have not seen. For this purpose, I have this movie to thank. <br /> <br /> Being a nature lover and hearing about the film before, I was sure that I would like it anyway. But I did not like it, I loved it. <br /> <br /> Technical mastery is amazing. How did they do it? How did they capture animals in the way they did? It's just wonderful. <br /> <br /> The moral of this story is good and although the ending is so French and ambiguous, it is happy / sad. I was a little surprised again. As a man who usually retains his emotions for himself, the ending was difficult when he was on a plane full of people I saw for the next 15 hours! Maybe because the ending made me return to what I left. <br /> <br /> But for those few hours on the plane I was happy to see something new and original. And this is life. Sure, there are things that you love and feel comfortable ... but there are many secrets outside. So next time I will see something extraordinary when I am in an open space; I intend to examine, observe and embrace it. This is exactly what's going on in this movie and that's exactly what you should do with this damned good movie / nature. 8/10 <br /> <br /> P.S. Two months have passed since traveling by plane. We still do not know when we'll see each other again, but we will.
