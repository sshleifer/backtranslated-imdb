There is nothing terrible in a modern "horror film", which is an insult to the word "horror". Freddie Vs Jason, Scream movies, Cabin Trash, and especially Stephen King's infantile rehearsals - he rewrote every story from The Monkey's Paw to anything, often in the same story - with horror both in writing and in the movie (except for Kubrick's The Shining, what was really frightening, unlike King's books, which are just as scary as my big toe - the left one who still has a nail. <br /> <br /> But a woman in black is a rare modern movie that will make that the hair on the neck is at the end, it should be done, the director creates tension, and the most terrible ghost he has ever seen when he suddenly appears, standing motionless somewhere with such an amazing look Then he brings it all to a ghastly ending, he learned lessons from masters who could create a horror movie - Val Lewton (original Cat People) and Robert Wise (student Val Lewton and director The H aunting and The Body Snatcher), Jacques Tou rnier (another student of Val Lewton, who directed a really scary movie about zombies, not the junk that Raimi did (gross is not terrifying, people are just disgusting), and Lewis Allen (The Uninvited) and of course Jack Clayton turns on Henry James The Innocents and the way a suspect master, Hitchcock, can still lead you to the edge of your place, even in the case of a slowly-building and burning period like Under Capricorn. <br /> <br /> TEN STARS ....
