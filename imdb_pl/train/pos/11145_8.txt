After racism, the exodus in the countryside - also known as migration from the country - is another socio-political issue of the sixties. WestSide Story dealt with racism through a love feast in an artistic perspective. Now, the Cowboy at midnight deals with the rural exodus through the tragedy of friendship in psychological terms. It is deeply painful that we are witnessing one of the two companions of fate. <br /> <br /> Director John Schlesinger skilfully provides us with the deepest secret thoughts, dreams, fantasies, fears and assessments of two New York scum. While handsome Joe Buck (Voight) dreams of all the beautiful women of the world begging him to share the fantasy of wild love, poor Ratso Rizzo (Hoffman) dreams of a better and healthier life in clean and sunny Florida. Therefore, Joe becomes a hustler to transform his fantasies into reality; and Ratso becomes a kidnapper to collect enough money to migrate to Florida. In addition, Ratso helps Joe find a way to do whatever he can. They begin to share everything in life. They share food, share medicine, share an uninhabited home, share wages and share their destiny. Unfortunately, as the story unfolds, Joe realizes that being handsome is not the only thing that makes all beautiful women plead for him to have fun; and Ratso can not see Florida because his heart is failing to overcome his illness while he was on the bus, taking him there. <br /> <br /> Power is always right, and weak is not right in daylight. Hence, "Midnight" gives a real picture. <br /> <br /> Despite the tragedy, there is no melodrama in the Midnight Cowboy. Every aspect of each character is the reality of the poor who bear the inevitable fate. Thanks to this Midnight Cowboy is a provocative look at the socio-political problem, an exodus in the countryside.
