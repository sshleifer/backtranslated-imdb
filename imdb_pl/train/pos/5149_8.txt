It is a warm documentary drama that does not cover the new ground, transforms all cliches and is messy with facts. For example, Munich is a very flat city. Why is the film hilly? For example, the end of the Great War in 1918. It was not a surrender, but a ceasefire. However, this is announced as surrender. For example, European news providers do not shout (and not) on newspaper headlines when they grunt their papers. However, this strictly American custom is used in the film. The Nazis, for example, did not receive the German eagle until they took over, but it is there on the desktop when Hitler supplies one of his home winders. Indeed, the majority of this disappointing production is not much more than the Nazi oratory. The film also preserves the myth that the putsch in the beer hall came to life in the Munich Hoffbrauhaus. There was no. Robert Carlyle presents his subject great. But his cast is, at best, sufficient, and often not even. These comments are based only on the first episode. You can only hope that the second one will be better, but do not bet on it.
