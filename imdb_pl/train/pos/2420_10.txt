If you like the subtle (yes, I said subtle) actions and reactions of John Candy, you can not help but like the film (pronounced "fillum" by Salvatore DiPasquale). An inattentive (and uninformed) observer always perceived Candy as a broad actor - a great buffoon. And sometimes it was (see "Stripes" and "Splash"). But when he has the opportunity, he can be really sharp and subtle. It is a pity that he was cast in so many roles that only showed his broad side, because we will never see more. Oh, yes, the movie. Over and over you can watch "Going Berserk" (I know that I have) with the frequency "Caddyshack". It is simply good. The plot, though a bit intricate, is actually quite deep for a farce of this kind. This allows Candy and always underestimated Joe Flaherty and Eugene Levy to bounce off Candy ... and HARDS are reflected. It is definitely worth a look at anyone who liked other SCTV or Candy works.
