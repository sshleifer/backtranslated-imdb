The first episode I saw in Lost made me think, I thought, people who crashed and were chased by a giant monster. But it is not so much more, because it is not a monster, and every episode you see in Lost is getting better and better. a deserted island with an underground bunker, especially a connection between people who crossed each other before they crashed. This is the real secret. <br /> <br /> The rules of this series and I can not wait to find out what's really going on. I hope that they will not release the last two episodes in cinemas, this series deserves 9 out of 10
