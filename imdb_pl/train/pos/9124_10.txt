Bar some dubious acting (there are musicians at the end of the day), in Quentin Tarrinno's words "The best rock movie ever made ... period" <br /> <br /> Think 8 Mile, no rap - a young musician trying to prove to the local community, while fighting against a broken home and a rival team. Cast in interest in sex and really special performances, this is a real 8 miles. <br /> <br /> The prince provides solid performances, just like Morris Day and Jerome Benton. A decent scenario, good direction, great plot and spectacular performances. Not forgetting the best rock / pop / funk music you will ever hear.
