Absolutely a genius show. The second season began where the first one ended, with a big secret. Suspension for the most part, if not all episodes and secrets everywhere. One that made me think and think again. It's really amazing how a writer can come out with all the connections and connect all the characters together and combine all of these elements to make the characters' lives so significant. Never disappoint and wait for the new season. I hope that more secrets will be revealed, and at the same time more secrets to solve. A good cast selection for this concert also fits the character perfectly. I really can not wait to finally discover the secret. I hope that all this noise will not break the end.
