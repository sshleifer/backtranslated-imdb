I have read the book and I must say that this film remains faithful to form. I think that this is the beginning of psychological thrillers in the same genre Psycho. Cristina Raines gives an excellent performance as a host, and Burgess Meredith gives an excellent supporting actor. I have seen this film at least twice and I think I will buy both a book and a movie for my collection. The tension builds up to a climatic end, a twist you will never see. If you like movies like Signs and The Village, Sentinel will be a classic prelude. Actors in the movie are also interesting - you would not recognize them if you did not read the subtitles. The late Jerry Orbach is great as a commercial director, and Jeff Goldblum is perfect as a photographer. There is also Beverly D'Angelo, who is unappreciated, but great.
