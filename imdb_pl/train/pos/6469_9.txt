This is a really great shortcut from Hal Roach. This is due to two main reasons: the youngest children in the short term are among the sweetest ever in the film, and the story has many fun and well-written elements. <br /> <br /> As for the smallest of the Little Rascals, to be honest I can not think of a prettier child than Spanky about four years old. Although he was a rather plump and unattractive child in later years, he was simply valuable here. And the placement of a small little boy responsible for looking after the children of even younger children was not only fun, but once again highly appreciated. <br /> <br /> After the older children blackmail Spanky to do this horrible job, all kinds of funny chaos are falling apart. Gags are quite effective and well done at this time - with accidental cranking of the murder and the last scene in which Spanky FINALLY gains control over the youngest ones who are the most memorable. I have not seen these films for many decades and I'm happy that I gave this opportunity.
