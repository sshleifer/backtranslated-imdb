I really liked this version of Emma. Kate beckinsale was amazing because Emma and Mark Strong were very good as chivalrous. the only complaint I had was about Mr. Woodhouse ... I can not believe that a man could moan so much or be so selfish in his daughter's life ... after all, she was a smart girl. as always, I love the places where Jane Austin movies were made. the settings are so spectacular. makes me want to visit England as much as Ireland and Scotland). I think the actors chosen for this movie were also a good choice and all other fictional lines were intertwined with the best Emma! I'm glad that I could also see this one.
