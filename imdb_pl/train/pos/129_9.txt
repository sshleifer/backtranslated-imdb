Thanks to the amazing photos and plot of the Cafeteria absurd, this movie brought me out of a simple but fascinating initial scene. The movie plays like a dream and I think that maybe because people either hate it or love it. Characters are drawn superficially, and the story itself is small and maybe a bit pointless. But these are the disadvantages of the film, but conscious choices. The film does not try to work as a story, but rather is a deconstruction of war movies from the 1940s. <br /> <br /> I would have trouble arguing that the movie was really real, but the movie is such a wonderful movie that I was completely swept away. This is one of the most beautifully made films in history, and its style has a wild imagination. I can totally understand why people hate him, but I give it 9/10.
