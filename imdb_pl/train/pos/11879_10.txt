This is one of my favorite games. <br /> <br /> If the film has a defect, it is that it comes to you like a mad bull. It does not involve the viewer as much as attacking him. Scarface is as voracious and relentless as Tony Montana himself. Nothing remains in the viewer's imagination. <br /> <br /> Lazy Morper's synthpop fits the action. Like the refrain in a Greek tragedy, he fails and grinds, hugs and tugs, a constant reminder of Tony's unrelenting fate. <br /> <br /> Not so much the story of caution, what the disaster is in progress, "Scarface" is torn on the screen with the unstoppable force of the escaping train.
