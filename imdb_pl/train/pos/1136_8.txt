I'm not sure if this comment contains a real spoiler, but I play it safely, so do not read it if you have not seen the movie. <br /> <br /> I love this movie and just like everyone I work with - and that's it. I spent a large part of my professional life in the cinema without being an actor. Such people are _sung_ heroes of this movie: gafers, pullers, directors on air, lighters and writers, costume people, etc. And the whole thing is told from their point of view, at least to a great degree. Most of the actors are crazy and absorbed in each other to the extent that it's absurd to make this movie so false, but you had to work with actors to recognize that this movie is a real drama! A possible spoiler warning: in one magnificent scene, two guides, both actors, are _discussive, like _dyscuss_ something personal, something completely "out of place", with another actor, and start to think up lines, try and criticize the other person's performance. <br /> <br /> Since the appearance of this movie in 1991 it has become fashionable, especially on television. But hardly anyone did it so well.
