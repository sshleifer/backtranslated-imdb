"May contain Spoilery * <br /> <br />" All dogs are going to heaven "is a great movie. I saw him in 1989 when I was two years old. I did not understand it well, but as I've seen, I've started to love it more and more, I love songs from this movie, and my favorite songs are "Let Me Be Surprised" and "Soon You'll Come Home". These are beautiful songs. the film is Charlie dieing. When I was little, my sister could not even see the part. Besides, this movie is wonderful. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the movie is that Annabelle and Charlie are flying around Heaven is beautiful in the movie, and the "clocks" are very clever. I also love Itching, in fact I have 3 own dachshunds. They are so cute. <br /> <br /> Overall, I love this movie and suggest that everyone see it.
