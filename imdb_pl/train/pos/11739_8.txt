"Elvira, Mistress Of The Dark" is a genus of "Harper Valley P.T.A." with the supernatural accents. Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) leaves her job as a TV horror hostess after the owner of the new station gets fresh. He now relies on a show in Las Vegas to do it, but learns he has to come up with more money to start. Things seem hopeless until he receives notification of his aunt's death, which then takes Elvira to Massachusetts to read the will. A house that needs refurbishment, a dog and a cookbook is all that's left of her aunt, and again it seems that Elvira has problems with inventing money for a show in Las Vegas. Adults from a small and narrow town make the situation worse, making it difficult for Elvira. Only the local hunk (Daniel Greene) and a group of teenagers make friends with her. Uncle Elvira "Vinnie" (W. Morgan Sheppard), pushes to conclude a contract with Elvira on a cookbook, but Elvira soon learns about her powerful heritage, which includes spell casting and some very effective casseroles. Elvira does not want to sell his cook's book to his uncle, but he is determined to get it, knowing its power. Then Elvira comes face to face with an old plea of ​​sorcery burned at the stake and a clash between her and her uncle. The plot is quite simple, but humor and well-developed characters make it move at a nice pace. "Elvira, Mistress Of The Dark" is full of sweet, rude, lewd and clever humor carried by many gags, puns, props, songs and parody. The touch of occultism makes it one of the best horror parodies ever made. It is a well made film with a great performance by all performers; including Edie McClurg and Jeff Conaway (from "Grease"). There are also nice special effects. Many people (including me) wondered if the character Elvira could wear a feature film, and the answer is cute, YES!
