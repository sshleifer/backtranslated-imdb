I really liked this movie. It took a rather dark story - Shakespeare's Macbeth - and wrapped it in a bizarre, often funny and moving modern yarn. <br /> <br /> Kudos to the way the filmmaker brought the very different worlds of modern New York and Macbeth Scotland together under one roof. Opposite worlds are trying to emphasize the intrigue and comedy of the game and you have to love Harold Perrineau as a choir, a part that does not exist in art, but really helps in jazz things up. The ending stands out among the small indies that I saw for its closure and originality.
