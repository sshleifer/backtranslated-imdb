This is the second movie that I have seen Ida Lupino as a director after the 53rd hitchhiking. I think this movie was better than this one. She has a girlfriend who is about to get married and then gets sexually assaulted and does not like everyone who talks about her, so she escapes and is taken away by her family. I think the review by Leonard Maltina is right only to give him 2 and a half stars.
