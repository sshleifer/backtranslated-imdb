Great action from Gretchen Mol. This movie is one of the best biopsies that will appear on the screen in a while. Although it covers most of Bettie's young life, he manages to stay on the mostly focused path that most biographical films lack. There is a charming and disturbingly funny subtext in dialogue and acting. This movie is a great break from Dira. "American Psycho" and I think it will manifest itself as her best work so far. Oh, and as a lover of cinematography, I give this film 100% in the film. It was amazing how well the look of the 1950s made with modern films. He praises D.O.P. Everything around is very pleasant. I recommend to all interested people to see it: 8/10.
