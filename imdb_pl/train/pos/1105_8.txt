Manhattan residents have to endure all kinds of inconvenience. The worst is the lack of wardrobe space! Some people who eat all the time, use their range and dishwasher as storage space, because the wardrobes are full! The novel of Eric Hodgins, whose hero, Jim Blandings, can not stand this narrow apartment, in which he and his wife Muriel and two daughters must share. <br /> <br /> Jim Blandings, Madison Ave. The executive director did it! When he sees the advertisement of the Connecticut apartment, he decides to take a look. Of course, the first owner, Jim, is deceived by a real man from buying a destroyed house, which is taken unscrupulously by an unscrupulous agent. This is just the beginning of his problems. <br /> <br /> Whatever may be wrong, it goes wrong. The architect is asked to develop a plan that does not work in the new home after the initial equalization. Because one problem leads to another, more money is needed, and whatever it was supposed to be at the original expense ends with an overstated price that Jim could not afford. <br /> <br /> The movie is funny because of three directors. Cary Grant was an actor who clearly understood the character he plays and makes the most of Jim Blandings. Myrna Loy was a delightful actress who always played with Grant. The third character, Bill Cole, an old boy of Myrna, turned into a Blandings lawyer, is polite and bonbon, as Melvin Douglas introduced him. One of the Blandings girls, Joan, plays Sharyn Moffett, who was amazingly similar to Eva Marie Saint. Great Louise Beavers Gussie game, but there is not much to do. <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully photographed by James Wong Howe, who clearly knew what to do to make the film look much better. Direction of H.C. Potter is light and has succeeded in this film that will delight fans of classic comedies.
