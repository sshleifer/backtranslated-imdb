I've always liked this great baseball movie! He has a good cast, including two amazing actors and two of my favorites Danny Glover and Christopher Lloyd! This film also includes Ben Johnson, Brenda Fricker, Big Tony Longo, Tony Danza and Matthew McConaughey! Also Jay O. Sanders and Dermot Mulroney! The film has great special effects and works from all movie actors! Baseball scenes are realistic! The music of composer Randy Edelman is very good and fits the film very well! Some of the actors who reminded me of real baseball personalities. Ray Mitchell from Stoney Jackson reminded me of Royce Clayton, McConaughey reminded me of Steve Finley, and commentator Jay O. Sanders in my opinion resembled today's Al Hrabosky. This is a fantastic movie for fans and not Baseball and I definitely recommend this movie!
