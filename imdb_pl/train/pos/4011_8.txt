After SuperFriends and Scooby Doo left Saturday's morning radio waves in the fall of 1986, I stopped watching morning mornings on Saturday because they were the only two who kept me in the mood. It seemed very promising, "I withdrew" and started to sleep on Saturday mornings. I did not return to TV on Saturday until 1988. For this one year only for one and only one animated program. <br /> <br /> The new animated Superman series was something that I did not intend to pass out. I was 17 years old and I was in high school, but so what! I loved this program. From what I remember, this series was a gift for fans, I suppose, during the celebrations of Superman's 50th birthday this year. He had leading music and a musical style reminiscent of music for the movie of John Williams from the films of Richard Donner / Christopher Reeve Superman. Honestly, I felt that the Ruby Spears animation style was similar to the Super Powers Team series: the Galactic Guardians series by Hanna Barbera a few years earlier. Unfortunately, Danny Dark did not return as Superman, but I felt that Beau Weaver did a very impressive job, because Superman's and Clark Kent's voice was as nervous as Chris Reeve's version. After listening to him as Reed Richards / Mr. Fantastic on the fantastic fours' 90s, I still saw this version of Superman in my head. Ginny McSwain as Lois Lane. LOL! What a rhyme. She was the voice director for Hanna Barber and Ruby Spears, and I suppose she took on Lois. The memories of SuperFriends remained in this series when it came to the cast over the cast. Jimmy Olsen is Mark Taylor, who was previously Firestorm at SuperFriends. Perry White is none other than ex-writer Batman TV Stanley Ralph Ross, who in SuperFriends was Gorilla Grodd and Brainiac in Super Powers. And Lex Luthor, now a smart billionaire tycoon, is none other than SuperFriends singer, Michael Bell, whom I know best as Zan and Zagadka, and many other characters from many other series. <br /> <br /> I felt that this series was a combination of Superman and John Byrne after the Superman crisis, with Lex Luthor as the billionaire mogul, Jonathan and Marta Kent, who live to see Clark as Superman. Bruce Timm and Lois and Clark will also do it. Unfortunately, we have never seen Brainiac, Bizarro, Toyman, Metallo or Darkseid. In addition to Luthor, we only saw Prankster and we saw General Zoda. I especially liked this one episode from Wonder Woman, which was expressed by BJ Warda, who also played it in the Super Powers Team. <br /> <br /> The episodes were devastating and I liked the stories of Clark's development and development, from childhood to childhood and adolescence, to an adult male moving to Metropolis in a short segment, Superman's Family Album. <br /> <br /> The only two things I did not like. Only one season lasted. And after the guest spot Wonder Woman, I hoped that Batman would appear with the voice given by Adam West. I also counted on this because in the episode of Prankster the Metropolis baseball team fought against Gotham Goliaths. <br /> <br /> Each popular Super Hero has one cartoon series that is extremely rare. For SpiderMan, I think it is a solo series from 1981 that was broadcast at the same time as Amazing Friends. For the Incredible Hulk, this is a cartoon from 1982. For Fantastic Four, it's a 1978 series from HERBIE the Robot. For Batman, it's New Adventures of Batman 1977 Filmation with BatMite. But for Superman the series is the rarest. <br /> <br /> Superman books and documentaries never include or mention it. This is the next series that WB should consider when publishing a DVD. In conclusion, the superman version from 1988 is well .... Super !!
