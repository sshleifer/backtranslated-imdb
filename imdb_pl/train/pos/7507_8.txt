Greetings from the dark again. Mary Heron collects quite a few films that give an insight into their specific era. Her previous "I Shot Andy Warhol" and "American Psycho" were the best, commenting on the society's quirkiness during this period. Although "The Notorious Bettie Page" is of course related to Mrs Page, it is just the same as the curtain in the world of perverse photo shoots in the 1950s. <br /> <br /> The movie is cool to watch from both the story's perspective and the technical aspect of the way it was filmed and submitted. Grainy black and white film and photos capture time, and the introduction of color in Miami Beach through Bunny Yeager's photos is very well done. <br /> <br /> The support cast is strong with David Strathairn (freshly released Edward R, Role Murrow), Chris Bauer (as Irving Klaw) and Lili Taylor. The film's star is the wonderfully talented and underestimated Gretchen Mol. Ms. Mol always brings an advantage and spirit to her role. She was absolutely hypnotizing in a small vision, Jason Alexander directed "Just Looking" in 2000. Here is the notorious Bettie Page. Her smile is captivating and her body is impeccable. It seems that she really enjoys this role and helps us understand how a girl from the Tennessee neighborhood can become the queen of the Pin-up underground. <br /> <br /> As you might expect, the soundtrack from the era is great. Patsy Cline and Peggy Lee are just two of the awarded artists. Although the movie suggests that history is about to appear in this industry, the last third of them does not allow the magic of pure film. But the magic of Gretchen Mol and Bettie Page makes it a fun movie to watch and one that will bring endless shows to HBO in the near future. Can anyone now turn Mrs. Mol into the star she should be?
