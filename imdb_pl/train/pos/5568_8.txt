Cheech's and Chong's typical buzzing, which includes drugs, singing, more drugs, cars and drivers, even more drugs, Pee Wee, aliens, gasoline, laundry, stand up comedy, surprisingly more drugs and KOSM. It is not as consistent or credible as "Up in Smoke", but it is still incredibly funny without becoming as weird as "Nice Dreams". There are several classic scenes, including an opening scene in which they get some gas for the car and drive to work. Cheech's song (Mexican Americans) and Chong's song are also funny. Another scene worth noting is the scene with a social welfare office with Jones (a machine for human noise), from the Police Academy series and an old laughing man. All in all, this is a great continuation of Up in Smoke and is quite visible when it is sober or not. <br /> <br /> -Celluloid Rehab
