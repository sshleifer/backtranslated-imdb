At the beginning you think about another Disney movie, it can be good, but it's a movie for children. But when you watch it, you can not help yourself to enjoy it. All ages will love this movie. I saw this movie for the first time when I was 10 and now 8 years later I still love it! Danny Glover is excellent and he could not play the role better. Christopher Lloyd is funny and ideally suited to the role. Tony Danza is as trustworthy as Mel Clark. You can not help but enjoy this movie! I give it 10/10!
