A young woman comes to her husband's home after he died in an accident. He barely settles down in this small town, but soon after he loses his little son in the abduction and all his hopes ... It can lead to all sorts of plots in a normal movie: find a new partner and be happy; or enough depressed to fight and finally kill himself ... Trying to kill himself, but not after a series of hard fights with God. He trusts God, but it turns out that God seems to forgive everyone, even the killers. Well, I should consider God here, the film does not mean anything against God. The way in which the film deals with this issue is quite interesting: not from the point of view of a woman or from the perspective of God (in this way, there will be a lot of grass, clouds suppose views). Rather, it is the eye of a third person, the film allows us to see and does not explain anything. <br /> <br /> The movie would not be so interesting if it was just a woman. There is this man who is all around the woman and of course in love with her, but in his own way. He is a funny guy, like a clown who I should say who shamelessly revolves around our heroine. The combination of these two, a woman full of tension, crying and always throwing herself, and the man, smiling and stupidly speaking, ends with a good balance of emotions: nothing absurdly wrong or too boring. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it.
