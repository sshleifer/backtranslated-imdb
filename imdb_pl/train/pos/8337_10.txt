Being a big fan of the genre of romantic comedy, and therefore seeing a large number of these films, it is rare for me to consider me completely unique. For this reason, it is also rare for me to catch my breath through laughter during a few scenes. The love story is a little skinny on earth, but I would say it's probably the best, because this romantic comedy puts the emphasis on "comedy", and in any case exceeds the limits of credibility only a bit. I like the majority of Romani comics. Four scientists have presented the funniest moments not only in this film, but in every movie that I've seen for a long time. I hesitated for a moment before I finally chose "10" over "9" as a rating, because I think too many people use it uncritically, so the maximum rating loses some of its impact. I'm also a big fan of Meg Ryan, which helps, but it's one of the few movies I've seen in which I'd say it's completely dim. She and Tim Robbins are cast in the lead role, but for me they play a second violin with the antics of inept intellectuals. A real movie type laugh.
