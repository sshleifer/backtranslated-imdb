This concert started with great mysterious episodes. I think everyone is in the first 15 or 16 episodes. Then the show started playing short episodes with Shaggy, Scooby doo and Scrappy doo. <br /> <br /> I think that Hanna Barbera Productions had to change the 20-minute episodes for short episodes. Some of the voice actors have become unavailable. After 15 or 16 episodes, Frank Welker (who played Fred) became unavailable. I think that Velma's voice changes after the first 12 episodes, because the first voice actress who played in Velma was unavailable. <br /> <br /> And the network ordered Hanna Barber's studio to do more movies with Shaggy, Scooby doo and Scrappy doo, because the ratings were high. So they had to do more shorts. I would like them to be secrets like 15 episodes. It is still a good program.
