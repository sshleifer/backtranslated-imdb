Just Cause takes some of the best fragments of three films, Cape Fear, A Touch of Evil and Silence of the Lambs, and combines them together to create a good movie thriller. <br /> <br /> Sean Connery is a professor of liberal law, married to former assistant district attorney Kate Capshaw and is a crusader against the death penalty. Grandfather Blair Underwood, Ruby Dee, at the hole in the conference and convinces him to deal with the appeal of her grandson. He is sitting on the death row for the murder of a young girl. <br /> <br /> When Connery arrives in this rural county in Florida, he fights the hard sheriff played by Laurence Fishburne, who is as ruthless in solving crimes as Orson Welles was in touch with evil. <br /> <br /> Later, after Connery dismissed the verdict along with the evidence he discovered, he feels quite good with himself. At this point, the film makes a definite change from Touch of Evil to Cape Fear. <br /> <br /> To say that everything is not what it seems is to put it mildly. The cast uniformly changes into good performances. Particularly noteworthy is Ed Harris, who plays Underground in the serial killer Hannibal Lecter. It will make your skin crawl and begin to make Connery rethink some of the convenient liberal premises on which he bases his beliefs. Many confirmed liberals whom I knew became completely different when they were victims of crime. <br /> <br /> Of course, the opposite. Many conservatives of law and order, if they ever get involved at the wrong end of the justice system, want to be sure that all his rights are really guaranteed. <br /> <br /> Criminal justice is not the end but a process and never ending for the whole society. I'm guessing that if Just Cause has a moral, it probably will.
