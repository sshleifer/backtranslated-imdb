The alternative title of Ecstasy is Symphony of Love; title that appropriately describes the mood and style of the film. Ecstasy is an early talkie that could be a classic movie if it is released in the era of a silent movie. This film is a visual feast and is intentionally wandered so that the viewer can enjoy his sensual lyrical quality, which is presented in an artistic, low tone. The director's style is clearly European. The subject matter and approach to sexuality were much more sophisticated than what was produced in Hollywood at the time. Consider the US censorship code in the 1930s, which sums up. Hedy Lamarr, one of the great beauties of all times, was the perfect choice for this "Symphony of Love".
