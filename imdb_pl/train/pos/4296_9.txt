This would be my number one movie in 1991, except that he was beaten by the brilliant JFK. It's such a great movie! I love it. I love stories in which the lives of different characters intersect with others and how to deal with their lives. Kevin Kline is good here, but dimmed by Danny Glover, especially Steve Martin. I've never liked Martin or his style, but he's great here. I loved the whole speech Kline gave at the end of the Grand Canyon. Writing was perfect. Larry Kasdan is, IMO, a great dialogue writer, like Kevin Smith and Quentin Tarantino. Here he created a few three-dimensional characters and well-thought-out stories and messages that give positive feelings in our lives. A really great movie. 4 out of 4 stars
