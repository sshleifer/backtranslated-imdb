I love this program, and my 11-year-old daughter and I LOVE it together. It teaches good, old-fashioned values ​​in a fun, adventure and fun way (albeit with a relatively predictable story most of the time). It's also fun to joke ... you know, scrolling and inserting your own dialog instead of actors. <br /> <br /> I have my recorder set to record all episodes and it happened to me to catch the final episode (just before the next one, starting ... so I do not know what episode it was), but it was totally ANAVIOUS sequencing error! Adam handed the sheriff's coffee a small sample of the "skin" that had been torn out of some cloak of the outlaws when he tried to get out, I suppose. <br /> <br /> Well, Roy just had this coat put it on the desk and put the sample exactly where it was torn off. The sample was EXACTLY rectangular ... which, I think, would be almost impossible to tear out of a piece of leather (Naugahyde from the 1950s? Yes, leather? I do not think so). Well, the sample was perfectly arranged and the mystery was solved. <br /> <br /> Less than 10 seconds later, in the scene, we see the coat again, still lying on Roy's desk. But this time the sample is more similar to the shape of North Carolina and is now COMPLETELY different in the coat (but still perfectly matched to the hole in the coat) and the seam (which was struck in the middle of the sample) is gone ... like the seam in coat. My daughter enjoyed good laughter when we played this short scene over and over again! It's a great idea for youtube, I'm telling you! <br /> <br /> But we still love the program, and sequencing errors make it a great fun!
