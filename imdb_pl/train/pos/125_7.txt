Lars Von Trier never tries to try new techniques. Some of them are very original, while others are best forgotten. <br /> <br /> He presents post-war Germany as a nightmarish journey by train. Leo Kessler, a young American of German descent, has so many cities in ruins that he feels obliged to help them in their reconstruction. This is not a simple task, because it quickly finds out. <br /> <br /> His uncle finds a job as a night conductor on the Zentropa railway line. His task is to meet the needs of passengers. When the shoes are polished, a chalk mark is made on the soles. A terrible argument arises when the passenger's shoes are not chalked, even though they have been polished. There are many allusions to the German fanaticism of attachment to such stupid details. <br /> <br /> The journey by train is like an allegory that represents the procession of a person throughout his life with all his trials and torments. In one sequence Leo runs through the rear carriages to discover that they are filled with half-starved bodies that have just escaped from Auschwitz. These terrible images are as fleeting as in a dream, each with its own terrible blow, but unconnected. <br /> <br /> At the station called Urmitz Leo, he jumps from a train with a sprayed bomb. Due to the many observers, he combines the bomb on the underside of the wagon. He returns to his cabin and joins the time clock. Later he jumps from the train (at high speed) and lies in the cool grass on the river bank. Looking at the stars above, he decides that his task is to build, not destroy. Then, when he sees a train approaching a giant bridge, he runs with breakneck speed to get on the train and stop the clock. If you want to analyze the situation, it is a completely impossible task. Pretty funny. This can only happen in a dream. <br /> <br /> It is strange that you remember small details, such as a row of mugs hanging on hooks and rattling a rocking train. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that this film is widely appreciated, I prefer the later films of Lars Von Trier (Breaking the Waves and The Idiots). The bomb scene described above has really discouraged me. Perhaps I am a realist.
