Probably the best movie of the year for me. This small French film focuses on the placement of Carli's office secretary (Emmanuelle Devos), who spends her days doing other men's jobs, unclassified, and being the source of their scornful and spirited conversation that is too clear to her because she is partly deaf reading her lips . The change is implemented when he employs the newly released conditional Paula (Vincent Cassel) as her assistant. The relationship that develops between them is the center of the movie. Mutual dependence, for very different reasons, binds them. Carla is attracted by Pawe≈Ç and the fact that he makes her feel attractive, as it seems, for the first time. Paul is doing nothing to dispel her feelings because he needs her help. He owes money to the local gangster and creates a theft plan that will require Carlas's reading skills. I think the main thing that shifts the film above the average suspense / drama is the amazing chemistry between the two stars. Throughout the movie, no matter what other characters are on screen, you can feel this incredible bond between Carla and Paul. I do not remember when I witnessed such sexual chemistry between two actors. Emmanuell Devos gives a great performance (she won the French Cesar for the best actress). You never feel that you're watching a bit of acting, it really is Carla. Chameleon like Vincent Cassel is also great. It makes it a bit unattractive, both appealing and attractive. I loved this movie because of these two people and every time I watched it, I wanted to go back to the cinema and get involved again.
