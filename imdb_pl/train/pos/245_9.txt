The only reason I wanted to see it was Orlando Bloom. Simply put, the movie was spectacularly average. This is not bad, but it is not really good. Editing is good; the film is at a good pace. The direction is competent and reliable. History revolves. The film is mainly played by Ledger, Bloom and usually great Watts and Rush. Accents are impenetrable if you are from the US, so just sit back and enjoy the scenery (or, as I like to call it, Orlando Bloom). At the end of the movie, I was neither bored nor moved. Some asked what happened to Ned Kelly at the end of the movie. I must say that I did not care about this point. <br /> <br /> Really, the only reason I can recommend this is that Orlando Bloom in some ways shows some hints (though often the current "I'm pretty and confused" look is visible), so fangirls may consider that it is worth the price of the morning. Also, just do not see it. It is not good enough or bad enough to be entertainment.
