I just watched this movie last night at the Toronto Film Festival, where he played in the Midnight Madness section. In fact, the only reason I went to this movie was that it shared its name with the Radiohead song, and also because my friend bought the tickets, so I really had no choice: -DI went awaiting this is something in the kind of Silence of the Lambs, but it turned out to be a half-gore flick. Someone has already mentioned that none of the characters is sympathetic and this is absolutely correct. I really did not care if Potente pulled her insides through Creep. I supported the homeless to feed the Potente figure who just got desserts. Christopher Smith certainly did a great job with the visual aspect of the film. However, the story is rather weak, but on the other hand, the whole movie was about frightening you and doing it quite effectively. The score of Bristol Insects was at the highest level. That, more than anything else, really scared me. <br /> <br /> The director was a really decent guy and he was pretty funny during the question and answer session. I really hope he can make better movies in the future. <br /> <br /> This movie is only for fans of the genre, but I do not recommend fans to try it. It was a fun ride.
