I studied Charlotte Bronte's novel in high school, which made me feel great. Here is a beautiful novel about the struggle of a young woman to find love and acceptance in the dark days of Victorian England. This young woman was Jane Eyre, a poor and simple figure with a strong mind and her own will. Her story, which Bronte spoke with her own eyes, was both sad and inspiring. <br /> <br /> As part of our research, we watched the adaptation of the story from 1983 and it dispelled me. The mini-series not only tried to stay true to the original Bronte text and the essence of this story, but the actors who played the characters were simply great. Both Zelah Clarke (Jane Eyre) and Timothy Dalton (Jane's lover, named Rochester) captured the character of their characters perfectly. I can not imagine anyone else in my roles. (Other versions of Rochester in other versions, such as the 2006 version, are devoid of the passion, energy and sensitivity needed to accurately represent Rochester. I say that Timothy Dalton goes to the top because he has all of these features in his Rochester performance. she only looks like Jane Eyre, but she captures Jane's silent but firm and passionate nature, who keeps her emotions, like Jane from the book, the right moments in history, but lets her fire appear in Jane's passionate scenes. which Clarke and Dalton present together in their scenes, is also credible and consistent with the devoted relationship Jane and Rochester. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this version of the classic story of Bronte. If you have not read the book before, you can view this production as faithful introduction to this beautiful story.
