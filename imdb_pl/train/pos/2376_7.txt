All the people who are reviewing this film and probably many professional film reviewers just do not understand it. This film was made of matting sequences and artistic techniques, like works by the great Czech filmmaker Karel Zeman. If you want to know what I'm talking about, I suggest that you get one of Zeman's films, such as The Wonderful World of Jules Verne, Baron Munchausen, The Journey to Begin Time, and the Comet. If you can not find the movie, read reviews in AMG. They will explain the processes used. If you look at Zeman's work and try to compare it with any other sci / fi fantasy films of that time, the viewers would probably not get it either. It is unjust to compare one of these styles of filmmakers with standard day technologies, because both Zemen and Hines "do not count". They have a unique style and should only be judged for their creativity. If you look at this movie from a perspective in which you KNOW that you deliberately tried to create a pastiche collage with mats mixed up with live action, you can easily come to the conclusion that he did a masterful job. It's not easy to make a few notches on your computer. I thought that the creatures are also quite good, also considering how they were created. Hines took a big gamble and I think his film will not be judged fairly for many years. Someone who promotes a movie should give viewers what to see, instead of letting them blindly enter the theater, expecting CG's usual work. As for actors, I think Hines also took a page from Zemen's book, in which many of Zemen's actors were initially a bit expressionless, but it became much more engaging when the movie and the action were lasting. It's totally refreshing for me to have this movie in my library. I will watch it for many more years, all three wonderful hours.
