Josef Von Sternberg directs this wonderful silent movie about mute Hollywood and the former imperial general to the Tsar of Russia, who was there. Emil Jannings won a distinguished Oscar, partly for his role as a general who, ironically, is thrown into the role of a silent image as a Russian general. The film flickers to the times in Russia, which led to the fall of the country to the revolutionaries. William Powell debuts on the big screen as a Hollywood director who casts Jannings in his film. The film is an interesting look at the fall of Russia and the imitation of behind-the-scenes Tinseltown in the early days. Von Sternberg delivers another classic and is filled with great elements of romance, intrigue and tragedy.
