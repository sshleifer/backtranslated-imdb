One thing is for sure ... you should not watch this movie if you have a bad day. The story is based on a sad event and follows a character who must live with a sin he can not capture. The story is rather dripping for you than an ordinary, muffled explanation, so you wonder what's going on. Eventually the dots are connected, and the performances make sense. All the characters were fine and Wil Smith made another good day at the office. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt that you should ask a lot of moral questions, but if you just accept and buy his agony, it is easier to accept what he decided to do. It does not matter if you agree or not. The journey she takes you is interesting enough, if not overwhelming. <br /> <br /> A good enough movie that sadly leaves some sadness at the end. I recommend this movie if you like the kind where you have to think, not just watch explosions and fights.
