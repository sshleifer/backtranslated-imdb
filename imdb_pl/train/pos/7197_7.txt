There were several films about Zorro, some even in Europe, e.g. Alain Delon. This role was also played by prominent actors such as Tyrone Power and Anthony Hopkins, but Reed Hadley was always the best of these times. This series gives you the opportunity to see an interesting western where you only discover a real villain, Don del Oro. The series also has good performances by various actors of B movies, such as Ed Cobb, ex-Tarzan Jim Pierce, C. Montague Shaw, eternal villains such as John Merton and Charles King, as well as Hadley's very good performance as Zorro. He was fast, smart, he used a whip and a sword well, and his voice was the best for every Zorro.
