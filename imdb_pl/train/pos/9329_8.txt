I saw The Perfect Son about three times. I do not see how this movie is a gay movie, I'm not even gay, but I do not consider it a gay movie. It's a gay movie, I do not understand why any movie with a gay hero should be a movie about being gay. I believe that the film is favorable to studies of death, the death of someone who is your relative. I think Theo quickly turns his back after rehabilitation, because he wants to, and his brother dying before him makes him re-evaluate his life. I found a dialogue in this scene when Theo tells Ryan that he will be a moving father who Ryan says he does not want to know about things he will never see or share with anyone. Is not it terrifying and sad? I highly recommend this movie.
