Anyone who thinks that anime is nothing but sex and violence will be silenced forever after watching this movie. This is a great movie that tells about Tetsuro's quest to avenge his mother's death, but also grows up in the process. Traveling by train represents Tetsuro's journey from childhood to masculinity. The music and visual styles of the film are a bit outdated (it can be said that it is a movie from the 70s), and the animation is only slightly better than the average episode of "Blaze Star". But the story and characters are so strong that it really does not matter. It's a must see for every animation fan!
