It was a top-class movie with the highest cast. Danny Glover, Tony Danza, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and especially Christopher Lloyed are well-staffed in this charming movie about real angels helping the Angels baseball team. You never know, it can happen. I loved the role of Lloyd in him. He was funny. The story of how to turn your life away, because the faith of the kid in Angels helped turn the furious, hardened and embittered manager, Glover, to see the best people. The film was well made and about to see the best people and achieve their dreams. It was funny, charming, touching and sad, very nicely done. You will like (or love) it. I guarantee. <br /> <br /> *** with ****
