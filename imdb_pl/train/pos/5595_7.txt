Polański returns to the themes of loneliness and madness, which he discovered in such a huge influence in Rosemary's Repulsion and Child in The Tenant. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere is a trademark of Polanski - dark, brooding, annoying - but there is something awkward about this film and I'm not sure if this is intentional. <br /> <br /> Sven Nykvist, who was responsible for some of Bergman's most beautiful films, is not fully fair. Because his name was one of the things that really attracted me to this movie, I was a little disappointed at how little really impressive pictures in the movie are. <br /> <br /> The only thing that really lets the movie down is acting. Polanski is certainly not a bad actor, but he seems to have bitten off more than he can chew the difficult role of Trelkowski. Some of the cast are great, especially Melvyn Douglas as the owner, and Shelley Winters as a concierge, but others are weak and bad. It is also difficult to avoid the fact that all these Parisian people have American accents. <br /> <br /> It is quite unexpected that the beautiful moments of the dark comedy appear in the film. Everyone who has seen The Fearless Vampire Killers knows that Polański is certainly a good comedian. However, there are times when it is dangerously close to a parody in itself. Sudden (and somewhat unexplained) Trelkovsky's "transformation" can trigger a giggle than eyebrows, which weakens what should be a powerful moment in his psycho-dramatic journey. <br /> <br /> In total, Tenant is a pleasant and intriguing experience, though a bit too lazy for your own good. There are a handful of exceptionally chilling moments in your veins and an invariably unpleasant and sinister atmosphere, but this film, although very good, does not go as well as it could. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, at the end of the day, Polański's "good" movie is still better than most other "good" movies. It's definitely worth a look, just do not expect to be blown away.
