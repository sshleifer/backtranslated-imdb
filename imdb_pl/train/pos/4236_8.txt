Take this film for what it is, not a remake, but a completely different approach to the same concept. It's not epic like the original, it's rather a popcorn thriller. Visually, it's amazing. Everything else was just OK. <br /> <br /> What is it, I think the movie is amazing, but I like everything Burton did. People have to calm down and stop acting as if it was the end of the world b / c this movie. It was not meant to be a remake, not a remake. <br /> <br /> The ending was cool. . I took it as a parallel universe.
