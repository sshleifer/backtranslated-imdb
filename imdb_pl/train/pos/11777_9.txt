"In the first episode, Jared Diamond noticed that other nations in the world do not have animals that could be domesticated, but the Europeans did, and that explains why we were able to produce steel and invent complicated machines." --- It is obvious that the person who wrote this comment did not understand the reasoning of this document or the original book. Please, do not ruin this wonderful piece with your simple mind. The reasons are much more complex than the only thing you mentioned. Please read the book because it is a great source of information. I liked it very much. This book is even taught as a textbook at some universities.
