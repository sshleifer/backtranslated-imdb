I think it's probably the funniest movie I've ever seen. The Robert Harling script is almost perfect, just check the "quotes" section; secondly, just rent a DVD because it is a delivery that really makes the lines sing. <br /> <br /> Sally Field gives you a comic, extraordinary performance you've never seen before. and Kevin Kline is effortlessly funny. Robert Downey, Jr. is usually brilliant, and Kathy Najimy in a very small role is a riot as a beleaguered customer. I've never been a big fan of Elisabeth Shue, but she's great here as the only * real * person surrounded by a group of cartoon characters on the set of "The Sun Also Sets" - it's the rumbling that you feel under yourself, it's Hemingway pounding in his grave. Either that or it's really hard to laugh. <br /> <br /> Five stars. Funny, fun, funny.
