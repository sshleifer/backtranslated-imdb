I watched this during an 8-hour flight and (presumably because of pressure and altitude) I found it slightly amusing (emphasis on "gentle"). <br /> <br /> The right idea of ​​the movie was brilliant: a woman dies, her fiancé falls in love with someone else, she decided to make sure that they did not meet, but finally let them do it. Unfortunately, the actual movie was not so good. OK, there were a few laughter and the actors did a good job. But from the beginning, the plot was as predictable as the purpose of the flight I was on. It seems to me that the whole part of the story of a gay but not a gay friend could have been much better done. Talking parrot was a nice idea, but to be honest: it was not really fun. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, the movie was more interesting than staring at sitting in front of me, but it was a close connection.
