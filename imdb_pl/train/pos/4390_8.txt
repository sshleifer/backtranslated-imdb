Trying to establish audience empathy for Jake Roedel (Tobey Maguire), the filmmakers denigrate North and Jayhawker. Missouri never withdrew from the Union, and the Union Army was not an invading force. The southerners fought for the rights of the state: the right to have slaves, to choose dishonest legislative bodies and judges, and to use the political system of loot. There is nothing noble about it. The Missourians could easily travel east and join the Confederate Army. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that history has nothing to do with ambiguity. When Jake leaves Bushwhackers, it is not because he has seen a mistake in his own way, he is certainly not indulging in the virtue of the cause of abolition.
