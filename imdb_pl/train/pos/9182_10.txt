Those who love Jane Eyre's book, as I do (it's my favorite time and I read it at least once a year) will love this version. Timothy Dalton is just too good to be Mr. Rochester, but otherwise he does a great job by introducing the deliberate master Thornfield. Zelah Clarke might have been too old to play 18-year-old Jane, but when I watch this movie, I do not think about the age of the character. The dialogue from the film is almost literally taken from a book that was very clever. Of course, this movie may seem a bit long, but this is the only version I've seen, containing part of 3 stories. <br /> <br /> I would like people who have made this movie to be involved in the newer Zeferelli version, because it would help this mess in the movie. <br /> <br /> I also realized that the last time I watched this movie, in which Judy Cornwell plays "Aunt Reed"! It is so versatile that I did not recognize her. She played Keeping Up Appearances at Daisy, and played Mrs. Musgrove in 1995 in Persuasion (another great adaptation). <br /> <br /> UPDATE: I got a DVD this week and it's wonderful to see the original version without editing. At the beginning there is a lot more (Young Jane in Gateshead and Lowood.) And finally they restored many things (I always wondered why St. John had a piece of paper when he reveals that he knows who Jane is - because part, in which he pulls it from her picture, it was edited from the American version of VHS!). Rosamund Oliver is in this ... he was completely cut off from the VHS. As far as I could tell, they did not edit any part of Timothy Dalton, so nothing new, but it's great to see the whole miniseries all over after so many years of enjoying VHS. Thanks, BBC (PS ... I would pay more for a special DVD release ... maybe with some interviews with the stars ... or with the show)
