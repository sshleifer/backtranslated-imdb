These slasher pictures are already after the date of their sale, but this one is fun. <br /> <br /> Valentine's Day is witty and well thought out. <br /> <br /> The film has one peach line ... "He is not an angel ..." when in fact he is an Angel !!! Watching Buffs will never be the same! <br /> <br /> The cast is an amazing show of young talents, but history does not give them enough depth. Denise Richards in the additions to the DVD seemed to think that the girls on the set are well connected with each other, which would give you the feeling that you are getting into their characters. Sorry but no! <br /> <br /> The direction is very good, it manages to show very little real gore and rely on the imagination of the suggested threat. You can also say a lot about the similar way that Miss Richards and Heigel do not take off their clothes ... :-( <br /> <br /> Essentially, the main plus director lies in "borrowing" various other ideas from previous Slasher films. Scene from psychological shower is related to the "masking" of Halloween. <br /> <br /> The murder of someone hiding in the bodybag, however, is quite original, as far as I know !!!> <br /> A light watching, not too scary, but a few good moments If it was a choice between The Hole and that, choose The Hole. Slasher's films had their day, and this is just another slasher, a good slasher, but nothing breakthrough !!!
