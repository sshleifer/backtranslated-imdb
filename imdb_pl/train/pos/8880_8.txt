Lives in (some) universities. Of course, artistic licenses have been acquired, but some of what you saw in this film are continued in some colleges. <br /> <br /> I went to colleges in southern California, where the races are almost going. It's funny because these are schools that want racial unity, equality etc. And I can honestly say it's there. But when the class is released, or whenever they wait for classes, they (students) just seem to stick to people of their own race or ethnicity. Is it wrong? Not quite. Everyone needs a sense of belonging. But just like the school newspaper of one of the schools I once attended, I wrote: "We should all try to spend time with students from other ethnic groups and try to get to know them." Otherwise, you create your own segregation. <br /> <br /> Racism certainly existed in one of those schools I attended. Once, someone set up leaflets around the campus, talking about the glories of the Aryan race and had the symbols of some of these racist organizations. Fortunately, nothing happened like an incident in a movie in which a young Caucasian man went out and started shooting at a multicultural gathering. <br /> <br /> I can only hope and pray that nothing like this ever happens. > <br /> So is "higher education" too dramatic? Superstitious? Maybe. Is it somehow? It depends on where you went or to school. A racial case in which ethnicity just happens to happen with your own affairs. Apart from exaggerations in Hollywood, this racing matter was very close to me.
