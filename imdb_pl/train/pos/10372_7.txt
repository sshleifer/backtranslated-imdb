ROLL is a great little movie. Toby Malone plays an 18-year-old kid (he also behaves very well) who plays football. Malone's cousin takes him overnight before his big game of adventure with lots of twists, including two gym bags, a drug lord, some hard bikers, a few cops and some prostitutes ... and the movie lets us guess which characters are on whose side right, what is the content of both gym bag, and even what is the gender of the main rider. Parts of this reminded me of LOCK STOCK and TWO SMOKING barrels. <br /> <br /> For me, ROLL strengthened three opinions that I already had before I saw ROLL. These reviews are: 1. I really want to visit Australia someday. The country and cities are beautiful and it looks like such a nice place for holidays. <br /> <br /> 2. Some of the best filmmakers in Australia. The photos in ROLL were particularly impressive. I loved stylized colors and lighting in many scenes. <br /> <br /> 3. Australian women are hot!
