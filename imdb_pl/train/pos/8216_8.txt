*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** After two such trips ("Magnum Force" and "The Enforcer"), Dirty Harry apparently regained his step in "Sudden Impact", a thrilling thriller that wisely plays its part strengths: Clint Eastwood's charisma, which he also directed, and a story that spends enough time on exposure and reserves energy for great scenes. <br /> <br /> For the first time the case takes Harry out of his hometown of San Francisco (where he again has trouble with his superiors for the tactics "shoot first, ask questions later"), to the village of San Paulo. There (WARNING: Potential spoiler) a group of low-level people is brutally murdered, one by one, by a woman they raped many years earlier, and whose sister was in a state of catatonia since the attack. /> <br /> The killer takes on the character of Sondra Locke, which makes Jennifer Spencer an interesting mixture of compassion and cold blood. Locke's cold eyes and frosty voice, when they try to cheer up their hospitalized sister or take revenge on rapists, are very effective in painting a portrait of an aggrieved woman whose years of suffering and rage are now beginning to bear deadly fruits. > <br /> Rapists are a wicked fate, especially a leader who has a "psycho nutjob" practically embossed on the forehead and a lesbian who seems to be almost one of the boys, despite her anatomical inability to participate. Flashback scenes, though not graphically clear, are terrible enough and are clearly meant to make the audience cheer for Jennifer by killing their attackers. <br /> <br /> Some will reject "Sudden influence" as trash: a mindless, manipulative tale of revenge. At some level this is true, but it is a well-made garbage. The advantage of the film is the strength of Sondra Locke's performance, which gives us a complex figure whose wounds are more visible in her paintings than in gestures or speech. Here we have a action movie with a point of view. <br /> <br /> You can take or abandon the idea that some evil deserves to be punished by all necessary means, but because the murder mystery becomes clear to Harry (realizing that it is not wisely expressed in dialogue), he is presented with a choice - what to do with an assassin whose motivation he can sympathize with, but whose behavior is not obligated by law. This makes the story more interesting than the usual Dirty Harry dish. <br /> <br /> Another salutary feature of the film is Eastwood's direction. This is finally a movie about Dirty Harry, and Eastwood knows this character better than anyone else. The film is directed with style and wit, and edited to give the action scenes a lot of benefits. Here are some of the best "Harry's moments" in the entire series, including Harry's most famous line: "Go ahead - create my day." <br /> <br /> "Sudden influence" is a movie that has the courage of his beliefs in presenting stories about the wicked crime and the brutal consequences that follow. It is also a thrilling detective story, well done and well told. And it's definitely never boring. These criteria are extremely successful.
