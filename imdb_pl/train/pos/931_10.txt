I like all versions of this story, but this one is my favorite. George C.Scott gives depth to Scrooge, which others do not give. The film shows why it becomes so bitter. Changes in Scrooge appear gradually when encountering different ghosts and events that show him. <br /> <br /> This film definitely has the best Tiny Tim. He is the right age, not played by someone who is almost a teenager like in other movies. Anthony Walters still has all or most of his small teeth. <br /> <br /> David Warner is wonderful as Bob Cratchit. He is such a versatile actor. It presents a man who clearly loves his family. He takes on a role with dignity, or as a cunning man cowering under Scrooges'thumb, but as a man who will come to terms with grace, because he has a family he can provide. Susannah York and other actors do a great job, bringing the characters back to life. Edward Woodward is the best Ghost of Christmas Present I've ever seen. Most often he is played as a cheerful character like Santa. It shows anger at Scrooges' attitude and really makes Scrooge wonder again. <br /> <br /> Costumes and sets really revive London Dickens. A great movie.
