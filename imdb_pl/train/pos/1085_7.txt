This movie was quite a funny comedy about Murphy's law applied to home ownership and construction. If such a movie was made today, without a doubt, the family would be dysfunctional. Because it was placed in the "simpler" forties, we get something that is supposed to be a typical family of the era. Grant, of course, perfectly combines comedy and drama elements and collaborates with a more than competent cast emphasized by Loy and Douglas. Their madness makes the entertainment last solidly for ninety minutes, 7/10.
