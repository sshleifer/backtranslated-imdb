It's a good movie. Something nice to watch money can be blown out at great speed, especially from the point of view of children. Take what it is, a funny movie about how your kid's dreams come true and what a child can do with a million dollars. I do not like it, do not watch it. They make videos for observers, not people who have nothing better to do than complain about their lives.
