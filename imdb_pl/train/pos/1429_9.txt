I loved the way Earth is being created. His photography is unbelievable, the edition had to be an interesting challenge, and Patrick Stewart's voice is PERFECT. In addition, its edition of music and sound makes watching EARTH is a deep experience that you do not want to miss. You're really on a trip to a place where you'll probably never end alone. <br /> <br /> And although at first I was very surprised by the audience's laughter, when we see animals in their everyday struggle for survival, I could not laugh at times. Nature just seems too impressive to understand. <br /> <br /> But instead of the need to laugh, I left the cinema with a deep question: "How can the 200 years of the industrial revolution destroy the natural systems that have been here for thousands and thousands of years? <br /> <br /> With this in mind, you will understand how I felt a bit bitter and powerless after seeing EARTH. I felt an immediate need to change the world, to help all these animals in their struggle, undo the changes we have undergone over the last century, and stop global heating at once (and this is not an activist of non-governmental organizations!) ... <br /> <br /> So I immediately visited the site mentioned at the end of the movie to see what I can do to save our - still - fantastic planet (and polar bear) from his depressing fate .... (www.loveearth.com) <br /> <br /> I was a little disappointed that I did not find any direct answers to my questions. However, it was very interesting to learn more about the film and the struggles of its crew. <br /> <br /> I hope that energy consumption will be reduced. I do not know how to shorten the distance polar bears have to flow to reach the ground before they utopiÄ… or attack animals that they can not beat in exhausted condition ... <br /> <br /> It is an inspirational movie, but I did not leave the cinema very much happy.
