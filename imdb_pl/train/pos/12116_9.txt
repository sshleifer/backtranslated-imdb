... that the Bette Davis version of this movie was better than the Kim Novak version. <br /> <br /> Despite all the other comments here written, I really prefer the Bette Davis version, even though the Novak version has a more consistent plot. <br /> <br /> However: Davis Mildred's severe emotions seem to me more appropriate for a sloppy girl who seems to be a prostitute. <br /> <br /> And these are the raw emotions that are * a part * of what a poor doctor falls in love with. He has emotions of despair, failure, "otherness" - strong emotions that he suppresses. In turn, Davis Mildred shows his emotions immediately and without censorship. There are no feelings of despair, failure or "otherness"; rather, she simply survives as a poor woman from Cockney in the Victorian era. <br /> <br /> Novak's portrait was more vulnerable than Mildred than Davis, almost throughout the movie. Davis' Mildred was ** never ** helpless until she had to go to the doctor and beg for help. And when he insults her - for her method of keeping his body and soul together and for continuing to use his love for her - he probably releases the most passionate rejection of snobbish sanctity that you have ever seen on screen: "I wiped my lips, I STRESSED MY BRIDE !! The sensitivity of Novak was perfect. Davis's realism was monumental. <br /> <br /> The IMDb Voices are in agreement!
