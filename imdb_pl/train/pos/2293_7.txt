This is a very, very early cartoon of Bugs Bunny. As a result, the character is still in the transition period - it is not drawn as long as later, and his voice is not quite right. In addition, chemistry between Elmer and Bugs is a bit unusual. Elmer is a poor juice that buys worms from a pet store - there is no weapon or desire on his part to attack the bunny in small pieces! Nevertheless, it is still a very nice movie. Early Bugs was definitely more sassy and cruel than his later incarnations. In later films he mixed with Elmer, Yosimite Sam and others because they started him - they let him down with the rabbit. But in this movie it's more like Daffy Duck in the late 30's and early 40's - a moron who just loves to irritate others !! A real "anarchist" instead of the hero of later cartoons. Although this is not one of the best Bug Bunny cartoon, watching is certainly fun and it is interesting how much it has changed over the years.
