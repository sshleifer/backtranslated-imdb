This movie is light, funny and beautifully filmed. The lightning is absolutely great, and the colors are convincingly reminiscent of Vermeer's paintings. <br /> <br /> This is a sentimental comedy at its best, well above American and French standards, and probably better than English. <br /> <br /> Each character is touched, and the interpretation is close to perfection. Isabelle Blais is great, Sylvie Moreau is better than in the Catherine series, Stéphane Gagnon is cute, Emmanuel Bilodeau is great in this strange role, and Geneviève Laroche is the perfect friend! <br /> <br /> I could go for hours before you find a negative comment on the movie, so give it a chance and add your own review.
