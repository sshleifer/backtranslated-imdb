This is one TV program based on horror, which does it well. Friday, 13th, the series had no relation to the films. Poltergeist in the legacy: I'm not so sure. Perhaps he was loosely related to films. It seems that they just throw the famous title for the concert, so fans will watch it. <br /> <br /> This shows that Freddy is burned by his parents from Elm Street (in the first episode, I think), and the number of parents was unsatisfactory. With all the children who managed in the first three films, you can expect that there will be more parents. But well. <br /> <br /> Freddy is basically the show's narrator. He observes the actions of people in the real world, which sometimes somehow engage. As in other anthology shows, such as Tales from the crypt, there is something supernatural or surprising in it. <br /> <br /> Actors are missing, but believe it or not: violence sometimes surpasses the movie. The performance lasted for several seasons and about the fourth movie was made. I heard he was canceled because of the protesting parents. As a child, I watched many things rated as R, so it is a pity that my parents had to ruin it for everyone. 4 more films appeared after the series, so it was not a total loss.
