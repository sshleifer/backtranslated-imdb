First of all, I have to start this comment saying that I am a big fan of Nightmare on Elm Street. I think it's the biggest horror series in history. For me, Freddy is a boogeyman! Of course, Freddy's Dead, who tried to be the last chapter, is a strange movie. It does not have the same atmosphere as previous movies. Freddy has a lot of time on the screen. Some people think that it makes him less scary, which I agree. And that is, in my opinion, exactly the point. This movie exists so that we can get to know Freddy better, who he is, who he was, how he became a man haunting our dreams. For some people this is a bad thing, better if we never find out, because it's more frightening to not know why evil is bad. Of course, these people will not want to remake Halloween Rob Zombie. To really enjoy this, you need to see things differently. It's not about a strange guy hiding in the bush of your dream land, waiting to frighten you. It was the first and it was amazing. Over the years, Freddy killed more and more people and no one could get rid of him for good. Now is the time to learn about the nature of this evil, the psychological aspects of Freddy's terror. In addition to the story of Freddy's past, I really liked the atmosphere of the film. No more children in Springwood, only crazy adults. Nightmare scenes are great. The soundtrack is amazing, especially the opening song "I'm Awake Now" by Goo Goo Dolls. In my opinion, The Final Nightmare is a masterpiece of horror and I can not believe that it is so underestimated. Maybe it is misunderstood, or I have different tastes! In any case, all fans of Freddy should watch it. It has many scary moments, as well as funny moments and many episodes! Get ready for something else and you can not fail.
