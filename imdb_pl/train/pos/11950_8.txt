I went to this movie without knowing anything and it ended up with it. There was a lack of authenticity and credibility - some of the things that characters said and did were totally weird, and many of the scenarios seemed to be "ad libbut" (maybe it's typical for Woody Allen? I'm sorry for ignorance), but the whole audience in the theater he was laughing so much. It was not even in the jokes of the movie itself, but in the film itself. Acting reminded me of Seinfeld's acting, in which he tries not to laugh at his own jokes - they are trivial, but if you do not take the film too seriously, you can really appreciate the humor of ACTORS, not CHARACTERS. If you're looking for a random movie and you like Woody Allen, I definitely recommend it!
