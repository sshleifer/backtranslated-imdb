Jimmy Stewart and Anthony Mann joined forces to make some of the best westerns ever made, and this is one of the best. <br /> <br /> The real star of the film, however, are the spectacular Canadian Rockies that serve as a backdrop for the storyline. Some of the best photos ever made in the history of the film. <br /> <br /> In all five westerns that Stewart and Mann did together, the supporting roles were perfectly manned. There is no exception here, up to parts that can only have a few lines, the characters are strongly engraved with these lines. <br /> <br /> Stewart is a cynical hard loner in this movie whose only real friend is his midfielder Walter Brennan. It's Brennan's death at the hands of the villains, who makes him want to finally free the gold settlement from the bad guys and accidentally buy back in the process. <br /> <br /> John McIntire is the main villain of this song and he was an underrated actor with a wide range. He could play delectable old coders, authorities, and in this case an extremely nasty and cunning villain. <br /> <br /> One of the best westerns in history.
