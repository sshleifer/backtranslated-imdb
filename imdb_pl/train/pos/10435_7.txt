My watch came a little too late, but I'm glad that I watched both this and the sequel together ... which makes me compliment the creators of this film for giving such a pure and basic treatment of the idea of ​​romanticism ... and very marginally separating it from the idea of ​​relationship! Since a lot has been written about the film, it would be good to highlight a few fragments of the film that I personally loved. <br /> <br /> I think Jesse and Celine are making fake calls to their proper friends were a very smart way of telling each other what they had for themselves, during a journey not even longer than 24 hours ... curiosity of two people who both they think that the other had an infallible influence on others, was very elegantly coped with ... <br /> <br /> On the plot, making a romantic story, working on a clean conversation is not an easy task to do ... <br /> <br /> I believe in a romantic cinema such a taste, the characters are not clearly designed, even in the writer's and director's mind. What the actors reveal is what happens to them ... good or bad even for the owners of the idea would be difficult to justify ... to become a character, the life that the actor gives must go beyond the instructions and the story ... here both actors only do the right job! Kudos .. !!! and Before sunset is another pen that makes it even more beautiful!
