The whole talent that Mr. Sooraj Barjatya showed in his first three films seemed to me a coincidence, because his fourth Main Preki Diwani Hoon was so bad. But I have to say it was not an accident. This guy is talented, and the way Vivah did it is simply brilliant. From the first scene it affects you. the sequences between shahid and amrita are amazing. Chemistry between these two actors gives glimpses between the srk and kajol. As usual, Alok Nath as a good and loving father is fantastic, just like Anupam Kher. But this is a Shahid-Amrita movie. Amrita looks good in most scenes, although Shahid looks a little young to get married but does a good job of a shy but morally strong groom. this film will be particularly liked by those who have had such beautiful moments in their lives. All in all a brilliant movie. hats off to Mr. Sooraj Barjatya ...
