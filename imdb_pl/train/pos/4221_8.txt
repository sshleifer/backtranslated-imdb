I loved this episode, but it seems to me that there should be some quick reference to punishing the secretary for actually being a partner after the fact. While I like when the Columbo episode has an unpredictable return such as this one, its resolution should be part of the end of the episode, along with the discovery of the murderer. <br /> <br /> The interaction between Peter Falk and Ruth Gordon is invaluable. At one point, Gordon, playing the famous writer, comments on the flattery of the famous Lieutenant Columbo, making an insulting allusion to the real fame detective as a criminal. This is one of the best of many great Columbo installments.
