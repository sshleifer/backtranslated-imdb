Dogs' days are one of the most accurate films I have ever seen describing life in modern cities. It is very sharp and cruel at certain times and unfortunately is very close to reality. Isolation, desperation, deep emotional blind alleys, problematic matters, perversion, complexes, madness. All things that are present in large, advanced cities today. It makes you realize once again the merciful condition in which people lead the society. <br /> <br /> The negative side of life in the city has never been so well presented on the screen. I just wish it was a lie. Unfortunately, it is not. That's why ... 10/10.
