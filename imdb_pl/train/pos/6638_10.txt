The attractiveness of such ancient films is such that you can see the real moving image of life from over 100 years ago. There are many people leaving the factory, all of whom are already dead, and none of them even realize the size of the invention that is going on before. I was shocked when I read that one of the reviewers called this movie as boring as home movies, and at least one of them mistakenly identified it as the first movie ever made (it was the first movie made at a rate of 16 frames per second, not then normal 46 frames per second). <br /> <br /> Sure, all you see are people coming out of the building and passing in front of the cinematograph on the way home from work, but this is a bit of curiosity for several reasons, not least is the first movie of the Lumi√©re brothers who it probably had a stronger impact on the development of cinema than any other person or group of people in history.
