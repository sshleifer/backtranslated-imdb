A nice story of the Martian attempt to colonize the Earth. (Things must be quite bad on Mars.) Two state soldiers investigate the scene of a reported UFO accident. Whatever has landed is buried under the ice at Tracy's Pond, but there are footprints on the snow leading to a nearby restaurant. <br /> <br /> The dining room has no customers since eleven this morning. Now a handful of bus passengers are sitting and waiting for permission to cross the structurally weak bridge. The bus driver insists that six passengers should be on board the bus, although he did not notice who they were. The problem is now SEVEN people waiting to resume their journey. One of them is an alien, but who? Everyone is suspicious. Of course, there is a crazy old man (Jack Elam) who seems to practice sub rosa wit. There is a nasty businessman who has to get to Boston (John Hoyt). A young couple on a honeymoon. (The executive ability of her husband, Ron Kipling.) With the exception of couples, nobody noticed anyone else. And even couples are suspicious of themselves. The bride of a newly baked husband: "I could have sworn that you have a mole on your chin." The story goes on in a clever, but somewhat frightening way - the phone rings for no reason, the lights turn on and off, the jukebox turns on - and nothing should be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> It is a very nice team game, and the culminating revelation is worth chuckling. There is no visible "depth". This is not a moral message about people who impersonate ordinary citizens. This is not a warning, only a fairy tale that changes direction and amuses. <br /> <br /> I always like it when it's on. It is particularly interesting to see John Hoyt as an annoying and impatient businessman, knowing that in 1954 he was a Roman senator who worked on the assassination of Julius Caesar in the version of Shakespeare's MGM. And here he is - with three hands. <br /> <br /> Oops.
