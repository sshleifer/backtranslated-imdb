Marion Davies stars in this amazing comedy "Show People" released by MGM in 1928. Davies plays hick from Savannah, Georgia, who comes to Hollywood with his father (Dell Henderson). The Jalopy they are reaching is hoot - just like the outrageous Davies costume. Davies gets a job in a slapstick comedy, not what he wants, but it brings her success. He meets another slapstick star William Haines, who immediately impresses her. Well, Davies gets a job in a more prestigious studio ("High Art Studios") and performs work in stuffy pieces from the era. A handsome but fake actor (Andre Telefair) shows her how to be a typical pretentious Hollywood star. Davies abandons his slapstick friend and father for a good life, but of course he learns that he is not who he really is. Marion Davies is wonderful, as she - outrageously - carries a range of emotions required from a "serious" actress. William Haines is his usual marvelous comic self-portrait and there are scenes of Charles Chaplin, John Gilbert and other celebrities of the day, including film director King Vidor. It is a silent movie with a few "sound effects" because the sound images just appeared. The treasure of the film.
