A groundbreaking musical by Rene Clair. If you want to see where the songs were going for the first time, this is the place. This is the story of a starving young artist who discovered that he won the lottery, just like his creditors. Unfortunately, his ticket is in his coat, which is in the apartment of his girlfriend and was handed over to the condemned man, who then ... oh, but that would be the case. <br /> <br /> It is a light and frothy story in which most of the dialogues are sung (most people think that it did not happen to Oklahoma or Andrew Lloyd Webber). It's a movie that they do not do anymore and they rarely did it. His sound is a film from the first days that plays like a movie five or six years later. Clair moves his camera in a way that Busby Berkeley did not do (although honestly, the comparison of the two film makers is unfair because Berkeley did basically stage dances, and Clair carried the camera through the "real world"). It's an amazing little movie. and it's a charming movie that will make you smile. It's just fluffy pleasure. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, I can not say more. It's just a nice little movie and that's really all you need to know.
