What sustains us - or at least what the writer wanted me to be glued at first, is our desire to know if Martinaud has done this dirty act. Without coddling, of course, there is red herring and surprise. But then we discover that it is a story of Martinaud's imperfections and his difficulties in coping. When revelation appears - we begin to feel compassion and pity over it, because with the progress of history we are forced to think that he is a sick, perverted pedophile, about whom we are predisposed. One of the things he has to deal with is the distant gap that he and his wife have, even though they live on the same roof. Of course, these problems are dealt with in the shocking finale of the film. <br /> <br /> This movie requires your patience and will definitely try these restless teenagers sitting in the back. Obviously, of course, because they are not biased towards films from the "central location". Although there is some travel, when we reach the forest and the beach. And we realize that Gallien is not as smart as we think he is. <br /> <br /> The Inquisitor is 5/5
