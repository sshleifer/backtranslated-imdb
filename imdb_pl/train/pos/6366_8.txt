this kid is such a child; this movie was not Titan A.E. (which is in many ways modeled on him), but he was still funny, the fact that he got lost in a piece of monkey nonsense, such as Tomb Raider, makes you want to cry; contains some of the most entertaining characters that I've seen in the disney movie
