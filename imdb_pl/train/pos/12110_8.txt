For those of you who think that anime is just giant reptile raping schoolgirls, think again. Japanese animation has a completely different side. Yakitate! Japan is one of those shows. This is a sweet story about a young boy with a gift for making delicious bread. His universe is about making Japanese bread that matches the famous European breads. The performance is so crazy, it seems, and I am sure that non-Japanese viewers will miss many jokes. But it is still very nice to watch because of the complete innocent atmosphere of the show. <br /> <br /> In the world of Yakitate! it often happens that people look like they have had an orgasm after eating bread. Bread has hallucinations and can give the consumer a wide range of superpowers, from time travel to swimming like a fish. This strange aspect makes it one of the least predictable and fun programs that I've been watching for some time.
