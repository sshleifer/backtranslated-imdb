I saw this short DVD on the best New Zealand shorts, everything was great, but the French doors were amazing. It starts slowly and you wonder if something will happen. Just as you relax in the noise of the house renovation, the most horrible thing happens. <br /> <br /> EEEEkkk, I wanted to stop watching, but I was stuck. <br /> <br /> The movies are immersed in the original fear of darkness and with small, if not any, special effects. It chills you to the bone. A simple but ingenious concept opened all these memories when I was young and I could not come up with the most unlikely but horrible situations. <br /> <br /> The visual style of the filmmakers is stunning, and the main character transports you convincingly through history. It's a short movie that I have not seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> French Doors has all the features of a great function, unfortunately it ends after about ten minutes. The bigger the ending, which asks you for more information. <br /> <br /> I really liked it and well done and thanks for the ride. These New Zealanders really show talent. <br /> <br /> A new fan.
