I love Paul McCartney. He is, in my opinion, the greatest of all time. However, I could not afford a ticket for his concert at Tacoma Dome during the tour Back in the U.S. I was at least worried. Then I found this DVD. It was almost as good to be there. Paul is still a man and I will enjoy it for many years. <br /> <br /> I have one complaint. I'd like to hear all Hey Jude. <br /> <br /> Also Paul is not dead. <br /> <br /> The single biggest DVD concert. *** except *****.
