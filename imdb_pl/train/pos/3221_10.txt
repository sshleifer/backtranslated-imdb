In the film, several references are executed in a subtle way to the Blade runner, but one of the most obvious is that Cain 607 and his unit are genetic constructs that are unnecessary warriors. But my favorite quote from the movie is: "You should have made them intelligent and fast." Kurt Russell did an amazing job, his facial expressions or lack of films gave more in the way of telling stories than the rest of the cast. Even when she falls in love with Sandra, but does not know how to deal with these emotions, and his tears after being thrown out of the group, or his shaking when he hugs him, and his attachment to the silent boy who remembers Todd of himself and what he could have been if it were not for his choice as a soldier.
