I was so surprised how really great The Man In The Moon was. At the beginning I was expecting a tacky and predictable movie, but I decided to put it aside when I looked. Well, when it was over, I was just stunned (mostly in tears), how wonderful The Man In The Moon turned out to be. This movie is so funny and so aware of its sound that it's just a fantastic movie. he was so sweet and lovable) and everyone else. There was nothing that really worried me, I felt that the ending was predictable, but very well done. I also felt that some things are simple or as if they were done before, but still a great movie. In general, I have to say that I do not have much to say about this movie, not because it was bad, it's just a movie you like or dislike. and everyone, even if you do not like this type of movie, is still a nice movie. <br /> <br /> 8.7 out of 10 stars
