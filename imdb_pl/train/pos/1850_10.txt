This is my favorite EVER movie. I watched it at least 10 times and every time I cry. My family begs me not to see her, so I will not want to cry. I think I love the fact that this is a real story written by Antwone himself, just as I love this movie. Acting is at the highest level, and the actors were perfect for their role. Denzel Washington is one of my favorite actors. But this is my favorite movie that he has done so far. I took care of a little boy who was also born in prison. He was the most valuable boy I have ever met. He was adopted by a wonderful family who fought for him for almost two years. I saw this movie during the fight and its future was uncertain and I'm happy that it is safe and loved. I am very happy that Antwone is happy and has found his family. <br /> <br /> I would like to know more about him and how it has been since meeting family. I just can not say enough good things !!
