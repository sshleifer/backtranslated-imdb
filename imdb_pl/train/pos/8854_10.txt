The Bible teaches us that love for money is the source of all evil. Love for money leads to greed, which can lead to pride and ultimately destruction. Two brothers, Andy and Hank, will find out how far their love for money and those they love will cost. <br /> <br /> Andy Hanson (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and his younger brother Hank (Ethan Hawke) could not be any different. Andy apparently enjoys a successful job on the New York real estate market and is married to his beautiful wife Gina (Marisa Tomei), who is the idea of ​​a trophy wife if she ever existed. Hank, however, is a divorcee who is at the mercy of his ex-wife, dear daughter bills, and endless child benefits. A man who understands well and has good intentions, Hank still can not escape the water, which slowly floats above his head, no matter how hard he floats to stay above it. <br /> <br /> Andy has his problems with the only difference between him and his brother, that he hides them better. He made a fraud against his company and is heavily involved in drug use to avoid his fears. The pressure of his life and lies, which he needs to keep up appearances, made him think about escaping from the country with Gina to start again. Of course, like Hank, he needs money to do it and believes he knows how to get it. How? Robbing a jewelry store whose parents own and run. This act of betrayal is the place where the Hanson brothers, their families and several others will be destroyed because of greed, pride and fear. <br /> <br /> The uniqueness of "Before the devil knows that you are dead" is the way history is told. After the attack on the theft and killing of Nanette Hanson (Rosemary Harris), Andy's and Hank's mother, the story is told from different points of view on different days before and after the assault. We learn more about the motivations of not only Andy and Hank, but also the reaction to their father Charles (Albert Finney) after the death of his wife. The relationship between Karol and his two sons, especially the Andes, are also investigated and another possible motivation is revealed after revealing that there is little love between these two men. Nanette could have been loved by her sons, but their father is a different story. <br /> <br /> Philip Seymour Hoffman proves once again that he is one of the most impressive actors in Hollywood, presenting Andy as not only a greedy criminal with a lack of morals, but also, in a contradictory way, as a man with which we can sympathize. Ethan Hawke also brings Hank alive not only as a loser, but in fact as a man who desperately wants to stick to what he has left behind. Andy and Hank are thus called to live in such a realistic way that it is easy to think about them not only about characters, but about very real images of lost and confused men who are now facing the consequences of their actions. <br /> <br /> Before the Devil knows you are dead, it's a moral story of how our actions lead to consequences that we would not otherwise expect. What's more, our choices can affect people around us in a way we've never expected. In what should be the best picture of the year, we see how life is easily broken when the passion for money becomes the ultimate goal to alleviate our troublesome lives. In other words, there are no easy fixes or answers to our problems and an attempt to find them can only worsen the situation. <br /> <br /> 10/10
