Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci are an excellent couple and demonstrate it with their unique charisma described in this film. <br /> <br /> This is a typical "alternative" or independent movie with a story that contains a rare situation that suddenly becomes really important. <br /> <br /> Pecker is an average boy who has an old camera, and his main hobby is photographing the exotic inhabitants of the small town in which he lives. Suddenly the alternative artist draws attention to his work and hires him to reveal his work at several important festivals and not only. <br /> <br /> But Pecker's life is changing drastically, because fortune and fame seem to piss people off the city who are Pecker's main inspiration. Even his sexy girlfriend is angry because now he does not pay "proper" attention to her. <br /> <br /> Well, this is an indie movie with an advantage, but not for everyone. For some, it may seem boring or pretentious, but I still think it's worth watching only because it offers something "different" to the typical Hollywood standards. <br /> <br /> Describe in a few words: This is a typical Christine Film by Ricci and John Waters. That's all. <br /> <br /> Oh, I almost forgot to mention that the poems "Full of grace" are really annoying. Geez.
