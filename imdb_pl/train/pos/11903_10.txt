I was lucky to catch this film during volunteering at the Maryland Film Festival. I have always been a fan of classic horror films, especially William Castle's tricks, so it was definitely mandatory for me. <br /> <br /> It's about the life and work of William Castle, who in my opinion was an underestimated director. It's true that he did some cheap horror movies, but he added something to these movies: real live tricks that are no longer seen. For example, he had nurses in case someone had a heart attack in their films and placed vibrators in the bottom of the TINGLER chairs. <br /> <br /> This is a really well made documentary and brings this rather shady director in the light and celebrated his contribution to the horror cinema. He also paints Castle as a character with a greater than life character who was very liked and had a smile on his face. <br /> <br /> Unlike most documentary films that show mainly the wills of film historians, SPINE TINGLER! he shows interviews mainly from his family members and directors, influenced by his work, such as John Waters, John Landis and Joe Dante. Must see for fans of classic horror and science fiction.
