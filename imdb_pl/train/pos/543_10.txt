This is the best horror movie, no bar. I love Stanley just a woman crosses the lake. For many years I have been a fan of the work of Judd Nelson, and he dropped me off. This combination of horror and drama and romance, not so much comedy. His angry, yet glamorous look caught me there and there. That look in his eyes, I will never forget. Something in it, I can not describe.
