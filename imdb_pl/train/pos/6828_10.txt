John Cassavetes (from the movie Rosemary's Baby), actor on Broadway and the movie that became the director, creates a masterpiece in this film from 1977. It features Gena Rowlands, John Cassavetes himself, Ben Gazzara, Joan Blondell, Paul Stewart, Zohra Lampert, Laura Johnson, and an episode of Peter Falk. Making a movie: An aging stage and movie actress (Gena Rowlands) re-evaluates her life after an out-dated fan dies in a car accident trying to get an autograph. The film has a slow pace and dark, moody, frightening quality. It has a cinematic look from the 1960s and reminded me of the Child of Polanski Rosemary's Baby without a supernatural horror movie. Concerns here are those that have every successful actress - getting old and useless in your career. In addition, she feels that she lived a life devoid of true spirituality, humanity and merit. She lived only for her career - no children, no charitable acts, etc. The gradual disintegration of her personality is the meat of this film. She is falling apart. He is in a crisis. Gena Rowlands really falls into the tormented psyche of the character and works quite well. She is a great actress, and the movie from the 70s is a refreshing contrast to the often brutal films from that period or catastrophic movies and adventure thrillers. It is a film with a lot of deeply rooted emotions, but it has a cold, cynical feeling, as if Cassavetes criticizes the main films and actors of the 70's generation. Either this or this movie is a product of the '70s, which itself was cynical in many respects - Nixon's deception, Watergate, Vietnam, etc. Although production values ​​are not great, and this film is not well known, it is very haunted film with disturbing moods. Recognition for the underestimated and deceased director Cassavetes, who died in the late 1980s.
