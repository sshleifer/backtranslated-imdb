"Capitães de Abril" is very good. History is not a document about the 1974 revolution in Portugal. But it gives us an idea of ​​what it was like. The fiction of the story is not very interesting, but it does not spoil the film. The heroic actions of Captain Salgueiro Maia are not an exaggeration, and the film is also a tribute to his actions. Captain Salgueiro Maia remains one of the greatest heroes of the April 25 revolution. <br /> <br /> All actors are very good and even the smallest roles are played splendidly. Lisbon looks beautiful as always. Do not miss it! I really liked this movie.
