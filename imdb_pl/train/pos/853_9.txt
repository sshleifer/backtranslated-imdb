"Matador" plays Pierce Brosnan as a burnt killer. It was James Bond who went to lie, in too tight, bright clothes, gold chains and an ugly hairstyle. Our fighting assassin, Julian Noble, is in Mexico, trying to regain his nerves. Staying in the same hotel is a nice businessman, Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear), who is trying to regain his balance. Danny is desperate to close the deal and return to his wife in Denver (Hope Davis) with the good news. <br /> <br /> Noble and Wright unexpectedly become friends. Wright convinces Noble to reveal some of the techniques he demonstrates during bullfighting. Noble is ultimately the target of his employers and appears in Denver. <br /> <br /> Writer and director Richard Shepard made Q & A after this great film at the Austin Film Festival. Shepard also had no luck. After losing his agent and discarding the final scenarios, he decided to write a story that no one bought, and create a character that no one would like to play. Then Pierce Brosnan called. Brosnan regains balance in this film. (There is life behind Bond!) He has a wonderful talent for a self-sufficient comedy. Do not miss it. <br /> <br /> Stay by the end credits to read what the filmmakers say about bullfighting. I am looking forward to more Richard Shepard's designs.
