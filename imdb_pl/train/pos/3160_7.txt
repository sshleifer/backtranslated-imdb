This series has all the usual characters in the comedy: good guy, idiot, pervert, rich girl ... but it's set to the '70s. This is the only difference compared to other TV comedies. I do not know how you like this program. His humor is pathetic! I mean, the jokes are so direct ... A typical dialogue is: "Fez: Oh, Jackie, I want to have sex with you." Oh yeah, I'm (the audience cheers and applauds) "It's not funny. I think if there were not such laughter (I do not know how to call it in English, I'm sorry), you would not laugh at all. This is not an intelligent comedy, it's an insult to the public. I like most American comedies, but it's not good at all. I would give him 4 out of 10. (Again I apologize for my poor English.)
