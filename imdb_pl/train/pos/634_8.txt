I was one of about 200 people who were lucky to see the early trick of this movie. <br /> <br /> The stardust follows Tristan, a young man who is looking for a fallen star and brings her to the woman he loves to prove his love for her. The only catch is that the star has fallen to the other side of the wall, the passage between England and the magical kingdom known as Stormhold. <br /> <br /> This movie was just a joy to watch, it has something in it for everyone, all action scenes are beautiful, and the comedy extends to the whole movie, making it fun without being known. If I had to compare a movie like that, it would probably have to be The Princess Bride, a classic. <br /> <br /> All the performances are unique, the beautiful Claire Danes makes you love her in the role of Yvaine trusting naive star and underestimated Michelle Pfeiffer provides excellent quality at the highest level as Laura ... but the performance you can talk to Robert De Niro ... In every scene he's in his hands, he steals the show ... <br /> <br /> If you fancy a funny fantasy story, it's a movie. The guys are not discouraged by the description, there's enough action comedy and not to mention the many sweets of Claire Danes and Michelle Pfeiffer to keep you entertained all the time. The cinematography is dead and behaves in the atmosphere of the film ... nothing about the film seems to be forced.
