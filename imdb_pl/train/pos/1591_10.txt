My mother and I have recently become addicted to this show, laughing at our cigarette butts! I only saw 10 episodes and I'm disappointed that I did not pay attention to this funny series before they were canceled! The plot is very funny, the characters really have great personalities (or, not so great, but they are still funny!). I TiVO every episode of What I Like About You. Amanda Bynes and Jennie Garth, as well as the entire cast, never get bored when watching! There is some inappropriate language for children and some sexual content, but with a guide for parents nearby, you should not have too many problems. There is a certain type of relationship "Friends" that attracts me to this program. I really like it.
