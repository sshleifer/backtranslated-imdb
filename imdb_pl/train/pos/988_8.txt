I liked the movie. When a guy who was in a bank robbery of $ 40 million in gold, his cellmate was used as a "bait" to lead them to the technologically sophisticated partner of the mad killer (by placing the monitoring device in his jaw without his knowledge) . It is a spy type action movie with enough comical scenes to keep the light. It reminded me of Enemy Of The State. Well-functioning and good enough thread.
