Elegance and class are not always the first words that come to mind when people (at least people who can do this) sit and talk about noir movies. <br /> <br /> However, some of the best movies of this genre, "Out of the Past", "The Killers", "In A Lonely Place", "Night and the City", cope with elegant sophistication that exalts them beyond the moody phrase and its connotations of bad feelings, fedores and femme-fatales. <br /> <br /> "Where the pavement ends", quite difficult to find a movie - the only copy in probably the best stocked video store in Manhattan is a rough bootleg from the cable channel AMC - belongs to the category with these classics. <br /> <br /> From the moment when the black cloud of opening credits has passed, the curtain extends to the decaying world of detective lone detective Marc Dixon and as time passes, it becomes ever closer, threatening suffocation. <br /> <br /> Sure, he is the well-known "dark-haired policeman", but Dana Andrews gives Dixon a gloomy look and restless intensity that makes you feel as uncomfortable as it seems. And so, he fought with the suspects too long, and the newly promoted commander (Karl Malden, in a typically strong and commanding expedition) warns him "for the last time". <br /> <br /> However, Dixon hates these thugs too much to stop. And boy, were not they supposed to come? <br /> <br /> "Hoods, dust, cups, nickel gutter racks" he spits when the hard boss's boss knocks him down and presents all the complaints that the office received about Dixon's right hook. The council is for him to cool down for his own good. Instead, he takes matters into his own hands. <br /> <br /> And what a world of trouble he discovers when he relies on his instincts and returns to nature, which could or could not be passed down from the previous generation. <br /> <br /> He is at once ready with the cops, the syndicate, his own partner. Dixon's doubtful commitment to the "investigation" of the murder threatens his work, makes him wonder if he is simply the basis of those whom he swore to bring. Like Bogart in "Lonely Place" or maybe "escape from who he is?" <Br> When there is nowhere to go, he discovers that he practically condemned his unexpected relationship to the seraphic beauty (the miraculous Gene Tierney), who seems to be able to turn his barren life into a bachelor in something that is worth returning home to. <br /> <br /> The pace of this amazing movie is tense and gripping. A group of authors who contributed to the creation of the film, refined the scenario to a high gloss - dialogue is lively, does not fall into an outdated parody, passionate, without becoming melodramatic or juicy. <br /> <br /> And all this in the highest-class direction and the game is not too slippery or reinforced to loosen the emotional load of the movie. The angel angel, the soft focus of Gene Tierney is used with great effect. She shows herself as an actress with a large range, and her gentle, kind nature is as boundless here as her psychosis in "Leave her to heaven." The scenes between Tierney and Dixon Andrews are becoming more and more intense and are touching each other, as it seems, to self-destruction. <br /> <br /> Near the end of the rope, cut, bruised and exhausted, Dixon sums up his fate: "Innocent people can also get into terrible jams," he says. "One false move and you are over your head." <br /> <br /> Maybe what makes this movie so fascinating is the feeling that for everyone - especially for someone who is trying so hard to do so - it can get crazy with one tiny wind change, one wrong decision or blow, or, most frightening, because of factors you can not control. Noir always reflected the darkest fears, he brought them to the surface. "Where the Sidewalk Ends" does it in a realistic way. <br /> <br /> (One of the pranks on the side: this movie in a different style has a glaringly poor dub blonde model that does not seem out of place in the Mystery Science Theater. How weird.) <br /> <br /> But fans of Noir - heck, EVERY fans of the movie - who have not seen this, are on a great feast.
