Honestly, everyone should see this movie at least once. In fact, I was looking at it from the perspective. Although it was fictitious, this movie is about something that can happen to your children. <br /> <br /> It shows how easily two children can hide both their hatred for school and plans to murder innocent students. This movie would not work in any other format. They took the camera out of hand, perfectly. <br /> <br /> It reminds us of April 20, 1999, when Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold murdered 12 students and then themselves. It also reminds us of a media storm that occurred later. Everyone wanted to see the Rampart video and everyone wanted to see the tapes from the basement. <br /> <br /> This movie is a fictional version of our dreams. We see a kid standing behind a monster. <br /> <br /> The only bad thing about this movie is that it did not do well in the market, and few people know it exists. If he had one preview of a single blockbuster movie, everyone would go and see what it's all about, Zero Day. <br /> <br /> I believe that this is the best film adaptation of the school shooting of the few who really tried to do it. The shooting itself takes only ten minutes of an hour and a half because it focuses mainly on Cal and Andre, as well as on what they have done so far. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie yet, borrow it and watch it. I guarantee that when it's over, you'll be speechless.
