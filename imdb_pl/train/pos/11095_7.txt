I've always liked this movie by John Frankenheimer. A good screenplay by Elmore Leonard and the main reason why it was not just another thriller comes from Frankenheimer. His tense direction and attention to small details make a difference, he even hired Ron Jeremy's porn star as a consultant! You can make a case that is the last good movie that Roy Scheider did. I always said that Robert Trebor simply gave a great performance. Clarence Williams III became famous with his scary performance and is also perfect, but I really thought that Trebor stood out. Frankenheimer may not be as proud of this movie as others, but it is an effective thriller full of blackmail, murder, sex, drugs and real porn actors appearing in obscene parts. What can you say about the movie in which Ann Margaret was shot with drugs and raped? At least guilty of pleasure. Vanity has a really bad role, and the very young Kelly Preston appears in the beginning. A classic performance thriller that should not be overlooked.
