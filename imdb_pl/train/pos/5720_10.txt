I saw "The Grudge" yesterday and wow ... I was really scared, okay. I love horror movies and I loved it. There were so many scenes of "surprises" (what is the English word?), Which made you jump into your place. Although too many audience cries made it difficult to not laugh. I think the most terrifying scene was ... on the bus when the face flashes in the window or when Yoko goes without her chin. The makeup is also VERY good. Sometimes you really could see it, but it still added a strange look. The boy was really very good, so cute without make-up and so terrifying him. The next time I hear crackling, I'll probably be scared ...
