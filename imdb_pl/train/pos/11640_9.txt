What I liked the most about this movie is that, like Hitchcock movies, it is a thriller that does not take too seriously. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock understood that people go to the cinema to have fun. Something Hollywood has forgotten in recent years. He is a thriller, but he has lots of laughter and always has one eye blinking to the camera. <br /> <br /> Rachel McAdams is wonderful as always. Cillian Murphy is more frightening than in Batman Begins. In the old days there were guys who always played a bad guy. We do not see much of this at the moment, because I suspect that Hollywood agents see it as a bad move in their career, but Cillian Murphy is really good at being bad. <br /> <br /> The director is surprisingly stylish. The story is good, but the dialog box could have used an addition. <br /> <br /> "Red Eye" is a really funny movie, and people started applauding when the subtitles started to end. If you are in the mood for a pleasant escapist thriller, "Red Eye" can be your ticket.
