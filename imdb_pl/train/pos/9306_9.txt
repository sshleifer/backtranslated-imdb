The world is a terrible place. But this movie is a farce and fun. And if you do not like it ... you do not understand ... and if you do not get it ... it does not matter. It's up to you whether you want to play together. Every actor in this movie had a good time. It's just a joke. And that's good enough for me. Gabriel Byrne is priceless. Byrne and Paul Anka do MY WAY, as "Vic" describes it: "the best version ever". Okay ... it's not a masterpiece, but it's not bad. I was warned, but I'm sure I did it ...
