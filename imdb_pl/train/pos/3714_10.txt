First of all, I did not know what to expect when I started filming. <br /> <br /> Each time someone brings back the cult film genre and adapts it to the present, something in the translation gets lost inexplicably. br /> <br /> This is not the case here. This movie is just starting on the right track. This is partly a familiar territory, but he also manages to take over the same. Crockzilla scene? You have to see it and just try to keep your face straight. This film contains several old classic iconic films and easily connects it to modern production. It is good to see that someone satisfies the needs in this market. Very well done. <br /> <br />
