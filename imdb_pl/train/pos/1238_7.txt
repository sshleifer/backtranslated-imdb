Although this movie has many disadvantages, it is actually a funny movie from the 80's. Eddie Murphy reaches the top in his 80s movies here. While his character is indistinguishable from earlier films, his timing is almost flawless with perfect partners and foils. <br /> <br /> Combine this with the hypnotic beauty of Charlotte Lewis, which makes it a fun, rainy action movie. <br /> <br />
