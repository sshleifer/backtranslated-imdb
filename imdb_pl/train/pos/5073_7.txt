This documentary drama is what you can expect from Richard Attenborough, the man who gave us "Gandhi": beautifully photographed, convincingly cast, well-written in a measured, literate way that Hollywood rejected in the 1930s and meticulously accurate. It stands out as a genre film, distinguished as a portrait of a native American (or, more appropriately, for its Canadian scenery, culture of the "First Nations") and standing with "Black Robe" as a wonderfully photographed piece of Canoe Country and its culture (here, circa 1934 ). This idyllic portrait draws drama from his subject: Archie "Gray Owl" Belaney, a Scot raised in Hastings (England) by virgin aunts who were obsessed with the story of a "red Indian" from childhood, who went to Canada, disappeared into forests and became a trapper and adopted son of the Ojibway team. He was a vain man with a habit of marrying and abandoning Indian fianc√©s, none of whom seemed to think less of him, because he was also an extremely charming and quaint character. One of his wives (one wiser than him, according to most accounts) pushed him to fame as a writer and early advocate of protecting the wild North country, and this is the subject of Attenborough's story. The chemistry between Brosnan and Anna Galipeau (as Pony's wife, Gray Owl) is addictive and, if not fiery, is quite touching. A good movie when you need some time out of a crazy crowd.
