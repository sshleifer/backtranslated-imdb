This film is an extremely funny and moving story about an orphanage that has financial problems. When the director goes on vacation, his dad agrees to temporarily step in to lead things. <br /> <br /> This is the best job Leslie Nielson has ever done. His idea of ​​borrowing children is immediately innovative, and his sales techniques will certainly make you laugh. <br /> <br /> The little girl in this movie is so cute and adorable that I know I will never forget her. Just make sure you do not miss the first five minutes of the movie! <br /> <br /> Such great family entertainment is now so rare. If you go for a bit banal photos with happy endings, go for it! I could watch it over and over again and often do it! My only complaint about this movie is that it's so hard to find a copy.
