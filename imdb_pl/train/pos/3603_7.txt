"Girlfight" is more than a story about puberty, than it is a fight movie. What a relief to have someone in a city school with naturalistic, realistic Latinos and credible use of Brooklyn design settings. <br /> <br /> I realized that virtually all Hollywood school movies are embedded in luxurious suburbs or small towns. (Even somewhat comparable "Love and Basketball", which focused on African-American teenagers, was set in the suburbs.) While these children have the same problems with their peers, these problems are shrinking compared to other struggles of these children, where graduation can to be the most important achievement of their lives. <br /> <br /> The feminist element here is delightfully original when you hold your breath to see if it can have a relationship - and victory - on its terms. Many audience sympathizers go to a guy who has a challenge to meet the expectations of sex bending. <br /> <br /> The movie is a bit stretched here, but it's not cheap emotions "Rocky" fight the film, because the practices and fights have complex results and all relationships - especially with fathers and father characters - take up more space than the ring central. <br /> <br /> At the end there were many interesting music tracks, but I did not really notice the songs. <br /> <br /> (originally written 10/7/2000)
