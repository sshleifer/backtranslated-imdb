I love the knobs and brooms so much that every time I have great pleasure, I see a cry of a thousand tears of joy. I would also like to repeat the simple fact that I love him so much. Too many people said. I have 27 copies on video and I love them all equally. I also love anyone who loves it. I love you. My favorite scene is the dance scene on the portobello road. I've learned dance moves and I practice them every day. I have several sound recordings in which I sang a song. if someone can play the drums or guitar, I think about creating beds and brooms. I hope to call it "knobs". love me (lyse)
