The pilot really liked me, he was as amazing as I expected, if not better. Patrick Warburton was a rebellion, although at first I thought I would not be able to bear his character. He and Megyn Price did not have any chemistry at all, but hopefully they would feel more comfortable as the season progressed. It must have been weird that Megyn went from being the star of her last performance ["Grounded For Life"] to being a star. <br /> <br /> Bianca Kajlich and Oliver Hudson seem really new in the Sitcom scene, but I think they'll improve over time. The character of David Spade, to my surprise, was not the main target of this pilot. The way he delivers his lines is so different from the others I've seen on TV, but I think it's just his style. It works for him. <br /> <br /> I think that couples, and even singles, will be able to refer to all doubts and fights and are not sure of their decisions that this series is about it. All situations in which heroes are placed, just feel like in real life, are not covered with sugar, like most concerts. <br /> <br /> I hope that for all actors, CBS will give them a chance. This show has the potential to become one of the best series if we only get the chance and the time.
