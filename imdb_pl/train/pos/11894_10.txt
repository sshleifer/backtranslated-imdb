A really charming heroine who is surprised and terrified by giblets, struggles with mattresses, runs to closed doors ... only a few moments that shine in my memory "Naked truth". I LOVED what I caught from this program: pleasantly crazy threads and some good supporting characters provided the setting for the diamond of the show - Tea Leoni as, "Nora Wilde"; sweet, clownish and wonderfully vulnerable - how refreshing is the view of an actress who can clown - no wonder Hollyood does not seem to know how to cast it. But where-o-WHERE are the DVD releases? The amount (bleep) they release is amazing that this little gem is still buried. (Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.)
