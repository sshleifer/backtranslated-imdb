This document has been aired on RTE and BBC in the last few months. Seeing it twice, I recommend it to anyone who is interested in the media and documentary. <br /> <br /> Initially, this document aimed to elaborate the political life of Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez. The Irish crew set off with these intentions. What happens when they reach Venezuela is surprising because they witness the first attempt by Chavez and his government to overthrow the rebel faction (especially oil companies in Venezuela). What we viewers see is the way the media manipulate the situation and, in effect, support Chavez's overthrow by distorting events that arise when the coup d'Ã©tat gains. <br /> <br /> It's really a great document and an extraordinary piece of work for a few beginner filmmakers. <br /> <br />
