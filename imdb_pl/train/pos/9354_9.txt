As someone who has never agreed to Adam Sandler in terms of talent, as it happens to him and many comic actors like him, I entered Reign Over Me, expecting a great movie, not only because of his presence in the film, but because that I thought it looked good overall. Even someone who already thought that Sandler could deliver an effective drama performance, writes here that I was surprised at how fantastic he is in it. He will make you cry, especially in his deliberately sudden and unexpected monologue. Incredible in his role is that it is a character hard to say that we saw earlier. We have seen many emotionally scarred characters, many mentally handicapped people, many loners, many enthusiasts of egocentric artists, but Charlie Fineman Sandler is none of them. Maybe in every respect it has the taste of each of them, but its character is really unpredictable and completely individual. It is a joy for the audience, which is emotionally drawn by him and can be pulled in by anyone, whose problems, way of thinking and provocations are completely different from most of the characters like him. <br /> <br /> Don Cheadle delivers interesting performance on a completely different level. He is every human. He is the most normal person in the world, so much so that you will hardly find many characters like him, or at least those in which Alan Johnson plays, whose name can be found even on the assembly line. Cheadle is brilliant in that he is funny, shocked, smart and stupid like many normal people. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is inhabited by actors and actresses who for almost a while did not do anything in smaller but quite colorful roles. Jada Pinkett-Smith is an overly sophisticated middle-class wife, Donald Sutherland is an impatient but surprising judge, Robert Klein is a father-in-law sensitized by Sandler. <br /> <br /> Mike Binder's script is quite brilliant, because he says something very deep about the miracles of communication in all its forms. It is much more subtle than, say, Babel, and has a much more ideal home. <br /> <br /> The camera is interested only in the reality of his paintings, in contrast to the usual style. This movie hit me as a kind of reference to the style of the 70's kitchen sink. The cinematography was grainy and detached, but it was her charm. It was not about attracting us to the camera itself and the gloss that would disrupt her stories like that. <br /> <br /> Music, which plays the main role in the film and its title, is very powerful. At first you feel like in another soundtrack "About Schmidt" or "Little Miss Sunshine", but you quickly realize that you have more than that. In fact, the movie is full of music that stimulates many of the most emotional scenes. <br /> <br /> Reign Over Me is an important statement not only for society, but also for the film itself. It shows that even director Blankman is capable of miracles.
