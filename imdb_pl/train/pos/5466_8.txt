A great, pre-coded amoral tale with Barbara Stanwyck as newly inspired (by Nietzsche's writings!), To deny her sensitivity and use herself, to use people in her favor. Not exactly righteous towards the German philosopher, but interesting that Hitler came to power this year. Stanwyck, not even in this young version, does not do much for me, but he certainly does a good job of leading himself and the movie forward. Not so much here on the body, as might be expected, but a lot of risky situations and amazing jokes and innuendo. Great fun, if not a particularly attractive presentation of men, and I suppose that with all honesty it is not a very attractive view of a woman digging gold. Still life!
