THE RUNNING MAN, along with TOTAL RECALL, is my favorite film by Schwarzenegger. No, this is not 2001, but it should not be like that. And the acting and screenplay are not even comparable with other Arnie's films, such as PREDATOR or TERMINATOR. But I'm saying that the idea for this movie is one of the coolest ones ever to hit the big screen. A state-sponsored game show in which criminals convicted of serious crimes compete against "heroic" persecutors armed with all kinds of weapons (runners are not equipped with any) to satisfy the audience's desire for sport and blood. The best reward for the winning runner: freedom. Or so they say the rules. <br /> <br /> In the case of a movie with such terrifying scenes of death and tacky single-minded, really has a lot to say. Someone else has pointed out all the comments on the culture / government presented in this video, so I will not read it here. Suffice it to say that if you look beyond the seemingly stupid feeling of the movie, you will be very happy with it (especially if you are a huge SF fan with a lot of imagination). As I said, it does not try to be a serious artistic film, but it is surprisingly layered for shooting from the 80's. The premise is borrowed from a short novel by Richard Bachman (aka Stephen King), but quite different from the source material, especially at the end. (The book ends rather nihilistically, needless to say that this movie does not.) I liked both, but I like the movie. <br /> <br /> My favorite line: "Guess it's caused by steroids."
