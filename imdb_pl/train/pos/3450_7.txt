I have never heard about this movie before, until I saw a rented DVD, but I'm a bit skeptical that there have been many films in the past with good casts that can not do anything bad, and in some cases they do not seem to <br /> <br /> Well, just watching this, there was no reason not to give this movie a cinematic release, it's good. A story like this in the genre can sometimes seem a bit forced, but it seems that there is also a lot of realism here that allows for momentum. I was pleasantly surprised at how good the work of Justin Timberlake has such an important role here, OK, he is not yet an Oscar material, but he will learn with each role and show MUCH promise for the future here. Dylan McDermott was also incredibly good at his unexpectedly nasty role and he is definitely the cream in this film. <br /> <br /> In the end, just give it a rest. You will not be disappointed, you will not get bored, I think you will be more than happy with the final result.
