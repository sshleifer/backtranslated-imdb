That would be much better if it were created as "Mitchell in Malta". At least we would not be spared the sight of Joe Don Baker running through the picturesque Mediterranean premises dressed in this absurdly looking cowboy outfit ... not to mention behaving like a gunman from the Old West. Mitchell is Mitchell, the film would not suffer because of unjustified police brutality. Well. At least the comic comments from Mike and the bots have made this pleasant tariff a stretch of MST. However, I can not imagine watching it myself.
