I really liked this movie. I have seen several films from the Gene Kelly series and this is one of his best. Actually, I would put it over my more well-known American in Paris. Sometimes it seems that history is lost in Gene Kelly's movies to great dance numbers and songs, but not in this movie. It is definitely worth renting.
