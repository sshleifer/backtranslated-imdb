I do not understand how this program is similar to OC. <br /> <br /> First of all OC focuses on teenagers and their parents trying to survive life. North Shore is hotel staff who try to manage the hotel and at the same time lead a social life. Second, OC is done in California. North Shore takes place in Hawaii. <br /> <br /> And why should Fox show up like one of his other programs on the same network? I think it's a great performance with good actors for the most part. Has a good storyline and story. I like events that happen and how people deal with them and work on them. The last episode was surprising how this story went. It was not predictable, like most stories at most concerts. <br /> <br /> I hope Fox keeps him in the air.
