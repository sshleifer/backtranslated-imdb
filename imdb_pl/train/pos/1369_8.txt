I loved this movie and I'm one of the older people who should not enjoy it, or at least it seems. No, this movie is not deep - who cares? These kinds of movies are never. But what's strange, there is a message in it. This is because each of us has the potential to be whoever we want to be. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey is great in this movie. I always thought she had some resemblance to Katharine Hepburn. So it's great to see that both Hepburn and Posey did videos about librarians (Hepburn's to The Desk Set). All librarians, especially those with a sense of humor, should see Party Girl. <br /> <br /> I gave this film 8. This is by no means a great movie by film standards, although there are some good photos in it. But he is incredibly charming and funny.
