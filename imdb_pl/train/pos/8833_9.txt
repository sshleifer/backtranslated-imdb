I was intrigued by the title, so during the small attack of insomnia (driven by my curiosity ...) I stayed and watched him. Then I checked the TV list and watched it again! There is one very obvious consciousness that came to my mind when I saw this film - despite politics, tradition, culture, etc., teenagers everywhere are practically the same. Figures of children from Belgrade could be transported to, say, somewhere in the American Midwest at the same time, and linguistic differences aside would be impossible to distinguish from other local teenagers of that era. Certainly they showed the same growing pains and worries, politics aside: music, sex, movie idols, music, drinking, sports, music ... Actually, the same as my time growing up in Southern California. <br /> <br /> It was a bittersweet story, but the joy of youth made her very pleasant. The heroes, especially the young actors, were also completely credible. I will not say that it was Yugoslavian American Graffiti, but I will say that it matches other 50s-themed films.
