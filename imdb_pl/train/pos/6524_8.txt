<br /> <br /> If you are interested in pirates, pirate movies, American history of New Orleans / early 19th century or Yul Brynner, watch this movie for yourself and decide for yourself. Do not be discouraged by various weak reviews. My reaction to being funny, well-preserved (for the most part), has a very witty dialogue, and that the charm, attractiveness and legendary fascination of the privateer Jean Lafitte are great. Although not all of the events in the film are historically accurate (can you show me any historical film that goes this way?), I think the film is apt in treating the role that Lafitte played in the history of New Orleans and love - I hate the relationship between 'respected "Citizens of New Orleans and this outlaw who was one of the city's favorite sons. Do not worry about what the movie does not do, but watch what he does, that is, for his study of one of New Orleans and the most intriguing historical figures in America.
