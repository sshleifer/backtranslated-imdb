A good western filmed on the rocky wilderness of Arizona. A lot of tough guys; Coberna's figure seemed to sway back and forth between a raging psycho and a relaxed type. There were a few holes in the picture, but not enough to balance what was exciting and worth seeing. One really stupid scene shows that Heston empties .45 boxes of powder and collects them in a sack to start a fire. A. To collect enough powder, he would need a parcel mule to carry ammunition. B. The grass was obviously dry: why not drop the match on it and not rip it?
