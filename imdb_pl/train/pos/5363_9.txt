This is a classic action movie from the 1980s, in which Arnold Schwarzenegger plays one of the most memorable roles. Set in a futuristic police state in which the government controls everything, including TV networks. One of their most popular TV shows is The Running Man, where convicted criminals are hunted down and killed for the entertainment of millions. It's set like a game show in which the public votes for their favorite "stalkers", trained killers who hunt and kill the unlucky "participants" of the show. Members of the audience also win prizes for the correct prediction of who will be killed by whom. And the host is no one else, like Richard Dawson of Family Feud, who, thanks to the experience of quiz shows, is great for this role. When Ben Richards (Arnold) is falsely accused of mass murder, he is forced to play this sadistic game. <br /> <br /> This movie is full of classic one-line Arnolds, such as his famous come back "just before entering the arena. And he sneers with a stalker armed with a flamethrower with the help of "How about the light?" I could continue and continue, but I do not want to spoil the movie. These are funny things! <br /> <br /> Regardless of whether it was intentional or not, this movie is a great parody of today's "Reality TV" madness. There are already many programs that show people suffering from pain and humiliation for entertaining entertainment, and even lawsuits are broadcast on television because of their "entertainment value". Running Man shows what would happen if reality TV hit the bottom and it is a frightening picture. One can only hope that the networks have common sense not to let it go that far. <br /> <br /> In general, it's a funny movie and I highly recommend it. 9 out of 10!
