I think that I usually approach comedies at film festivals with little expectation that they will always be "bizarre" and that any intended humor will be derived only at the expense of the simplicity of the character in the face of a complicated context. What was special about Big Bad Swim is that the director was able to maintain the integrity and development of his characters in his film, while finding laughter on the stage on the stage. It was sophisticated, maybe also partly due to the hard work of DP, I rarely saw in indie film, and even less often in comedy. Special note here: Brewster Paget's turn as Amy a math teacher. After watching this performance, I can not understand why Brewster was not "discovered" by a larger audience. It brings the necessary mix of anger and sympathy to the role that really helps this image to achieve its potential. It's a great job deserving a bigger audience. I am waiting for more from the director and this cast!
