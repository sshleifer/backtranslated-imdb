My boyfriend and I really liked this movie. The viewer is swept away from modern life in old Japan and at the same time exposed to very topical subjects. The characters are realistic and detailed; it has an unpredictable ending and a story that is very refreshing. The story consists of mini-stories from the lives of several geishas living together in a poor neighborhood of the city. I highly recommend this film to anyone who is interested in a realistic romance or life in old Japan. <br /> <br />
