That afternoon we took the kids to the cinema and saw Neil Gaimans star dust and all I can say is Wow. <br /> <br /> It's rare that I'm totally surprised by anything, but it's probably the biggest fantasy movie I've ever seen, maybe even the best movie of any kind and all of it Neil Gaiman's fault. <br /> <br /> Sure, I could have been drawn into a wonderful dialogue that was clever, fluid and made figures completely reliable. <br /> <br /> I could talk about spectacular acting for a few days, Charlie Cox is perfect as Tristan, Claire Daines is Brilliant like Yvaine, and Robert Di Nero almost steals the movie as Deep in The Closet Pirate Captian Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> Pure joy resulting from humor that was fun for our speakers, smart enough to make the first Shrek look like a sitcom from the 80s and perfectly blend in with the rest of the movie itself would be a great movie. <br /> <br /> The special effects were almost perfect, t rue it was not LOTR or Star Wars SF Extravaganza, but where they were used, they were exactly what you needed, not too much to distract you from the film itself and blend in perfectly with the story. <br /> <br /> Then there is this story? What can I say. How often do you come across a tale containing all the classic elements of a fairy tale formula that not only falls out as another cheap counterfeit Princess Bride. It manages to be familiar and comfortable, and at the same time completely new and refreshing at the same time. <br /> <br /> Each of these things would make it a good movie, all combined together make it a great movie, but they're pale compared to a rich, charming world that combines these elements to make a good one revive. Once again, Neil Gaiman did it, stabbed another dagger into my dagger, creating a fantasy world that is so beautiful and charming that I would do almost anything to live in it and give it only a brief glance. I did not want it to end, I wanted to be sucked through the vortex to the land of Stormhold and meet personally with Tristan and Yvaine, to travel through the fields and valleys, walk around the fair and meet with both dangerous and friendly people and stay there for always. It's the feeling that I noticed when I read anything from Gaiman, Sandman, American gods that Coraline left me with deep sadness when I finished reading, because it ended, I saw nothing more in the worlds that he created, seemed much more alive and live than the ones in which I have to live, and watching Star dust was not different. <br /> <br /> In the end, I'm sure Neil and the film will not have the same impact on everyone, but trust me when I say that you will not regret the time or money spent watching this movie, it's with Certainly one of the 5 best films I've ever seen and I can guarantee that everyone in the soul at least likes it.
