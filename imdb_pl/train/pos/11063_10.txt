I was impressed by "Waitress" Shelley Adrienne (2007). This movie only confirms what was clear about this movie. Adrienne was an extremely talented writer-director, an original and exceptional artist. She managed to show the misfortunes of everyday life with absurd humor and a real warm optimistic and humanistic tendency. Ally Sheedy is stealing this movie with an amazing performance as a woman who fell off the edge. Reg Rodgers, who looks like Judd Nelson, is doing well. There is also a great episode of Ben Vereen. The song at the end of the movie "The Bastard Song" by Adrienne can become its optimistic praise: <br /> <br /> "To the world of suffering, <br /> <br /> In the sea, pain, <br /> <br /> Regardless of how much sun you bring, <br /> <br /> Padasz na deszcz ... <br /> <br /> Do not let without heart, take you, <br /> <br /> pozdrawiaj bezdusznych u thych drzwi, <br /> <br /> Do not live among the soulless
