This is a better adaptation of the book than the one from Paltrow (though I liked it too). It's not that Beckinsale is better - both are very good - but the script is better. Davies is a master in film adaptation of Austen, and production values ​​are very good here. It is not as shiny as in Hollywood, but it is close and I thought that places and costumes actually work better.
