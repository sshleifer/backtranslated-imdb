We often talk about cinema relics - Kane, The Godfather, A Bout de Souffle. However, one film is often overlooked by "serious" film critics. Of course I'm talking about the classic Doc Savage (M.o.B.) <br /> <br /> This film is not only exciting, but also seriously investigates the problem of the exploitation of nations developing through US imperialism. Not to mention kung fu. <br /> <br /> He also had the biggest soundtrack in film history (up to the breathtaking work of Queen on Flash Gordon). Although this is a bit of a rarity, this movie is worth seeking - it will return your search effort tenfold.
