This is a collection of documentary films that last 11 minutes 9 seconds and 1 frame from artists from around the world. Documents are diverse and deal with all kinds of concepts, the only thing that is shared, is topic 9/11 as a topic (in some cases very small). Some segments are weak, while others are very strong; some are political, others are not; some are only about September 11, some just use 9/11 as the subject of the touch of universal human feelings, emotions and tragedies; some are mainstream, while others are abstract and artistic). This film has not been censured by anyone in any way, so the thoughts you see are very raw and powerful. <br /> <br /> It's a very controversial movie, especially for conservative Americans. I believe that two segments can really fend off right-wingers (one from Egypt, where a dead American soldier and a dead Palestinian bomber return as ghosts, another from Britain who talks about the US-backed overthrow of Chile on September 11, 1973, which resulted in 50,000 death and terrible atrocities). The Mexican segment was the most powerful, telling about the fall of towers and the resulting death in a lively style (you have to see it to believe it). <br /> <br /> Even if the end product is uneven, some segments are almost "pointless", I still recommend it. It is very difficult to arrange this movie, because the segments are different in different places (some weak, some very strong;). I give a rating of 9 out of 10, because some segments were excellent and included issues that are usually censored (Mexico segment, UK segment, Japan segment, Egypt segment).
