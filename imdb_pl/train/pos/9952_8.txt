Before watching this movie, I thought this movie would be great as Flashpoint, because before watching this movie, Flashpoint was the last movie of Jenny Jameson and Brad Armstrong, who I watched before. When it comes to sex scenes, I was disappointed, I thought that Sexual scenes from Dreamquest would be great as sex scenes from Flashpoint, but I was disappointed. With the exception of the sex scene of Asia Carrera, every sex scene in this movie does not make me feel great (you know what I mean). Wonderful Jenna Jameson does not do such sexual scenes of what she is capable of. Felecia and Stephanie Swift both these charming girls disappoint me the same way as sexual scenes. <br /> <br /> Although it is an adult movie, but if you skip these sexual scenes, the movie is very good. When it comes to typical adult film standards, this movie has definitely raised the standards for adult movies. History, acting, directing, sets, make-up and other technical elements of this film are really great. The actors of this movie did a really good game, they all did a great job. Dreamquest definitely raises the bar for the quality of adult movies.
