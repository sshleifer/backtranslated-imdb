I love this movie, it was a very interesting fantasy film b / c the real meaning of the family in it, the history of our country, the action packed in the movie. I watch time on the summit around 4 X a week and I just love it! I regret that there has been no continuation to see more of Susan's father in the past and watch Susan delt with his younger sister and have no phone, computers, computer games or anything from the 21st century. I hope that everyone liked the movie as much as I do, I think it can be said that I am sometimes at the highest fanatic and I do not mind. The little boy in the film Robert Lincoln Walker was simply adorable. I wonder who he is and how old he is today. Does anyone know if he has played in movies or TV shows?
