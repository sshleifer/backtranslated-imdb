I see what my ancestors saw in the youthful Bette Davis. It works great in this almost crazy comedy in which Warren Williams plays the role of a political actor. Vivienne Osborne is brilliant as his former team and I've been supporting her all the time. Williams's character is not at all nice, and he is not even a decent op. <br /> <br /> Guy Kibbee is one of the best at what he does. As a candidate, he got out of sleep on a political convention and was appointed governor to prevent a rival candidate from being nominated, so all this mess is caused by an internal political war in a party called the "Progress Party". If you're a political mind, you'll probably see a party different from the one you're associated with in Williams' and Kibbee's fictional Progressive Party. I could draw exact similarities, but we're not here for it. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie for those of us who love these old comedies. If you've ever watched some old Wheeler and Woolsey titles (HALF SHOT AT SUNRISE, THE RAINMAKERS), you'll find Frank McHugh as Williams' right hand, looking and behaving very much like Bert Wheeler. He told me to cheat. <br /> <br /> Yes, both my wife and I recommend this one.
