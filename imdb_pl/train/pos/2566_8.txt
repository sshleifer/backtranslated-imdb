Any film that deals with bigotry in a positive way is a film that should be perceived by the current audience, because the message and moral of this story will always be relevant, as long as we have a world full of fanaticism. <br /> <br /> In addition, the movie is really an old-fashioned love story .. a boy meets a girl ... guys lose a girl ... a boy gets a girl back .... <br /> <br /> The weakest role is late Kent Smith as Lieutenant general Webster (Riccardo Montalban is close) ... my question would be how he ever became a three-star general ... the character is such a wimp in the presence of his wife and military subordinates, it's a miracle that they turn out at all him respect. <br /> <br /> Brando's south accent is a bit exaggerated, and some scenes have a few holes, but overall, I like this movie every time I see it. <br /> <br /> Red buttons are great ... I always love to watch comedians in dramatic roles ... as in the case of Button, often a comedian can better present the tragedy of a person than a more traditional ramatic actor.
