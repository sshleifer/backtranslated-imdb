I was very interested in watching this movie when it first appeared in cinemas, but I was not able to get around it. Eventually he hit the shelves and picked them up. Not knowing exactly what to expect, I threw the dvd into the player, settled on the evening of murder and pressed play. What happened next was one of the most immersive movies I've seen in the last few years. <br /> <br /> * SOME SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> This is the story of the Wonderland murders that led to the most seedy parts of LA and straight to the biggest porn start in the '70s, John Holmes (Val Kilmer). <br /> <br /> I was addicted to the beginning, and the impression of the movie kept me up to the very bloody end. I was surprised when I saw that the film was less focused on actual murders, and more on the events before and during the investigation. Apart from a few bloody walls at the beginning and the actual showing of the murders at the end, the film was more or less an engaging show of great dialogue and great acting. Val Kilmer, but he sells me as a porn star, and even "beautiful, but that's all" Bosworth was a joy to watch (and only for her appearance, remember) <br /> <br /> Personally, I felt the best aspect of the movie was, as I mentioned , no direct display of murders. It was shown in a very dark atmosphere, so you could not completely see the brutal plunge in the four-point feeling. In addition, the sound effects of these murders were more than enough to exacerbate my appetite. They beat with lead pipes, there is nothing more to say. <br /> <br /> My only real problem was the short look of Carrie Fisher. Her image of an overly religious figure was, I think, a bit too stereotypical. Maybe this person was actually part of the story, maybe not, but I was not sold and for some reason Fisher seemed a bit too "accented" in her image. <br /> <br /> In general, an excellent movie worth watching, even if once! <br /> <br /> *** 8/10 ***
