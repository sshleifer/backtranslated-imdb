This masterpiece of the lesbian horror comes from the master of exploitation of Joseph W. Sarno. It contains a lot of soft sex, really hot lesbian sequences and many naked women. Acting is quite good, and the film is quite moody and well done. Forsa is one of the hottest chicks I've ever seen in horror - it's a visual pleasure to see her wonderful body. Sarno really knows how to pick up hot ladies. Must be for sex fans!
