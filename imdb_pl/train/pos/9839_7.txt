Hmmm, yes, this episode is extremely unappreciated. <br /> <br /> Even if there is a lot of bad writing and working on parts. I think a good victory wins. <br /> <br /> I love parts of origami and a big "turn" at the end. I love this scene when Michelle confronts Tony. This is one of my favorite scenes in season 1. <br /> <br /> For some reason people have always hated reincarnation episodes, but I always liked them. They are not the best in terms of writing. but the subject really interests me, <br /> <br /> I will give him THREE stars, but if the writing is a little more consistent, I will give him FOUR.
