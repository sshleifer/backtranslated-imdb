This is not the most successful television project that John Cleese has ever done, the "Strange Case" has the impression that the first project was put into production before making any changes. There are a few stupid ideas, and even a few clever, but the whole story unfortunately does not add up much. <br /> <br /> Arthur Lowe, however, is hoot, like Dr. Watson, bionic pieces and everything. "Good Lord."
