Although the main story is to take place in Morocco, this film was shot in misty Romania within 18 days with a very tight budget. However broken their cards may be, actors and crew play them with amazing skill and commitment, so that in the end I found a moving effect as well as graceful. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau provides amazing performance as a bad guy. The script and direction provide jewels. Regardless of whether you like the movie or not, it will probably depend on your role in the title role of Alexander Staden. Other reviewers pointed to Staden's shortcomings as Modesty Blaise. They may be right, but I found her interpretation to be wonderful and very fitting. Modesty manages to overcome terrible chances through discipline, innate talent and courage. It seems that Staden does the same.
