The need for Serbian or at least Balkan knowledge to understand and enjoy the many situations, characters and jokes from "Zavet", as well as from many other Kusturica movies. See, for example, opening scenes with an outlying village in the Serbian mountains, low-tech devices that defend the integrity and way of life of the inhabitants, longing for good days of communist rule, and awakening the young brother watching the naked teacher to the sounds of the Soviet national anthem. Kusturica not only tries to depart from the tragic history of Serbia described in his previous films, but also creates the whole world of himself in this process. <br /> <br /> This is not a political film, nor a clear political movie in any matter. It is above all a funny movie. Kusturica creates a set of characters on which we care. Music plays an active role in this film, as in all other films. His style is direct and grotesque, now what he feels about his characters and we know that he wants us to feel the same. The space he creates combines the present, history and magic, and the colors appear to be from Douanier Rousseau of contemporary cinema. <br /> <br /> This is also not a perfect movie. The main disadvantage is length, some edits and shortening would be useful, because at some point the director seems to have run out of ideas and replays. This is one of the most catchy, funny and moving movies I've seen lately.
