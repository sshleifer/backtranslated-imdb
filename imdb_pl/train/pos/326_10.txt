"Jag är nyfiken ?? Yellow "is great fun. As at least one other reviewer, I laughed a lot. Yellow is energetic, funny, self-aware, exploratory. Do not expect Bergman here. This film tells about youth in the early 1960s in Sweden and about problems, reading * the contradictions * faced by the nation and the world. Sometimes Yellow seems to be a serious socio-political document, with Lena, the main character and other people interviewing both ordinary people and politicians (eg Olaf Palme at home). Another time, Yellow seems to parody this kind of document. At all times, Yellow acts as a personal document exploring the life of Lena - her family life, her love, her political views, her view of herself. Is she a complete person? complex, defective, contradictory, happy, sad, interesting. Above all this is the wonderful additional dimension of the director, Sjöman, and his crew documenting themselves documenting Lena. It really gives me yellow wings for me. Not only do they suddenly appear in very funny times and funny ways, reminding the viewer that this is fiction and artificiality, but their presence is in itself another layer of the film; they film themselves. Reminds me of the Bjork video of the same quality? music video about making a music video, ad infinitum, with each iteration more and more weird and more cartoon. I think Sjöman might have meant something similar. Although "Jag är nyfiken ?? Yellow "may not be a cup of everyone's tea, it is certainly intelligent, witty, refreshing, impulsive and authentic.
