As everyone knows old enough, South Africa has long suffered under the base racist oppression of apartheid, which completely subjugated the black population. One of the best-known activists against apartheid was Steve Biko, who was murdered in prison. After the assassination, reporter Donald Woods wanted to give Biko a message to the world. <br /> <br /> In "Cry Freedom" Woods (Kevin Kline) befriends Biko (Denzel Washington) before he gets arrested. When Woods tries to spread the word Biko, he and his family begin to live under the threat of an attack, and ultimately are forced to flee the country. In the last scene, the gut-up show shows that the police are firing at the protesters. <br /> <br /> As one of two films (along with "A World Apart"), which helped stimulate the anti-apartheid movement, "Cry Freedom" stands out perhaps the best that ever works for everyone involved.
