THE BEAVER TRILOGY is undoubtedly one of the greatest films ever made. I was lucky to be able to catch him, along with a question and answer session with director Trent Harris, at the NY Video Festival a few years ago, and then I bought a copy of Trent's website. This film MUST be seen to be believed! I sincerely recommend that you search for Trent's name on the Internet, and then buy a movie from his site. He is an amazingly nice guy to start. Do not be wrong: the operator in the fictitious sections of THE BEAVER TRILOGY is NOT Trent! <br /> <br /> After watching TRILOGY several times I must admit that I could probably go without Sean Penn version. It's like the tried-and-tested version for Crispin Glover's Orkly Kid and is more interesting as a position with curiosity if you're a Penn fan than a good movie. Penn is however quite funny and you can see the makings of a big star in this sharp black and white film. <br /> <br /> This is probably one of the best roles of Crispin Glover and I would just like to see an updated version of the original Groovin 'Gary document. When you see this movie, you'll never have Gary's nervous laugh again.
