I seriously loved the movie ... I started reading the book and I loved it ... the way everything was set up and everything had its purpose ... I think this movie was so good because Louis Sachar wrote the script. and of course, Andrew Davis directed ... Shia Lebouf gives a great performance for her first movie ... the story is very cool and interesting ... it's humor, heart and intensity ... it's very similar to the book ... I think this movie it is not the least boring ... I absolutely loved it ... and I encourage everyone to read the book ... all in all this film is very well made and carefully made ... two thumbs for me in every respect
