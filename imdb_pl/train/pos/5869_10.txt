after seeing "Deer Hunter", which is a masterpiece, the movie "Jacknife" had large shoes to fill. It has the same motives as The Deer Hunter, devastating effects for a person after the Vietnam War. Robert De Niro is in this movie, as in The Deer Hunter, and he's very good here, like Kathy Baker. But this film belongs to Ed Harris, who gives a strong, emotional and influential performance. The film is based on a stage play, and there are one or two scenes where it was obvious to me. I just mean that for those one or two scenes I felt like watching the scene. It was not such a great event, and it does not really reduce the movie. This movie is not an epic like The Deer Hunter. They are about a similar age and have similar themes, but these are two very different films. He thought Deer Hunter was great, and I think that this movie was great. in what makes him so great. For me, Jacknife is 10/10
