For the first time I heard about this film after the purchase of the movie "Snuff" from 1976. I was told that Devil's Experiment was much better, so naturally I went further and ordered a set of guinea pig boxes. I really wanted to hear that Charlie Sheen went out trying to ban this or the second movie, so my interest was the highest. <br /> <br /> Devil's Experiment is a short film with no history, no character development. Only 3 men torturing a woman for about 45 minutes. They torture her in various ways, such as Beaten, shoot her over and over again, then force her to drink alcohol, forcing her to listen to noisy sounds for 24 hours, smashing her hands with a hammer, smoking and putting worms burns, throwing in her guts and eventually punching sharp needle in her eye. <br /> <br /> I have to say that a lot of this movie was fake, like a beating scene. But then some of them were well done when it comes to disgusting you. Scenes in which the woman turns around, make me dizzy. Or the scene in which she is forced to listen to loud noise for 24 hours is painful. The scene is the worst. I did not look at it when I watched it, but I just thought, "Damn, it looks pretty good for such a low-budget movie." I was fascinated by the movie, but I do not know if I can really recommend it, unless you've seen most of what the horror genre has to offer. 7/10
