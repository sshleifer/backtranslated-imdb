This last Voyager episode will start 23 years in the future. Voyager returned home. In the many years needed to return, the mind of Vulcan Tuvoks was destroyed. He had a disease that was coming home too late to heal. <br /> <br /> Captain Janeway encounters strangers who have time travel technology. He realizes that there is a Warp Wire in Delta Quadrant that can immediately take Voyager home - if he can go back in time and tell Voyager. There is one problem. Conduit is deep in Borg Space. <br /> <br /> Janeway visits Tuvok. He is like a child. He's scribbling, obsessed, working on math problems or film reviews or something like that, he's convinced he's somehow important. At the institution Tuvok is crying, asking for "Janeway", please come back to him. <br /> <br /> Janeway decides to take control of the federal ferry and equip him with weapon technology 20 years ahead of Borg, hopes of going back in time and using this new technology to lead Voyager to the Warp Channel. <br /> <br /> When he goes back in time and joins Voyager, Janeway meets a younger person. The two captains disagree, they argue about the plan. A real captain visits Tuvok by asking him if it is true that he has a brain disorder. Tuvok admits that this is true, but he can not be cured by using devices on the ship, so he kept it to himself. <br /> <br /> The young captain agrees with the plan of senior captains. To increase her chances of success, older Janeway plans to pull Borg away from her shuttle. Borg actually takes over Janeway and her shuttle. Queen Borg personally assimilates Captain Janeway. But Janeway expected that! Queen Borg learned a virus that kills her. With the killed Queen Borg Voyager, she makes her way through the Warp Channel back into the federation space.
