When the scientist and man from the family Matt Winslow (Robert Urich) finally accepts an invitation to work at Micro-Digitech Corporation in a space suit project, he moves with his beloved wife Patricia (Joanna Cassidy) and their son Robbie (Barret Oliver) and daughter Chrissy (Soleil Moon Frye) to a huge modern home in a corporate complex. They meet with their friend Tom Peterson (Joe Regalbuto) and his family completely adapted to a new way of life, and Tom invites the Winslow family to join the Steaming Springs Country Club. Tom tries to seduce Matt by telling him that every member of the club has an instant professional erection at Micro-Digitech, but Matt is not tempted by the offer. He is later presented to the club's director, Jessica Jones (Susan Lucci), who befriends Patricia and convinces her to join the club with the children. Matt feels a change in his family's behavior and decides to explore the club, finding the wrong secret about Jessica and the members. <br /> <br /> In the 1980s, when I saw "Invitation to Hell", I liked the movie, which partly resembles "Wives from Stepford", with people changing behavior in the suburban complex. I just saw it today and found a great metaphoric message against big corporations when people literally sell their souls to the devil to climb positions and earn higher salaries. I am not sure if the author intended to give this interpretation a story, but I believe that it fits perfectly. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Convite Para o Inferno" ("Invitation to Hell")
