this movie is a masterpiece of the story of a young woman during the war and it really happened, not exactly like in the movie, but it's a great story, I was impressed by the movie, the acting and the story I like the movie because it's a real story I feel I have been there and I regret my confrere, whom Maruschka Detmers plays, because who wants to end his life this way. I recommend everyone to see this film, special young people and learn something from this film. In this film, you can compare a bit of a soldier's movie with oranges or any real story from World War II.
