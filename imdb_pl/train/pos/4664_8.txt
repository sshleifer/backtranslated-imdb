"Hot Millions" is a lovely comedy that is even better thanks to the presence of a wonderful cast. The film is a tribute to the genius of Peter Ustinov, who wrote the game on screen and appears as a key figure of an entrepreneurial embezzler. Directed by Eric Till, the film does not show signs that he died as terrible as some others from that period. <br /> <br /> In the center of the action there is a friendly man, Marcus Pendleton, who sets up income tax forms for the headman before being released from prison, who is amazed at the return of the government. Marcus, who is a genius of numbers, sees opportunities where others would not. He starts working for a company that uses the latest accounting computer, but Pendleton is a resourceful man who finds a way to use the system and set up different fake accounts in different parts of the continent. <br /> <br /> Marcus has an assigned secretary who also has a flat in his building. Bumbling Patty works as an accepting bus fare, which manages to spoil everything. The way he lands as a secretary is incomprehensible, but the office never happens the same when the frightening Willard Gnatpole decides to follow her, but do not be afraid, Patty's heart belongs to Marcus, who is a great pianist, and she is a flutist and together they create beautiful music. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the film is Peter Ustinov. He clearly understood how Marcus should be played and run away with the movie. Mr. Ustinov gives some account of embezzlement. Outstanding Maggie Smith is also in the best shape when it comes to patty, a nice woman who adores Marcus and who turns out to be a genius when it comes to investing money in Marcus' pockets. <br /> <br /> Karl Malden is perfect as an American responsible for the corporation. Bob Newhart also appears as Gnatpole, a man who wants Patty, but can not force her to reciprocate. The wonderful Robert Morley is seen as Caesar Smith, whose identity he founded Marcus. Cesar Romero also appears in the episodic role of the customs inspector at the airport. <br /> <br /> "Hot Millions" will delight anyone who is looking for fun in the company of this distasteful but charming character of Marcus Pendleton.
