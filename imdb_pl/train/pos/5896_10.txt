A really great movie and a real story. Dan Jansen The biggest skater in history. A moving and beautiful movie that the whole family can use. Jane Jansens's fight story with cancer and Dan Jansen loves his sister. From the important promise made by Jansen to get the gold medal to prove that his sister Jane is right, believing in his rapid skating talent, it was justified. This picture is worth the time. I would like them to do more films of this quality. Thank you for a great movie with excellent actors and great history. It is a very moving story about the beautiful support of the family and faith for their children and a special dream for their youngest son and his sister.
