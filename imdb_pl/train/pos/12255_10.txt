Spate of Austen movies from the 90s is my favorite, more than "Persuasion", which turned me into Austenian. Before I saw this "Emma", I saw two previous versions, but in one Emma she seemed completely angry, more like Lady Teazle, and in the other she seemed half wrong, like a potential cheater, while here she seemed to be fine, young and stupid and stubborn. In general, I thought that the attitude and atmosphere of production perfectly reflect the charm of the novel; in fact, it is one of the sweetest, most merry things I have ever seen, or rather in the form of a festive feast. The script is unusually well-formed, and the adapter accessories, such as the ball of light that reveals Harriet Emma in the church, are fine. Mark Strong as Knightley is not what I would expect, but I loved it: it strongly emphasizes the simple, practical side of the character, unlike Emma's feelings, and his outbreaks of cholera against Frank Churchill are quite funny. Bernard Hepton makes Mr. Woodhouse a figure of almost Carolyan absurdity; Samantha Morton as Emma's protege is just as soft and as firm as it should be. And just as in the "Duma and prejudice" of the same producers, it is ensured that you can believe in possible combinations of characters - in some cases, exceptionally. For me, this production was and remains a joy.
