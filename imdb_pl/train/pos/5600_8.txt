This is my kind of movie. I'm fascinated by strange psychotic nightmares and this movie is just like that. But it is also a dark comedy. Although I see it mainly as a horror / thriller, there will be others who can see it as a black dramatic comedy. <br /> <br /> But anyway, it's a fascinating descent into madness. The ending surprised me, but what an end! This leaves the viewer a lot to think about. <br /> <br /> Powerful performances, a complex and detailed plot, a great script full of terror and a bit of humor and an amazing atmosphere make this film worth watching. br /> <br /> Personally, I think that I will have to observe it several times to understand and understand all the subtleties that are inside. But this movie will be a pleasure, not a duty.
