I must admit that when I read the description of the genre on Netflix as "Steamy Romance", I was a bit skeptical. "Steamy"? In the movie from 1968? I was prepared for disappointment. And when I realized that it was filmed entirely in black and white, I knew that my erotic hopes were broken. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was wrong! This film not only contains all the elements of a steamy romance - the discovery of the first love, the fear of revealing the secret, a sudden unexpected end - but sometimes the movie was simply erotic. Soon you will forget that it is filmed in black and white. Photos deserve every distinction they have received over the years. And the performances of two stars (Essy Persson and Anna Gael) are intense and unforgettable. OK, so they're both around the age of twenty trying to play school girls. It is 1968. Do you really expect that teens from the 60s will be able to effectively discover such a lesbian love story? Many adult women have still tried to cope with their sexuality. Anyone looking for real teens here expects too much. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is ahead of its time. The level of eroticism was an unexpected pleasure; however, we still managed to leave a lot of imagination, choosing instead to give us poetic descriptions that we will add to what is shown. <br /> <br /> I have no doubt that lesbians will identify with the heroes here. As for you guys who love to watch lesbians in action: Although it will not be all you expect, I do not think you too, too disappointed.
