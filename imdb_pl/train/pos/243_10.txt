Definitely one of my favorite movies. The story is good, the acting is great, all technical (especially the photos) are sharp and the script is clever. <br /> <br /> Heath Ledger is wonderful as Edward '' Ned 'Kelly. He is addictive like a legendary outlaw, and he is supported by Geoffrey Rush, Naomi Watts and Orlando Bloom. All action sequences are in place. <br /> <br /> The film is the edge of your place to the very end. One of my favorite movies from the late legend Heath Ledger, which was the highlight of every movie he played. And he does not make a mistake here. <br /> <br /> A great movie all around.
