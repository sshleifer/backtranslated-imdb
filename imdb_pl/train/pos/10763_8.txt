I must admit that I was very skeptical about this document. I expected it to be a kind of American propaganda that we do not like so much in Europe. I was wrong. This is NOT propaganda, in fact it is not political at all. <br /> <br /> Presents the events of September 11 through the eyes of firefighters called to the stage right after the break-up of planes. It's an amazing coincidence that this documentary was filmed at all! This film was originally shot as a documentary about a novice New York firefighter who became a "man". We can only thank the filmmakers that they continued their work during the horrible trial that met them. <br /> <br /> Great work. Absolutely stunning material. I would highly recommend. <br /> <br /> Best wishes,
