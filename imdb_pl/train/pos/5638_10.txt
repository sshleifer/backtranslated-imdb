I really liked this movie. Britney is a great role model for teenagers and should be more appreciated. This film tells you about following your dreams and never gives up no matter what people can do or say to discourage and criticize you. Holly fulfills her dreams like Britney. <br /> <br /> There are moments in the life of everyone when people judge them for who they are not, who they are. Watching this movie will make you understand that you are unique in your own way and that you should follow your dreams no matter what happens. <br /> <br /> I'd like to thank Britney for encouraging me and my friends to follow our dreams. He will never know how much it means to me. Bravo Britney. You're the biggest !!!
