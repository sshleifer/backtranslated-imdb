Although Stardust appears to be a fantasy film with predictable ending and average performances, it certainly is not. When I saw the movie, I knew it would be one of my favorite movies. And I was right. <br /> <br /> Stardust is more a fairy tale than an adventure movie. It has this magical "aura" from the beginning to the end of the movie. The plot is well written and keeps you on the edge of the seat. Like every story, it has a bit of morality. Therefore, we know in our hearts that evil brothers will not pass to the throne, but an innocent boy who manages to overcome every obstacle and difficulty he encounters during his journey. We also know that true love is Yvaine, not Victoria, a material girl who is shallow and manipulative. <br /> <br /> I must give you extra Claire Danes points. Literally shines in this movie. Her eyes have that glow that completely fits her character. What's more, she and Cox have a chemistry that makes romance in the film even more noticeable. The rest of the cast are well-known actors and actresses, which of course make Stardust an interesting and "highly classified" film. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is FANTASTIC, magical locations, and the plot is interesting. he was very disappointed that the film was not nominated for further awards. I have to give at least 9/10 stars for it.
