I saw the movie for the first time when I was about seven years old and then I was absolutely delighted with it, but over the years I was unable to find out what the film was called. Now I'm twenty-one and by accident I came across a movie about two weeks ago and bought a copy. although my memory of the film was a bit vague, I was not disappointed with what I saw. the animation in this movie is a great conjure up of the whole world, which is so credible and so well animated that you are drawn into this movie yourself. But this movie also has a story that will enchant and entertain adults and children. with a floating island, a crazy general, a friendly pirate grandmother and a well-constructed love story, this film will not disappoint you. I would recommend this movie to anyone.
