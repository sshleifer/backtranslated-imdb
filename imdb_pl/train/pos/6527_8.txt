The document begins by setting the perspective to several light years. The traveler travels our milky way with the sounds of our earthly life, as a cosmic monument for (possible?) Extraterrestrials. <br /> <br /> The documentary includes the film material of Willy Dixen, Robert Johnson, Skip James and J.B. Lenoir. Material from J.B. it has never been published before. The story comes from the "blind Willi" Dixon. However, this is done by the actor. The film shows the work of all these early blues, and then covers and interpretations of musicians, including Nick Cave and bad Seeds. <br /> <br /> Death J.B. Lenoir (John Mayall's song) is a striking event in history. Lenoir was politically involved and is considered a member of Martin Luther King and his peers. His political interests can be found in the topics of his texts. <br /> <br /> Blues was considered the native music of "THE" America. Blues are the roots, and the rest are fruits. <br /> <br /> The title "Soul of a Man" comes from the song of Willie Dixon.
