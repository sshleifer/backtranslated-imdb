If you love iconic science fiction from the 70's like me, or if you like movies like "Repo Man" or "Buckaroo Bonzai", then you'll love this one. It is a stream of sci-fi consciousness from the 70's, including the scrap yard from the 22nd century and the Earth for a million years. This film is pure from the '70s. Create "Fly Like An Eagle" by Steve Miller or Pink Floyd's Dark Side Of The Moon and you're ready!
