It was provocative to the soul! I am an Iranian and live in the 21st century, I did not know that such great tribes live in such conditions in my grandfather's time! <br /> <br /> You see it today, and even in 1925. On one side of the world, a lady or child can have everything that is needed, clean and on demand, but here 80 years ago people dared to go somewhere with more grass. It's really interesting that these Persians have difficulty finding a pasture for their sheep, but they lose many sheep on their way. <br /> <br /> I praise the Americans who accompanied this tribe, they were as tough as Bakhtiari's people.
