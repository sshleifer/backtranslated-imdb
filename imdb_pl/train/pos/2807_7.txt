I caught the last part of the movie through the cable one night and it struck me how morbid it was. Even if one of the two victims is the most damaged, the camera still works. the exposed shots of his corpse and his concentration camp, fastened with a body bag, are both mobile and depressing. do not watch this movie if you're already depressed. then do not watch it again if you feel really good.
