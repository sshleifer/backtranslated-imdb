I really enjoyed watching this movie. It has a great direction, already known by Bigas Luna, born in Spain. And in Spain, the film takes place in Catalonia, or more precisely. <br /> <br /> Luna once again discovers the subject of obsession, in this case the obedience of a young boy for women milk. In this story there are some psychological concepts, such as a rejection complex that the older son feels after the birth of his brother. In the film, this leads to the obedience of a young boy who suddenly sees his mother's milk, which goes to her recently born son. So she begins to look for a breast that can feed him. This is found in a recently arrived woman, and from that moment the film is everywhere. <br /> <br /> This film lives a lot on the pictures, more than on the story itself, the espectator records certain moments (unforgettable moments) and certain symbols (the film deserves to analyze almost everything that happens because it usually means something .. .). Surroundings, landscapes typical of the region, as well as the surrealistic characters' behavior, also symbolic, and Nicola Piovani's fantastic ambiguous soundtrack move us to another dimension, not parallel to the real world, but cutting it from time to time ... It is worth living in this world , it's worth to watch this movie, although in the end and for a while we can get tired and get overly obsessed with something that maybe exceeds the limits ... <br /> <br /> I also liked the performance of the hero ... 8/10
