This movie is probably my favorite movie of all time. Miriam Flynn is excellent as Bunny Packard. Zane Buzby as Delores is a comical genius. The rest of the cast is amazing, and the movie is really funny. A vast satire of horrors, with a bizarre accent. If you like fun, evening full of comedy, go and rent this classic. You will laugh all the way!
