Another Spanish film about the civil war in 1936. This time we are talking about the story of Carol (beautiful played by the debutant Clara Lago), a little girl who lives in a small Spanish village from New York. It is such an initiating journey and will soon discover the injustice of the human race, their stupid fights and conflicts, their contradictions. <br /> <br /> Imanol Uribe creates her best film since "Días Contados" (1994) with such a sober pulse, beautiful photography and a pretty script. Trying not to take part in the conflict, he just shows us a few facts and lets us decide (ok, the facts are clear enough for us to decide which team we're in) and he has a huge advantage of the presence and freshness of a young couple of stars: Clara Lago and Juan José Ballesta. <br /> <br /> Well-groomed production. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7/10
