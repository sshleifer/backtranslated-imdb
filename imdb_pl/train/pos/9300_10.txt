I do not know much about Rat Pack, and Frank Sinatra always seemed a little too self-conscious. So when I call it one of my all time, it has nothing to do with the mentality of the tribute band. As another reviewer says, Mad Dog Time is symbolism, not realism. It's kafkaesque (it's a pity that Kyle MacLachlan is probably the weakest of the very strong crowd, when he was as good as Josef K), he is stylish, familiar, sardonic and slippery. Jeff Goldblum moves in different characters, trying not to be shot and behaving skilfully, not stupid, trying to keep up with what he knows and others not who he can outshine and which he can not. Gabriel Byrne and Richard Dreyfuss (his best game) have a ball, and the accompanying cast looks like it's on the spot. Symbolism, settings (one move outside with Jeff Goldblum coming down the stairs seems really strange after so many lizards in the living room), dialogue (style, not practicality, is the order of the day), it's all about character interaction, not really gangsterism. The fun to watch had to be fun. What critics wanted was really a secret ...
