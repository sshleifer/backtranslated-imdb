La Teta y la Luna is a symbolic film of Spain. Everything that is happening in this film has a symbolic meaning. It is completely different from a regular movie that has access. <br /> <br /> This movie is good, but it will be good only for people who want to search for the meaning of everything in the story of the film. I must advise that this is not a trial film. <br /> <br /> Enjoy !!!
