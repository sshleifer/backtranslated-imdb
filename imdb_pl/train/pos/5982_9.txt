One of my favorite movies. It has everything - rocking soundtrack, courtesy of Eddie Clark, ex Motorhead, lots of action, lots of laughter, totally funny plot and the greatest stereotypes of the 80s as heroes. Eddie, a nice guy who just wants to be alone, be different, Leslie (more or less so wet), Nuke (burnout), Eddie's mom (pathetic), Roger (geek) and Ozzy as a preacher (he certainly exists in America? ). There are also boys (rich, mean and stupid) and girls (free, vain and stupid). What more can you want? <br /> <br /> Well, first of all, there is Sammi Curr, a rock star, an amalgam of every 80's rock that you can think of. What about this rocket-shooting guitar? Then there's the scene where Sammi pulls the old woman through the TV screen and breaks it. And what does Roger do? Why, vacuum it, just like a good geek. My favorite scene is that Tim Hainey receives his long overdue reward from Sammi using a wet finger in the plug - magic! <br /> <br /> If you were in rock in the 80's or just liked funny movies like me, then check it out. It is available on DVD and very cheap, so (trick or) treat yourself.
