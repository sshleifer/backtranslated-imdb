Flock is unjustly denigrated as a smaller "Se7en". There is really no reason to compare these two, except maybe similar scenery in the final showdown. <br /> <br /> Now that this is not right, I will say why Flock is very interesting in some respects. It is mainly a drama, not a full blown thriller with a very vigilant social worker who monitors sexual offenders. At the very beginning you can clearly see that his work is better than him. This is clearly seen in two scenes where he first interviews the criminal and pats him, and the other when the woman tries to pick him up, and all he can come up with is his standard questionnaire. <br /> <br /> Gere is very good like Errol Babbage, the social worker mentioned above. His way of doing work is no different than the way a policeman works, he wears a gun and constantly checks newspapers and provides information to lawyers if some of his "flock" may be responsible for a sex offense. She is also a person who has lost all happiness of life, and the only relief seems to be forcing her flock to be alert. Twice you see him smile, once when he apologizes for treating his partner rudely, and the second after he beat a member of his pack. <br /> <br /> As a flirt, Flock is not as effective. A bit confusing and with annoying holes in the story, but it has a lot of striking sets. <br /> <br /> In general, Flock is a solid drama about a man doing dehumanizing work and in the end he has to work hard so as not to be absorbed by the abyss in which he was surrounded. The world we live in is a sick place and the more you can get away from the worst, the happier the person is. Flock does it nicely.
