FORBIDDEN PLANET is the best SF movie from the golden age of SF cinema, and what makes it a great movie is his admiration. As soon as the spaceship lands, the audience - through the human ship crew - travels through an intelligent and sometimes terrifying adventure. We meet unforgettable Robbie, the mysterious Dr. Morbuis, his beautiful and innocent daughter Altair, and we find out about the old inhabitants of the planet - Krellach, who have died out overnight. If they? <br /> <br /> You can take a look and say that the planet is of course shot in a film studio with painted backgrounds, but it adds a sense of threat to the claustraphobia that I feel, and electronic music Bebe and Louisa Barron adds even more atmosphere <br / > <br /> I am shocked that this movie is not in the 250 best IMDB movies.
