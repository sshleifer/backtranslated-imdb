I was a little too young for it, but I had to see it. There is great music that many people have mentioned, but no one seems to notice the very rare performance of "Angel", now ignored, but once quite a popular music outfit. Wearing white, characteristic outfits, they polish the "Foxes of the XX century" and apparently everyone is trying to squeeze into the field of view of the camera. Keyboard player Gregg Giuffria remains the main attraction of the bands and apparently has never achieved too many hairstyles! Cherie Currie (ex-Runaways singer) begins here a short but notable acting career and is remembered along with Jodie Foster and the rest. (Her topless three-dimensional scenes in "The Passenger" and her UFO sightings in "Wavelength" kept us all for some time). <br /> <br /> This is not a masterpiece, but it keeps a piece of his period that everyone would stare at him and wonder.
