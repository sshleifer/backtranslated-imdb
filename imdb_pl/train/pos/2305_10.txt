I thought it was a very good movie. It would be nice to see a little more in the movie about two sisters who know that everyone likes the same boy before he was killed. I am sure that if the film was made in this way, it would be a very different ending, which is why it made the film so good. This shows that no matter what happens in your life with your siblings, you can always get to it and that if it is 2 sisters who are dealing with a boy (the same boy), then work on pain and pain makes things seem better and easier to work out between them. It is nice to see love stories that have horrible things in the life of someone that you can still get to when it's even closer when you finish it. I really enjoyed watching this movie and I'm still doing it now when it appears. I think I watch him every time he turns on. It would be nice if there was part 2 of the movie, perhaps having an older sister who will come and give birth to his child, it would really be a great end to this story since he died, that way he would be alive, though he is dead.
