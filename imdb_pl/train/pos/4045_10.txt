I am glad that I have the opportunity to see this rare little jewel of the film. I saw it at an independent film festival, so do not expect it to come to your city soon. During the film, I noticed that about 10 people get up and leave. It is a pity for them (here in the south people do not like reading subtitles). The film starts slowly, but it is so rich in dialogue that I have never been bored. When the action finally arrives, I found myself glued to the screen as if I was riding a roller coaster. <br /> <br /> I also got large copies of chapter titles appearing before the chapters, especially those that introduce characters that appear on the screen. It reminded me of Zelda (Ocarina of Time) when you face a level bossom. <br /> <br /> If this is the future of the "video games / comics" movies, I welcome.
