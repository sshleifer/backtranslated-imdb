Great Woody Allen? No. Good Woody Allen? Definitely. I found myself, together with the audience in attendance, laughing hard and often on some of Woody Allen's best lines that we've heard for some time. Aging Allen created a proper role for himself as "father" Scarlett Johansson ... well, in a sense. Some have said that Johansson plays "young Dianne Keaton." I beg to differ. He plays Woody's dialogue, which in his comedies always has a very similar atmosphere ... like Woody Allen's comedy. It's fine for us. She certainly had Woody's dialogue much better than the young cast of his last comedy Melinda / Melinda. Some may think that Woody's mood is tiring, but for those of us who love him, when he's doing well, we're waiting for the next ones.
