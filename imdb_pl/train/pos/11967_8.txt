I do not know if it is a sitcom or not, but I agree that it is one of the largest television programs in history. It's great that this program is still being broadcast. And I love Michelle. She's sweet in episodes when she was a kid, and she talked and sometimes she said something funny. Aw. <br /> <br /> This show may apply to children and teenagers and ... well, families who struggle in difficult times and try to work out as a family. I do not know who would ever reject the possibility of watching this program with someone. <br /> <br /> I love this episode when I think my name is DD ... an older girl accidentally stole a sweatshirt and learned a lesson about theft. It was a great episode. An example of which television program shows a family working as a family. <br /> <br /> I recommend this program to everyone.
