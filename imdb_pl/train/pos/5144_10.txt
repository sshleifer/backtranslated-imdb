This very strange movie does not resemble anything that was done in the west at the time. With its turbulent emotions and the network of visions, dreams and surprising images, its effect is both beautiful and disturbing. The actors are choreographed more like dance than acting. It contains the only sequence of dreams known to me, which in reality resembles a real nightmare (sorry, fans of Dali).
