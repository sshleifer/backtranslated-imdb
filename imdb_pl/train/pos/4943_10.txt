This is the simplest film production and is the best. <br /> <br /> I had doubts because although Freeman is a great actor, he sometimes engages in bad projects; This is not one of those times. <br /> <br /> It's a small story that lasts just over an hour and a quarter, when we're getting used to the fact that movies are getting longer and not necessarily better, the director uses that short time in his favor, because the characters they are so well defined from the very beginning (great portraits of Freeman and Vega by the way) that some information on them seems real, Morgan is himself, although his name is not mentioned, he has not been in the movies for several years, because he was saturated with business and he was afraid to engage in the script, and doing research for a character in the indie film in which he plays the store / supermarket manager. The story starts with falling into a supermarket in a rough neighborhood, where the cashier meets 10 items or less (Vega) and must take part in the ride, because "production" forgot to pick it up. br /> <br /> In many respects this is a road movie, Morgan provides laughter and quirks with his invincible smile and a positive look at everything, showing a talented actor who has trained his mind to be able to define everyone he sees in the character in which he could play, and Paz (by the way, what an extraordinary beautiful woman, even more beautiful than Penelope Cruz) brings the vulnerability of a 25-year-old woman separated, who works harder than everyone, without getting any loan at the end of the shit supermarket. <br /> <br /> It's talkie, there are a lot of dialogues, but the balance between light and fun and seriousness and sadness is well maintained, the characters become so loved right away that you spend the last 20 minutes asking for more time on screen s A strange couple, but the shortness lies in the nature of the story, so a good director was not giving up.
