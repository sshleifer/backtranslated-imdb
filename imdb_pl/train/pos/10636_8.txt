This story is a complex and wonderful story about the last harem of the Ottoman empire, well-told and provocative, we see the internal functioning of the world that has already passed, and we meet the people who lived there. <br /> <br /> I liked history, characters, acting and scenes. Several scenes suffering from fast editing, and the titles sometimes disappear too quickly, otherwise it would be a great piece. <br /> <br /> The main character of Safiya is wonderfully played by Marie Gillain, which I am happy to say, she did a fantastic job without over. Scenes with her and Alex Descas (Nadir) are cute and charming. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch something less Hollywood-like and more authentic for the world that they imitate.
