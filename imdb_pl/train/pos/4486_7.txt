SPOILERY <br /> <br /> Tom and Jerry is a classic cartoon with an impeccable idea, and almost every single abbreviation is a jewel. Although I must admit that this is definitely a worse comparison compared to other classic Tom and Jerry pants, there is no way to hate this cartoon. Of course, it's understandable that this is one of the worst episodes of Tom and Jerry and I can say that I agree, but the fact is that all episodes of Tom and Jerry are great, but some are simply better than others. It would match "others". <br /> <br /> Here is the plot of Fraida Cat. Tom listens to the old horrific radio show and is easily afraid. Jerry observes how afraid he is and tries to scare him even more than he is. He creates terrible dilemmas for Tom, and Tom will get scared of cunning and life. Then Jerry puts the sheet on the vacuum cleaner and controls it, making it look like the vacuum is a ghost. Tom learns that Jerry has done all this and chases him. Tom accidentally bites the maid. In the end, however, Jerry ends up getting scared when he sees his reflection in a mug of flour. <br /> <br /> In general, this is far from the best in Tom and Jerry, but it's still a fun and fun piece of time. I would like there to be more such cartoons. Slapstick and gags in what makes Tom and Jerry famous are as good as always in this short one, but it seemed that something was missing. He felt slower than most of Tom's and Jerry's shorts. In any case, this is a good shortcut that does not match the other cartoons of Tom and Jerry, but it's still cool. <br /> <br /> 7/10
