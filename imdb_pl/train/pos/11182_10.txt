I am quite a big fan of most of the films based on Stephen King's books - this one is considered one of the most terrible and memorable. <br /> <br /> I just finished watching it for about a tenth time and I still think it's a heartbeat as well as frightening. <br /> <br /> The scene in which Gage is on a collision course with a monster truck is one that stands out. And "No fair" spoken by little Miko Hughes at the end is a bit of light. <br /> <br />
