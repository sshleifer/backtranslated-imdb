In this satire of commercialization and the "light joy" of the war, John Cusack plays Brand Hauser, the killer sent to "Turaqistan" to take Omar Sharif, who is doing business with oil, which will cause trouble for the former vice president of the American company. In addition, Hauser must juggle his fake position as a fair producer, the wedding of the pop princess Yoniki (Hillary Duff) and the meddlesome journalist Natalie (Marisa Tomei). <br /> <br /> Evaluation of technical aspects: <br /> <br /> - Acting (at least by the main characters) was good, as could be expected. Some of John Cusack's dialogues apparently were not written for him, because it often seemed uncomfortable. . . maybe unrealistic is more accurate. Joan presented a wonderful and often funny performance. Marisa Tomei, though I've never been a big fan of her, she was more than adequate for this role and she worked well. But Hillary Duff was terrible. They needed an attractive Middle Eastern (or Russian or any other accent) pop-star. Unfortunately, they went with her 0 for 3. <br /> <br /> - As I mentioned, writing seemed a bit stiff and unmatched in points, especially in John Cusack's dialogue. Not much, mind, but some. The story also became somewhat absurd in points, which is good for satire to some extent, but it took a whole new level. Fortunately, Cusacks and Tomei keep a relatively cool, calm attitude all the time, and that makes even a mix of movie madness and the undertones of the actors cool. <br /> <br /> - Joshua Seftel, who previously had a real credit drought for his name, did a great job in a wide-spectrum film. He managed very well with a small budget (10 million dollars), stretching him to look much more. Seftel also managed to combine the humor of the story nicely. . . with painful and difficult to watch parts of a real war (including civilian slaughter, etc.). <br /> <br /> - As for the general satire, its exaggerated look at the commercialization of the war is very well done, especially the advertisements of "Golden Palace Poker" on American tanks. At some point it becomes a bit too much, but in the end it is still an accurate presentation of what will happen to the style of the young "Mel Brooksa". <br /> <br /> In general, the film is very well done for a modest budget and is definitely worth seeing. It will not fall as one of the great satires of cinema, but it is certainly not the worst. <br /> <br /> 7/10.
