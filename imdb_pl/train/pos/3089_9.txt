I got attached to it because apparently ABC licensed Pearl TV in Hong Kong. This surprised me because it was a break from listening to anything Chinese. But I started getting involved because the cast and feature lines are new enough and thoughtful enough. Nothing too incredible, although I think it's very stereotypical to write Damien as a potential black man with a sheet !!!! It was the most disappointing aspect. The rest is great and I'm sad when I found out about IMDb that I can not wait to see season 2 when I come back to the USA. I am just as disappointed as other commentators who have shown a lot of promise, quality and taste. But just like shows showing that the characters are approaching, it is probably more difficult for people if they start watching a few episodes. This is probably too late for willing networks.
