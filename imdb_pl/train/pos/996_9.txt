This movie surprised me. Some things were "trivial" and some technological elements reminded me of the film "Enemy of the State" with Will Smith in the lead role. But mostly very funny - a good mix with Jamie Foxx and comedian Mike Epps and 2 would-be hoodlums Julio and Ramundo (providing comical relief). This is a movie that you can watch again - say ... some Wednesday night, when nothing else happens. I gave him 9 for entertainment.
