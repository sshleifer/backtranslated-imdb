I just came back from the projection a few hours ago and was very happy with the movie when I left it. It is very intense, and the next one I have been crying in a movie for some time. This is due to Adam Sandler, who provides great results on many levels and who probably deserves an Oscar nomination if he did not show up so early this year. Don Cheadle gives his usual, excellent performance, playing a simple man with Adam's anxiety. <br /> <br /> There is a bit of humor, but most of them are really fun compared to tearing moments, because Adam deals with his loss and Don tries to help him. Adam plays very well on two levels ... when he is mentally stable, he is funny and lovable, but when he is, well, the less stable is powerful and dark. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to anyone who likes intense mental dramas about difficult friendship and loss.
