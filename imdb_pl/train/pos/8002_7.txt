I have seen Maslin Beach a few times - both on free television in Brisbane. I will not wonder if it is good, bad or otherwise, because others describe it well and well. <br /> <br /> I will say it is so Australian. Only in Australia we can have a film about the relationship between people spending the day as naked as they were on the day of their birth and watch it in free commercial television. <br /> <br /> I have a friend from the USA who is still amazed by what we put on our free television compared to her home country. Sex and the CIty and Huff are just examples. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that our government is trying to transform us into the 51st American state, it's good to know that at least some things remain truly Australian
