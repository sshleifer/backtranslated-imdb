Joan Fontaine is "Damsel in Distress" in a musical from 1937, starring Fred Astaire, George Burns and Gracie Allen. The plot, as a result, concerns a British woman (Fontaine) in love with an American who is confused with Astaire, the star of musical comedy. <br /> <br /> The film directed by George Stevens contains Gershwin's wonderful music, including "Nice Work if You Can Get It" and "A Foggy Day". The best scene is the number "Stiff Upper Lip", which takes place in a fun home. <br /> <br /> The Astaire singing voice sounds more solid in this film than in others, and he has some excellent dance numbers. Burns plays his best publicist, and Allen is Burns' secretary. She is funny. The problem, as others have noted, is Fontaine, who must dance with Astaire at the end of the movie. Stevens could easily use the double, because it shows the dance in a long shot and takes place among the trees. I thought it was double, except that the dance was so bad. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing despite its flaws.
