I do not think anyone apart from Terrence Malick and perhaps Tran Anh Hung would make cinema on a cleaner level than Claire Denis. That said, I do not love this, her latest film, just like her masterpiece from 2001 "Trouble Every Day" (though it's very close), which in itself is one of my favorite movies. That's just because the narrative here is probably a bit elliptical because it's good. Do not get me wrong, the fact that this movie does not have a story at all is really one of the best things, but I think Denis took it a step further than it needed, so the movie flirts with incomprehensibility and a few key points of the plot should be somehow explained (as the main character goes to South Korea to transplant the heart, instead of just showing him there suddenly, without any explanation of where he is and why he is there). Also some other characters seemed unnecessary and as if they were excuses for Denis to re-use the actors he likes (especially Beatrice Dalle's character is a bit distracting, because you expect that it will matter). Despite this, the film is incredibly addictive and the photos are amazing. It's definitely a masterpiece in its own way. At least as good as Denis 'highly praised Beau Travail', if not better. Claire Denis must be my favorite French director at the moment, even better than Leos Carax. I must also admit that the sequence from South Korea really does "Lost in Translation" better than the movie itself (and I, unlike some, am also a big fan of this movie).
