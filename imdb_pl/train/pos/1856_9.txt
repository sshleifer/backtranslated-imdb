He glorified himself as a great supporting actor in "Glory", proved that he is not the average actor "Malcolm in the middle" in "Malcolm X", showed his brotherly love for acting in "Philadelphia", he drew the slam dunk in "He Got Game", he did not bring out blows and shook us like a hurricane in "The Hurricane", he provided us with thespian education on "Training Day" and now he showed that he can also direct! Directorial debut of Denzel Washington "Antwone Fisher" is the most moving film of the year. This tale of tearing fish has nothing to do with the fiasco that occurred in the Miami Dolphins in the fourth quarter against the New England Patriots in the last game of the 2002 season. Unlike the Dolphin tragedy, "Antwone Fisher" has an emotional, joyous conclusion. The film is based on a true story of a young naval officer who has trouble managing anger because of the abhorrent suffering as a foster child. Denzel plays a naval psychologist who helps Antwone overcome his rage and convinces him to find his natural mother. Derek Luke's debut performance as Antwone is the best admirable action I've seen in a beginning actor at some point. Actually, I saw some of Luke's idiosyncrasies I saw in previous Washington performances. It was as if Washington was saying Luke, "la la la Luke, I'm your acting father." Well! I will free Star Wars jokes before my readers send me to a distant galaxy. Speaking of the great Denzel, his work as a psychologist was masterful. But what can you expect from the actor "Master D" himself. "Antwone Fisher" was written by Antwone Fisher himself. Emotional pathos, which he placed in the scenario of his life, was the material of the "fisher king". Hello main "Mr." Washington "catching the right bait in" Antwone Fisher ". ***** Excellent
