Probably one of the best examples of following a tense, dramatic episode (in this case, a great Balance of Terror) with a lighter case, Shore Leave is the first real attempt on behalf of Star Trek writers to create a more entertaining sci-fi piece, and although the formula does not is still quite accurate in this post (the real triumph is Trouble with Tribbles, in season 2), laughter comes quite quickly, as long as the viewer is willing to let all stupidity. <br /> <br /> Turning away from the tradition of the series, the Enterprise is not in a proper mission in this episode. Instead, Kirk found the perfect planet for his crew to spend some free time: a well-deserved break after three months of continuous work. A planet-like land (budget-related fact) is very appealing, but it only takes a few minutes before something strange happens: Dr. McCoy begins to have visions of a white rabbit that seems to come straight from Lewis Carroll's work. Soon other people start to experience similar things: the woman meets a character similar to Don Juan, Sulu meets the samurai, and Kirk meets a double meeting with the past, in the form of almost love and the guy who used to choose him at the Academy. Put a weird looking tiger and it's easy to see why Kirk and Spock are determined to find out what's going on before anyone gets hurt. <br /> <br /> The idea is classic: it turns out that the idyllic place to be far from the sky. The funny shot of this episode is rather successful, is it not the dark turn of events that do not match the rest (of course, everything ends well again) and the general cast dislike to show the more fun side of their own (especially ironic, how funny William Shatner). And yet, Shore Leave deserves credit for another good example of writers trying new, previously invisible things: the definition of Star Trek success. <br /> <br /> 7.5 / 10
