I will be honest with you ... I liked the movie. It's a great zombie movie, full of action, original ideas, a good game, but it's also full of Zombie's bad effects. Part IV, entitled "After death" is also good. I recommend this film to horror fans around the world. <br /> <br /> 10 of 10 <br /> <br /> Horror fans of this type should check out Puppet Master, Skinned Alive, Slumber Party Massacre, Sleep Away Camp and other Full Moon Pictures.
