Recently, I started watching this program and I have to say that it really made me laugh. You must appreciate the unrealistic aspects of everything and everything else. Some others have said that this program should have, among others, more realistic responses from the dead. If you intend to accept the fact that Ned can bring the dead back to life, you have to accept that other completely crazy parts of the series. I could not stop smiling after every episode I watched. I really think it's great that there is a show that can take a very strange subject and really good to watch. I love the narrative, I think it adds a little extra miracle to the whole show. You can not always compare old writer's performances to his new ones, you have to take everything for your own being. Definitely give him a chance and just enjoy the funny parts as they are.
