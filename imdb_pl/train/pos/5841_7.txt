The story of peace-loving farmers and townspeople fighting for land, water, law and order, as well as respect and the ultimate subjugation of long-term cattle interests and their hired rifles has been improved earlier (Shane) and probably later movies well. There are a few good action scenes, and the overall layout of the story, except the disappointing ending, is well done. Law and order and religion have started the roots in the city, but the old order of cattle riders, cowboys and gunmen still exists. The collision of both occurs in a nicely organized ambush scene in which the burghers are trapped. Granger, a former shooter, plays a guy who is avoided by the burghers themselves who need his knowledge from the gun.
