Jackie Chan is considered by many film and martial artists as one of the biggest action stars ever to win a silver screen, and Police Story has established his reputation as the likely successor of the great Bruce Lee. If Enter The Dragon bared the so-called Lee splendor benchmark in the '70s, the same could be said of Police Story and Jackie Chanie in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> Forget the rush hour trilogy, or any of its efforts in the US - the only movie that truly characterizes Chana's perfection, not to mention kicking off the kicking and crushing kung fu talism, as well as his movie career, Police Story - the first in a series of successful policemen's films taking place in the continental part of today Hong Kong. <br /> <br /> I have seen many of his efforts - like the American Rush Hour, Rumble in the Bronx, The Medalian and The Tuxedo to name - and to be honest, many of them fade to mean compared to Police Story. In these movies, we saw a less "depressed" version of Jackie, who failed to use his combat abilities to the maximum, not to mention that the sequences of fighting were not as good as those in such efforts as Drunken Master, Police Story to name. <br /> <br /> The stunts in this movie are extraordinary and are the best in every action movie. The scene in the shopping center is literally one of a kind and one should believe in it: flying glass shards, Chan who hanging off the bus, only by a cane, madly running through the city streets, and Chan successfully using various inanimate objects and auxiliary devices as a weapon to fight evil people. <br /> <br /> Given that he is known for hurting and breaking every bone in his body and putting himself in danger, Jackie's persistence in showing his versatility as a stuntman himself, not relying on one, is a bit of a testament to his reputation as a kung fu expert. Especially that he has bruises on him. In this way, he proved that he is not a single pony when it comes down to inventing and inventing various and clever moves. <br /> <br /> There are not many stories to tell, but what is lacking in his narrative, he makes up for his sequences of actions and struggles. When it comes to dialogue, this is not really a big aspect of the movie - that's why most fans of Jackie's films and martial arts are more interested in the action than the story. <br /> <br /> Unlike The Matrix, there are no CGI cables or any other computer trick. What you see is what you get - and what you get at Police Story is the great epic game of Jackie Chan, full of action and pulsing stunts. It is much better than Rumble In The Bronx, Rush Hour and all of his other American efforts. /> <br /> Police Story is a great movie that I would definitely recommend to anyone who is a budding fan of Jackie Chan, but I'm not sure which one to watch first.
