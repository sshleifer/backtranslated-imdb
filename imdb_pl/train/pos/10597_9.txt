I recommend photos that try something different. Many films just seem to be a repetition of old ideas, so this is the main reason why I recommend the Passport to Pimlico so much. <br /> <br /> The film is set right after the Second World War, and the post-war shortages and rationing seem to drive the Londoners "barmy." The film focuses on a small district in London called Pimlico. They also have enough that they can not buy what they want, but they can not see it. That is, until they accidentally come across a hidden treasure and a card that officially named this district a sovereign nation many hundreds of years ago! This document shows that they can bypass all rations and coupons and live the way they want, because it turns out that there really are NOT British subjects! Where the movie from there and how the crisis will eventually resolve, you will have to see it yourself. Leave the genius minds of Ealing Studios to come up with this gem!
