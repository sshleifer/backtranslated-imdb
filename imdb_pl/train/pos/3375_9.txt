In this film, year 2022 looks just like the seventies. At the beginning it is fun, but soon the viewer notices how much this decadent futuristic world is different from appearances, how many things that we take for granted can become inaccessible. <br /> <br /> Characters often interact, without tact or manners and respect. I believe that this is intentional, not bad acting. After all, whoever witnessed social changes in the 1960s and 1970s can assume that until 2022, the overpopulated city folk behave in this way. <br /> <br /> Most of the action scenes did not please the priest: too cheap even in the seventies. The plot is not too polished. But great scenes and ideas - such as the death of Sol, the way the rebels and dead bodies deal with, "furniture" - outweigh the disadvantages of this film. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10.
