no movie with dennis hopper, gary busey, erika eleniak, tom berenger, dean of Stockwell, marilu henner deserves a rating of less than 5 here. This is a poor version of films such as 16 blocks or a timeless run at midnight, except that the prisoner transported here is very easy in Ms.Eleniak's eye. Tom Berenger plays well on another crazy, independent military type, and William Mcnamara plays his debut well. The plot at first glance is absurd, because I lost the count of time that Eleniak should have and could escape, but it is a funny movie with a good frame of mind and there are good scenes from all the above-mentioned actors who continue the film. This is not really a family movie, because there are some curses and a rare nude scene with eleniak, but it is much better than the other guffs that appeared at that time.
