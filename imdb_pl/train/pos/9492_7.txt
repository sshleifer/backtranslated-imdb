This movie was pleasant, but for the wrong reasons. Coordination of the action sequence is ridiculous and makes the movie have some fun moments. Robert Ginty and Fred Williamson have an unforgettable scene at the end, in which Williamson says to Ginta: "You will definitely go around the boy!". I liked the movie only with Ginta and Williamson, but not the storyline that had to be written on the back of the napkins in four lines, and the rest with ad-libbed most likely. A film with more than 30 parts has only a credit list of 10 or more. It seems strange that no one has recognition in the film, they could have an insight into the appearance of the finished product. The only thing that this film goes to is that it is quite violent, so three times in comparison with Fred Williamson and Robert Ginta they create a film worth watching.
