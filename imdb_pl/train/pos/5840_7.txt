Although the premise of the film is quite poor (he was diagnosed with "hornophobia"), the film is a nice and pleasant little film. It's also a bit better than the movies they did after that - probably because it was the last movie produced by Hal Roach Laurel and Hardy. In fact, it would not be a bad idea not to see ANY of their latest films, because all of this chemistry has gone missing in these movies, and the boys are playing their parts exclusively for pathos - something that the real films of Laurel and Hardy never do. They had some advantage, which was missing in later films. <br /> <br /> Stan and Ollie work at the horns factory. It sounds quite funny, but it is not. No wonder he has a nervous breakdown with the whole racket, and he has to release a bit from work. The doctor (James Finlayson - in his last film with the band) recommends an ocean cruise. However, they do not like sailing, and Stan has the idea to rent a boat tied to the dock - then they can easily get all the sea air they want! When they are on a boat, a dangerous man escapes, the criminal gets on the boat and everyone accidentally goes to sea. Fortunately, this part of the movie was really calm, and the end ended very well. <br /> <br /> Although it was not a great feature film by Laurel and Hardy, he was much better than many of them since then he did not have annoying and distracting music numbers (as in THE BROTHER THE DEVIL or BABES IN TOYLAND). In addition, there is still a decent amount of physical comedy - something you would not see almost after this movie. This was partly due to the decreasing health of the boys (and the growing circumference of Ollie), and partly because of the general nausea of ​​these later films.
