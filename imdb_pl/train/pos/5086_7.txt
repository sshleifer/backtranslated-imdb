When I heard that Patrick Swayze was finally coming back to his acting career with KING SOLOMON'S MINES, I was very excited. I was expecting a great adventure like Indiana Jones. I got an epic epic lasting 4 hours, which was very slow. The second and third hours could be completely removed, and history would not suffer. The end was good (no spoilers here), but I still wanted more. Anything a guy can do is get Swayze doing "RoadHouse 2" so he can get back to the action genre that made him famous. Until then, if you're a king of Solomon's fan, instead of reading a book or watching the 1985 version with Richard Chamberlain and Sharon Stone, which is also not very good, but her only hour and forty minutes passed instead of 4 hours.
