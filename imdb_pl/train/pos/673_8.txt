In all the great division, which we call understanding, there are many things that we do not know what the first tribal elders explained. In each case there are many risks associated with too much knowledge. And vice versa, there are those who warn us that we are not preparing for what they warn is "the time of the end". In this movie "The Last Wave", the indigenous native is murdered without any apparent reason. When those responsible are arrested, they are silent less than they disturb the order of things. David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) plays a defense attorney whose job is to defend the accused. Although haunted by prophetic images from his childhood and warned by modern signs that he gave him a sympathetic Aboriginal named Chris Lee (David Gulpilil), Burton proceeds to defend the offense as a tribal law, and thus is not subject to standard justice. The film is full of mysterious, dark, ominous images of apocalyptic catastrophes in the world and warns of the future tsunami and destruction on the island. Black drama and deep rituals make this film terrifying and therefore it is not intended for people with weak hearts, in fact the simplest haunting ghosts can survive years in the nightmares of innocent movie viewers. Good quiet drama. ****
