Wes Craven was created as the most successful movie about the killer-thriller of all time. After watching the movies you will see your new fears. People do not know which Wes Craven thriller movie is the best, because they are all different. <br /> <br /> In this movie, Lisa terrorizes a traveling companion. He forces her to kill, and if he does not, Jack will kill her father. Lisa is in a big mess, for whatever she chooses, she will kill. <br /> <br /> Acting was unrealistic. Rachel McAdams and Cillian Murphy worked incredibly well. Emotions were right. The idea and script of this film is also great ... <br /> <br /> Sometimes it resembles "Scream", but definitely better than both "Screams" sequels together. <br /> <br /> And what can I say - this is the best movie of the genre of deadly thrill in the 21st century ...
