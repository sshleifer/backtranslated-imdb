Forget about Neo and Bourne and all those half-baked modern heroes. They only look 12 years ago to please a wide audience of geeks who want to be their heroes. Since they can not be Rambo or McClane, or even Indiana Jones, Hollywood has allowed a few counterfeits that do not have a beard, but still meet teens wishing to see what looks like an action movie. <br /> <br /> However, their "action fragments" are simply painful to watch, and any girl can undoubtedly question her masculinity. This explains the repeated occurrence of old age on our silver screens over the last few years. For better (Rocky, Rambo) or worse (Die Hard 4 - where John McClane, get ready ... did not have a beard !!) <br /> <br /> I say that the time has come when the new hero appeared and finish their reign. This movie "Largo Winch" is far from perfect and perhaps too predictable, but at least Tomer Sisley gave a very promising performance as the hero of the action. And only once was he weakened when MÃ©lanie Thierry shaved his beard! I rest in my case. <br /> <br /> I did not know about it when I entered the theater room, but it could be a movie I've been waiting for for a decade. For the first time in France since Belmondo, whether the film can be well made and rooted in the B genre without flushing with its performance. In the meantime, all we had to chew was either a gigantic pile of dung or something too limited to reach a wider audience ... In other words, it was "Le Pacte des Loups" or "Dobermann" (I like Dobermann, remember) ... I think that "Largo Winch" has what it takes to be both a popular and a high-quality film. <br /> <br /> I was very happy with the theater hall and wanted more.
