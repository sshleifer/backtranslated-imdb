Very interesting. The great turmoil was not as much a shock as they might have hoped and was very outdated, but it made my mind work. It really made me think about a world without vegetation or livestock, and made me appreciate the world in which I live a lot more. Charlton Heston does a good job, as did all the accompanying characters, and it was a very realistic movie that was surprising. Sometimes he missed direction, and many settings and background needed more explanation, but it was still a surprisingly good and intelligent movie. The main disadvantage I could find was that I did not want the film to end when it happened, I would like to see what will happen next.
