As an adult at the age of about 40, I am not even close to any of the key demographics of Nancy Drew, but this afternoon I was pleasantly surprised by the film; so I could say that the pair of sixty-year-old silver-haired ladies left me. An elderly man who left the theater right in front of me especially praised the film for a woman of 20 (who said she had seen the movie the previous evening and liked him very much). <br /> <br /> But the more is: in the row right in front of me there were nine - count them, nine - ten-year-old girls lined up next to each other, passing popcorn and hot dogs and candies back and forth and giggling through the announcements . <br /> <br /> When the movie started, they immediately sat down to watch .... <br /> <br /> .... and not so much peeked until the final credits began to spin. <br /> <br /> This is not the perfect movie; he does not pay much for his school subplots, he is not sure enough about his own sound, and his bandits are just hair too far away from sometimes inept. But the adaptation of the source material is basically respectful, the story is quite well arranged and skillfully passes between the sins of excessive cheesiness and over-modernization. Finally, Emma Roberts carries a film with amazing grace - despite the excellent timing of Josh Flitter, this is Robert's film, and she pulls him beautifully. Her Nancy Drew is the direct ancestor of Veronica Mars Kristen Bell, and the film is also a descendant of the early and underestimated "Candleshoe" by Jodie Foster. <br /> <br /> In today's market it's a rarity: a family film that respects viewers' intelligence. As such it will not be for everyone's taste - but from what it is, it's the best movie of its kind in decades.
