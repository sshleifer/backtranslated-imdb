I loved it, being a fan of the original series, I always wondered what the story behind would be - it did not disappoint me. I also love the fact that apart from Eric Stoltz, I did not recognize one person - it is refreshing, just like BSG. It has brought me a whole wealth of new talents - I can not wait for the series to start broadcasting. Good job for Ronald D. Moore and the team - a great job. Special effects, dialogue and acting were in place and I felt emotionally connected with the plot. I know there are purists who probably disagree with my assessment, but I felt that Caprica was much better than most Sci-Fi materials made in the last decade.
