I took part in a small mini production of this film when I was 8 years old at school, and my mother bought me a movie. Since then, I love it !! When I was younger, these were songs and spectacular dance sequences that I liked, but because I watched them when I got older, I appreciate the more fantastic acting and character performances. Oliver Reed and Ron Moody were brilliant. I can not imagine anyone playing Bill Sykes or Fagin. Shani Wallis' Nancy, if he's the best character for me. She endured so much for these boys, I think she is such a strong character and her last scene when ... Well, you know ... She always makes me cry! In my opinion, the best musical of all time. It lasts all this time, it will last for many years! 11/10 !!
