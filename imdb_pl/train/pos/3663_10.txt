Perhaps the last movie you would expect from Vittorio de Sica and Cesare Zavattini (who wrote the novel on which this movie is based). It's a neorealistic fantasy, really an oxymoron. An elderly woman finds a child in her cabbage and raises it as her own son. After a few years the child is a young boy (named Toto) and the adopted mother dies. He goes to the orphanage, and when he finally turns 18, he leaves. He immediately states that there is no home. However, Toto is an optimist and will not let anything bring him. The man steals his suitcase and instead of being angry with him, Toto becomes his friend and stays with him in a small district of misery. Toto takes the initiative and organizes many homeless people living in the area and builds a better district of poverty. Soon, the landowner is trying to sell this plot, and the inhabitants of the district of poverty must protect themselves. After many attempts, the owner assembles the police force to get rid of the homeless. At this point, the film becomes a full-fledged fantasy (earlier it was a more comedy / fantastic melodrama in the style of Charlie Chaplin). These things are so strange and shocking that it's probably best for others to see for yourself. It's quite amazing and very funny. There are some reservations that can certainly be raised about the miracle in Milan. Fellini and Visconti were very much criticized when they began moving away from neorealism. I think I read what was widely criticized at the time of its release. At the moment, however, it is so nice - I liked it a lot. This may be my favorite of the films of Vittorio de Sica, although Umberto D and The Bicycle Thieves come very, very close. 10/10
