Excellent second part, which is as good as the first one. <br /> <br /> Once again, the casting is just great. I like how the first and second episode have nothing to do with each other, except wit and cunning. <br /> <br /> The second episode is simply very funny, very stupid and very pleasant. This is the first episode of a woman who is tormented by a serial killer dressed as Santa Claus after killing her husband. As in the first episode; karma. <br /> <br /> The most humorous scene is the relationship between the murder of her husband and the telephone conversation, first pretending to fear, until it becomes real.
