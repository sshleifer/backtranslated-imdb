I have never seen the film by Barbara Steele, which I did not like, and I was always a sucker of a good story about the haunted house (especially with such great pictures as "The Legend of Hell House" and original versions of "The Haunting" and "House on Haunted Hill" ), so I had the impression that "Castle of Blood" will be right on my avenue. Boy, was it ever! This Franco-Italian co-production, although it may not be a classic that still remains in the first horror of Steele 'Black Sunday', is an extremely atmospheric, chilling entry in the spook genre. Filmed in black and white, it manages to convey truly terrifying mises. The film concerns a journalist who bets one Lord Blackwood and author Edgar Allen Poe that he can spend the night in Blackwood Castle on All Saints' Night, when the ghosts of those killed in the castle recreate their fate again. The viewer can see these deaths and they are mostly horrible. The film really shifts the viewer's shivers, and in the uncut DVD that I just watched - thanks to the great people from Synapse - it even contains a surprising scene of topless and a bit of gentle lesbianism! And Barbara is wonderful in this movie; its unearthly beauty is well used when playing with a nice ghost. Her very presence turns a terrifying ghost story into something truly unforgettable. It was not without reason that she was called the "Queen of terror".
