celebrities: Julianna Donald, Lonny Price and Louis Zorich. episodes: Art Carney, Brooke Sheilds, Liza Minelli, James Coco, Joan Rivers, Dabney Coleman, Linda Lavin, Gregory Hines and others. <br /> <br /> Muppeteers: Jim Henson as Kermit, Rowlf, Dr.Teeth, Swedish Chef, Waldorf, Ernie and others. <br /> <br /> Richard Hunt as Scooter, Janice, Statler and Beaker. <br /> <br /> Frank Oz as Fozzie Bear, Miss Piggy, Animal, Bert, Cookie Monster and Sam the Eagle. <br /> <br /> Jerry Nelson as Camilla chicken, Floyd Pepper, Lion Zealand, Crazy Harry and Pops. <br /> <br /> Dave Goelz as Gonzo, Zoot, Beuregard and Bunsen Hunnydew. <br /> <br /> Steve Whittemire as Rizzo rat and others. <br /> <br /> Another great Muppet. This time, Kermit, Fozzie, Miss Piggy, Scooter, Rowlf, The Electric Mayhem, Gonzo and Camilla with chicken are out of school and appear in a musical they are trying to get on Broadway. After a pathetic failure in production, everyone split up and dispersed. I love characters and cameos. The song in the film is "Together again", "Look at me, here I am", "Say goodbye", "I will always love you", "Rat Jazz" and "He'll Make Me Happy" Frank Oz superbly manages this movie, and all the actors are doing great, behaving like Muppets. Look at this! 91 minutes. Rated G. My rating: A.
