All Kira Reed fans MUST see it. The premise of the film is the difficult novelist Kira's romance, who is unable to come up with any new ideas. She is also divorcing. However, he meets this guy in the restaurant and helps her get out of the shells (and clothes). They enter the corner room and they do it. Fortunately, Kira gets a condom (now, never tell me that Playboy movies are worthless stacks of a soft core, remember about children, safe sex). Later, she delights in her publisher, how wonderful it was, but she did not get his name. Nevertheless, the guy finds her and continues his kinky games. But in the end she got tired of his deception and wants to know more. When he does, hell breaks loose and I will leave it. This is the best of those soft Playboy movies that I've seen. Check it out and admire the size of Kira.
