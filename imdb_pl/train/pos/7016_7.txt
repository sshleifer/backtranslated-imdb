Although I understand the bad things that someone has to say about this movie, I still think it is absolutely amazing. It will affect you, and if your critic does not get into the disadvantages and blunders in any film, or simply nothing touches you, it's worth seeing. Do not go into the movie, expecting anything, just a box of tissues and an open mind. She's beautiful, and acting is brilliant. I think Will Smith, even though he's playing another lonely person with depression again, is amazing. I think that a good actor is someone who can really represent the feelings and emotions that we all have in our worst / best experiences in a way that reaches you and makes you feel something. And that's what the movie is doing. Give it a chance.
