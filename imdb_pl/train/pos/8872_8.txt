This is the first movie I saw at John Singleton and is a pretty good director. The film begins with a group of new students and shows what is happening with a few of them. Omar Epps plays a song star with a partial scholarship and has difficulty keeping up with his work. He is a friend of Ice Cube and creatures meeting with Tyra Banks. Kristy Swanson is a rich girl who was raped on a date and befriends Jennifer Connelly, who is a lesbian, and is not sure which way to go. Michael Rapaport is a kid from Idaho who is part of the neo-Nazi group and their leader is Cole Hauser. These are the three main characters, and Laurence Fishburne is a professor of political science who is trying to help them. It's a great movie and it's a pity that the studio had to do some cuts to the film.
