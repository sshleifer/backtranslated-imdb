Seeing that Keifer Sutherland plays my favorite character in the history of television, it was settled that I intend to go to the cinema and spend 15 dollars on it. I also think that this applies to Eva Longoria fans. <br /> <br /> The movie revolves around a leak that the Secret Service agent is going to kill the president. In the course of the investigation, it seems that Pete (Michael Douglas) is the most likely candidate. Pete, begging for innocence, continues to play, runs away, seeking the truth. <br /> <br /> It's solid but definitely not spectacular. A decent cast, a decent story, but it made me feel a little empty, but you could certainly do a lot worse.
