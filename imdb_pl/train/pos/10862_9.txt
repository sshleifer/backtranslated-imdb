The election is a Chinese mafia movie or triad in this case. Every two years there are elections in which he decides to become a new leader, and initially it seems that between Big D (Tony Leung Ka Fai, or as I know him, "The Other Tony Leung") and Lok (Simon Yam, who was judge in full contact!). Although Lok wins, Big D refuses to accept the choice and goes all lengths to get recognition as a new leader. Unlike other Asian movies that I watch with gangsters, this movie is not an action movie. He has his bloody moments when it is necessary, as in Goodfellas, but it is simply a really effective drama. There are many characters that are hard to follow, but I think this is a bit of a threat to madness. The 100-year-old club, which is a symbol of the power I mentioned earlier, changes hands several times before everything calms down. And although it may seem that the film ends with a 65 or 70 minute sign, there are still a few big surprises waiting for you. Simon Yam was my favorite character here and as if he anchored the picture. <br /> <br /> The elections were quite rewarded at last year's Hong Kong Film Awards, winning for the best actor (Tony Leung), the best picture, the best director (Johnny To, who made the Heroic Trio !!) and the best screenplay. He also had nominations for photos, editing, film scores (which I loved) and three subsequent performances (including Yam).
