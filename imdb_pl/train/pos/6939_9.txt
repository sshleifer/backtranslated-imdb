I was impressed by this film. I would have to rate him as one of the better westerns from the classical era. I say this for the whole: acting, mature dialogue, storytelling and excellent photos. <br /> <br /> Director Anthony Mann, who did some well-photographed films about the same era, also did some westerns like this one. It has the same look of the noir movie. Mann and Jimmy Stewart cooperated in several westerns at the time. . If you like this movie, I recommend Mann-Stewart's "Bend Of The River". <br /> <br /> In short, the story is about the man "Lin McAdam" (Stewart) who owns the prestigious Winchester 73 rifle, a weapon he won fair-and-square in the competition. Then it is stolen and handed over from the villain to the villain. All these villains are interesting characters. <br /> <br /> Helping Stewart in this interesting story is Shelley Winters, Dan Duryea, Stephen McNally, Millard Mitchell, Charles Drake, Will Greer and J. C. Flippen. They are all pleasant to watch. But it stretched a little when I saw Rock Hudson playing the Indian ("Young Bull"), but you can not have everything.
