This charming animated short film features two comic icons - Betty Boop and Henry. <br /> <br /> Henry is a bald, slightly crazy comic boy who never talks. <br /> <br /> Well, he says! <br /> <br /> I want to get a puppy from the Betty Boop pet shop, and when it's left in the store's memory - it comes to funny hijinks. <br /> <br /> Betty sings a song about animals Henry gets into a battle with birds and a monkey, but in the end everything works.
