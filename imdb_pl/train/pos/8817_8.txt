French production, in which leading film directors from 11 countries were invited to create 11-minute short films presenting their thoughts on the events of September 11th. <br /> <br /> Film segments differ significantly in content and quality. Two refer to US complicity in terrorist acts (in Chile against Allende, who died on September 11, 1973, Presented in the segment by British director Ken Loach and in Palestine by US-supported Israelis, shown in the segment by Egyptian director Youssef Chahine) ). The other two resemble other destructive acts (a Palestinian suicide attack in Tel Aviv, filmed by Israeli director Amos Gitana, a Japanese "holy war" against the West in World War II, Shohei Imamura). <br /> <br /> Ironies abound in a few stories. Shadows that darken in the New York apartment of a pathetic old man suddenly disappear when the World Trade skyscraper moves the telescope to the ground in Sean Penn's art, bringing a momentary joy to man. But in this bright light, he can finally see that his wife has really gone. In Mira Nair's film, based on a real incident, a missing young man, also in New York, the son of a Pakistani family, is considered a fugitive terrorist for the first time, but later proves to the protagonist who sacrificed himself trying to save others in the towers. <br /> <br /> There are moving moments all over. Loach has his exiled Chilean quoting Saint. Augustine, because hope is built of anger and courage: anger for things, courage to change them. Imamura tells us that there is no such thing as a holy war. Samira Makhmalbaf shows a teacher with his very young Afghan students, sent to Iran, trying to tell them about the events that have just taken place in New York. It is understandable, however, that the great event in their refugee camp, in which two men fell into a deep well, one killed and the other upheld a broken leg. This is an understandable tragedy on a large scale for six-year-olds. <br /> <br /> Idrissa Ouedraogo from Burkina Faso creates a drama in which the sick woman's son sees Osama bin Laden in her village and gathers her buddies to help capture a runaway terrorist to get $ 25 million in American prizes. He tells his friends not to let any adults know their plans, because older people simply waste money on cars and cigarettes, while he plans to help his mother and others who are sick and deprived of their livelihoods. <br /> <br /> This is the Mexican director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu (creator of "Amores Perros"), which provides the most powerful and chilling segment, which for the most part shows only a darkened screen with loops of audio with songs and voices and from time to time thumping sounds. Short visual flashes gradually allow us to see the bodies falling from the high towers of the towers, and it seems to us that the banging is these bodies hitting the ground. The sequence ends with elegiac orchestral and immobile music, featuring the phrase first shown only in Arabic, and then with the added translation: "Does God's light lead us or blind us?"
