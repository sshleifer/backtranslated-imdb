This Oscar-winning short film may be one of the greatest genres of this genre. Totally spoken without dialogue, he is a visual feast about a young boy who buys a gold fish, loves to put him in a bowl, then goes to school, leaving the gold fish unprotected and the window carelessly open. After a while the neighboring orange tabby spins, enters through the window and slowly approaches the bowl. The fish apparently knows something is going on and is very excited. When the cat approaches the bowl, the fish pops out. The cat catches the fish, drops it back into the bowl and comes out the window, when he came in like a boy, not knowing what happened, he returns. It was amazingly filmed with real animals; as Cousteau behaves in this way, it is extraordinary. I just want this movie to be available now so that people can see it; I saw him only once, in 1959, when it was originally released, but remained unforgettable.
