My father was the prison captain (now he is retired) presented in this film and I grew up in prison, so maybe my views will be completely different than everyone who is watching this movie. I will say yes, the filmmakers who brought us this 93-minute miracle are fantastic artists and even better people. They were brave enough to A) Show and tell the story, B) Get into the minds and hearts of those prisoners, and C) Do it all responsibly. Responsible for his art and, more importantly, responsible for the prisoners and employees of the Luther Luckett prison team. They should be endlessly recommended for this work. Take 170 hours, HOURS, recordings and be able to cut and reduce up to 93 minutes of riveting is nothing short of extraordinary and have my highest respect. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in circumstances that only very, very few were able to see. I was at the prisoners' show. I was in the same room with these men as they watched their hearts being poured out on the screen. I saw men crying on television crying in a chair in front of me and let me say that it was a very deep experience. These people have committed terrible crimes in some cases, but they have found ways to try to buy back, even if they consider themselves unrecoverable. How many of us have the courage to do it? How many people can do what they have done in such a difficult environment? Seeing how they react to the film was eternal gratitude to me and I will never forget it. Thank you to the men who let me penetrate their lives, thank my father for making all this possible and thank Philomath Films for taking the time to shed blood, sweat, soul and tears in this project. /> <br /> This movie will change everything you think about prison life and prisoners embedded in it. "Oz" is not real, television is not real. "Shakespeare behind bars" is.
