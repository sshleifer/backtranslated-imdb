Michael Jackson is not very popular in the USA, but in Europe (especially in Germany) he still has many fans. Many will say that this is a bad movie, and it is: there is no plot, it is full of clich√©s, Michael boasts constantly. <br /> <br /> BUT, you can not expect the plot or the non-classic in this kind of movie! It has fun visual effects and the music is perfect. Fragment The Smooth Criminal - the biggest song ever, full of Moonwalks, group dance acts and even the famous "Michael Jackson's Bench-over" - makes this movie one of Jackson's masterpieces with even handsome (and white ...) Michael Jackson! <br /> <br /> Necessarily for fans of Jackson, a must for music fans, a must for dance fans. <br /> <br /> However, as I am a fan of MJ, I should warn everyone that they hate Michael Jackson: DO NOT watch this movie, you will only increase hatred ...
