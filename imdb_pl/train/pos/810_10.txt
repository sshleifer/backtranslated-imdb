This is probably the best of all Star Wars movies. <br /> <br /> The point of departure for the film was almost episode IV - cabaret's cabaret music and thoughts of a cabaret place, where the gravity of Jabba the Hutt's gangster grew more and more serious. He ordered Luke die in the cellar through Bantha's crushing teeth, which looked almost like a cross between a bear and a shark. Jede Luke's power eventually finishes the monster. Adding to the wily rescue of Han Solo, who was frozen alive at the end of episode V, Jabba was very angry at Luke being sentenced to death down the Sarlacc. <br /> <br /> But all Star Wars "good guys", especially R2-D2, had other ideas ... and these other ideas resisted Luke's execution; in the end, most of Jabba's soldiers were killed, and Princess Leia was able to use her strength to kill Jabba deathly. <br /> <br /> As in episode IV, the Death Star appears in episode VI. When I analyzed the fleet of rebels attacking Imperial fighters around the Death Star, I guessed that the Star Destroyer personnel had speeded up the weapons of the main laser, using imperial fighters as a subversive. The 20-25 Star Destroyers that lined up were ready to attack, but he was dismissed, and instead the laser weapon on the Death Star was shot in surprise. When he fired, the only hope of the rebel fleet was that the shield of the Death Star deflector would be knocked out, and that touched Lando so much, because he wanted to destroy the Death Star, but he could not, until the shield was removed. And that was taken with Lando's growing impatience. <br /> <br /> Just like in episode V, the Imperial Piechurs make their menacing look their twin cannons, killing at least one Ewoks ... but Ewoki found an ancient but unusual way of dealing with them. For example, Chewbacca, like other Ewoks, was able to defeat one of the infantrymen (and actually used it to destroy from behind one of the infantrymen), while the other Ewoks used logs to kill two other infantrymen. > <br /> It's amazing what Luke could do with his Jedi powers on his luminous saber, for example on the Endor scene, where Luke receives the upcoming laser arrows from the Storm Trooper cinder bike and uses the saber to knock out a part of the bike. Or, at the climax, using Saber to break his father's arm during the last Saber fight with Sith Vader. <br /> <br /> You probably know the Ewoks feast after the Death Star burst, along with a short fireworks show, drumming on the spoils of victory (eg Storm Trooper Masks), and Luke finally meets Leia after Luke's own nemesis - - Darth Vader, now dead, gets burned at the stake. The celebration includes Ewoks' singing, but I think Lucas did not buy it - even with the respectful composer John Williams. <br /> <br /> In the home movie version, I think Lucas wanted a different ending himself. In addition to the celebration at Endor, he wanted to shoot scenes of saints on several surviving rebel planets, including a ceremonial laser shot that destroys the Sith statue. The Ewoks song was replaced with an alternative instrumental song. He probably wanted extra things to prove that with the destruction of the Death Star, the rebellious galaxies were restored.
