I liked the movie very much. I liked most of the actors. But for me, a very weak accent of Mrs. Davis and her rigid acting really make the movie in a different way captivating is very difficult to watch. Seriously, if any other contemporary actor played the same role in the same style as Mrs Davis, they would be ridiculed. <br /> <br /> I really think that she "called this". If Myrna Loy or Ingrid Bergman were playing the role of a wife now, I would have enjoyed much more. <br /> <br /> I guess I just do not "get" Bette Davis. I always thought of her as an actress who "plays" no matter what role she is in. A possible exception is Now Voyager. <br /> <br /> I am sure that many other reviewers will explain it carefully (and I hope that it will be civil) to specify how completely wrong I am. But I will still watch the films in which I am located, because I like stories / writing / supporting the cast, but I will always think of different actresses who could do a better job.
