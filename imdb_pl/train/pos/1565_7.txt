I saw The Saint Strikes Back for the first time and thought it was pretty good. It was George Sanders' first performance as a Saint, where he replaces Louis Hayward. <br /> <br /> In this, Saint is sent to San Francisco to explore shooting at the nightclub. With the help of his friend Inspector Fernack, who came from New York, they help the daughter of the head of the crime. <br /> <br /> Joining the cast of Sanders is Wendy Barrie and Jonathan Hale. <br /> <br /> Not a bad Saint movie. Worth to see. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
