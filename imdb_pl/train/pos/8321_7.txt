It's a nice movie, even if the premise is stupid. It was nice to watch. Meg Ryan seems to be able to play roles in this kind of movie (another example is Joe vs. the Volcano). This is what makes her a star. Walter Matthau, of course, had this ability and really engages himself in this role, creating a funny, good-natured Einstein. I suppose it can be said that both are good at presenting nice characters, although they are sympathetic in many ways (nice young women and pleasant craftsmanship).
