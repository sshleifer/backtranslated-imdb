Leonard Maltin had to watch some other movie. (Although I think his guide is quite a valuable asset, please ignore his comments on this subject.) He states that "it starts well and then it fades" when it really is the opposite - "it starts cold and then it catches ". The plot is as simple as it can be. Happy mom, happy dad and happy son take vacation on an isolated beach, dad incapacitated, mom escapes for help, meets a dangerous fugitive convict. Mum tries to convince the convict to help, while Dad is waiting and staying for the rest of his life. <br /> <br /> A good white buddy, who Ralph Meeker gave an electric tug to, appears suddenly (director, John Sturges, filming it in a clever way that will make you catch your breath) halfway as a cunning, desperate criminal. Meeker is an extremely nonchalant, reckless actor (at least here and in the classic "Kiss Me Deadly") and happily grabs the keys to the film's narrative and accelerates from top to bottom. His character has a habit of childish smiling and saying "Pretty cool, eh?" When he is particularly pleased with his misdeeds. It's funny to have a break in action when they have a tire, and succinctly instructs your hostage, Barbara Stanwyck, "Do not go." It fires "Where would I like to go?" (They are in the middle of nowhere) and implements sitcom-ishly "Yes, it's true". The friction between them is hoot. <br /> <br /> There are disadvantages, a bit ridiculous. There is one scene in which the police, who had been pursuing Meeker for some time, stopped Stanwyck's car and avoided detection. Meeker rests her head on her arm, like a loving husband, and pretends to be asleep when she's interrogated. A. It looks clearly not manly in this pose and B. I think it is safe to say that every adult who seems to sleep during a meeting with law enforcement agencies will certainly arouse suspicion. <br /> <br /> There is still a solid thriller that creates an exciting and constructing application. <br /> <br />
