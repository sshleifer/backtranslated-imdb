In 1994, I spent a really long holiday around the fourth of July - some 17 days off in a row, what about a two-week paid vacation, weekends and the holidays themselves. At the time I was in town, I often spent time at my parents' house. <br /> <br /> I did not have a TV in my apartment, so I watched my parents' lamp. I just finished watching the X Files segment when a program called Personal FX appeared. I was drawn in immediately. I have always been fascinated with objects in our home that came from my parents 'family houses and relegation from relatives' estates, and often wondered about their history, value, etc. <br /> <br /> After my long vacation, I went to my people's house during a lunch break to catch Personal FX. <br /> <br /> I remember one episode, during which co-organizer Claire Carter announced that the flat in New York, where the series was filmed and was renewed, and when it was already said that the repairs were completed, Personl FX will come back to air. <br /> <br /> He never did! Personal FX was the first and the best of collector's shows. And he disappeared from the air! Almost fifteen years later I'm still sore. <br /> <br /> Way to go, FX.
