Finally, we have a category III movie for the 2006 summer season. Produced from cruelty, crime and passion of equal parts, Dog Bite Dog uses not only the right title, but also a flexible direction, excellent photos and respectable performances most involved. Of course, there must be a catch, manifesting here in the form of several glaring inconsistencies, but everything DBD has said represents the mature spirit that we would like to see in the mainstream of HK. <br /> <br /> This also marks the trailer of the return of Edison Chen, who has long been absent from the initial defeat D from last year. Reserved by Chen machismo, he does wonders in the film, but he would have to be rough without facing Lee Sam, whose talent for the alternating physical comedy (Crazy 'N' City, No Problem 2) and the maddening lead to the strongest role we've seen him since Time Made in Hong Kong. <br /> <br /> The duo together creates the Dog Bite Dog, and hopefully Edison will now have an easier break: his designs touched by Princess D to the saga of Infernal Affairs and still remain a rare phenomenon. <br /> <br /> Mainly after the start, DBD presents some mesmerizing photos, playing great tricks with light, shadow and perspective. The soundtrack strengthens this atmospheric effect, adding to the overall unrealistic mood of the film. Much of the resulting combination is probably related to the writer Matt Chow, who previously also dealt with macabre Three Extremes. Dog Bite Dog retains many of the features evoked from this horror, namely spoiled urbanscapes and the ubiquitous air of something amazing lurking around the corner. <br /> <br /> You can be sure that this is not a horror story, but instead a path trodden earlier by the classic One Nite in Mongkok, albeit with a larger angle of inclination. Replacing the reluctant figure of Dan Wu's assassin, we have Edison playing a nameless killing machine from the underworld of Cambodia. Posted in Hong Kong, a way to accomplish one goal, an almost silent killer deals with matters immediately upon arrival, this process is presented coldly thanks to the wonderful visualization of the film. <br /> <br /> Set aside from childhood to become a professional killer, the title wild Edison dog still has human weaknesses and leaves a mark that has been picked up by the CID team sent to investigate. The band includes a cool episode song by Lam Suet from the mob movie and good support from the TV star Wayne Lai. However, the renegade officer Sam Lee Wai leads the charge, revealing that he is very restless, but a perfect cop. We are gradually learning the inner conflict of Wai, which stems from the background of his father's police corruption, recalling demons useful in the ongoing pursuit that follows. <br /> <br /> A small number of bodies appear, it seems Edison is considering taking prisoners for them. In the magazine there is quite a quotient of violence, although gore per se feels subdued in places, and the adult language only looks symbolic. Once again, there is no nudity, which leads to the Cat III conclusions, which are now being hurried. Despite this, DBD is a relatively mature cinematic release, and we applaud its arrival. <br /> <br /> Between the fights, stabbing, hacking and shooting, even a professional killer needs some romance, and just as Daniel Wu had Cecilia Cheung in One Nite, so fearless Mr. Chen gets his beloved, beautifully made by the newcomer Pei Pei . Her unnamed character (including a lot of anonymity) meets Edison in a strangely abandoned landfill, abused by her father to the point of repulsing madness and the desire to escape. When the killer deigns HK, he agrees to take her with him, and they run together, love to bloom on the road. While the film does not last in love for things, our hearts reach out to the tragic character of Pei Pei and her endless suffering. He shows off a timid but brave hero, stating that there are no good or bad guys here, as evidenced by the sobering final. <br /> <br /> Cheang Soi's portfolio includes the latest thriller thriller Home Sweet Home and I Love Battlefield with Eason Chan, two numbers probably outweigh the dog's bite attitude Dog Bite Dog. Cheang manages to keep DBD in a continuous state, and considering many elements in the game, he faces critical standards raised by people like Johnny To in his nightly epic The Mission. There are a few flaws, for example Edison shrugs her chest wonderfully, but they are very forgivable. <br /> <br /> Marking triumphant returns for two young, talented performers of the kind that Hong Kong needs, if we want the movie's glory period to come back, Dog Bite Dog does not stand out from the story. Its strong side is hidden in strong portraits and style, maintained on thespian muscle strength and sharp eyesight for visual and auditory finesse. <br /> <br /> HK has a long, time-honored history related to the Night's alter-ego, something that Dog Bite Dog supports with love, which is a solid run, if not a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Rating: * * * *
