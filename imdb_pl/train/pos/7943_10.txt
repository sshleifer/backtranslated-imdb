I love this series so much. contains animation that is interesting and beautiful. I can not believe that they cut him off from television, and also that I never found out whether cybersix and data7 are dying or not, apparently they are experiencing, but I'm not sure. Cybersix was by far the best TV series ever. I know it is too late to hope that they will start the series from scratch, so I am very happy to see it. I HAVE A LOT of <3 <br /> <br /> about a woman named cybersix, she is not human. She goes through Adrian Sieldman, a high school teacher. Now the cybersix is ​​actually a woman who is just disguised as a man during the day. At night, the cybercriminal patrols the city. <br /> <br /> A guy named Von reichter is the one who created the cybersix, and once he finds him, he lives, uses everything he can to catch her. > <br /> IF you never watched it before you downloaded it completely. It was the best television program in the world. Why did they cut him off? some people have problems. but I'm happy to see 13 episodes.
