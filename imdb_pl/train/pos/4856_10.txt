I saw this movie for the first time years ago and watched it several times a year when I had the opportunity. It is on my list of favorite movies along with some classics. If someone tells you that he is stupid or outdated, ignore them ... this movie is for anyone who likes to laugh and listen to music. Dance is not as important in this film as in other Astaire movies, so comedy and acting shine. See this movie, if you can, it can be light, but it's still totally fun. So I know that many people hate black and white movies, they think that old movies can not be funny, this movie should make them change their minds. No one I know can watch this movie without being at least slightly amused. The only problem with the film: Fred Astaire sings without dancing. He can be a great performer and talented vocalist, but he is simply not fascinating and leaves a big hole in the middle of history. Sometimes the comedy becomes a bit banal, but the vaudevillesque performances of G Burns and G Allen are perfect for this song and can satisfy anyone looking for easy laughs. Give this film a chance, even if you do not like old movies, this movie can appeal to the ridiculousness in everyone.
