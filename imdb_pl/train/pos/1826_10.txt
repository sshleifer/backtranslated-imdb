I loved this movie when I was little. Today at 5 pm it is one of my favorite animated films. Beautiful animations and attractive characters are just two things that they like in this movie. Although many people may not like some songs, most of them are well-made and fit the story. He focuses on Charlie, the impish, handsome German Shepardzie, who may seem unlikely for some at the beginning ... but he will eventually win. <br /> <br /> In no way is this a movie for children. Often very dark and frightening. Taste for fans of Don Bluth and animation lovers. But keep the tissues at hand. ADGTH never fails to cry and I will do the same for those who are sensitive to the film. Probably one of the largest animated films other than Disney in history. Along with Watership Down and My Neighbor Totoro. <br /> <br /> LINE: A heavenly masterpiece.
