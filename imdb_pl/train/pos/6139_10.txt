Great movie. Lansbury and Tomlinson are perfect, the songs are great, the dances, with special emphasis on the "Portobello Ballet" are wonderful. As for the animated section, the match between the animals became immediately classic; Culmination with the attack of the armature is chilling and fascinating. I recommend seeing the reconstructed version of 134 minutes or at least 112 minutes of the movie. In Italy, we only have a 98-minute version, although the film was presented in the original release in 117 minutes. If possible, also look at the German video cassette: it was generated from 98 minutes of running, but it lacks all references to World War II and all scenes between the English and their Nazi invaders!
