This film is the first of the trilogy of the Miikes triad community, and the trilogy begins with a great start. Films in the trilogy are connected only by theme, and these themes are really visible in all his films, if you look closely enough. The Shinjuku Triad Society deals with a policeman who tries to stop his younger brother from getting too involved in a rather extreme gang of outsiders struggling with the Tokyos yakuza summit. The kid is a lawyer, and the triad gang more and more needs one as the film progresses. The film takes place in a very difficult environment, which is why it is quite violent and hard. Miike got worse, but because it's a serious movie, it hits you very much. As usual, there is also a lot of perverted sex, mainly homosexual sex. The film is in many ways a typical gangster movie, but with great drive and real grittiness. If you've only seen movies from distant Miikes movies (Ichi killer, Fudoh, etc.), it's worth checking out because it's a kind of compromise between its aggressive over-the-top style in these movies and its more serious side, as seen in other Trilogy films . And as always in the case of Miike, there are at least two scenes in it that you will NEVER forget (see and check which ones for yourself). <br /> <br /> 8/10
