Recently (May 2008) I discovered that this childhood favorite was available as a DVD. Although since then I have seen many high quality films (late 70s (I was 10 years old in 1978)). This three-part low-budget project is still strong. <br /> <br /> It's funny that now I watched it with my 10-year-old daughter and she's experiencing the same thing I remember from that time: terrifying music (she had to hold my hand, despite being raised with watching LotR and Resident Evil), always changing the theory of who the perpetrator actually is, as well as complaining about theatrical voices from the era, before Norway discovered the difference between stage acting and film acting. <br /> <br /> This is the only good science fiction film (or series) ever produced in Norway. And it's still worth watching.
