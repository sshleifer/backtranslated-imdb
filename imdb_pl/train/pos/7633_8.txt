Reading various external reviews of Roger Ebert and other renowned film critics makes me hesitate to admit how much I love this movie, even though I only have a video version with dubbing to Japanese. <br /> <br /> It seems that many critics seem to treat this as a minus, that the premise of the story has been used earlier, most famously in the very great "This is a wonderful life". For me, a great premise is a great assumption, no matter how many times it is used, and I would be happy to see more films using this particular assumption - a dissatisfied man who has a chance to look at his life through some "divine magic" . <br /> <br /> I suppose that people and critics of a more intellectual attitude are not so caught up in history, but I do not go to the cinema to criticize them with a notebook in hand - I go to the movies to throw in them and let them take me wherever they want. <br /> <br /> If you're sentimental like me, you'll be well rewarded when seeing this photo. The performances are excellent all the time, and the film was very well manned. A great selection of music. Michael Caine is great as a nice bartender. Jim Belushi does a great job as an "average Joe" who wonders if his life has gone as it should. Linda Hamilton, always perfect, is right here again as a loving wife. Jon Lovitz plays as usual and even has surprisingly moving moments in "Mr. Destiny. " <br /> <br /> No, "Mr. Destiny "is not" It's Wonderful Life ", but who says it must be? "Mr. Destiny "on your own terms is a pleasant, well-made, funny and moving movie. I have seen my Japanese video many times with its dubbing and I am sure I will see it several more times. If it somehow makes me "short", so be it! I'm glad I have not read any reviews "Mr. Destiny "before watching it. <br /> <br /> I suppose I should have the courage of my beliefs and give the film nine or ten stars, but I could not resist doubts after reading all the critical reviews!
