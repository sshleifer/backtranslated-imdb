Hickory Dickory Dock was a good secret to Poirot. I admit I have not read the book even though I am an avid fan of Agatha Christie. Adaptation was not without problems, there were situations in which humor and valiant attempts to bring it to order were somewhat exaggerated, and the events leading to the final solution were rather hasty. I also thought that there were several free moments, so some of the mysterious felt was padded. However, I loved filming Hickory Dickory Dock, it had a very similar visual style to the brilliant ABC Murders and really gave the atmosphere thanks to dark camera work and dark lighting. Darker moments were a bit scary, it helped one of the most haunting music in Poirot's adaptation, maybe not as disturbing as in One Two Buckle My Shoe, which gave me nightmares. The plot is complex, with all the necessary ingredients, although not as convoluted as Buckle My Shoe, and in some way is a good thing. Acting was very good, David Suchet is immaculate (I know I can not use that word forever, but I can not come up with a better word to describe his performance in the show) as Poirot, and Phillip Jackson and Pauline Moran are just right to their integral characters . And the students had great personalities and generally developed well, especially Damian Lewis as Leonard. In summary, a solid secret, but not the best. 7.5 / 10 Bethany Cox
