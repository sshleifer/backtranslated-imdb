Excellent performance. Instead of watching the same old type of sitcom, which shows that it is the same old thing, only different "stars", this refreshing show provides an incredibly funny view of office situations. For two years we have not been watching TV, and after returning from all available programs we look forward to watching this show at W. Shame on Global for pulling the plug out of it. I thought it would be a winner. Let's be realistic, FEW Canadian SHOWS will do it. Everyone I'm talking to enjoys this show and I think it was stupid to leave Global. I think they want to do this with stunning US shows, instead of pulling on a Canadian show that was very promising. Do not get me wrong, I enjoy many programs on TV, but come on people, keep diversity. This unique program has provided a very comedic image of a slightly exaggerated realistic side of office life and relationships, with unique characters that you can not see in any series today or in the past. It is a pity that the global had to refuse this one, stupid mistake.
