Mardi Gras: Made in China provides a wonderful, intricate connection between popular culture, nudity and globalization through the creation and tossing of beads. I saw this movie at the Boston International Film Festival and I expected a dry introduction to globalization, but I got an interesting visual display of shocking materials from China and the United States. The film that opens the eyes is humorous, profound, serious, non-condescending, and makes you want more as a role for loans. It's worth comparing to Murderball - it's just well done. Young women working in China have different points of view, and the owner is extremely open about discipline. The revelers during the carnival are the most important event, but only because this perfect movie provides an in-depth context inside the factory in China without a narrative. Well done to the filmmaker for getting in and finishing the movie! I never would have thought about the relationship between beads, China and New Orleans; Now I am thinking of a human relationship between almost every object, but also about the role of globalization, inequality and play. More importantly, I can make these calls without feeling guilty after watching this movie, unlike other globalization movies that I've seen.
