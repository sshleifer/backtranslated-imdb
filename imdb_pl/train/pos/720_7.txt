Imagine what school would be like in such a world: children are one big gang that has good musical taste and unites with bad directors and teachers. In this world, "Rock 'N' Roll High School" takes place. It's like the Ramones recording comes alive. The characters are as stupid, innocent and charming as the Ramones songs, and the music itself is fantastic, of course. High school comedies have changed over the years, if you compare a movie like "American Pie" with a classic from the late 70's, which does not create any tasteless sexual jokes. Because the remake is apparently in the songs, you can probably expect the charm of the original to disappear along the way and be replaced by vulgar, half-funny jokes, as Bill Hicks called them. However, the main problem will be that Ramones CAN NOT be replaced. They were the perfect band for this movie and no one else could even get close to their place. It would be best to leave the original alone, as bizarre and charming as it is. Gabba gabba hey!
