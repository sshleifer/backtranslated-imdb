It is a brilliant political satire. No wonder that this has largely been ignored in the United States: it reveals our murderous foreign policy for what it really is. <br /> <br /> Another good movie from this era, Rendition, was also completely rejected only because he showed, precisely, that the US is a war machine aimed at torturing, murdering and mutilating civilians in the pursuit of total domination over the world. <br /> <br /> A smart plot, good acting, some great stars (John Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Marisa Tomei, someone?), and some scenes of gaiety should make this movie a hit. Unfortunately, Americans do not like to hear the truth about themselves, especially when they are involved in mass murder.
