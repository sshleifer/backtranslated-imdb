the photography was beautiful, but I had difficulty understanding what was going on ... was there a lot of symbolism? ... 2 goldfish - do they mean something in Thai culture? there is not much story, nothing happens and just meanders. without a real start, without a real measure and without a real end. rather unsatisfying. <br /> <br /> It was difficult to get into a character because you never felt you knew it ... it was difficult to know which scenes were imaginary and which ones were real. The movement was chaotic and chaotic. I do not know what the panga brothers meant. Maybe if I was a Thai, it would make more sense ...
