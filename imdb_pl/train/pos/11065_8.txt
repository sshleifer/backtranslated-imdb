This comedy, which is accompanied by pain and sadness, goes where most others fail. There were many films of this genre, with more significant actors trying to achieve this elusive mix, which did not come close to the depth and agility of this. This is certainly because the exceptional cast with outstanding performances by Reg Rogers and Ally Sheedy seems so spontaneous that the reality of their characters quickly attracts interest and emotions and keeps them throughout the film. Initially, the action seems hopeless and depressed, but gradually learns that these two rather mournful, devastated people desperately and reluctantly try to heal, even if reluctantly, through each other. Rogers' distorting face pain and his furious outbursts are so eloquent that they feel when they are watched. You will take care of these two nice but deeply suffering people and you hope that they will succeed because it is dubious and hangs on a frail emotional thread. I hope that the audience will see more Reg Rogers and Ally Sheedy, because this film proves their merits as very talented actors without a doubt.
