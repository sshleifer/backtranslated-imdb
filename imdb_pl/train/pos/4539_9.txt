Acting is pretty bad, but for people in this area in the 80's and currently automotive engineers from Detroit, it's a great movie. I even work with a Japanese supplier, making this movie even more fun. <br /> <br /> Jay Leno showed his age last night on The Tonight Show! It looks quite young here ... 17 years ago. The opening scene, with the drag race on what seems to be Woodward Ave, was great. <br /> <br /> Leno now also has some bad cars **, it would be great to see a remake of this with his modern collection. I'm sure that the inflatable Vette in the opening scene was his own car. <br /> <br /> A typical movie from the 80s. Follow and enjoy. No nonsense generated by the computer!
