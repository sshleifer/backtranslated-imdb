I could see episode or 2, when the show was originally broadcast, but when I watched the episode on netflix, I was also hooked. I watched the entire series in about 2 days. :) I really liked Gary Cole's character. First, it's completely reprehensible, and then you start to like the character ("These things have a thousand uses")! His family Andy Griffith meets Charles Manson with Satan is great. Charming, charismatic, smarmy and a bit dangerous, and by "kind" I mean "really." I want to grow up like HIM. Lucas Black is great too. The accents are great too. Anyway, I thought it was one of the best TV shows ever, and you owe it yourself.
