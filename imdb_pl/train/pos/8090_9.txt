When a small hobbit named Frodo Baggins inherits the magic ring from his uncle, wizard Gandalf investigates and discovers that the ring is an ancient creation of the evil dark master. If the ring is in his hands, he will regain his power and destroy Middle-earth. Frodo and his loyal friends set out on an expedition to destroy the ring with a group of warriors. This is an underestimated adaptation of classic novels, because it covers only the first part of the story. Regardless, it's an epic and great animated film. <br /> <br /> The animation is superbly made using a rotoscope that tracks material from live action. Ralph Bakshi worked well with the low budget he received. The film also boasts the great music of Leonard Rosenman, which fits every scene. There are a few plot lines with the script, but you have to justify it, considering that the original contract was to create a book trilogy in two films, much in the first one. My biggest problem is character design, Samwise was a little too stupid, while other hobbits behave completely normal. Other characters are well-written on the screen, and the actors do a great job, I was glad that Legolas is actually a little more helpful in the story. Rotoscopies are more comical than frightening, while ringwraiths are ghostly and nightmarish. <br /> <br /> Another problem is that the bad writer Saruman is called Aruman, thanks to the writers. In general, I think that a little more money and better writers would do a lot of justice, but there is something charming about it. Ralph Bakshi made a brave effort to adapt the screen of these classic stories. The film suffers a lot from depression through live action movies, but it is still a great movie for animation lovers of all ages.
