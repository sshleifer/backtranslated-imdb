What a great movie that qualifies for so many labels that it will never receive: science fiction, film noir, script and dialogue with high intelligence, which assumes an educated, cultural audience. before 1960 in England (and shown only in American houses of film art after her first arrival) and never, never in the USA. <br /> <br /> The main characters in the film Man in a White Suit (1951) starring Sir Alec Guiness and Joan Greenwood routinely use polysyllabic, scientific references such as 'polymer', and discuss and explain chemistry concepts such as 'long-chain' molecules "and then communicate their meaning to the average person and the benefits of science> <br /> Man in a white suit (1951) is the opposite of the video game explosion that currently (2009) dominates the global cinema and certainly dominates in the main US cinema ......., a story told intelligently by talented and credible educated English actors (who play educated, talented people), all thanks to comedy, charm, pathos and the sense of irony that ancient playwrights would agree. <br /> <br /> Everyone should see this movie and one day, somehow, some worthy filmmaker and his supporters should make it happen. <br /> <br /> It's great.
