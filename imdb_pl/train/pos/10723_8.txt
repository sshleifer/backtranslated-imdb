I have read several other users' comments and decided to place one of them. Some users are stuck in a "realistic" mentality. This movie was supposed to be a "fantasy" ... a funny movie "what if". It was never meant to be "real" or serious. It was very nice for everyone I knew when it appeared - although it was a shadow of the Challenger explosion ... I was 30 years old and I was happy - my young son loved it too! Later, I shared this with my daughter and she loved it too. SpaceCamp is a fun family movie that you should enjoy - fun. All "realists" in the world should brighten up or stick to watching documentaries or docudram√≥w and avoid any other type of film. I'm sorry about the young people who saw the movie first, and then they could go to the real SpaceCamp (one in Alabama and one in Vandenberg AFB in California) - they had to expect that they would find the same type of environment that was presented in the movie, and then he felt "disappointed" ... I think that their parents did not explain the difference between fantasy and reality. Well. If you like fantastic movies and have not seen it, I highly recommend it! Enjoy!
