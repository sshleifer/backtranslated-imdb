This is another fantastic favorite from Ralph Bakshi; after watching it on YouTube. Set in the distant past after the ice age, it is a prehistoric quest for the sword and spells between good and evil. Nekron, the ruler of the Ice kingdom and his mother, Queen Julian, decided to conquer the known world. When their glaciers destroy the village of a man named Larn, he (Larn) vows to avenge his people and kill the Ice Lord. Meanwhile, the subordinates of the servants Nekron and Juliana captured the steady daughter of the King of Fire Jarol, Princess Teegra; but she manages to escape and eventually meets with Larn, who promises to take her back to Firekeep; if the sub-humans do not find them first. <br /> <br /> This film made very few cash registers (like most of Ralph Bakshi's films), but it became an iconic classic, partly due to the quality of art, cooperation of Ralph Bakshi and the famous fantasy artist Frank Frazetta. I also heard that the script was written by Gerry Conway and Roy Thomas, two men who made stories from Conan's comic books, including James Gurney, the illustrator of the novel Dinotopia; although I have never read Conan or Dinotopia. And also painter Thomas Kinkade, known for his paintings for figurines, music boxes for The Bradford Exchange Company in addition to paintings. And just like Bakshi's films The Lord of the Rings and American Pop, this film has been subjected to rotoscopy, but this process works better in this film than in the previous one. <br /> <br /> So, in general, I think it's one of the best animated fantasy films ever made, and the amazing collaboration of two great minds - Ralph Bakshi and Frank Frazetta. With lots of fantasies, sexual insinuations and exciting adventures.
