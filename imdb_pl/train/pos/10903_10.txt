This man is unusual. You really feel that you have lived a life with him through these tragic events and finally you cry with your family. He was so passionate about his case, not only for himself, but to ensure that others who survive him do not have to go through this miserable pain. I watch this movie every time I have a bad or "bad" day, and I always manage to see the great and brighter side of life, just like Jonny, even with his unbearable pain. I only regret that I do not know about Jonny earlier because I visited England twice in his life and I could say that I met him. It is comforting to know that Jonny is sitting on his cloud, without pain! Rest in peace, Dear Jonny. You deserve it!
