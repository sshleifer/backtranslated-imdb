I saw the trailer of this movie in the 70's when I was only 16 when watching a different movie. ABOUT!!!! how excited I was and my best friend. we could not wait for a month until it happens. I saw this movie 17 times this year in the theater. I love, I love, I love it. Kris is perfect for a movie. He is bold and a bit tacky, but also shy and uncertain about the Babs. When they sing evergreen in the studio, and he calls his hoarse voice, so much different from the perfect notes coming from her, but I always thought it was one of the best scenes in the movie. The way he looks at her and is so proud. I could watch this movie every day. We tried to dress like est-her. I even have a long sweater and a hat that was just like the one she wore. it came on TV on time and I told my daughters to watch them as teenagers and they loved it. Maybe I was just so involved in times when everything was extreme, I do not know. The ending is in tears even today.
