In recent weeks, I liked Laurence Olivier a lot and I was excited when I discovered this gem. I've always thought it was wonderful when I came across a movie where I do not have to have my finger on the remote in case the nudity blew his ugly head. <br /> <br /> The divorce of Lady X is charming until the final scene and had to be a real delight for the viewers in 1938. I just want people today to accept and love real humor instead of the horrible conversation that people now call funny. <br /> <br /> Ms. X's divorce is worth every moment.
