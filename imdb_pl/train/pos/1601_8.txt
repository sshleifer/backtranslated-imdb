It's a pretty simple, not very active, but very charming movie. There were moments when I see why Cher won an Oscar for Best Actress, but there were other moments when I was wondering why Glenn Close did not win at Fatal Attraction. In any case, winning the Oscar and the Golden Globe, and BAFTA Cher nomination for Cher, plays Loretta Castorini, a simple woman with low-paid work, who was asked by Mr. Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello) to marry him. He promises to come back in a month because his mother is ill, so he means when he needs as much of his family as possible to attend the wedding. The only problem is that when he discovers that Johnny is Ronny's one-handed brother (nominated for the Golden Globe by Nicolas Cage), they begin to have a relationship, and there the love goes to the lunar scene (where the title comes from). Starring nominated for Oscar Vincent Gardenia as Cosmo Castorini, Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe, they won Olympia Dukakis as Rose Castorini and John Mahoney as Perry. It ends without a wedding for Johnny and Loretta, but she and Ronny were happy together. He won an Academy Award for Best Screenplay, a script written directly on the screen and was nominated for the Best Director Award for Norman Jewison (in the heat of the night) and the best movie, received BAFTA Award nomination for Best Score for Dick Hyman and the Best Original Screenplay and was nominated for Golden Globes for the best film - Komedia / musical and the best screenplay. It was 100 for 100 years, 100 quotes ("Snap out of!"), Number 17 for 100 years, 100 for passion and number 41 for 100 years, 100 laughter. Very good!
