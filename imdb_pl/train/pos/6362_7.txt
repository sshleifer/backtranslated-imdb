I admit I saw "Speed ​​Racer", but I never really watched it, and I saw other shows, some of those dressed as birds that flew a ship called the Phoenix, and others revolved around a spaceship that looked like giant ocean ship and sometimes flew for some reason and was really dark and difficult to understand for someone who was five years old. This one, although I was watching almost every episode and amazing at that time, was such that this concert had something to do with the solution. Actually, it's over, the bad guys did it in contrast to almost every American cartoon, in which nothing really ends, like the last episode of Transformers of the first generation, which ended with Galvatron and this new evil guy swearing to get Autobots, Dungeons and Dragons with kids at home, with GI Joe and Cobra still ready to try again and so on and so forth. This ended and contained a pretty cool robot that got new weapons as the series progressed, it was a bit bland, because he could not fly and only had some really nice weapons. When that happened, he got a cool shooting fist, like the one that Android 16 used against the Dragonball Z Cell, and then this weapon evolved to include razor-fired weapons. Then the big robot even got wings so that it could fly, and even more weapons were built into the wings. He would also get a few allies in a female robot and a rather funny one, called in America Bobo. The villains consisted not only of Dr. Hell, but a really strange person who was a half-half woman and a guy with a flying head. An interesting spectacle and it was nice to see the ending.
