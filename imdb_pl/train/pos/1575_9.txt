The van trott movie rosenstrasse is the best movie I have seen for years. I am not really interested in films with a historical background, but thanks to that I gained my interest for this time !! <br /> <br /> the only annoying thing about the movie were the scenes in New York and the impression that he was "trying to be as American as possible" ... which I think was absolutely unsuccessful. <br /> <br /> scenes in the back really got to my heart. the German actress katja riemann completely deserves her reward. she is one of the most impressive actresses I have ever seen. I will watch more of her films in the future. great happiness for me that I am a native German speaking =) and only for a year in us, so as soon as I come back, I will buy some DVD riemann. <br /> <br /> so that everyone will be there who has not seen this movie yet: SEE THIS !!! I think it would be too long to describe what this is all about, especially all flash backs and time switches are hard to explain, but I just feel it, you will be delighted!
