I did not know anything about the film before watching and I think it was a "no expectation" factor that helped me to survive early and later I liked it more than I expected. <br /> <br /> The setting was interesting, strange but interesting. The plot had gaps / jumps, which I think are a bit distracting the audience. In the background there is no great soundtrack that creates a "romantic" atmosphere. BUT, it did not matter. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between Emma and Luis was simply excellent. There was some inexplicable strange chemistry that I could not resist; I fell in love with him and here I am, writing this review. The subtle portrait of the love of the two actors was excellent and I believe that this is the core of this film. <br /> <br /> This film is not a daily romantic comedy; in fact, not everyone will appreciate it. I had to sit down for a while, then slowly began to understand the little things that I could not catch at first. I can not guarantee that everyone will like it, but I hope you will.
