The Prix de Beauté was created at the threshold of the transition from silence to sound, which happened somewhat later in Europe than in Hollywood. Originally conceived as silent, it was released with a dubbed soundtrack in France, with a French actress talking about the lines of Louise Brooks, but was released as a silent in Italy and other parts of Europe. I was lucky to see the flawless renewal of the Italian print Cineteca di Bologna at the Tribeca Film Festival. I have not seen the talkie version yet, but I think it is safe to assume that the silent version is much more satisfying, because in all reports the dubbing is poorly made (Louise Brooks speaks English clearly, so there is no way that her lips are matched. ) Also, the film is entirely mute, with a few titles and a small need for dialogue. Prix ​​de Beauté tells its story visually thanks to the exciting, ingenious work with the camera. The opening is immediately kinetic, with fast-cut scenes of urban life and swimmers splattering on the public beach. The whole film focuses on visual details, on clothing, machines, decorations and symbolic images, such as a bird in a cage, a heap of torn photographs, a diamond bracelet. It's a quiet film technique at the top. <br /> <br /> Louise Brooks is of course responsible for saving the film from oblivion. Understanding this makes it only painful to reflect that it was her last role in the main role. Glisteningly beautiful, it dominates the film with its charisma, and also gives a completely natural, but very charged performance. Her role here, more than in the Pabst films for which she is best known, is a woman who we can fully understand and sympathize with. Game Lucienne Garnier, a typist with an invasive fiancé who wants to draw more from life and secretly enters the beauty contest with immediate success. He is then torn between the exciting life of a new life and the love of a man who insists that he gives or loses everything. All characters are drawn with nuances. The fiancé arouses pity and is not just a brute: he loves Lucienne, but he is a limited man who can not deal with life outside of him or draws the attention of other men. Even the "other man" in this story is not a simple narrow group for which we first take him, although his intentions may be as possessive as a fiancé. <br /> <br /> ********** *************** NOTE: SPOILERS BELOW ************* **** <br /> <br /> The film has many great sets of songs, including the Lucienne triumph in the "Miss Europe" competition, shown by the comic reactions of various members of the audience who finish dressing the heroine of flowers; her misery as a housewife, peeling potatoes while the cuckoo clock pendulum means time behind her; a nightmare trip to a funfair (in a silent version, it happens late in the movie, after her wedding), in which Lucienne, crushed among the low-born and depressed macho antics of her husband, decides that she can not go with her current existence; especially the last scene in the projection room, where he watches the test of the talkie screen. Louise Brooks may never have looked more beautiful than she is here, with the projector's ray shimmering on her alabaster profile, her arms covered in white fur, her face glowing under the black helmet of her hair as she looks at herself as she sings on the screen. The double shot of her exquisite corpse and her still vivid picture on the screen is particularly moving: the image of Louise Brooks, like Lucienne, remains immortal despite her frustratingly interrupted film career.
