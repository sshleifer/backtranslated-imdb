Although DiG! he was hailed as the closest to what the music industry is highly fabricated. The director introduced the audience into the belief that Brian Jonestown's massacre disappeared from the ground after 1998. And the rivalry between Dandy Warhols and Jonestown was exterminated. In this film, the truth about this subject is not really visible. <br /> <br /> Having said that this film is infinitely quoted and is an interesting watch because we are looking at two groups of very talented musicians creating their art. One of the best things this movie is wearing is the unique perspective between the indie music scene and the larger corporate scene. <br /> <br /> Recommended mainly for music and two fantastic bands.
