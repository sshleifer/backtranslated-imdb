From the very beginning I was very excited about this film. The poster is probably the funniest movie I've ever seen. I immediately bought one for a dorm in September. <br /> <br /> Each element has met beautifully in this film. Often you can see a movie with so many penises, gay and racial jokes, so praised by critics. Carell and the rest of the cast provide sensational jokes. Carell remains sweet throughout the movie, where at the end of the movie you support him to succeed in your relationship more than you let him be abandoned. Supporting cast is brutal, each of them has some problems with the ladies themselves. <br /> <br /> One of the things in this movie is the abundance of memorable scenes we've received. This makes the movie easy to remember. This film will often be touched when the words "chest waxing" and "condom" are mentioned in the conversation. <br /> <br /> Watching him in the theater, I was surprised how many older people were there to watch him. I saw a group of four women enter in the mid-1960s. Despite the older audience, this movie still filled the theater with laughter. <br /> <br /> I think people who like it are fans of Office and Steve Carell. A lot of jokes reminds me of jokes that you can see in Family Guy. The film is sufficiently shallow for adolescent boys and is still sweet enough and wise for middle-aged women. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend going to this movie if you are not a fan of profanity or if it is easily offended. However, when you're in a movie, remember that this movie is in a good mood. Jokes are not "gay jokes", it's just jokes. And they are fun.
