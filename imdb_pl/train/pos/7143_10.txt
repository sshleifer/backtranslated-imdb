"Holes" is my favorite movie of all time! So far, I've seen this movie three times in cinemas and can not wait to buy this movie on DVD in September. I read the book after watching the movie and was amazed at how similar the book and the movie were. The director of this film did a great job of recreating the book in the form of a film. In addition, all actors chosen to play roles did wonderful roles, especially Max Kasch as ZigZag. Props for everyone involved in creating this movie, it was a real success! 10 out of 10 stars, I definitely recommend it to everyone!
