Here is a rare jewel for those who have not seen or probably did not even hear about it. In the 1980s, Dennis Quaid was a hot commodity, but in the early 90s Dennis Quaid disappeared from the scene. In 1993, he returned to the big screen with three films, all of which unfortunately bombed. Two of those movies that I really liked, and let me develop one of them. <br /> <br /> "Wilder Napalm" is a crazy movie about two brothers Wallace (Quaid) and Wilder (Arliss Howard) who are ... fire starters: yes, they have the power of pirokinetics. <br /> <br /> Wilder decided not to use his power (in any case unusable) after a fatal incident in his youth, when he and his brother blew up an abandoned house that killed a man who was unaware of them. Currently, Wilder is a firefighter and is married to crazy Vida (Debra Winger), who is under house arrest, guess what, arson (see the video to better understand this). Wilder also did not talk to Wallace for 5 years because Wallace set fire to his hair during the bachelor party. <br /> <br /> Wallace loves his piro power and uses it to play. He also runs a carnival and is the main clown. When Carnival arrives in Wilder's town, Wallace decides to connect with his brother and see Vida, in which Wallace was in love! Vida's house arrest ends, but Wilder is busy. So Wallace comes in and the fun begins. Brother versus brother ... fighting fire with fire! <br /> <br /> A great ball of fire throwing yourself into this movie ... eat your heart, Drew Barrymore! <br /> <br /> There are also really strange, but funny elements in the movie, like Wilder's fire unit singing acapella songs during fires and wards. Jim Varney (known worldwide as "Ernest") appears as a pal from the Wallace carnival. "Wilder Napalm" is perfectly filmed ... and cleverly connected ... very close to the wall and avant-garde. <br /> <br /> Give me a look ...
