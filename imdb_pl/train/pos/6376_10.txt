If you have sons or daughters who love action, adventure, intrigue and imagination - without having to break into the song every twelve minutes - this is a Disney movie for you! My sons loved every minute of this movie and I have to admit that I have repeatedly laughed throughout the film. There are no lively songs that could interfere with the wonderfully told story, and the characters themselves are cute and easy to identify. This should become one of the "Disney classics" due to the beautifully illustrated scenery and unremitting emotions!
