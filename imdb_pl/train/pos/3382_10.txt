I did not always have the impression that the film is visionary. But clearly this movie has the germ of a premonition. <br /> <br /> We should not have a tendency to be alarmists and see armageddon in something because it seems to fit our emotions of the moment. But did not we say that about "1984"? Did James Orwell know that the Internet would become a reality soon after 1984; In fact, it was in 1994; he could reconsider writing his story the way he did it. Reward. <br /> <br /> It does not matter. The important thing is that we often consider ourselves better than our surroundings, but we actually become emotional about the "apple of love" when necessity knocks on our door. A snapshot of yourself in old age. <br /> <br /> No matter what time line, I know for sure that we have not seen its beginning yet. <br /> <br />
