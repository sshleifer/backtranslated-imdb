Most people miss the Hollywood concept. If the hero can stimulate heroic deeds to the child's mind, within the limits of the law, I support the lessons taught by Doc Savage. <br /> <br /> In times of conflict or war, society and the government are looking for heroes to decorate. The film industry brings heroes to the screen for people with whom you can identify - such as Doc Savage, James Bond, Superman, Batman, Spiderman and others. Doc Savage has been remembered by more than one generation as "the best of the best" in front of James Bond, Superman or any other. All others who follow Doc Savage are only part of the character, not "Bronze Man."
