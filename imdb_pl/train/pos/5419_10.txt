It's yarn for reps, old-fashioned. I understand that according to today's political standards, the treatment of Indians was unacceptable. But this movement is not about politics. It's about action, dialogue, comedy, acting, directing, music and photography, and all this is wonderful. Grant, Fairbanks and McLaglen are electric together, and Jaffe is great. This is the best buddy movie.
