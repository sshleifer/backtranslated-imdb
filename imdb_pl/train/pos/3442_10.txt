This film leaves an intellectual mind thinking and trying to analyze history. I also can not understand why people would throw away this movie. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Jerry Bruckheimer, this movie may not be suitable for this. . The performance of actors and actresses is exemplary. Not false, only natural. <br /> <br /> No special sound effects, so special side effects. <br /> <br /> The camera's operation is excellent, the music is so good. I can not wait to get the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> It leaves your body numb, like Constant Garderner. Directly, he has a strict talent, certainly not a supporter.
