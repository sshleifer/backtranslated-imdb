After watching the movie last night at Sundance, I realized that most of Nakata's style was made for the first time in this movie. We have many of the same elements of the RING series here, especially the idea that the media is a source of supernaturals. Instead of a cursed video tape, instead we have a haunted studio and strange images appearing on the film. In fact, the strange images appearing in the movie immediately bring to mind the cursed video tape in the RING. There was only one obsession with the water that goes through the later films of Nakata. The final scenes are quite chilling in the veins, with a slight nod to Murnau, which opens the door to the same person and the ghost entering the room, reminds me immediately of the NOSFERARY. A cool movie that will make you think twice about entering the catwalk.
