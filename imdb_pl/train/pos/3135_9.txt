I loved this movie. I knew that it would be filled with camp and stupidity as in the original series. I am very happy to see again Adam West, Burt Warda, Frank Gorshin and Julie Newmar. Anyone who loved the Batman series from the 1960s should enjoy the Return to the Bat Cave. We can say that the actors had a great time creating this film, especially Adam West. And I bet he would be happy to jump into his Batman outfit if the script required it. I told many friends about this movie who did not want to watch it ... now they regretted it. I have all the original 120 episodes on VHS. Now this movie will join my collection. Thank you for meeting Adam and Burt again.
