I admit that I am a bit tired of a small child's film genre, which softens the heart of his / her unwilling protector. I saw them enough? Baby Boom, Kolya, About a Boy, Mostly Martha and to some extent Whale Rider ?? expect him to be bored with the formula. In the "King of masks" I noticed a gloomy environment: small towns in China in the 1930s. Extreme poverty was the norm, and the girls were considered so worthless to poor parents that they killed them at birth or gave them to anyone who would take them to the black market. When Wang discovers that his purchased grandson, which is called "Doggie", is a granddaughter, he initially throws her away, despite being very promising as the heiress of the street. Even after he reluctantly takes her, she is not too upset when she is kidnapped. The film is then rough, showing the length to which a young, intelligent girl had to go through to survive in this society. <br /> <br /> The two main performances are credible and captivating in a social context. In western society one would expect at least a bit of resentment from Wang, who did not achieve more material success. Wang accepts his station as a famous artist with low social status, but I did it too. While Doggie demonstrates the level of prematureness and cunning that would be suspected in a modern, suburban child, he is completely credible in the context of a kid constantly experiencing a lifestyle in a society that treats poor girls like trash. And after he learned that her seven previous owners physically and mentally exploited her, her fierce commitment to Wang makes sense. <br /> <br /> Take a look at life in a small town in a foreign country, the naturalness of the two main actors, surprising twists and of course, thrilling resolution, all contribute to a very watchful movie.
