I always liked to watch Chuck Norris in the movie. Although acting may not be great, the battle scenes are fantastic. I also liked that Judson Mills was performing next to him. In my opinion Norris Brothers proved that they are great artists and it was another great production! I hope you will take some time to watch this movie!
