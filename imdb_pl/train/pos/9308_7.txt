If you're used to watching Gabriel Byrne in serious roles like Tom in Millers Crossing or Keaton in The Usual Suspects, then I recommend you this movie. Even if you're not a fan of Gabriel Byrne in particular, all the actors in this movie give really great performances. If you have about eleven bucks (or almost nine pounds), I'm talking about ordering online or borrowing from your favorite movie rental agency. I guarantee you will laugh if you like gangster movies. Mad Dog Time / Trigger Happy is one of those movies you will never forget, and which you still watch. You will talk about it so much that your friends will beg for borrowing.
