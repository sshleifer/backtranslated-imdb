I would even say a few shades of Hitchcock ... it's clearly better than MMM, which some, if not most of Woody's fans, perceive as guilt-pleasing. By the way, do you know that Annie Hall was first conceived as the secret of murder? In any case, Woody regains some meaning in the film comedy. The plot returns are nice and strained. I will say that in the first 20 minutes, some actors are a little too hasty in providing their lines, but they stick to each other. Scarlett Johansson is well cast as Diane Keaton and she never has any uncomfortable moments between her and much older Woody. Nobody can imagine a more perfect actor for the role of Peter Lyman than Jackman.
