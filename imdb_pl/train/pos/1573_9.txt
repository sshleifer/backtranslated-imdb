Here's an explanation of what scriptwriter Pamela Katz told me why MvT introduced JG as a specific character in the movie: <br /> <br /> "... the historical record is very clear: Joseph Goebbels was directly responsible for publishing the Rosenstrasse prisoners, so we needed the way to introduce Goebbels to our film ... For a woman like Lena, a woman from an aristocratic family with connections, it was not inconceivable that she would try to reach the top. The idea of ​​reaching Goebbels was not impossible for her, so he became our hook. <br /> <br /> Those of you who insist on seeing the current sex here, can read my new thread below and then shoot <br /> <br /> Jan Lisa Huttner FILMS FOR TWO
