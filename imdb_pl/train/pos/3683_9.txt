18 directors had the same task: to tell stories about love in Paris. Of course, some of them turned out to be better than others, but the whole mosaic is quite adorable - besides, would not it be boring if everyone had the same vision of love? Here's how I rate the segments (which can change after the second display): <br /> <br /> 1. "Latin Quartier" by Gérard Depardieu <br /> <br /> One of the most outstanding French actors directed my favorite segment, in which always appeared Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara. Witty and delightful. <br /> <br /> 2. "Tour Eiffel" by Sylvain Chometa <br /> <br /> Beautiful, visually stunning (thanks to the director of "The Triplets of Belleville") story of a little boy whose parents are mimes; <br /> <br /> 3. "Tuileries" Ethan and Joel Coen <br /> <br /> Brothers Coen + Steve Buscemi = Funny <br /> <br /> 4. "Parc Monceau" Alfonso Cuarón (" Y Tu Mamá También "," Children of Men "), feat. Nick Nolte and Ludivine Sagnier (funny); <br /> <br /> 5. "Place des Fêtes" by Oliver Schmitz, feat. Seydou Boro and Aissa Maiga (touching); <br /> <br /> 6. "14th Arrondissement", Alexander Payne's ("Election", "About Schmidt") a great look at the pitiful side of life is here, feat. an underestimated character actress Margo Martindale (mother of Hilary Swank in "Million Dollar Baby") as a lonely, middle-aged American woman on vacation; <br /> <br /> 7. "Faubourg Saint-Denis", the crazy style of Tom Tykwer ("Run Lola Run") works in the story of a young actress (Natalie Portman) and a blind man (Melchior Beslon) who fall in love; <br /> <br /> 8. "Père-Lachaise", Wes Craven, feat. Emily Mortimer and Rufus Sewell (plus an interesting episode of Alexander Payne as ... Oscar Wilde!); <br/> <br /> 9. "Loin du 16ème" by Walter Salles and Daniela Thomas (a simple but moving story of talented Brazilian directors, Catalina Sandino Moreno's performance); <br /> <br /> 10. "Quartier des Enfants Rouges" by Olivier Assayas ("Clean"), sad story. always fantastic Maggie Gyllenhaal; <br /> <br /> 11. "Le Marais" by Gus Van Sant, feat. Gaspard Ulliel, Elias McConnell and Marianne Faithful (simple but funny); <br /> <br /> 12. "Quartier de la Madeleine", Vincenzo Natali, feat. Elijah Wood and Olga Kurylenko; <br /> <br /> 13. "Quais de Seine", Gurinder Chadha; <br /> <br /> 14. "Place des Victoires" by Nobuhiro Suwa, feat. Juliette Binoche and Willem Dafoe; <br /> <br /> 15. "Bastille" Isabel Coixet (great director of the underestimated "My Life Without Me"), feat. Miranda Richardson, Sergio Castellitto, Javier Cámara and Leonor Watling; <br/> <br /> 16. "Pigalle" by Richard LaGravenese, feat. Bob Hoskins and Fanny Ardant; <br /> <br /> 17. "Montmartre", with Bruno Podalydès and with participation; <br /> <br /> 18. "Porte de Choisy" by Christopher Doyle with Barbet Schroeder (known mainly as the director of "Barfly", "Reversal of Fortune" and "Single White Female"). <br /> <br /> I could classify some segments so brilliant, and others medium (and even a bit boring), but none of them is bad. Generally, I give "Paris, Je t'Aime" 8.5 / 10 and I recommend what it is: a lovely mosaic about love and other things in between.
