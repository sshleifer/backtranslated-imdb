I never watched this movie from 1971. And they had a great time with this amazing production created by Walt Disney Studios and great animation creations. Angela Lansbury (Eglantine Price) played a unique role as a woman who took the witch craft course and was a student who began to fly on her broom and had a lot of difficulties during the start. Eglantine discovered many tricks and was able to travel to different parts of the world. However, Eglantine has left her last exams, becoming a great witch. Mr. Emerlius Browne (David Tomlinson) was the person who sold Eglantine this magic course and tries to help her in every possible way to find a solution. Eglantine has a goal in his madness, namely stopping the Nazis from avoiding England. Great entertainment for the whole family and we need more such films today.
