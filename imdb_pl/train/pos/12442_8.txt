The film, shot in an impossible schedule and budget, was much better than you would expect, certainly much more faithful to the books and comics of Peter O'Donnell than the previous two films. You can read the bar currently in reprints from Titan Books or in the Comics Revue monthly. This is one of the greatest adventure comics of all time. The movie is not great, but unlike most low-budget movies, it makes full use of what it has and has your interest. In the case of DVD accessories, an interview with Quentin Tarentino, who is obviously stoned, is a gas. Some people accused Tarentino of associating his name with the film, but without it it would never have been made. He is a fan of Modesty Blaise and chose a good writer and director. All things considered, worth 8 stars.
