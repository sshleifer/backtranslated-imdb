I caught it on the plate yesterday. I liked this movie. I traveled to Russia 3 times (accepting 2 children). I can not pinpoint exactly why I liked this movie, except that I saw the "bad" phrase "good" and "good" phrase "half-bad". I liked Ben Chaplin's appearance throughout the film. Like "I can not believe that this is happening to me", whether it's good or bad the same look (and works). A great ending. 7/10. Rent her or grab her on the plate, just like me.
