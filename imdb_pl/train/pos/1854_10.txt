After developing a critical look at the film and the love of good cinema, I went to see Antwone Fisher with my breath held. Although I am a firm fan of Denzel Washington - both his acting skills and his public character; I am an honest enough fan to admit to (very few) times when he did not quite hit a movie or two. And I could have been wrong in these matters - after all, I'm not an actor. But it was different - Denzel poured his experience into a career and ran a film that touches one of the most sensitive topics known to man - bullying a child. As his directorial debut, no less. And develop a film to show that he will successfully present the triumph of man. I did not want to be disappointed. <br /> <br /> And I was not. <br /> <br /> What I saw was a film full of promise that combined a diverse audience and gave the inexperienced viewer a brief but true look at the life of a young man whose childhood was hell, but he triumphed in spite of everything. This film did - and no dry theater in any color proved it. It requires that someone knows the topics from this movie to know when the truth is presented. It takes a talented filmmaker to tell a story convincingly when you have not experienced it. And if it continues to attract the audience and make the audience react emotionally, without mercy, the filmmaker has done his job. In every movie. Black, white, purple or polka dotted. It makes good cinema. Bravo, Denzel Washington, Derek Luke, Joy Bryant and above all Antwone Fisher - you've actually won.
