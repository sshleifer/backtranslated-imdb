This film tells the story of the romance of the niece Alberta Einstien and the gas station employee. To connect these two elements, Einstien agrees to help Ed (Tim Robbins of Hudsucker Proxy) learn to act more intelligently. This impresses Catherine (Meg Ryan). Unfortunately, Einstien goes too far, and Ed is considered a genius. Cheerfulness follows. It can not be bypassed. Filmed in Mercer County, New Jersey, Princeton University, Law Schoolville Prep School (twice at Princeton University), and a beautiful historic gas station in Hopewell.
