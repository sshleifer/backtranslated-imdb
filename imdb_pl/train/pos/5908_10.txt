This is one of the most brilliant films I've seen in recent times. It goes much higher than any international film of any reputation. I am really surprised why he did not receive the recognition he deserved. Sonali Kulkarni winning the National Award is probably the only comforting fact. Renuka Daftardar simply amazes when he speaks loudly through his eyes. There are several scenes that stand out: When Gauri returns from the city to Krishna's wedding, she and Krishna meet for the first time in many years. K Krysznaa notes the change in Gauri, but one line of dialogue is not mentioned. The whole range of emotions is conveyed through subtle manners and eyes. There is one more at the end when Krsna begs Abhay Kulkarni to marry Gauri instead. If this scene does not move you, you have no heart. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie to see the purity of movies and acting abilities.
