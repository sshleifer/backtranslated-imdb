PRZEWODNIK PO CEREMIE PERVERTA (2007) **** <br /> <br /> If a loving cinema makes me a pervert, so be it! <br /> <br /> If you're a real "moviefreak" like me then I'm sure you do not have enough movies about making movies, and I do not necessarily mean a dry document, then. I mean the total discourse about watching a movie. Well, if so, I have a movie experiment for you. <br /> <br /> In Sophie Fiennes (sister of Ralph and Joseph, if you were wondering), he noticed the philosopher cum cinephile Slavoj Zizek. the cinema with impressive (and often outrageous) takes over everything from the silent Chaplin period to the modern era of the Wachowski brothers analyzing, probing and writing about the psychosexual basis, socioeconomic, political and, of course, undefined magic of film experience with its unflagging, determined and almost frenetic dissertations. The transition from explaining how The Bates's home in PSYCHO is the properly reflected psyche of the conflicted Norman Bates with each level as his Ego, Superego and Id is one thing, but then suggesting the same about every Marx Brother in just one stroke is an extraordinary test of faith, which conquers the layman's skepticism. <br /> <br /> Although I had no idea who Zizek is? reminiscent of the hybrid of filmmaker Brian DePalmy, European actor Rade Serbedzija and the hyperkinetic energy of filmmakers Quentin Tarantino and Martin Scorsese ?? thanks to his hissing language and passion, the host turns out to be a crazy prophet. <br /> <br /> Fiennes cleverly inserts Zizka into several fragments of movie clips scattered all over the text, creating a humorous tone, but still allows the ranting and raving to continue the full pass, giving a break for the arguments in three acts including a range of films by Kubrick , Lynch, Hitchcock and films as diverse as THE WIZARD OF OZ, THE RED SHOES and FIGHT CLUB. <br /> <br /> Everyone will find something for themselves and if one man can provoke an argument, or at least a reason to discuss the topics of the film? even if they are guilty of Freudami / Jungami? then I say that this collection of movie theory is worth watching. Search now, if you can, before the home video comes; it's the only way to appreciate it.
