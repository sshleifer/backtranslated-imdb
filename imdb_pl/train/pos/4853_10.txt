I have something for old black and white movies of this kind, films Will Hay and Abbot & Costello, especially since these are my favorites. I chose this movie on DVD because it used the same idea as Will Oh "Oh Mr Porter", which is one of the best comedies ever made. I just finished watching this movie less than ten minutes ago (the movie ended at 12:45). I find movies of this kind, related to Ghost Trains etc., It's best to watch at night when the lights are turned off. In this way, you enter the story more, and watching at night works well in this movie. <br /> <br /> One-liners in the film may seem a bit outdated for some viewers, it probably depends on the viewer. However, they are not dated to me. I am 28 years old and even though I'm not old enough to be around when this movie was released for the first time (my father was, however). I still have a lot of appreciation for some of the old movies of this kind. Sitting in the room in front of the TV, with snacks and drinks, and bouncing and relaxing at night while watching these movies, few things can beat the feeling you get doing it. This is an escape from reality for a moment. <br /> <br /> I noticed that one of the men in the film (he has a black mustache) appears about three-quarters of the movie after a car accident and looks for a woman for whom he went to the station. This man was also in the classic movie Will Hay "Duch St Michaels". I thought I would like to stress it if nobody noticed :). <br /> <br /> The songs in the film are very atmospheric. Outside, the abandoned station looks good and if there is no soul in miles in any direction, and the interior of the station is very cozy, looking away from the rain storm that is outside. I felt like I wanted to be in a movie with a cast. The atmosphere in this film is now something that is missing in many movies. This makes you addicted to the beginning of the movie until its completion. <br /> <br /> We need more of these types of movies in today's market. But, unfortunately, you could have missed watching movies with nudity, curses and primitive humor. This kind of film-making era (The Ghost Train, Oh Mr Porter, etc.) is the golden age of cinema for me!
