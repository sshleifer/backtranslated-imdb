what's wrong with you guys, if you were not thrilled with the sequences of action cars and the hot body of Jessica Simpsons, you're screwed up in the head. Of course, the movie is not a masterpiece, I do not think it should be. It was fun and funny, I never watched the show when I was younger, recently I only saw one episode, and when I watched the movie, I felt that it had the same kind of atmosphere. The spots in the movies were practically shaking, and the sequences of the cars were good because they did not bore me and stretched like some scenes in 2 fast 2-people. and jessica Simpson is just hot, I just want them to use it more in the action sequences. In conclusion, I watched it hellishly and I will see it again soon and buy it on DVD. People, enjoy what it is.
