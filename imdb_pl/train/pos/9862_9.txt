In the end, I saw the infamous "Ice Age". Besides, maybe it's not as much fun as I expected after seeing the genius teaser, I can not say a bad word about it. Of course, it's not as spectacular as Disney production (besides, this is Fox's first attempt in the full CG movie), but it has a huge heart and sometimes (like looking at Manfred's eyes after we see a sad look at his past) I found myself on the edge of tears. But when they joined the child with their father, I could not keep them anymore. A film that has no problem with walking on a thin line of juicy and banal and manages to bring more than the best of it; The end result is one of the most moving animated creations I've ever seen. Great, funny characters that grow quickly on you (and great voice talents) and many funny unforgettable scenes, especially from Scrat, make the movie a sufficient reason to do so. Plus Dodo scene, which is my favorite funny scene from 2002. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I do not understand it, but for some reason it really looks like the CG animation will have an advantage in the future. But if it just means there will be more movies like this (and who can forget about Pixar's works), I do not mind, at least for now. 9/10
