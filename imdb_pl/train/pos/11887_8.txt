It is estimated that between 2000 and 2020, 68 million people will die prematurely as a result of AIDS. Anticipated payments are the largest in sub-Saharan Africa, where you can expect 55 million additional deaths. In addition to grim statistics, there are personal stories that we rarely hear. Christophe Honor√© describes one of the most moving films Close to Leo, produced for French television as part of a series devoted to the problems of young people. Although fictional, he deals with a situation that is unfortunately too common - the result of the diagnosis of HIV for a loving close family. <br /> <br /> When twenty-one-year-old Leo (Pierre Mignard) tells his parents and two teenage brothers, Tristan (Rodolphe Pauley) and Pierrot (Jeremie Lippmann) that he has AIDS, the family is devastated. Out of concern for their youth, they decide not to give information to their youngest brother, 12-year-old Marcel (Yannis Lespert), but he overhears conversation and begins to sulk and act chaotically. When Leo goes to Paris for treatment, he takes Marcel with him, but the young boy confronts Leo and demands knowledge of the truth. Leo tells him he is sick, and Marcel is sad but accepts. But when he brings Marcel to a meeting with old gay friends, the tension between them comes to the surface, preparing the scene for riveting. <br /> <br /> Although I felt uncomfortable with the scenes in the bed covering the physical contact between the brothers, I feel that the honesty of Close to Leo and the brilliant performances of Lespert and Mignard outweigh the weight in his favor. Watching events unfolding from the perspective of a young boy gives the film an authenticity that reminded me of the movie Quebecois Leolo and The 400 Blows Truffauta. Unlike some of the American films that dance around the anguish of AIDS, Close to Leo tells the raw truth, but it does it in a gentle and wonderful way.
