I think that this film increases diversity and is very accurate in terms of historical reconstruction. The way he shows the different communities that stay together in Thailand is very interesting ... Portuguese, Japanese and various communities managed by the king. Plots around the manor are, as usual, a struggle for power with a lot of betrayal. The wardrobe is fine. The film is also produced locally in Thailand in reasonable production. The scene with the elefant as performers is very interesting. This is fun and I think it is also useful in schools because of its historical accuracy, because it shows that Europeans in Asia were subjects of local kings in a way very different from the traditional perspective of Hollywood.
