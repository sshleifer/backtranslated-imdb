Honestly, I had to see this movie back, I did not expect too much, but hey, I was not cheated, I had fun. <br /> <br /> I would say that this movie is a fresh breeze, despite some facts that tried to modernize Nancy Drew, but it reminded me of those 60s and 70s films from Europe and Quebec, where they succeed make contact with children. In this case, the sixteen-year-old teenager tries to do justice, trying to solve the mystery of the death of an actress who died 25 years ago. In any case, when her father ran a business in Hollywood, why not rent a house with a secret behind the door? Well, at least Emma Roberts is doing a great job here. Kinda, like a chubby kid who is na√Øve at first to support his sister's pranks in Nancy, but he finally said that Nancy is cool enough to stick to her, even in her affairs ... The rest of the supporting cast is great and she was happy to see Rachael Leigh Cook in another role: a lonely mother (she did it in Family Rescue, but this time she plays a mature woman ...) Anyway, don dump it, it's fun!
