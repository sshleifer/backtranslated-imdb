Handsome and bold British airline pilot George Taylor (solid portrait of Guiseppe Pambieri) is beaten by bandits after a crazy night in Hong Kong. George meets and falls in love with sweet and virgin Dr. Emy Wong (a great and charming performance by the charming Chai Lee). George recovers his health and returns to work. When Emy does not hear from George for a long time, she succumbs to despair and becomes a prostitute. While the director / co-writer Bitto Albertini actually delivers a satisfying amount of the expected tasty nudity and exciting soft-core sex, this movie is something other than a routine that is plunging into flaccid stench. Instead, it is a surprisingly thought-out, touching and tragic love story between two well-drawn and very attractive characters (Chai like Emy Wong is particularly radiant and endearing). The painting begins cheerfully and cheerfully, but the tone radically changes into a more grim and harsh mood about two-thirds of the way. Ema's descent into the vice after she falsely assumes George abandoned her is grim and depressing; similarly extremely sad and moving surprise ending. It is true that the narrative is certainly melodramatic, but never too stupid or kitsch. In addition, the sex scenes are quite tasteful and even genuinely erotic. The famous Italian porn star Ilona Staller has a good population as the jealous and unfettered secretary of George Helen Miller. Improved photos of Guido Mancori offer many strikingly beautiful pictures of exotic places. The functional, pulsating result of Nico Fidenco goes to a great place. It is worth looking for those who are looking for something else.
