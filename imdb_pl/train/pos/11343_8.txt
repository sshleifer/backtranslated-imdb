I remember seeing it on TV in the late 70's - and it stayed with me! It's charming, loud, colorful - a great movie for children. I recently set up this for some friends at the party - and naturally they thought I was angry and I expected something bad to happen to puppets "Know the weakness" But no - its healthy pure fun. <br /> <br /> jack wild is in great shape, just like mama cass, and somehow attractive charming pile. <br /> <br /> If you like banana pieces and you're 30 years old, it will recreate this surreal childhood on Saturday vibe! <br /> <br /> Even if I now realized that Puf himself is a bit crappy - all he does is catch and run! The quality of a TV movie - if you're like me, you're in death metal - you'll love it!
