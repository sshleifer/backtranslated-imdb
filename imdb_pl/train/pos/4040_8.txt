An ingenious, full of tension claustrophobia exercise. A Japanese thriller that poses a difficult challenge because it fits in two rooms. Not quite successful, but tense, surprising and well-functioning. Can the film look a bit like SAW? two men trapped in peace and fighting each other? but unlike this movie, he has the courage to stay with his assumption and keep the character in his cell throughout the movie. It's like watching a laboratory experiment. For some it may seem that the tension in it is boring, but this reviewer found it fascinating. The sound and image of the film are stunningly well realized. It's definitely a good movie to show a good home video system. Just in time for the evening film festivities in which the paranoid mood prevails. I certainly did not sleep that night.
