TCM keeps me calm all the time ... they make up movies that I've never heard of ... Senso .... now Ossessione ... very early Visconti movie !! ... wow ... The Italian version of the postman Always Rings Twice ... brilliant !! he has played and directed beautifully ... I have never heard of great leaders, Clara Calamai, like Giovanna, and especially about Massimo Girotti as Gino ... what a sensual man !! more muscular and attractive than anyone on screen in 1943 !!! His gaze was ahead of his time ... many of the 50s male stars were probably inspired by him ... he should have been a star all over the world !! The film is much better than the Jack Nicholson / Jessica Lange version and less glossy than the MGM version (which I really like) with John Garfield and Lana Turner remember this white outfit? who can forget .... This Italian version is different ... more realistic and with a very different ending ... see this look ... I'm going to buy it !!
