If a more masterful adaptation than that existed, you do not have to look for it; in this almost perfect presentation of Charlotte Brontë's masterpieces, you'll find everything and more. <br /> <br /> I rarely saw a movie that would make me read the novel on which it was based, but I admit that here. Although I have not read Jane Eyre, I am convinced that I really miss dialogue and conspiracy, intensity and emotion. I would just like to explore the novel because of the great curiosity and emotions that this masterpiece has touched in me. <br /> <br /> I do not have to reveal anything here on the storyline. Let me say this: if you are not sure whether you should watch or read the beautiful story of Jane Eyre, I am begging you not to doubt any more! Every atom of power and magic, which brought up Jane Eyre as a popular classic of English literature, was successfully captured in this film. <br /> <br /> What Brontë did not bring, Clarke and Dalton managed to translate in the spotlight with incredible intensity. The film's success is undoubtedly caused largely by their acting prowess. <br /> <br /> Love Jane Eyre or hate her, but you appreciate wealth, vitality, the truth of history; love characters; love actors; everything as if you loved what is great in the cinema.
