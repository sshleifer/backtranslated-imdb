FINALLY!!!!!!!!!!! I waited for the appearance of this movie for almost a year and finally saw him at the premiere at the SB. I met several actors who were really nice and great in the film. I watched the trailer so many times that I did not know what to expect, but I was completely drawn. The film was really beautiful and the music was good. I recommend it to anyone who is a fan of ryan donowho, and dominique swain was good at it too. other actors were also great. I hope it will appear on DVD soon !!!! He's great in this movie and everything he does is independent. I also like Dominique, but I have not seen her so much. I hope we will see them both soon !!!
