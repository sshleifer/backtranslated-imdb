Yes. I think so. Sure, it was still a great performance with John, but personally I think it's better without him. <br /> <br /> I love to live in the house of CJ and my grandfather, because they are fun together. > <br /> When John was still around, I really did not laugh as much as I do now. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that you are not doing anymore. (I do not think ...) because I would like to see some new material. <br /> <br /> My favorite character must be Rory. poor Rory is almost always omitted. It's always about Bridget or Carrie. WHAT ABOUT RORY !!! ??? Honestly, it's a great concert and for anyone who has never seen it, you have to watch it and watch it. I almost guarantee that you will laugh. even giggle.
