and this is a very disturbing movie. I may be wrong, but this is the last movie in which I considered Burt Reynolds to be a real actor who changed the role and gave the message. <br /> <br /> Jon Voight and Ned Beatty are also great. They are modest and unconscious; businessmen who want to enjoy the country. They did not know what would happen next. <br /> <br /> Photography and sets are realistic and natural. That was before Wes Craven's days. <br /> <br /> The most disturbing thing about this movie is that such places still exist. In America, the rural people still hate city dwellers; almost a century and a half have passed since the Civil War. <br /> <br /> This movie will appeal to you. It was filmed in rural areas of South Georgia, which still exist. Just do not drive past Mobile in Alabama; This area has still not been repaired since Hurricane Katrina. 10/10
