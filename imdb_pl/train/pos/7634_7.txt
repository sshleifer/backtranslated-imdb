<br /> <br /> Ok, the movie will not win any prizes and it's pure chewing gum, and this is a modern update "It's a great life". But it's just released as a low-cost DVD release and it's a much worse way to blow $ 13. You get a movie that has a surprisingly strong cast, but for most years they were a year or two before they became the stars of the list B. However, it is a nice way to pass an hour and a half, do not think too much about it.
