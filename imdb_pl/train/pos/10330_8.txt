It is a trilogy of three short stories by Somerset Maugham. The first one is The Verger, which lasts about 15 minutes and is very pleasant. After 17 years, Albert Foreman is dismissed from work in the church because he can not read or write. So what does he do? Opens a tobacco shop, of course! <br /> <br /> The second is Mr. Know-All, which was actually a story I read at school six years ago and I forgot right away until I heard a known introduction. Another 15 minutes, and also very good. It worked better in the movie than in the book for me, but perhaps because I was only 14 years old, after all. <br /> <br /> The third one is almost disappointed. Almost an hour of length is simply stretching. It's not that bad, but not as fast and briskly as last 2. I watched the first quarter, then jumped to the last quarter of an hour and discovered that it still made sense and I really missed the thing! <br /> <br /> Overall, I give them 8, 9 and 6 out of 10, respectively.
