This is a correct description, but it will not prepare you for the fact that "Enchanted April" - the best film "feel good" is the perfection of its genre. Adorable and sunny, delicate and calm, nice and magical, it is like a ray of sunshine on your face during spring, when you want to close your eyes and smile and stop this moment of peaceful happiness and cherish it forever. This is a movie that really influenced my life. I watched him in difficult times when I was lost, unhappy and very lonely, when I had to deal with sad and tragic events and accept some unflattering truth about myself. It helped me regain my optimism and hope that everything will change and everything will be possible. I promised myself that, no matter what, I would stretch out of misery and self-pity and be grateful for every minute of my life - with his joy and sadness ... I promised myself that I would go to Italy and later that year I did and I was not alone. <br /> <br /> Charming, charming and hearty "Enchanted April" is one of the best films ever and my eternal love. This small film is the highest quality diamond.
