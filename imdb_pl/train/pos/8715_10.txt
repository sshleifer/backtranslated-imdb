This movie is definitely the sweetest I've seen in a long time! Great animation and cute characters (even bad guys were sweet!) Made this winner my winner in my book, as well as in the books with the ones I saw. I still want to see it, but I did not have time. Better than Toy Story, which was good too, but it's not good.
