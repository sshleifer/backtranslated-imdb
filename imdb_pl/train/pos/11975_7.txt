Full House is a great family show. However, after watching several episodes again and again, I realized that they are incredibly boring and often seem to protect against the outside world. Yes, there is a lot of comedy, but there are times when it's incredibly tacky. It's not like I hate him, but just do not watch them again because they get old fast. The first season is probably the best. <br /> <br /> Full House is a widower of Danny Tanner (Bob Saget) and his three daughters D.J. (Candace Cameron) Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin) and Michelle (Mary-Kate and Ashley). When Danny's wife dies, she needs help. So his best friend Joey (Dave Coulier) and Uncle Jesse girls (John Stamos) move in to them. Once they live there, they discover that they can not live without each other. <br /> <br /> Full House reminds you how important your family is and that you can always go home.
