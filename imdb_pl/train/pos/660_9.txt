9 / 10-30 minutes of pure holiday terror. Okay, so it's not so scary. But it's definitely cool. <br /> <br /> Tales from the Crypt (John Kassir) talk about holiday fear, giving us all Christmas geese ... GosseBUMPS I mean. Bwahahahahha. You really should be careful about what AX Santa is for. A scary Christmas and a happy new fear. Okay, I'll stop. <br /> <br /> Okay, so in history, the greedy wife (Best screamer in the world, Mary Ellen Trainor) is killing her husband (Marshall Bell, the coach who gets the towel to death at ANOES 2) for money. BUT, her plan is ruined when a crazy killer dressed in Santa's suit (Larry "Dr Giggles" Drake) comes to her way. <br /> <br /> If you look at YouTube, you can watch it, but most of you have already seen it (my third watching). But if you have not seen it, I advise you to do it.
