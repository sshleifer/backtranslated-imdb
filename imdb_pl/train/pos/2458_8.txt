When I took a seat in the cinema, I was in a great mood and did not plan to change it. But this movie is a dramatic power. I was sweaty and needed a shower afterwards. So what are we? Theoretically, the story of a mature teenager living in Copenhagen, Denmark. It soon occurred to me that the plot seemed quite borrowed from "Bend it like Beckham", where we had an Indian football player and spoiled her sister's wedding. Here we handed her over to a Turkish girl who spoiled her brother's wedding by doing Kung Fu. We also have a love story and of course a competition. After I accepted it, it turned out to be a really emotional, emotional drama and shows some beautiful Kung Fu (though I'm not an expert). The main actress Semra Turan is not only a female Danish champion, but also provides a great performance, so it seems safe to assume that we have a lot of autobiographical impressions here, considering that this is her first film and that she is not an actress. The rest of the supporting cast is fine, good camera, intense Kung Fu. Sidenotes: - The Turkish male audience showed respect, so they had to do something right. - The audience applauded when our heroine finally fought and attacked the boys who beat her brother vengeance heavily. - Xian Gao, Chinese film instructor / actor Kung Fu (Hidden Tiger, Crouching Dragon) played master of the main role <br /> <br /> If you have the chance to see it in the cinema, do it, you will probably have a good and intense experience and do not I know if it works also on a small screen
