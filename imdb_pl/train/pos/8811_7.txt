Eleven different filmmakers from different parts of the world are gathered in this film to present their views and ideas for the WTC attack. This is one of the best efforts you'll see in every movie. Such films are rarely made and appreciated. This movie tries to touch every possible WTC core. Here are some of the most important stories from the movie that make this movie so special. <br /> <br /> There is a story from Samira Makhmalbaf (Iran), where somewhere in Iran, people are preparing for attacks from America. There the teacher tries to educate his students, informing them about killing Innocent People in the WTC massacre. Then comes the story of Youssef Chahine (Egypt), in which Film Maker meets face to face with Dead Soldier in the WTC attack and Dead Hard Core Terrorist, who was involved in the WTC attack. Then we see the story of Idrissa Ouedraogo (Burkina Faso), in which a group of Five Innocent Children sees Osama Bin Laden and plans to kidnap him and win money from America. Then we see the story of Alejandro Gozaleza Inarritu (Mexico), where you see the Black Screen and slowly see the real pictures of the WTC buildings that are approaching. And the people who got stuck in the building jump out of it to save their lives. Another most important story comes from Mira Nair (India), where the mother fights for respect for her Dead Son, whose name is falsely trapped in the WTC massacre! After the September 11 attack, our heartbeat begins to pump automatically if we hear two names around the world. The first is the World Trade Center, and the second is Osama! This film completely changes our perception and is a strong point, claiming that it has something more. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie to everyone who loves to have this kind of home DVD collection. Definitely worth every penny you spend. But please do not expect anything more than Movies on this DVD. There is of course filmography of filmmakers, but without additional features.
