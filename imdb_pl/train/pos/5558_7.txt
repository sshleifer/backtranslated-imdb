This story is known in the long cartoons of Tom and Jerry, especially in the 1940s, with the difference that two cats are in danger of being evicted if they do not catch the mouse (Jerry). Tom has an unnamed buddy ("Butch?") Living with him at home, so it really annoys "Mammy Two Shoes" who can not believe they have a mouse in spite of TWO cats at home. <br /> <br /> Anyway, whoever gets Jerry can stay while the other gets a load, so the competition continues! <br /> <br /> Although it is a familiar territory, I still liked it, because the cartoon had enough of the original sight gag to entertain. Not only cats competed with everyone but also with Jerry in the equation, so there were enough good gags to strongly recommend if you're a Tom & Jerry fan.
