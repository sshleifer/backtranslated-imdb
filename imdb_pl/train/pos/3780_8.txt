Only during my second review, many years later, I realized two things about this film: 1) I loved it immensely and 2), because its performance is definitely more severe than the justification justifies. I laughed through the movie before it occurred to me to renew my initial protests - playing in the valley and ugliness and airheadedness (even * good * -natural airheadedness) are simply not fun, especially when they are drawn to length. But despite the fact that the film's impetus begins to flow towards the end, Reeves and Winter and Sadler (and Hal Landon Jr. in an unforgettable scene) show such a remarkable sense of comical timing that even more clumsy jokes (eg Ted inability to recognize a certain hell inhabitant) also work effortlessly like witches (eg challenge). And cooperation between Winter and Reeves goes so well that the combination of Bill and Ted (who spend only one scene separated in the whole movie, catastrophe, if they are not well chosen) seems completely uninhibited. <br /> <br /> (Additional note: the first movie turned out to be sporadically funny - it looks like it has other comic impressions). <br /> <br /> I give him 7.75. Surprisingly good fun.
