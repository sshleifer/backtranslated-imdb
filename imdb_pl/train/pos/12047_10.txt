The first and only time I saw a woman in black, I thought that the only time I found out he appeared on television in 1989. It was Christmas Eve, and my father and I watched him in the living room shortly before we all went to a midnight service in the village church. I was very young then, but I'm not sure who was more scared of walking through the church yard to enter the church that night, me or my father! <br /> <br /> There are many factors on the subject of the movie, which makes it so frightening, but I think that one of them is the fact that the soundtrack that plays in the background of almost any Hollywood movie, does not it has a lot in common, so every squeak, bang and bang is more strengthened in your head because there is no distraction. Another factor that distinguishes it from other ghost stories is that there is no jump factor that would bounce off the wardrobe, so it does not have to be what you see, but what you hear and what you think. It's a smart medium because nothing scares you more than your mind thinks about riots, what's happening around the corner or behind the door! <br /> <br /> A great story about ghosts, I've never seen anything that could match it with all the recurrent slag on TV I can not believe that the BBC removed it (according to my knowledge) only one show!
