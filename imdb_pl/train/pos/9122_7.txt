Purple Rain is a great movie if you're a 40-year-old music lover who took part in Prince's music in the 80's. The story is a very popular formula: growing musical talent has to overcome personal and professional obstacles to find your audience and respect for yourself. Prince is a bad actor, but his performance, especially Purple Rain / I Would Die 4 U, makes it worth sitting in the movie. He is himself and a showman, as powerful on the stage as Mick Jagger or Michael Jackson, about Thriller. Apollonia Kotero, a protege of the prince, is beautiful and shows Prince's acting and chemistry, but her script does not allow her far. Morris Day and other supporting actors provide comedy elements.
