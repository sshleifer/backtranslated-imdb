This movie is pretty good. Six months ago I bought it on DVD. But first I thought it was an original movie. I saw this series and it is a good movie, but here they put together "The Living Legend, part1 and 2" and "Fire in space". Same as the first movie, but with other episodes. But it's still a pretty good movie. Only the ending is strange (you can not see what is happening with Pegasus). But I still think it's pretty good. Actors and special effects were good. If you have not seen him, see him. Starring: Richard Hatch, Dirk Benedict, Lorne Greene, Herb. Jefferson Jr., Tony Swartz, Terry Carter, Lloyd Bridges, Jack Stauffer.
