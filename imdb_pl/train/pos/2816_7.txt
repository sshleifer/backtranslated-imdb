It's an extraordinary movie by Jackie Chan, because of the fantastic finale and great humor, but otherwise it's nothing special. All characters are pretty cool, the movie is fun, and Jackie Chan is just amazing! Jackie and Wai-Man Chan had fantastic chemistry together and they are very funny! I think the main opponent looked really dangerous! But dubbing was just awful! Character development is above average for this type of thing !, And the main fight is simply fantastic! Plus some of the inequalities that Jackie takes in this case are sharp! There is a lot of stupid and stupid humor in it, but it amused me and the ending is fun! And all the characters are quite nice. It is quite cheap, but generally very well made, and although there is not as much fighting as you would expect from Jackie Chan's shot, he does enough to watch you, and one of my favorite moments in this movie is when Jackie ( Dragon) and Wai-Man Chan (Tiger), play with a rifle and go out! This is an extraordinary movie by Jackie Chan because of the fantastic finale and great humor, but otherwise it's great, it's still worth watching! The direction is good. Jackie Chan does a good job thanks to the solid work of the camera, fantastic angles and keeping the film fast at most. Acting is very good! Jackie Chan is amazing as usual and he is amazing here, he is extremely nice, funny, he always does crazy acrobatics, he had fantastic chemistry with Wai-Man Chan, he kicked this ass and played this wonderful conceited character, he was amazing! I wanted them to stop dubbing it! (Jackie rules !!!!!). Wai-Man Chan is as funny as Jackie's best friend, I really liked him, he is also a very good martial artist. The rest of the cast can guess. Overall worth the watch! *** from 5
