I love it when they do good sports history. So many in the past have been so hokey that it was embarrassing. Not this one. It's just a really nice movie, an old-fashioned type of story - based on a real guy who did exactly what Dennis Quaid did in this movie. He plays the role of a high school trainer, who is supposed to try out late in life in sports, to become a pitcher in professional baseball. Ultimately, it achieves its goal of reaching the major leagues, even if it was a very short period. <br /> <br /> All the characters here are nice people, the ones you come from, from Quaid to players in his high school, his little boy (Angus T. Jones, now a bit on television). <br /> <br /> Quaid is credible in playing Jim Morris because, unlike actors in the past, he knows how to quit baseball. It looks like a pitcher, a guy who can shoot 90 miles an hour. And most of this movie is real, as evidenced by a real-life jug in one of the documentary films on DVD. <br /> <br /> So if you're looking for a nice, inspiring movie about real sports life, you can not be wrong.
