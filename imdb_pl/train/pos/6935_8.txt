James Stewart plays a classic western revenge story that connects to the fate of other films in which he plays Winchester. Stewart is without a doubt perfect adding some cold, hard obsession to his usual loose cowboy. The story tells the story of Winchester's rifle and its owners after winning the contest by our hero and stealing by the man he hunts. <br /> <br /> We meet a selection of players, fighters, Indian merchants and bankers when we follow the path of rifles through Indian battles, bank robberies etc. The supporting staff is solid, and Dan Durya stands out as Waco Johnny Dean, a shooter with disasters with a wire and an itchy trigger finger. Also as a curiosity note the very early appearance of Rock Hudson as an Indian leader. <br /> <br /> The final game is a classic, tough rifle battle fought at a long distance and around a rocky rock. Put in a bit of good, western action, fistfights, shootings and horse rides that make you delight Western adventure. 8/10
