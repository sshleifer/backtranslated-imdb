This is one of the funniest movies I've seen. I watched it on a DVD and the disc does not have any special functions or even a menu, but I do not necessarily care. <br /> <br /> I tend to judge films individually, depending on, among other things, if it is a large studio production or a smaller movie. It's a smaller movie and I'm ready to forgive small things. I said, however, that it has one of the most original and original sequences I've seen. <br /> <br /> I liked the acting of all major players. I especially liked Til Schweiger and Alan Arkin. Alan Arkin has the most funniest lines. The figure portrayed by Claire Forlani may be unrealistic for some people, but I personally know real people with emotional problems who are very keen on life decisions, just like her character does. It helped me learn the nuances in which her wounds could come out of the fortune of her humor. <br /> <br /> This is obviously not a movie for children, but NOT involved in free sex and nudity. However, there is a bit of an adult language, but sometimes it can be very fun. (In particular, the character of Alan Arkina, who can not even curse correctly.) <br /> <br /> Also observe scenes with famous actors.
