The history of Chinese spirit Ching Siu Tunga and Tsui Harka, in addition to being one of the greatest wuxia pian movies ever made, is a beautiful and romantic love story and an impressively choreographic martial arts film that should belong to every film lover's collection. A very missed Hong Kong superstar, Leslie Cheung, a traveling tax collector who spends the night in a haunted temple. During his stay in the temple, he meets a colorful cast of characters, including Yin (Wu Ma) and Hsiao Hou, the Wood Devil, and the beautiful spirit of Sin Sin Sin, played by the charming Joey Wong. <br /> <br /> To free her from the clutches of the evil Devil Tree, she must revive her body and go to the underworld to defeat the more powerful demon. <br /> <br /> It's not enough to say good things about this movie. The pace is perfect, with a perfect combination of romance, action, fantasy and humor, and the frantically walking finale should leave you with a small chance to breathe. The chemistry between the wonderfully tragic Joey Wong and Leslie Cheung (whose legendary career ended too early) really allows the viewer to sense them both. Indeed, acting as a whole is so vivid and lively, I'd say it's one of the most fun watching experiences I've ever had. Wu Ma is a great contributor in the performance of the mysterious swordsman Yin. His above-average personality of the disappointed infernal fencer, which is aimed at overcoming evil, leads to great moments of humor and the traditional drama of HK. Great results, lush photos with eye colors and crazy actions courtesy of Ching Siu Tung complement this wonderful movie. Find a copy anywhere. 10/10
