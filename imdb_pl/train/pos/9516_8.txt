Tom Hanks, you've never seen him before. Hanks plays Michael Sullivan "Angel of death". He is a hitman for his replacement father John Rooney (Paul Newman), senior Irish mafia boss. The young son of Sullivan (Tyler Hoechlin) is a witness to what his father earns his living, and both are on their way for seven weeks, robbing banks to avenge the murder of Sullivan's wife and another son. Enter Jude Law as a reporter / photographer who wants to kill Sullivan himself to have a chance to add dead gangsters to his collection. Filmed beautifully catching the drama of life in the 1930s. Sometimes the rate of rocking, but then the explosion of graphic violence keeps history. Director Sam Mendes directs this powerful drama about loyalty, responsibility, betrayal and bondage of a mysterious man and his young son. Other important cast members are Dylan Baker, Stanley Tucci, Daniel Craig and Jennifer Jason Leigh. Hanks turns out to be perfect in a very memorable movie. Make room for several Oscars!
