As a child, I loved this game. I played it a million times in spring 1993 with my friend Andrew. I played in Axela or Blaze, and he would be Adam and no matter how often we played, we never got bored. Then came Streets of Rage 2. And we quickly forgot that it existed even. <br /> <br /> You play as former cop Axel Stone, Adam or Blaze Fielding, who gave up their strength to face evil in their own way. There are 8 levels to work in a damaged and broken city run by the evil Mr. X. Beating all the bad guys and the head of the end of the level is great fun. Level 4 (The Bridge) was my favorite because you could throw holes down the river. You can even become the right hand of Mr. X at the end of the game (for a price). This leads to a "bad end" in which you become the head of the syndicate. Exactly how it's possible, it's a secret, because you're destroying the syndicate on the way to Mr. X, but never mind. <br /> <br /> Streets of Rage also has really fantastic music. Composer Yuzo Koshiro made absolute wonders thanks to the limited Sega Genesis technology. The main theme, Level One, Level 4 and Final Boss are unique melodies. <br /> <br /> As the owner of Wii, I'm proud to have it on my console forever. But with the available Streets of Rage 2 it makes the first one a bit outdated. <br /> <br /> Plusy: <br /> <br /> Average graphics, but a nice background represented in a panel progression comic that matches the tone of the game. <br /> <br /> Great melodies. <br /> <br /> It's easy to put it on and it's hard to put it down. <br /> <br /> Wady: <br /> <br /> Significantly worse than infinitely more complex Streams Rage 2. <br /> <br /> Weak hostile SI. Baddies often leave you instead of fighting. This is particularly annoying for the level 5 boss. <br /> <br /> No combo moves. <br /> <br /> No decent weapon. <br /> <br /> Bad models are repeated far too often. <br /> <br /> Graphics B- Sound A- Gameplay B- Permanent appeal B-
