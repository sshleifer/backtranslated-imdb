Like in Amelie, recent French films seem to have a stereotypical relationship between men and women, focusing on a woman who finds one true love in her. In this case, desperation leads to conviction, which leads to its evolution into a prototype of mobs. A clever and surprising story in many ways, except that the woman is there to support a man. <br /> <br /> For those who do not speak French, the subtitles are a bit quick but not unreasonable. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack, as it seems more and more often in the case of European films, is great and perfectly in sync with the film's variations. Nothing seems forced. Visually it reminds me of various urban horrors. There is a sense of Wes Craven in Chicago.
