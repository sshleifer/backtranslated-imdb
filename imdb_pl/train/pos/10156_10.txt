This wonderful film has failed to register a higher rating than 5. Why is this not a great representation of the life of Christ without the ruthless sensation of the "Passion of Christ". Johnny Cash has done great things for God that are amazingly avoided and neglected in areas where they should be of the greatest importance, such as our churches. The film itself took less than a month because Johnny felt the strong presence of God leading him through him. Great credit for everyone involved in this extremely honest movie that will always be appreciated At least Billy Graham's crusade has rated him high enough to use him as the main source of education for new Christians. Thanks to Fox for its production. As Walk the Line proved that it was strange that this man survived, but he was an underestimated masterpiece. Films are not canonized by popular vote because this production works! In conclusion, I think that this film is one of the great documentaries in the world because it is honest, sincerely portrayed and a great witness of the Christian faith!
