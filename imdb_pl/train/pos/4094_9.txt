For anyone who has seen only Disney Productions beautiful animated version of "Beauty & The Beast", and even a surrealistic vision of the fairy tale Jean Cocteau, will be quite surprised by the French version of 1975 (but with the director from Poland). The plot is about a French family of fading aristocracy, which marries a well for the English family. The main obstacle is that the groom bears an ancient curse on the family. The film also contains many flashback sequences (potentially) explaining this family curse. From the beginning of the subtitles, right up to the very end, it is almost an interrupting erotic fun at home, with very VERY expressive and graphic sexual content (hence the assessment of the X film in the US in its initial run, which is now unrated). To some extent, the contemptuous attitude of the film in the ruling class will probably remind one of Bunuel's flights in a similar territory. If you fancy a truly bizarre and unadorned taboo material, then this movie can simply sneer.
