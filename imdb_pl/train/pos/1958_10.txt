I heard that Madonna was briefly considered for the role of Catherine Tremell. In comparison with Sharon Stone, Madonna is too rough and BAUERISCH. It is not even close. <br /> <br /> EVIL INCARNATE: Sharon Stone is a bit too long in the tooth, despite the mild effects of modern chemistry and surgery. However, he cleverly treats us as a terrifying personification of evil beyond redemption. In the obligatory sex scene he designs pure, crystalline lust. Especially her hooded, luminous eyes and flat face with pleasure. Thanks to the brilliant use of lighting and other stage techniques, sharp age lines appear only sporadically. Rather, it seems to have a delicate golden glow (YES, YEATS). <br /> <br /> The locations gave us a view of London, which is a welcome departure from the usual London landscapes. Catherine's character is so powerful and dangerous that I thank my lucky stars that our paths have never crossed. I would not have a chance. <br /> <br /> ORIGINAL BASIC INSTINATION; ATTEMPTS AT CENSORSHIP: I must comment briefly on the original 1992 movie, Settled in San Francisco, a beautiful city worthy of this film. It is excellent, from music to locations and sets. Paul Verhoven brought out striking performances from the cast and crew. <br /> <br /> The fact that the main Baddie was a woman did not escape the attention of gays and lesbians from the Bay Area. Attempts at censorship were vehemently denied. SWELL. These philosophical pygmies demanded editorial control over the script, insisting on re-enrollment that would promote their political and psychiatric programs. Example: Seriously accusing sexism and misogyny, they demanded a change of the main role of BAD GIRL to BAD GUY. <br /> <br /> In places in San Francisco, gentle, tolerant activists did their best to sabotage filming scenes with noise, flashing lights and other tactics. Executive producers, Mario Kassar and Andrew Vajna, have pledged to fight all efforts to limit the artistic freedom guaranteed in our democracy and to obtain a ban against tactical strategy. <br /> <br /> BLOWBACK: Thanks to the staggering activists, the film has gained huge coverage in the national press - free ads worth millions of dollars. Their appeals to the audience for a boycott of the film caused a reaction that caused that customers waited in long queues wherever the movie was launched. He also received wide critical acclaim. It was, as reptile Hackett said in the NETWORK, "HIT HIT!" I'm sorry, gentle reader; I just could not resist it. Yes, it's gibe. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I believe that both BASIC INSTINCT 1 AND 2, with their brilliant musical scores, aesthetics and acting, are works of art <br /> <br /> that deserve protection under our constitution.
