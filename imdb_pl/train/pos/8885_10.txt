Sometimes you have to look back to go forward. The 1960s did just that. We must remember the past. The past is part of the future. <br /> <br /> A great mix by Gary J. Coppola. I see a great future. You deserve a nomination and win, the best mixer of the year 60. <br /> <br /> The best mini-series of all time. <br /> <br /> Thanks to Ursula <br /> <br />
