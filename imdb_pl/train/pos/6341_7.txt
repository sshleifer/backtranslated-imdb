Although I really liked the recent "serious" performances of Jim Carrey ("The Truman Show", "Man on the Moon"), I always thought that his true geniuses lie in physical comedy. It does not mean that he is a fantastic, talented actor: these Oscars' boots seem to dislike him so much that he has never received a (really deserved) nomination or reward. Well, no "institution" that nominates up to 11 Oscars can be taken seriously, e.g. "Titanic". <br /> <br /> With review. "The Grinch" is the sweetest, best-looking, best played, more enjoyable season from "The Nightmare before Christmas". Both films seem very similar, with their stylized sets and the premise of Christmas theft. Both make their main actors seem like villains (one more than others), both have a strong moral lesson, and both are really nice. he is a doll, and The Grinch is a man. But a man who is so incredibly expressive, so fluid in his movements, so cartoonish, so unreal that he never bothers the film. It can be funny, it can be a sad soul, it can be bad. He lives in a three-dimensional world in which three-dimensional people live. He jokes, laughs, cries and ultimately saves Christmas. I loved the movie for bits and I can not wait for it to come out on a DVD. This is one of those movies that you really enjoy in 10, 20 years. As timeless as they appear.
