I've heard some not-so-good things about this movie and I've probably seen a low score in IMDb and that's why I avoided it. Today they showed Vanilla Sky on TV and because I had nothing better to do ... and as it turned out, it would be difficult for me to find something better. Vanilla Sky is a frightening, sad and moving movie, actually one of the best I've seen in a while. I was surprised how this view was influenced. It is difficult to explain, but during the film your feelings for the characters and your perception of what is happening is quite an emotional journey. Vanilla Sky really moved me in a way that is very rare in a movie or any other medium. <br /> <br /> I really recommend everyone watching this movie. Regardless of what you heard about it.
