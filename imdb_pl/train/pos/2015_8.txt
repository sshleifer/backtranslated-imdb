This may not be one of the best films ever made, but overall it is a very nice, light piece of foam in which everyone involved seems to have a good time. I highly recommend it for the well-being. OK, so the "acting" of Frank Sinatra leaves much to be desired, but his singing is a great feature of redemption, and the songs perfectly match the romantic atmosphere of the film. Sinatra made even more films in which his unquestionable acting abilities showed up, but in this, his first venture in Hollywood, his voice, not acting, is his main contribution to this film. I just watched it again on TV and it still raises my mood the way I saw it for the first time many years ago.
