and what a combination. Two great singers of the century play together in this unappreciated musical. He writes music, writes lyrics, and they both work for Basil Rathbone, who can not write because his wife died (actually she just got fat!). The best scene is the number of the pawnshop, in which Bing sings the improvised number, while the swing team takes out the instruments from the ankle. Just great. And that's a rare role as the main legend on Broadway, Mary Martin, and it's pretty good. Charley Grapewin, John Scott Trotter, William Frawley, Oscar Levant (once again maniacal pianist), Charles Lane and Helen Bertram. Who knew that Rathbone could be funny?
