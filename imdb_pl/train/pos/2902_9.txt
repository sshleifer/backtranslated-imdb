I'm in movies like "Tiempo de valientes" and I want to talk about the cinema for hours. The admiration that this film has made for me goes beyond my limits of explanation, because I am watching movie scenes and looking for ideas of film and innovations in dialogue that may emerge from something greater than that of Damian Szifron. br /> <br /> Looking at the environment, so uncompromising, so simple, I think; this man is a genius. No wonder he created probably the best TV show Argentina has ever witnessed, and then the first movie full of elements that some contemporary directors have not yet achieved. "El fondo del mar" is the name that woke up (a few years ago), my enthusiasm for our everyday cinema. <br /> <br /> Starting his journey from the everyday life of people, Shifron goes where Pablo Trapero has never been in El Bonaerense; life of the Federal Police Department. Trapero was a journey to the mind and experience of a man, not to the places he saw. Yes, there was detailed training and many criminal situations, but Shifron in "there" is more of a crime story than we know and love, with secrets and thrilling music. <br /> <br /> But there is a lot of humanity in his work, and he shows us his investigation through the eyes of the main characters, Alfredo Díaz and Mariano Silverstein. There are many actors of great caliber in the film, but these two actors can not do without a movie. The first character (Luis Luque) is a detective who has just learned that his wife is cheating on him; and he must work on the matter. <br /> <br /> The second is a psychiatrist who has been assigned detective treatment. He wants to deal with him in regular sessions, but the sheriff uses a temporary disposition and suggests that he joins Díaz in his procedures: "It's nothing, ordinary things; no problem". But it is bigger than this and reveals some of the personality of the doctor he did not know. <br /> <br /> The relationship between the two tracks can not be explained unless it is observed, because it believes that such complexity shows how gifted people like Shifron are, who are trying today to leave a signature in our history. Díaz, reaching the points of unbelievable spontaneity, in a situation of high pressure, tells Silverstein: "How do we continue treatment?" And Silverstein replies: "No, I'm not your doctor. You call me for supper; your friend ": we laugh because we can not help it. <br /> <br /> And we can not help laughing when Díaz smashes a car on the street and does not give it meaning, or when he makes all the red lights on the street or when he smokes a cigarette in his police patrol and Silverstein can not believe it (but then it also burns because it's fucked up); or when Silverstein tries to be a friend of the friends of the robber Diaz. We get the magic from Diego Peretti there. He, the psychiatrist himself, gives the performance in the "Locas de amor" plan, but delights with its full range. On the other hand, Luis Luque returns to the track with the highest-class portrait, which reminds us of the great actor he is. <br /> <br /> I have a passion for it and as I said, I can write about it for hours, but unfortunately this is not how it works and I have to be accurate and summarized. Although I have to watch many old films and study them, I can assure you that "Tiempo de valientes" is a comedy that Argentina has been waiting for and never got.
