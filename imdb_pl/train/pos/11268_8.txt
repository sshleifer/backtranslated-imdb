Jane Porter's old love interest Harry Holt (Neil Hamilton) and his friend Martin (Paul Cavanagh) come to the hidden Tarzan jungle, looking for an ivory-colored gold mine, or "Elephant Cemetery", which he saw for the first time in TARZAN, MAN APE ... we only quickly discovered that both men have hidden intentions ... namely Jane. Will Tarzan support it? It is possible (in fact, Tarzan will not even interfere in the "Elephant Graveyard") and knowing that Martin is trying to lead Tarzan out of the picture, he is later in the world of trouble, later he and his team (including Jane, who goes with them after how he believes that Tarzan is dead), he is captured by a native tribe who wants to feed them to lions. Will Tarzan be free and able to reach them on time? <br /> <br /> This film is an adventure filled with a lot of scenes with the participation of Tarzan and other wild animals and the culmination that attracts the viewer's interest and persists. Cruelty to animals and the depiction of indigenous people today may disturb some, but everyone should remember that this is basically a fantasy adventure and should not be taken so seriously.
