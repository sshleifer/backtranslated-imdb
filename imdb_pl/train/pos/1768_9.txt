I did not laugh about it in the film for a long time. I have to go to the initial projection and I was excited because I died to see it. For most of the movie, I had tears in my eyes with laughter. The audience shared my laughter and clapped and screamed through most of the movie. <br /> <br /> Kudos to Steve Carrell (whom I've already been a fan of). He proves his huge talent for comedy in this film. It has a style that I have not seen before. And Catherine Keener is always perfect. Thank God there was no episode with Will Ferrell (love him, but I saw him too much this summer). <br /> <br /> There were fragments of comedy genius in this movie. Partly thanks to Carrell and partly thanks to writing (also Carrell). The waxing scene and speed dater with "obvious problem" were absolutely hysterical. <br /> <br /> I will definitely see "40 Year Old Virgin" when it will be released. My advice: go see it for big laughs and an incredibly nice movie.
