Unfortunately, 8 Simple Rules, for arranging with my teenage daughter, was the last sitcom, over which John Ritter was working on his tragic death in 2003. He was one of my favorite actors. He had it all, comedy (which he can forget about him in Kompania Trzech), but he was also a great dramatic actor (unforgivable? Worth watching a TV movie) I loved all other cast members so much (Katey, Amy, Kaley and Martin) John was the star, he was, first and foremost, the reason why I was attracted to the show, and that was his perfect comedic delivery, which was able to break me every time. <br /> <br /> I loved the fact that the show was not cute (just like I loved The Cosby Show, come on, they were too nice to each other), they perfectly presented the typical dynamics of the family. It was realistic enough, with all the competition with siblings and squabbles between parents, but it was still fun. Many American comedy series try to completely fill the show with morality and what is not, and this program did not do it. Yes, they were like solving important problems like drugs and intimidation, but they did not try and were nothing more than a funny family comedy. <br /> <br /> The way they wrote John's death was great, I still sob like a child every time I see it. You felt how raw emotions were during these incredibly difficult episodes. <br /> <br /> I am sad that the show has been canceled, I still like to watch replays and never tire it. <br /> <br /> John Ritter, you will always be remembered for the hilarious presentation of this caring father who would prefer to block his daughters in his room than to have a date with the boy =) You rock Ritter !!!
