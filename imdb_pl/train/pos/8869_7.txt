In this small movie we have some great characters, but a very shallow story. It's really nice to watch, because Singleton does a great job presenting esoteric conflicts and interpersonal relationships. This makes the viewer forget about the non-existent realism that the movie is supposed to be. In fact, we have here all the possible clich√©s and stereotypes on celluloid at a rate higher than soap. Definitely not a deep movie (even if it wants to be), but better than an average student movie.
