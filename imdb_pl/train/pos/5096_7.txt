This is a vast (4-hour) remake of the story of Rider Haggard with an ordinary added woman and foreign thread thread with Russian soldiers looking for the "Stone of Power" buried with the treasure of King Solomon. It is very well filmed, giving a keen sense of the wide open spaces of Africa and very well preserved. Patrick Swayze is an excellent Alan Quatermain, and Allison Doody is attractive as Elizabeth Maitland, who employs Quatermain to help save his father. Sidede Onyulo as Umbopa, Gavin Hood as McNabb and the leader of Russian soldiers (not mentioned on the IMDb list) are also unforgettable. After all, Hollywood can not leave a good story alone when it's adapted, it's well told and besides being too long, I liked it. 6/10.
