It's such a great movie, "Call me Anna," because it shows how a person suffered for so long without knowing what was happening to her. In order for Patty Duke to come out and tell her story, she is an inspiration for those who suffer from this disease. I have a lot of respect for her as a person. The only thing I do not like is that I can not do it on tape, I tried to look for it, but without success. Does anyone know how to get it?
