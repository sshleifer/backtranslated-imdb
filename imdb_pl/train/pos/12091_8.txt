`Castle of Blood '(aka` Castle of Terror') is a well-executed, surprisingly frightening entry by Italian director Anthony Dawson. Exceptional black and white photos, flawless dubbing, excellent castings, quite logical scripts, deliberate pace and surprise (although completely appropriate) ending this stand out. Only movies sometimes hokey music and rather sudden "love at first sight" between Elizabeth (Barbara Steele) and Alan (Georges Rivière) mar a surprisingly entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> During a visit to England, Edgar Allan Poe sits in a pub telling one of his ghostly stories to Count Blackwood. Recognizing the great writer, young journalist Alan asks for an interview with Poe. During the conversation Poe reveals that all his stories are real. Amazing, Alan expresses his skepticism about life after death. Count Blackwood offers a £ 100 Alan plant that can not survive tonight in Blackwood Castle, the night after Halloween, when the dead walk. Alan can not afford a bet, so he bets his life for a £ 10 bet. <br /> <br /> In contrast to the overly "Black Sunday" by Mario Bavy (also known as "Satan's Mask"), "Castle of the Blood" is quite restrained, making several moments of violence even more terrifying, especially surprising since the director usually associated with these horrible Italian space movies from the 60s. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that the only version of this movie that has been found is a very deteriorated (and registered) version of pan and scan. Still, it is worth seeing and demanding a modern remake, perhaps with Christina Ricci or Jennifer Love Hewitt in the role of Elizabeth. Watch it and enjoy a movie that is comparable to Robert Wise's The Haunting movie.
