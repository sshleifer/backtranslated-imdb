This movie starts vigorously, has a few free moments in the middle, but generally it moves well, has some very good moments, and then falls out at the end of the Act 3. I was able to see it at the premiere LA 2 times (with 2 different endings). Jason Lee is a star, but he is not tomorrow's man. He is full of humor and has his own but he is better served as a supporting actor. Julia Stiles does "ok" in the role of a comedian, new to her, but not "steals" this film, as should the star of her caliber. For an actress who has so much potential (10 things, save the last dance, O), it's hard to watch how she still performs roles that are so "mediocre" and then do not make her play a role and escape the movie (like Daniel Day -Lewis in "Gangs"). Selma Blair is also a good young actress and does the work "ok". I did not expect her to receive an Academy Award and she did not provide it, but her performance was right. Chris Koch presents another film that is "above average". Perhaps the problem lies in the script more than anything else. "I did" this movie! But this is not a movie where you walk away and say ... "it was great!" ... This "story" has been done many times before and there was nothing new here. The trial dinner scene was probably the best in the movie, and Larry Miller gives an amazing performance in the supporting role (may be the best surprise of the movie). If you want to see a movie that will make you laugh a few times, and have a nice evening, I can still recommend this movie, but if they do not change the end ... once again ... go away on the church scene, or you'll be disappointed .
