Funny. Sad. Charming. These are all the words that flowed through my head while watching this beautiful, simple movie. <br /> <br /> It's rare that the movie really moves me, but "Shall We Dance?" did it with a grace to save. The mild humor mixed with occasional agonizing from time to time made it easy to become one of the best experiences in the history of watching movies. It left me with a quiet feeling of elation, but with a bit of sadness confused. <br /> <br /> And dance, oh yeah, dance. Even if you are not a lover of art or can not put one foot in front of the other, the steps displayed here are breathtaking and make you want to sign up for classes as soon as possible. It was absolutely captivating, even the parts that show how Sugiyama (poignantly portrayed by Koji Yakusho) took his first steps when he was learning to dance, they were beautiful in a humorous, childish manner. And yet this film was not only about dance, but about the subtleties of human behavior and feelings. We are witnessing a shy man learning to express his suppressed feelings through dance, a beautiful dance instructor rediscovering her love for art and the personal development of each member of a great cast. <br /> <br /> Beauty. Ache. Emotion. All love and small sufferings of life are expressed here by the delicate feeling of beautiful Japanese watercolor combined with the emotional strength and grace of culture. <br /> <br />
