With the approaching winter, our state broadcaster ABC decided to organize a partial Jane Austen festival on Sunday nights for some reason. It started with the twelve-year version of the movie "Emma" from last Sunday; there will be newer versions of three other novels, Persuasion, Northanger Abbey and Mansfield Park. <br /> <br /> An interesting thing about this production of A & E Television Networks, with a screenplay by the ever-reliable Andrew Davies, that appeared almost simultaneously with two much larger budget film versions, one of Gwyneth Paltrow and "Clueless", "modernized" the version with the participation of Alicja Silverstone, who transported the story to Beverly Hills. Perhaps as a result, even with Kate Beckinsale at the forefront, this production sank without a trace. <br /> <br /> As a general rule, many are lost when the novels are shrunk to fit the length of the feature film. Adaptations that have a tendency to both enjoy and memorize are those that have enough space to develop both history and characters. A brilliant example is "Brideshead Revisited", which had 13 50-minute episodes in 1982. It is enough to compare the very ordinary version of the film Pride and Prejudice in 2005 with the brilliant, six-part television series from 1995. The point is not that the novel should be filmed side by side, and some novels (often not very good) adapt well to the film ("Atonement" is the last example), but Jane Austen novels need some time and space to derive their full charm. <br /> <br /> Given the drawbacks of this type of adaptation, this production is OK. Kate Beckinsale gives Emma the right mix of confidence and vulnerability, and Mark Strong is honest Mr. Knightly (he reminded me that Jane has a tendency to change characters? Knightly is a more articulated version of the moody Mr. Darcy from P & P). Samantha Morton was rather an inert Harriet, but Prunella Scales perfectly blabbermouth Miss Bates? Sybil Fawlty on speed. Bernard Hepton as Emma's weak father was also perfect. We've seen wet surroundings, mud and poverty, as well as elegant interiors, in case anyone thinks it's a particularly idyllic age for everyone. <br /> <br /> Even if it was a condensed adaptation, it was strangely slow in places ?? some of the conversations were rather slim, even taking into account the formalities of the times. I would have to look at the film one more time, but it may be due to the insufficient use of shots with reaction. <br /> <br /> If you like filmed movies from the era, this is a pretty nice example, and compares with the Paltrow version. In any case, there is more!
