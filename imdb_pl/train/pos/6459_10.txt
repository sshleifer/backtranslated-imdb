Return to the roots of "as in heaven" - what are the real values ​​of life? These Swedes make a message that speaks to every heart. We have already seen it twice in the cinema packed to the last place: love purity and joy in the choir music, which is simple but full of power when everyone finds their inner tone. <br /> <br /> From the glory of fame to the school of his youth, now empty and ready to be adapted as a new home after his fall on the stage, Daniel wants to start listening and is drawn into life by the simple, warm and rough people of the North. <br /> <br /> He earns his heart with music and gains the ability to love and be loved unconditionally. <br /> <br /> Do not go if you were normalized in Hollywood. These things do not contain any additions, only your laughter, your compassion, your tears!
