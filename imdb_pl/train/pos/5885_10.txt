This film surprised me a lot. I did not have much expectations, but I was wrong. Mary and Rhoda were very funny and well-written. They did not spend too much time reworking the past, so they did not rely on the success of the old television program to transfer the movie. Generally it was very funny. <br /> <br /> My girlfriend commented that this could be a weekly sit-com and I think I can agree with her.
