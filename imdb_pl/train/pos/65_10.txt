This movie is not just a school shooting, in fact it has never even been seen. But this only increases the power of this movie. It's about people and how they handle a tragedy. I know that this was shown to the students who survived the shooting at Columbine, and this ensured the feeling of closing many of them. Acting is great. All three main actors (Busy Phillips, Erika Christensen and Victor Garber) are great in their roles ... I highly recommend this film to everyone. This is one of those movies that make you talk about it after watching it. It provokes discussion not only about school shootings, but also about human emotions and reactions to all forms of tragedy. It's a tearing jersey, but it's worth it and I will watch it again and again
