Sure, it was cheesy and nonsense, and sometimes banal, but at least the filmmakers did not try. While most TV movies bordering on the extreme of mediocrity, this movie has some advantages. The photos were good for the TV movie, and Viggo Mortensen displays Aragorn's shades in the film about the man who played according to his own rules. Most of the retrospective sequences were quite tacky, but the scene with the mountain lion was intense. I was a bit irritated by the role of Jason Priestly in the movie as a rebellious shock, but on the other hand it's a TV movie! Despite all the good things, the soundtrack was terrible. It was nice to see in the film Tucson in Arizona.
