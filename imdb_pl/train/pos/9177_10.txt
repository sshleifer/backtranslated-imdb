I must say that this miniseries was the best interpretation of the beloved novel "Jane Eyre". Both Dalton and Clarke are very credible as Rochester and Jane. I've seen other versions, but none can match that. Best for me. I could never imagine anyone playing these characters yet. Last time I saw it in 1984, when I was only 13 years old. At the time I was a bookworm and I just read the novel Charlotte Bronte. I was completely charmed by this miniseries and I remember that I did not miss any of these episodes. I would like to see it again because it is so good. :-)
