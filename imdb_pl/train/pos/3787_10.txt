I saw it as a critic in the 49th Internationales Filmfestival Mannheim Heidelberg. <br /> <br /> Like any movie that I know and is involved in, it is simply brilliant. <br /> <br /> I love his way by combining different stories and characters. <br /> <br /> His * Knoflikari * and truly magical * Powers * (part of Regina Zieglers * Erotic Tales IV *) are definitely worth checking. Go and take it, people!
