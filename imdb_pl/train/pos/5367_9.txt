This film is one of the most underrated films of that time. Watching this movie, your action, and when something is not happening, humor is not matched. A great magazine for a movie that was created to give us a bloody blend, a game show in which criminals are players, and in the near future when the general public has a thirst for blood. Also, Arnold will not disappoint us with some of his best liners. I do not want to mess you up, but I'll tell you when Arnold gives his "I'll be back", he gets the best answer from them in this movie. I hope you'll like this gem just as much as I do.
