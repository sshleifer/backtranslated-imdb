I went to Deathtrap, expecting a well-arranged and intriguing thriller; and although this is something like this movie; I can not help either, but I think it's just the Sleuth of a poor man. The classic film from 1972 is of course an inspiration for this film; not especially when it comes to the storyline, but it certainly is the case with executions. The cast of Michael Caine in the lead role only confirms this. The film is based on the art of Ira Levin (who previously wrote Rosemary's Baby and The Stepford Wives) and focuses on Sidney Bruhl; a playwright whose best days are behind him. After the last bombs, Sidney is at a low level; and it does not help when a game called Deathtrap; written by the amateur he taught, he reaches his threshold. Deathtrap is a guaranteed commercial success, and Sidney soon begins to rule out her own story; which involves inviting amateur scribes, killing him, and then dropping Deathtrap as his own work. <br /> <br /> Despite all the clever twists and turns; Deathtrap falls on one main element, and these are characters. The film does not provide a single nice character and it is very difficult to care for history when you are not cheering on any of the players. Acting does not help. Michael Caine performs a good and entertaining performance, as you might expect, but no one else is proud. Christopher Reeve is awkward in his role, while Dyan Cannon manages to somehow make the only repugnant character repugnant with a sincere annoying performance. It is fortunate that history is good; and it's good enough to save a movie. The plot contains many twists and turns; some work better than others, but there is always enough to ensure that the movie stays interesting. Director Sidney Lumet also deserves recognition because the style of the film is another huge plus. The central location is interesting in itself, and the pictures fit the movie well. Overall, I have to admit that I liked the movie; but it could have been much, much better.
