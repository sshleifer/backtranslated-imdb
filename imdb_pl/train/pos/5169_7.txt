I saw the last five or ten minutes of this movie in 1998 or 1999 when I was surfing before going to sleep and really liked what I saw. Since then, I've been watching, browsing TV lists, browsing DVD / VHS stations in stores, but until recently I did not find a copy when I found out that some online stores sold it. Then, being a world-class procrastinator, I still did not order it. Finally, I found a copy of the DVD in Circuit City during a visit to Portland, OR, a few weeks ago. Then I came home only a month before I sat down and watched him. <br /> <br /> So what do I think about the film? This is good. Not as good as I remembered and for which I was hoping but still worth 9.99 USD it cost me. After watching the whole movie for the first time, I rate it as 7/10, with the potential to become 8/10. I will then have to be less sleepy and have a better sound system to avoid scrolling in order to catch some dialogue.
