Never seeing this movie, based on the funny novel by Nicholas Katzenbach and considering the first cast assembled for production, we decided to take a look. "Just Cause", although it is not a terrible movie, has too many freedoms in relation to the original material, which Jeb Stuart could not achieve in his treatment. Arne Glimcher directed. <br /> <br /> The first thing we think about when a young black man is taken to a local interrogation is police brutality. In the end, Sheriff Tanny Brown and police officer Wilcox show no mercy by beating Bobby Earl, who is accused of killing a young white girl. We feel frightened by what the officers do to the prisoner. <br /> <br /> Then the scene changes. Evangeline, Bobby Earl's grandmother, is sent north to ask an eminent Harvard professor, a retired lawyer, a young man wants Paul Armstrong to defend him. The old lady is convincing enough that Armstrong can look at the matter. He is also convinced of the innocence of a young man. <br /> <br /> Things are not exactly what we thought they were. When Blair Sullivan, a man who serves in the same factory as Bobby Earl, introduces himself to the murder of a young girl and changes the dynamics of the case. The way he plays in the film serves to confuse the viewer and distract Armstrong's attention from reaching the truth. <br /> <br /> This thriller gives pleasure to Sean Connery, who plays Armstrong. Intense actor Laurence Fishburne gives the impression of a sheriff who, as we see, is guilty of using his prisoner. Ed Harris has a great opportunity to show why he is one of our best actors. Blair Underwood, Kate Capshaw, Ruby Dee and young Scarlett Johansson are supporting roles. <br /> <br /> The movie, even with its flaws, will not disappoint.
