Neither the total catastrophe that British critics have spoken about, nor the misunderstood masterpiece that several fanboys insist on, Revolver is at least an admirable attempt by Guy Ritchie to add a little bit of content to his capricious konman. But then nothing is more despised than an ambitious movie that bites more than it can chew, especially one that uses the framework of a gangster-artistic film. As you might expect from the name of Luc Besson on the authors, there is a specific element of "Cinema de look" on this topic: embedded in a kind of realistic fantasy world in which America and the United Kingdom overlap, looks great, has some excellent edited and imaginary sequences of actions and emanate style, all of which mean one-off entertainment. But Ritchie apparently wants to do more than just rewrite his own movies for fast zloty and spend a lot of time thinking and reading about life, the universe and everything. If something is in it, then he tries to throw in too much influence (some Machiavelli, a little Godard, many rules of chess), motives and techniques, cluttering the screen with quotes: the movie originally aimed at ending three minutes of epigrams about photos of the victims of the mob victims, and sometimes it seems that he never read a fortune he did not want to turn into a movie. Instead of advertising cabbalism, it is rather a mixture of overlapping rules of commerce, chess and confidence tricks, which mostly draw a difficult trick of sharing theosophy, hiding the central (somewhat metaphysical) movie. Br /> <br /> The final third is where most of the problems can be found when Jason Statham takes over the enemy (literally) inside with a lot of ambitious but not always entirely successful cross-sections to contrast the outer bravura of people with their internal fear and anger, but everything is the same. It is not worth starting a new religion, but I am surprised that he did not get an American distributor. Perhaps they thought Ray Lakota's artificial tan was terribly frightening?
