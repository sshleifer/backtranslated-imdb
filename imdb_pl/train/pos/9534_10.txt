Acting This movie is a very well made film. I will say that sometimes performances are weak; but most of the acting is very good. The only actor who killed me with his performance was Jude Law as Harlen Maguire. Was amazing! Tom Hanks seemed a little uncertain at several points in the movie, but he was amazing as well. Paul Newman, as always good. Cinematography This has made the film a masterpiece (and I rarely use this word). Conrad Hall is a real genius. If at some point in the movie you had to stop it, you will see the delicate work of this man. Sets each shot so that nothing is missed. When the camera is stationary, the quality is similar to a postcard on the screen. When the camera moves, each shot aims at understated perfection. But this is not the end. The choice of colors and contrast between the light and dark settings of Conrad is a work of art. The way it lights a set is one of the most amazing lighting work I've ever seen. His work on this film has made it so. This film is at the top of the list of the best films from LOTR, Black Hawk Down, Hero, CTHD, Moulin Rouge and Vertigo. History People will say that this movie is a gangster movie from the 1930s, but I believe that they did not hit the movie. It's a love story about an assailant who fails to protect his son from the life he chose. It's a genially crafted story that develops into a beautiful relationship between two people who have nothing but themselves. The Writing screen is worth an Oscar. Music Thomas Newman has a sad but hopeful result to intensify this sad but hopeful story. Music is one of the most beautiful and moving scores that flock. Director Sam Mendes is a new director with an experienced director. The symbols he uses and the performances he receives from his actors are rare in today's film world. I will look for another Sam Mendes Film. 10/10 one of the most moving and beautiful movies I've ever seen.
