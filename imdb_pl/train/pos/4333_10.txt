I saw it in the preview - great movie - wonderful characteristics - witty and intelligent dialogues - fantastic actors - Peter Falk will be ready for an Oscar - Paul Reiser was charming - the photo was wonderful Reiser was in the theater when we watched the movie and he gave a vivid description of making the movie - it was a long dream to write a semi-autobiographical description of the relationship between sons and fathers, and specifically between him and his father - it was achieved in a dramatic and playful fashion - the supporting cast was well chosen and gave the film a sense of family - I recommend this film to everyone, who wants to see intelligent drama and great performances
