This is probably the best documentary I've seen for a long time. Jonny Kennedy has been and still is a tragically beautiful inspiration. Not only did he survive one of the most painful diseases, but he used his beauty to show the world that there is life after death and never give up on reaching people and spreading love. Watching the minutes of his long fight was painful. Listening to his clever remarks and looking at his charming gestures was cordial. And the sight of his smile was indescribable. I feel blessed that I could have been touched by this little giant. Please, if you ever have the chance to watch this movie - think that you met Jonny Kennedy.
