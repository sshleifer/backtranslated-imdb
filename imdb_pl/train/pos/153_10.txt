This film is, in short, a film masterpiece. The film moves brilliantly thanks to the intense images that deeply move the sensitive viewer. The film begins during the Spanish Civil War when a group of children seek revenge on another child. In fact, they operate in their world in the version of what they have witnessed in the adult world around them. Later, we meet again with three children as adults in a sanatorium. Here we see what life has done on each of them. One of them is a lonely sexually repressed patient. Another man is a hustler who became ill. The third child, a young lady, became a nun and serves in a sanatorium. This film is an allegory of the influence of violence on the psyche. <br /> <br /> This movie has a culmination, which is certainly not for the sensitive members of the audience, but it is logical and deeply moving. Acting is excellent, and the script is well-written. There is music that provides the current of fear throughout the film. This is not a movie for thrill seekers, but a movie for a thoughtful audience.
