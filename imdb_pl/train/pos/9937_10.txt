This television series was one of those I loved when I was a kid. Although I see it now in pink-shaded glasses of nostalgia, I can still say that it was a high quality show, very educational, but still fun. I have not seen the original French version, only the Swedish one. I do not know how good the dubbing was, it was too long to remember. <br /> <br /> The premise of the program was to show how the body works. I swear, the school still has not taught me half of what I know from this program. It also involves other things, such as what happens if you eat unhealthy food and do not exercise, with nice examples in the body. Who wants to have another portion of chocolate when you know that miniature virus tanks can attack you? : D The cartoon looked nice, of course very friendly to children, but carefully. Cells, viruses, electrical signals in the brain, antibodies and everything else are represented by smiling cartoon characters that look almost like you'd expect to look like in an animated body. <br /> <br /> This, and the cycle on history (especially the terrible environmental finale) was a key element of my childhood. I'm so glad I found them here.
