If you like action phrases, this is your movie. At no time can you predict what will happen next. Nothing is as it seems or ends as you think. All characters are angry and addictive. The cage is the best. Dennis Hopper again shows his charmingly sinister side. JT Walsh is perfect in his last performance. Laura Boyle sizzles. Dwight Yoakum makes a great debut in the film in an episode. I categorize this movie as "I have a really, really, really bad day". This is not a slow minute in this movie. Real sleeper. This film is underestimated and, unfortunately, overlooked.
