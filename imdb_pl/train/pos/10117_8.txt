The story of a tramp, its boss, and the daughter of the boss is not for all tastes, but it is still very intriguing. It takes place in the beautiful country of New Zealand, amidst the scenery that we so well met in other films from this region. <br /> <br /> This movie was the first time I saw Mary Regan, and since then I've been a fan of her. The cast also includes Bruno Lawrence, who probably best remembers the American audience from the movie "Smash Palace". Terence Cooper turns as a ranch owner who pays some attention to his daughter (Regan). <br /> <br /> He acted sharply, with unforgettable shaking performances of all his leads. For the first time I saw this movie in an extremely edited form on TV late in the night here in America, but trust me, you can not miss the unsophisticated version.
