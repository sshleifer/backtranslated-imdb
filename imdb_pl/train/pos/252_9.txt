The performances were great, the costumes were a special feeling for this period and being a Victorian historian, I was impressed by the accuracy of the weapon and the attention to detail. <br /> <br /> I would not say you need knowledge of Kelly's saga to stay on the course of the movie, but you will need some basic historical knowledge to understand the events and attitudes of those times. Do not expect, as some foolish people, any of the characters who have Auzzie's accent, as we know it, then it was a country in the infancy. <br /> <br /> OK, the story had some elements of fiction, but they are required for wider tracking of the movie. Gregor Jordan said in an additional feature on the DVD that he wanted his movie "aroused interest" and that's exactly what happened to me, so this movie has a thumbs up. <br /> <br /> See it and you will not be sorry
