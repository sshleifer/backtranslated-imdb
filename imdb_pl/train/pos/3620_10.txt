I just watched this movie tonight, the opening day. It was great!! I am a big fan of sports films and it was one of my favorites. Dennis Quaid was great. (Oh, by the way, Mr. Quaid, if you read this ... my sister lives in Austin, where you live ... you picked up a bit ... but she did not want to !: C) [not that anyone would believe it ... .]) NEVER, it's a great movie. Anyone who likes a good sports movie should see and see it! :DOWN)
