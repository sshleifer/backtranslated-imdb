My college professor says that Othello may be the best Shakespeare drama. I do not know if I agree with him yet. I bought this video version of the movie. First, I love Kenneth BRanagh as Iago, he was perfectly complicated and worked very well in this adaptation. Surprisingly, he did not manage it, but played a part. Lawrence Fishburne shows that American actors can play Shakespeare as well as British actors. it was not about the Anglo-American issue. In fact, if we all work together, Shakespeare can reach the masses he deserves. In addition to other tragedies, Shakespeare deals with the question of race. Something that existed from the beginning of time. The relationship between Iago and Emilia could have been better and showed the complexity of their relationship. While Othello loves Desdemona with all his heart, he is weak to jealous and is afraid that he will lose her to non-Moors like Cassio. It's a great scene at the end of the movie, but I will not reveal the ending. It's just worth watching. I think they edited most of the lines for 2 hours, but they always edited Shakespeare.
