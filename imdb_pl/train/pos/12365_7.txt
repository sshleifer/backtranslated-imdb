I am surprised that no one has mentioned that there are two versions of the same movie. The lion's share of the material is identical, but here they are different: in one version (the version I saw most often on television), the group of clergy guarding the gate consists of the "Protectorate Brotherhood", a fictional group of priests and "excommunicated" brothers . In the second version, which I saw only once on television, the clerics guarding the gates are portrayed as priests of the official Church, or the Archdiocese of New York (or perhaps Brooklyn). Also in the previous version, in most important scenes, clergymen are referred to as "brothers" (in some scenes you can see where the mouth says "Father" such and such, but dubbing says "Brother" such and such. In the second version, I think that each is described as "Father". <br /> <br /> In any case, it seems that one of these two versions is more or less partial re-shooting to the second, with all scenes of "Brotherhood of the Protector", filmed again as scenes of the "Archdiocese", or vice versa (reminds me of scenes with sections of Raymond Burr in "Godzilla"), versions from television, so I can not imagine that. Can anyone shed more light on the history of these two versions of the film?
