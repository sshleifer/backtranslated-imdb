Who does not know Largo Winch in the France-Belgium-Luxembourg trio (three countries in which the French "BD" or "Bandes Dessin√©es" are massively published)? 18 years after the publication of the first comic, which is itself an adaptation of a series of novels, MUST be adapted on the screens. After the first and unsuccessful attempt on the television program, the real thing begins. <br /> <br /> First of all, and most fans did not get it, the purpose of this movie is not to tailor the comic series. Some essential parts, signs and actions of the original are missing. The film itself offers an alternative and more modern version of the series. As a fan of the first-class comic I must admit that I was pleasantly surprised. The actors are good, this is the script, though it may seem too fast. That's why I recommend this movie to anyone interested in financial / political thrills, but apparently it's not an alternative to James Bond and Jason Bourne because I could read online.
