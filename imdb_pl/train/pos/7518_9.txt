Beautifully done with the wonderful performance of Gretchen Moll, who captured such impeccable happiness in his work, as well as the reproduction of small films and photographs are perfectly made and often fun. According to Harron, they used film materials that are no longer produced, and studio lighting in the style of the fifties, even in outdoor places, to give a colorful portions a characteristic look. Bettie Page saw the movie in Hugh Heffner's house (now eighty-three years old) with the producers there, but not with the director, in case she became awkward if she did not like it. Apparently she liked it until the official investigation, which turned out to be disturbing. Some great costumes. The idea for the film began in 1993, but it was worth waiting. Her portrait never seems false with regard to all these images and fragments (scary) of films that many of us have already seen. It would be an interesting work with Goodnight and Goodluck, but much more enjoyable watching!
