This film moves without sentiment - significant without pretentiousness. It tells the simple story of a family at risk of collapse, because the interference of technology and progressive society make the family business more and more unsustainable. <br /> <br /> Acting is great - although none of us the West probably heard about these actors, we should have long ago - play their characters with honesty and respect - these are defective characters, each of which has serious weaknesses, but with so much humanity and kindness that you can not not engage history. <br /> <br /> We need more such films - we need more western filmmakers making such films.
