I remember that I saw a promos for this concert before it appeared in 1993. I was 8, and now, at the age of 22, it was weird to see this cult start and end and look back at it. it suddenly seems so far away, what a great decade. In any case, I watched Monster Vision all the time, because I am a huge fan of horrible movies and horror movies. It was like the version of the Chiller Theater from the 90s. If MST3K can get a DVD, why not Joe Show Bob, at least MonsterVision was more interesting and informative. Many comments and information about Joe Bob about the movies was just fun. Most of the films shown at the exhibition are Class B or C, but they showed a lot of A house movies, as well as Hammer films from England, which are both top-notch and many with Ray Harryhausen's time-lapse. Many of them were weird movies that you would not see anywhere else, like Japanese Sci-Fi movies, except of course Godzilla, which is known for almost all and independent films, such as Metal Storm and Motel Hell. With the new Decade of Film Protection and more independent directors, I think that MonsterVision will be a good show for IFC, because they already have a hit with the IFC grind house show. I'm sure that one day the concert will be picked up again for reasons of nostalgia, I think he will have to wait and see. Until then, "it's great TV"!
