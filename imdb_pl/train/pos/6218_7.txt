79/100. Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers never made great films together. Although this is not one of the best, it is a perfect musical. There are several great music numbers, good support from Randolph Scott. Two notable appearances, Betty Grable and Lucille Ball are memorable on early screens. The ball is especially good and also blonde. "Let's Face the Music and Dance" is one of the best numbers in a musical duet. Harriet Hilliard, better known as Harriet Nelson from "Ozzie and Harriet", plays sister Ginger Roger. The basic theme is quite familiar, but with exceptional staff it works. Excellent artistic direction and result.
