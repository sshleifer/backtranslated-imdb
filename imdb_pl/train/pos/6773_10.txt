And I caught this movie on T.V. Last Night And You Know Danny Masterson was quite a good actor in the movie and it was great to see him in something other than a show from the 70's. The film is not evaluated, but in my opinion I would rate it (R) only because of the nudity and a lot of adult content. But All In All I Loved It, I thought Dirty's Wisecracks were quite fun. It's just a guy who does not have a job, a girl or money, and eventually he'll get a job as a private detective (more a messenger really). People who really need help. I Give It .... *** 3 stars.
