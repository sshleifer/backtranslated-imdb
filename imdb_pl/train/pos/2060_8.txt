This movie is not your typical horror movie. He has several scenes with humor and death that can be quite comical. I liked the film personally because of his humor. It's definitely not a super scary movie, which is good if you do not want to be scared and paranoid later. I liked the performance of a guy from the hill and Lester ... very credible. I think I will dye my hair red like this scarecrow girl - very good! In any case, in general, it is worth to rent humor and unusual horror films at the campsite.
