"I looked into the eyes of this island, and what I saw was beautiful," proclaims one of the main characters in the ABC award-winning television program "Lost." The series can be summed up as a story about the drama about a group of survivors from an airplane crash, who were stuck on an unknown island, but it would be harmful. The "Lost" follow a large group of characters who come into conflict with the island, as well as with each other when they fight their new way of life and dependence on themselves. The situation becomes more complicated when it becomes clear that it is not an ordinary island - and that they may not be alone. <br /> <br /> Initially, I was afraid after hearing the concept of this series was the lack of new stories that they could tell us after some time, but it turned out to be unfounded. The narration flows naturally, the dialogue is witty, the characters are memorable, and the performance is great. The island itself is a character and to understand this comment, you have to see the series for yourself, which shows its originality and greatness. <br /> <br /> At the time of writing this review, only the first two seasons have been broadcast and are filled with strong sections. My only mild criticism is that the second season seems to slow down a bit, but then fortunately returns to the admirable shape for the last episodes. <br /> <br /> If I can recommend one TV series, you should go right now it will definitely be this one. If you like emotions, adventure, stories about characters, extremely strong cast and crew, beautiful places and an island that seems more spiritual than natural, "Lost" is for you. Just start from the beginning.
