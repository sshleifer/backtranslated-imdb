I first saw "Breaking Glass" when it was released in England in 1980. I loved it then and just caught it in August 2005 at the Canadian station, it's still great. The only thing I regret is that I can not find a soundtrack or DVD in stores ... ... someone wants to shed some light or I have to order it in some expensive online company. But back to the film the music withstands the test of time, Hazel / Kate had something to say about Britain in the 1980s, in fact it was the same decade that I moved to Canada for the same reasons, one of which was "Thatcher" what she did then with the country. If you have the chance to watch this movie, you will not regret it!
