is a film about life, triumph over the adversities and miracles of the human spirit. I am opposed to anyone who does not shed tears at the end of the movie. It's more than just a tearing jersey, its addictive, thought provoking drama with the perfect performances of all the actors, but especially Derek Luke and Denzel Washington. Seven years later I am amazed that Luke is still a virtual unknown, and Washington has directed only one other film. However, apart from the slow growth, the history of trials and torments of this adopted child and how it still affects him in adulthood is a kind of film that stays with you long after you see him. As with many images of fox spotlights, it was more of a sleep blow and did not gain the critical acclaim it deserves. The scene in which Antwone finally meets her mother, summed up the movie for me, there were so many ways that you could do, and everything could be frightening or unrealistic, but Washington chose exactly the right tone, his mother never said one word and I could only shed a tear while the antics just asked why. Her overwhelming wine kept her from saying anything she could say to defend herself? One of the most moving cinemas I've ever seen.
