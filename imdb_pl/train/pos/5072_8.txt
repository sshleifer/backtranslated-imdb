Pierce Brosnan will probably be the only person known for the new biography of Richard Attenborough. The rest is new to the international audience: the Canadian history and culture of the first nations. <br /> <br /> The "Gray Owl" is a light study of how a man was adopted in Ojibway, northern Ontario, learning and teaching the environmental protection of the decade before it became politically correct. The film contains a love story, a moral message and a man tortured by the past. This torture, however, does not always come to life with the dramatic impact it can have. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it is a movie that keeps the audience without violence. He refers deeply to the Canadian First Nations and presents them in a dignified and non-stereotypical manner. Brosnan's performance is a bit stiff, but I suspect that Lord Attenborough wanted him so. <br /> <br /> Thanks from the proud Canadian.
