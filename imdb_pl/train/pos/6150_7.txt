Personally, I've seen a lot of Disney movies in my lifetime, although none of them suits Bedknobs and Broomsticks in any way. Although I personally would not cross the live action with animation, it was an improvement in trying to dress people as the heroes of animation. The film depicts three evacuees from the Second World War who were sent to stay with a quiet and socially awkward woman in the country. I must say that the casting was brilliant. Angela Landsbury created the perfect Miss Price, and David Thomilson made the great desperate artist love interest. The endings always surprise me and it was no exception. It was neither happy nor sad, although I do not know if it was intentional. The dialogue was not great, but considering it was designed as a movie for children, it's fine. In general, I would give the show nine out of ten, in a dialog box six out of ten, cast nine out of ten, and costumes eight out of ten.
