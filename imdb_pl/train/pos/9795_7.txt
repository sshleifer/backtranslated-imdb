I've always said that Batman's animated movies were much better than live action movies. <br /> <br /> I have seen all animated films, but this is the poorest and rather disappointing group. <br /> <br /> "Fantasy Mask" would be the best, then "Best in the World", then "Sub Zero", then "Return of the Joker", and finally the last place. <br /> <br /> In this latest animated film, there is a mysterious new batgirl in Gotham, and Batman intends to discover whether she is a friend or an enemy when she sets out to seek revenge. <br /> <br /> But as Bruce engages in three young women, he begins to research them and discovers who is the new batgirl. <br /> <br /> The tone in this film is extremely light, considering that most movies are bleak and gloomy, which was rather disappointing. Bruce most of the time behaves strangely, the characters of villains are re-used from recent movies, and the action scenes are exciting, but they are really nothing new. There is also a lack of dramatic influence of other films, especially the movie "Sub-Zero", which was heavy in drama and character development. <br /> <br /> Everything in the film is very processed, and supporting characters are charming, but nobody is worth cheering. <br /> <br /> I liked it all this time, I had a great time, and the identity of the new batgirl is surprising, but it was not as exciting as me, "he hoped. <br /> <br /> (** half of ****)
