I voted for 10 out of 10 simply because it's the best animated story I've seen in a long time. The animation is stunning. The graphics behind each landscape were beautiful. From colors to lighting to an unusual art tariff. I was amazed. Going beyond the beauty of the screen, you are immersed in a story that is both timeless and fresh at the same time. Character development is short, but these test moments are exactly what you need to tell the viewer what and why and how the character came to where he stands. I am impressed by the whole matter and I think it must be seen by the whole family.
