You have a friend who is currently involved in a relationship with SOB, who has a longtime girlfriend. Of course, SOB is very handsome, charming etc. And my friend is a very intelligent woman. Watching the character of Jean Pierre Leaud at work is exactly like watching what is happening in real life, when such people destroy the lives of our friends. It's tragic and you know it will end very painfully, but you can do nothing. Leaud is brilliant. Completely empty. He pulls his faces all the time and tells the stories that he believes trigger the desired reaction. <br /> <br /> The scene lasts two hours, when Leaud and Lebrun make love, and the next morning he starts recording and, very sweet and charming, he sings to make her laugh, he's genius. The phrase "What the hell I'm doing here with this idiot" that flickers back and forth on her face will be in my mind for a long time. <br /> <br /> It's a long movie, but see it in one go, preferably at the cinema. Taking the time to enter, but time just disappears.
