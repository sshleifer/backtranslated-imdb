The most moving and truly opening documentary ever made. I cried all the way, from beginning to end. Watching the performance, you are immediately caught by a man's struggle to live without pain, live a life that we take for granted. When I heard the title for the first time, I was almost afraid to see the program, it was difficult to understand life in agony every day of my life. I really felt for him. The saddest part of the documentary is that Jonny takes the coffin. Can you imagine it? The more that despite the pain and unbearable pain he still opened his own love. (DEBRA) Jonny is one of the few people who deserves real respect and admiration, he is the definition of the role model he was a real and undeniable hero!
