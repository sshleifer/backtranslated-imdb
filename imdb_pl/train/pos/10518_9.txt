Emma, ​​filled with great English environments, is a delicious sweetness that you can enjoy for dreamy trips. <br /> <br /> Emma (Gwyneth Paltrow) is a graceful, intelligent young woman who has just married her governess - a marriage that Emma takes on in her matchmaking. Wanting to use her talent in arranging things for the people around her, she decides to fit in with the vicar, Mr. Elton (Alan Cummings), with her beautiful young friend, Harriet (Toni Collette). <br /> <br /> The result is a series of mixed signals and misinterpretations that end with sorting, and Emma learns that she did not have as much control over the events as she thought. <br /> <br /> The film is full of witty and crooked characteristics. Gwyneth Paltrow is at its best, presenting this girl of a restrained, polite society with wit and ease. Her growing affair with an unmatched Mr. Knightley (Jeremy Northam) is the heart of this film. Mr. Knightley is one of the greatest romantic men in movies. He is incredibly handsome, in a modest, relaxed way that is irresistible. Certainly it fits Gwyneth Paltrow well. Their sweet friendship, which began when he was 16, and she was an infant, flourished when he, a friend of the family, combines cleverness with her in an older brotherly style, which turns into something more. With an ironic look at Emma, ​​Knightley from Northam is happy to watch. <br /> <br /> Another great feature is the comic book by Juliet Stevenson, Greta Scacchi, Ewan McGregor, Polly Walker and the talkative Miss Bates who is very funny. <br /> <br /> It seems shorter and smoother than most of Jane Austin's adaptations, Emma has a comic rhythm that promises real joy.
