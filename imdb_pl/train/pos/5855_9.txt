If you've played the PS Spider-Man, you've seen everything. To really experience this, you should get the DC version. Simply put, it's a much better game in terms of graphics; The textures are sharp, the levels are easy to navigate and have a much better sound than the PS cousin. I bought this game back in the late 00's and it still sticks to today. Well, Marvel: Ultimate Alliance is a much better and more strategic game, but if you're an ol Web Head fan, then you have to choose it for your gaming library. Turning around the city, Spidey never looked so good and did not play a video game. If you have a Dreamcast, catch it for cheap. The DC version is simply amazing.
