The first two seasons of this comedy series were very strange and not too funny and had a dramatic element in which Bill (mother) struggled with all the usual problems in life, but this element was a bit depressing and did not mix well with the elements of comedy, which is why he was probably abandoned. Then he soon became one of the hottest comedy series the BBC ever produced! The chemistry between Bill and Ben was very funny and there were always so many great and unforgettable sketches in each series. Christmas promotions were fun and a real feast for Christmas. <br /> <br /> The concert ended when the main actor Gary Olsen playing in Billa died, which was very sad because he was a brilliant actor in movies such as Up 'n' Under and a very funny man RIP <br /> < br /> This underestimated show has unfortunately disappeared from our TV screens and should not be repeated so often - although it appears on UKTV Gold once in a while, but should be repeated on the BBC one or two to show this brilliant comedy for a new audience
