Making a book in the film by tracking the page on the side is NEVER a good idea. When people read a book, they automatically start to create their own "mental film" about how the characters look, about the places where they are, about the progress of the situation. And every mind is different, so when the movie "REAL" finally comes out, you'll always have a detached segment of viewers who are disappointed that it just does not measure. <br /> <br /> All writers and directors can hope that they can achieve it, regardless of their own vision of the film, and we hope that it will be as close as possible to what viewers expect. /> <br /> There is no better case for this situation than films based on Stephen King's novels. When the filmmakers capture at least the essence of his story, the results can be breathtaking and really scary (CARRIE, "SALEM'S LOT, THE DEAD ZONE") or they can be what fans regard as a terrible mess (Kubrick's THE SHINING, miniseries for IT and THE TOMMYKNERS). <br /> <br /> Although it is not even close to King's perfect adaptation, PET SEMATARY has so many moments of deep anxiety of skin and bones that it seemed that they bled on the screen directly from the book that you can almost forgive his faults. For this purpose, we have Mary Lambert, the director of music videos, who thanks (she directed SIESTA, not quite a horror movie, but another bizarre as it should be, see the list), working with the screenplay of "Man-ster" and probably one of his better ones. <br /> <br /> Since most of you know this story, I will not sleep with too many details. Dr. Louis Creed (Dale Midkiff) moved his family to an ideal home in the country. Well, almost perfect, except for two nasty little things: a dangerously busy stretch of interstate highway ahead and a large animal cemetery in the woods behind. Because Louis is a vet and he has a little toddler for his son ... well, even if you have not read the book, do your maternal math. After all, it's the king's story, so there's no secret where it's going. <br /> <br /> What counts is not so much the goal as the terrible stop along the way. Some of the scenes that are so well-known from the book bring shivers with each other, causing shouts: the terrible memory of Rachel Creed (Denise Crosby of STAR TREK'S) about a terminally ill, crippled sister; Meeting of Louis with the fatally wounded runner Victor Pascov (Brad Greenquist), both before and after his death; travel to the "other" cemetery outside the graveyard of pets. And this third act ... if it does not give you some nightmares, maybe you should check your pulse. <br /> <br /> Good performances of everyone here, especially the late Fred Gwynne as a good neighbor, Jud Crandall, who gets the best line in history, which summarizes everything: "Sometimes the dead is better." <br /> <br /> The only problem with the film version is the casting of Louis' son, Gage (Miko Hughes). Knowing that it would be almost impossible to get the performance he demanded from a child of this age to seal this deal, Lambert and his team continued to do what they could, and unfortunately Hughes was too damned CUTE then. "Sell" your intended role of the evil, demon-possessed zombie. It takes you out of the movie as soon as it appears, although the scenes in which it appeared are still masterfully staged (especially the Gwynne death scene.) <br /> <br /> Besides everything else is still as good as it gets. CARRIE still has the title for the best adaptation of King, if you ask me; but SEMATARY is in the top five. <br /> <br /> Is something adapted to the screen based on King's book will be as scary as reading this story? Probably NO BLOOD ... for now.
