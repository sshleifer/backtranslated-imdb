The basic plot is that Aditiya (Kumar) is the spoiled son of a millionaire, Ishwara (Bachana) who owns the toy industry, in the eyes of Ishwar his son Aditya can do nothing wrong, mother Adityi Sumitra (Shefali Shah) warns Ishwara, to bring his son to a responsible path before it's too late, because Ishwar is a lung cancer patient and only has 9 months of age when his son pops up and marries Mitali (Chopra), Ishwar easily forgives Aditya, but when the happy Aditya and Mitali couple come back from the honeymoon, Mithala is pregnant, and this forces Ishwar to expel Aditya from the house to make him more responsible, Aditya does not know that his father suffers from lung cancer, and he does not know his father threw him out of the hose to to make him more responsible, Ishwar can not bring himself to exalt Aditya, that he will die soon, with a hungry and pregnant wife. it's a race against time, so Aditya does everything to prove he's a father, and the culmination comes when Aditya has a big break in the film industry, and his father tells him he's going to die soon. <br /> <br /> This film is absolutely brilliant, it's a breakthrough in Indian cinema, which was needed by the Bollywood industry, Shah's direction is almost flawless, but which film has no flaws? The best part, if this movie is a father-son relationship, is a tear squeezer. intermittent song is just put in the right time, the scenery is good, the only part where the movie fails is the jokes between Boman Irani and Rajpal Yadav, the jokes are too long and after some time are annoying, but overall it is a brilliant movie, I advise anyone who reads this review to view it, regardless of other reviews. 9/10
