Bette Midler is divine again! Humorously humorous. In love with Burlesque. He can bring you to tears with old jokes with new dresses or only with old songs with more power and power than ever before. All in All Singing new ballads, singing good old / eternal such as "The Rose"; "Stay With Me" and yes, even "Wind Beneath My Wings". The best way to appreciate Divine Miss M has always been a libe - because this is another thing I recommend, I strongly recommend everyone with a wide spell and appreciation for adults and a mischievous desire to push all boundaries!
