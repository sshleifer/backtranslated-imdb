I must say that the events of September 11 did not strike me until I saw this documentary. It took me a year to deal with the devastation. I was the one who changed the radio station and the TV channel if you talked about the towers. I had enough of listening about it. When he was broadcast on TV a year and a day later, I was shouting out my eyes. I cried for the first time since the attack. I highly recommend this document. I watch it now on TV, 5 years later and I'm still crying about the tragedies. The fact that it contains one of the few video shots of the first plane striking the tower is amazing. It was an accident and look where he got it from. These two brothers make me want to be there to help.
