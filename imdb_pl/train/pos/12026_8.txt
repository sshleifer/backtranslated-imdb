I must say that this TV movie was a work that really showed how talented Melissa Joan Hart is. Now we are used to watching her in a sitcom and I hope that the TV station will show this TV movie soon, because it will show Sabrina fans that MJH shines in the drama. Seeing that we have been watching her now on Sabrina for 5 years, to give viewers taste of her unused talent, would be a plus. Melissa plays her role so well that she wants her parents to "leave" so that she can be with the guy he loves. One thing that all Sabrina viewers will notice, Melissa works with David Lascher in it, long before he took the role of Josh on Sabrina. So it would be nice to see it on a regular basis when it will be re-broadcast. I hope MJH will get good roles in movies and even in more TV movies like Kellie Martin, which has always been shining on television. Lots of unused talents waiting for the exit, when it comes to Melissa Joan Hart, you always shine Melissa !!!
