This vague de Sica delivers goods. It is said that "quiet will inherit the earth." This story about activities on the surface, but really an allegory for all homeless people who populated Europe after the great war. They are homeless, but cheerful, in societies that are too impoverished and selfish to look after or recognize; de Sica decides to tell it as a fairy tale, a story about Cinderella. I have not read the book on which it is based, so I can not predict whether deus ex machina is a writer's or Vittorio's construction. It starts with the words "Once upon a time ..." to illustrate the timelessness of his story, because the story could be set anywhere and everywhere. The caricatures of the aristocracy that cross the bone, the capricious nature of the homeless, especially when they begin to fulfill their wishes and end with the image of Spielberg, make this bouange a pleasure for everyone. The most accessible image of De Sica. Abandoning neo-realism, he always hesitated between this and a clean, good old film, creates a film that breaks the heart and at the same time fills him with longing for the hope that one must continue to leave this world. Gracias Vittorio! Gracias! Gracias !!! Gracias !!!!!!!!!!!!
