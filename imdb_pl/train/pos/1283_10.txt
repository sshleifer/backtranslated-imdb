The film focuses on a man who believes that all media forms are outdated. The idea behind his artistic project is to expose the absurd culture in which we are bathed. Of course, the film takes place in Los Angeles / Orange County. Attacks standing comics (caw, caw, caw), rock bands, models, Hollywood hits and touches many other media. In the end, he is in the viewfinder of the weapon he set in motion. The film is five years old and is more real every day. This is the best description of post-punk anger I have ever seen. It's also one of my 10 favorite movies.
