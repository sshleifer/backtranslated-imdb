Gabe Ryan (Frankie Thomas) leaves the reform school and returns to the slums. His sister (Ann Sheridan) does everything in his power to avoid getting into trouble, but he seems to be following him. In addition to their links with the Termite gang, real gangsters are behind Gabe who have a plan to set fire to random buildings to collect insurance. They need someone to blame for arson, and Gabe is. The task of Termites is to work on the law in their favor and give the gangsters just desserts. <br /> <br /> The scene that introduces Dead End Kids is really good. The boys wander to furniture the new inhabitant on the street and make their own. They talk to each other in false elegant accents and talk about drinking tea together; Bernard Punsley is slumbering in a chair. The boys are starting to fight the new boy, but after he proves himself a good fighter, they ask him to join their club. <br /> <br /> The initiation scene is also quite good, full of mischief, that in the beginning it seems dangerous, but it is really clever and innocent. <br /> <br /> Later, when Billy Halop studies to become mayor, he dreams of schooling. It is wonderfully staged, with tiny holograms of children walking on his face and shooting questions with him. <br /> <br /> Angels wash their faces is a great title, because they play the role of success of Angels with dirty faces, and really say what children do. Known for their bad behavior on and off the set, these boys are having fun in this movie. But instead of appearing insincere, it makes him laugh great. This is a preview of what many boys will become in The Bowery Boys. We get even a few distorted words from Leo Gorcey.
