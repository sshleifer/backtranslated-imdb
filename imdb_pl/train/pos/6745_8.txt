???? The sequence of the Turkish bath in the noir movie in New York in the 1950s, it must be a hint! Something interesting in all previous comments, no one paid attention, but it seems to me important for understanding this movie <br /> <br /> sequence of Turkish baths: back street at night, entrance of a sauna and Scalise wrapped in a sheet, massaging his thigh. Steve, the masseur is a type of young rough boxer (Beefcake!) And another guy, a bodyguard? it ends up changing. Dixon apparently hates what he sees there and becomes rough at once. We know he has the reputation of a rough suspect. Good cop, but it's easy to get out of control. Why does he hate them so much? <br /> <br /> Is it possible that he hates himself. That part of himself that he inherited from his father? The dark side that could lead him to the end of the sidewalk, to the gutter? What if the dark side lurks in the "closet"? Remember: each time Dixon meets Scalise (3 times), the guy lies on the bed and has only male companions around him (the irony of the "Girls" poster strapped to the wall next to his bed!). <Br /> <br /> Scalise is acting funny: offended manners, shaking his neck arrogantly, defiantly, sliding the inhaler (poppers?) Into his nostrils every time he talks to Dixon. Dixon, out of revenge, is inclined to pin Scalise, who does not seem to understand: "I have never seen a man as full of hatred as you. I find it almost an amusing way to follow me alone. "Four years are jumping on me as if I was someone special! Why? "<br /> <br /> Because Scalise is someone special: he is the direct heir of Dixon's father:" Your father liked me "," Your father put me in business. " incarnated dark side. And in addition, he prefers the company of people. Dixon knows it well: "Who killed him (Paine)? You or one of your playmates? "Playmates! Notice how they meet each time, Dixon manhandles Scalise: he takes out the address book from his jacket, pats his face, hits him. Scalise: "I warn you not to touch me! "Dixon's homophobia is obvious. Or else: his unexpressed homosexuality. Dixon, son of Dixon, is the son of a thief. In response to this, he decided to become a cop, good, but there is something a criminal in it, a dark side: he is a brutal copper, a murderer, a liar. In addition, he is not married, every now and then brings "a stunning blonde" to his family place to eat, but nothing more. The scoffful waiter says he can not make love to a woman. Dixon has a deep sense of guilt and hates himself for these reasons. A hood and a gangster like his old one. Blood will say, "In the end, to achieve redemption, Dixon decides to sacrifice: if he gets his alter ego Scalise to kill him, he will be freed from guilt and free the girl and her father too. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie returns to the initial sequence: Scalise is pressed into the gutter, and Dixon deserves the right to walk on the sidewalk and gain love for the lady. <br /> <br /> <br /> (These notes are guilty of much to the film commentary of Jean Douchet on French, <br /> <br /> <br /> DVD edited by CarlottaI
