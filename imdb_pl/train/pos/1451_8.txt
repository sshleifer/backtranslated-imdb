I saw this movie about 6 times. And every time I watch it, I am more impressed with history and acting. It's like watching a train wreck in motion. His subtle approach, but very effective in achieving the goal. <br /> <br /> Spoilers-> In the center of the story is a very nice dichotomy. On the one hand, we have deputy Major Eddy Calhoun (Cusack) who unknowingly tears apart the old boys' network that forms the heart of the Major of the New York administration, and on the other hand we have the mafia boss Zappati, who deliberately tries to maintain the status quo with all necessary means. This situation eventually ends when Zappati orders Alselmo to make his life easier by killing himself and Calhoun, ordering Pappas to do the same politically. <br /> <br /> The film also contains some really great single liners such as (my personal weakness): - You do not summarize the life of a man in an instant - The only novelty in this world is a story you do not know. <br /> <br /> All in all, a great movie that deserves a much higher rating.
