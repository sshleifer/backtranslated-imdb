Recognition for the director and cast for such a realistic movie. Grittiness, lack of glamor and desperation dragged me into the movie and kept me there. I was really impressed by how the dates and information were passed on in the film; ie, newspapers, letters, etc. It made the movie move so fast that I did not feel like pushing forward. Personally, I thought that all the rules did a huge job ... it was great to see Bosworth and Kudrow in such difficult roles. Sometimes I wanted to cry. Val Kilmer did not surprise me ... his performances of this type usually arouse my admiration. In general, it is a brilliant movie that can not be missed!
