What is "Raising Victor Vargas" is as close to perfection as a movie. Or the mere genius of a freshly baked author, or just one of those happy mixes in which everything was clicked (probably some of them), this simple, small fragment of urban ethnic life, the first love movement shows his young figures with such depth that you can almost read their minds. The film begins with the strong taste of the "street", but enters the romance of the Latin family, and then focuses on the story, which talks about the uncertainty of youth and the deeply natural desire to love the other. In my experience, you have never done so much with such a small amount (cast, newcomer, etc.). Praised by critics, but not for everyone, "Raising Victor Vargas" is recommended to indie and realist fans in simple stories rich in humanity. (BEHIND)
