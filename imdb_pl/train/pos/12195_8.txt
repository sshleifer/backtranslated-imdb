Each film from the first days of Orson Welles is a triumph up to the third man with Joseph Cotton. It's also great at Touch Of Evil. Please see them all! He has a tendency to be pompous and to serve himself in films such as F for the False, really stupid waste of the film. Do not waste time watching it. it is really ignorant. Orson Welles is a movie icon and anyone who studies a movie should see everything he filmed. All his leading ladies are huge, but eventually Welles became a fat drunk, like his character in A Touch of Evil! For some reason Orson Welles had contact with women. I can see how it could be considered attractive in his youth, not like Gary Cooper or Joseph Cotton, or Cary Grant, John Wayne, I could go on, but digress ... and because I am a woman, I see a train to him. He (Orson Welles) is one of the last real filmmakers, and if you do not count film makers from today: Tarantino, Scorscese, Spike Lee, most filmmakers simply do not match the movie makers of the forties! I know that today there are many other great filmmakers, but in such a short time I can not name them all. No offense to the great creators of this millennium! August 21, 2006. Remind me of some current and future filmmakers, I do not want to get stuck in the past! I love some movies now, but there are rarely any that I would put on the "Top 100" list. "Hustle and Flow" was great, like "Fargo" and "Oh, brother, where are you? , "From a line on Sullivan's travels; another great movie from the forties! Can anyone give me the best list for the 90's and up to 2006? I would like to know who to watch! Thank you! Also props on this page! Where else can you connect a movie or win it! I love ranting and raving from ordinary people like me who can say what I want and I promise that I will not spoil any film to someone who has not seen it yet!
