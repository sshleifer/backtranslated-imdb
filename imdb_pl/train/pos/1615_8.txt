A great drama about a romantic comedy about an Italian widow (Cher) who plans to marry a man with whom he is comfortable (Danny Aiello) until he falls on his stubborn, angry brother (Nicholas Cage). The screenplay is sharp with lots of great lines, the game is great, the accents (as I was told) are perfect, and the pictures are beautiful. New York has never looked so good on the screen. Must be seen primarily for Cher and Olympia Dukakis - both are fantastic and merited for the Oscars. A beautiful, funny movie. You must see!
