For the first time, I saw Frailty's trailer on Yahoo Movies in the day after I heard Stephen King praise him for the high sky. I'm really not a fan of any star, but I still wanted to see it because I'm a huge fan of thrillers. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed. Acting was great, especially on the part of two young boys. I usually hate children's actors, but Young Adam and Young Fenton were perfect. Bill Paxton really dealt with it well. It was beautifully filmed. <br /> <br /> Also pay attention to the twists and turns of the action. Three bends at the end hit hard and fast, and I did not see them coming. The final turn of the film, combined with the seriousness of what has just been revealed, gives me the chills to this day, even though I have watched the film many times. <br /> <br /> A real gem.
