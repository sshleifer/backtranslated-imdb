I watched it during the Christmas season, I do not know why, but it reminds me Christmas, so I watched it, so we are. <br /> <br /> Arthur is a movie that I watch with a big stupid smile on my face and a mixture of special performances, great joyful music and a script that evokes charm and charm. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore creates a character that can be very hated (a broken, rich, lazy drunk who regrets himself), but turns him into someone you love. Liza Minelli is great as Linda Morolla, a queen waitress who can tear apart a hard / soft woman that Arthur almost surrenders to his world. John Gielgud gets all the juicy lines and polishes them with taste. <br /> <br /> I can watch Arthur again and again and it always makes me feel good, check it out, if you need a lift, it's a beautiful movie.
