Given the low budget and production limitations, this movie is very good. It is credible, realistic and shows how Csikos (Hungarian horsemen who lived on the plains (puszta) risked their lives to save a shot down American pilot from ruthless and savage Nazis ... We are drawn by strong feelings to young, vulnerable but very brave boy - who admires the American pilot If you're looking for special effects, superhero characters and magical endings - this movie is not for you If you want to feel how it must be avoiding persevering, amoral Nazis and their lack of compassion, then you will be fascinated by this movie, I really like and for those who love horses, dogs and humble, helpful people who value freedom and those who strive for this purpose, this film will be remembered for a long time.
