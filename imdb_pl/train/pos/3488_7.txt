WWE needed a savior when Wrestlemania 14 was in progress. The departure of Bret Hart and the subsequent evaporation of the Hart Foundation meant that Vile D-Generation X became undisputed in WWE. Their wicked leader, Shawn Michaels, stole the title of Hart thanks to the interference of Vince McMahon and with the help of his cohort, Triple H and Chyna systematically took everyone who challenged his supremacy. But a new rival appeared on the Royal Rumble. Stone Cold Steve Austin. Austin, hated by McMahonagement, was worried about DX. He was so worried about the fact that they benefited from the help of Mike Tyson's "The Baddest Man on the Planet" as a special enforcer. Austin would have opposed the odds in his title duel with Shawn Michaels. <br /> <br /> But first, there was an inaccurate card, thanks to which the Legion of Doom won an unforgettable battle. 15 Royal teams became rivals No. 1 in the title of the tags. I forgot that this match existed until I reconstructed the PPV. Not very good and really emphasized the lack of depth in the division of tags in that period. <br /> <br /> The next match brought the title Light Heavyweight defended by master Taka Michonoku against Aguil. WWE set up the Light Heavyweight Title to compete with the strong Cruiserweight Division at WCW. It was not successful and it was the only time the title was defended at Wrestlemania. A short match, lasting about five minutes, actually too short to be able to achieve a lot. What they did was exciting and it was a nice little game in which Taka retained his title. <br /> <br /> OK, our next match saw a member of DX Triple H defending the title of WWE European, who won the farcical fashion of Shawn Michaels on RAW in December and did not defend PPV against Owen Hart, Sole Survivor. Triple H got a big entrance with the DX team to perform his theme song. Chyna accompanied Triple H in the ring, but was handcuffed to the WWE Commissioner Sgt Slaughter. Triple H and Owen have a nice little match before Chyna intervenes, causing a low blow to Hart, which leads to Triple H retaining the title. A good match could be great if he went a little longer. <br /> <br /> But of course we would not want to waste time on another match in which we saw how husband and wife Marc Mero and Sable beat Goldusta and Luna Vachon in the first mixed match in Wrestlemania for 8 years. And to be honest, it was not worth the wait. Although it is not terrible, the match was not unforgettable either. This was the close end of the only Mero run in WWE, and the main goal was to continue the breakup of his relationship with Sable. <br /> <br /> Then we saw Ken Shamrock throwing and he costs the Intercontinental Championship as he destroyed IC Champion The Rock, but then he refused to release the ankle lock and the judge reversed his decision. It was a short game, but decent for what it was. <br /> <br /> Then I saw the first good match that night when the WWE Tag Team Champions of the New Age Outlaws lost the Cactus Jack and Chainsaw Charlie title to play in the trash. The decision was overthrown the next night, when the Cactus and chainsaw threw the Outlaws in the garbage behind the scenes, not the one that was used in the match, but it was still a funny match. <br /> <br /> It's time for the long-awaited first meeting of Kane and his brother Undertaker. Kane cost Undertaker the WWE Championship at the Royal Rumble, and then "killed" him when he helped Shawn Michaels close Undertaker in a coffin and set him on fire as revenge for Undertaker, who burned their parents' home and left him horribly disfigured years ago. It was a decent match and told me a good story when the Underataker absorbed everything Kane could throw at him and then knocked him down with three tombstones to finish the match. <br /> <br /> Only the main event, in which he saw WWE, will face Steve Austin and Mike Tyson as the guest exec. Michaels suffered a devastating back injury in the match against Undertaker on the Royal Rumble and was unusual in this match despite his physical limitations. Triple H and Chyna were banished back at the beginning after disruption from outside. The match ended with Austin avoiding the Sweet Chin Music challenge and striking at Stone Cold Stunner with a ref down. TYson then went into the ring to count three, celebrating the victory against Austin, and then knocked out Michaels after the match. It turned out that Tyson and Austin were together, and the cat was playing with the mouse all the time. <br /> <br /> This was the last PPV match for Shawn Michaels for four and a half years. This helped establish Austin as the biggest star in the wrestling business, and the mainstream advertising gained by the emergence of Tyson proved to be a key turning point in WWE's fight against WCW. Austin became the biggest star in the history of WWE, and along with Rock, Mick Foley, Undertaker and Triple H, they led the WWE in a period where they would gain the highest cultural level. It all started here at Wrestlemania 14.
