I liked the movie, I admit, mainly because I like watching Sean Connery's act, and this one has the bonus of owning Ed Harris and Lawrence Fishburne. The story has a grandmother looking for Connery's help, because her grandson is in prison and she says he was wrongly convicted. At first it seems that there may have been some racist aspects of the case, but later it turns out that the chief officer in this case was black himself and it seems that he did some bad things to make the boy confess. Well, the boy is trying to point out another assassin locked in the same prison to be killed. He is also a particularly nasty person, because he takes great joy from what he did, writing relatives of his victims and trying to get people to send them. Many twists and turns in this one, some of which are slightly unexpected. I just enjoyed the character of Sean Connery, trying to understand the whole test. The movie also drove me crazy in areas, especially when you find out what happened in the end. You get a very good interaction between Connery and Harris, Connery and Fishburne, because everyone is good at it. In the end, he does rather good suspense / thriller.
