Masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Yes, maybe not for everyone. <br /> <br /> Working with the camera, acting, directing and everything else is unique, original, wonderful in every respect - and very different from the garbage we are sadly used to. <br /> <br /> Summer Phoenix creates a deep, credible and intriguing Esther Kahn. Like everything else in this movie, her acting is unique - she's entirely hers - neither "British" nor "American", or anything I've ever seen. There is something hypnotizing about it. <br /> <br /> The long, uninterrupted, natural shots are wonderful, reminding us that we are too used to a few limited ways of photographing and editing.
