Shawshank, Godfather, Pulp Fiction ... all good movies. Great movies. But nothing, and I mean, nothing deserves the biggest Christmas movie of all, Saint Nicholas. <br /> <br /> The movie is so great and has so much news, I cried while watching. Seriously, this is one of those movies that you have to watch 10 times. When we see Pitch say he will have to eat ice cream, we see sadness in his eyes and we feel a deep sadness, and then we wonder ... what's wrong with this ice cream? Does it mean that we humans treat ice cream as good when everything it does makes us bad? The thought of a movie makes you think. <br /> <br /> This movie has the best interpretation of Santa Claus in history. Unlike other Santas, he is a normal person. We see children bonding and spying on children's dreams, and we are wondering; Does Santa Claus believe in really good? This Santa Claus also mentions Christ, the whole sense of Christmas. <br /> <br /> You owe to watch this cinematic masterpiece. We should just stop making movies and do nothing but this epic 24/7. Regardless of whether it is Christmas or not, this movie gets 500/10. Whoever says that this movie is bad is an ignorant one.
