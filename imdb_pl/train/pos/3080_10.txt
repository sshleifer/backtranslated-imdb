I have complained to ABC about the cancellation of six degrees. If enough people do the same, it would be enough to restore this wonderful performance !! Just go to the official website and the rest is quite simple. I do not understand why this show was canceled. What a fantastic show, cast and characters. The whole concept is catchy! I'm amazed that my favorite program ended after one series. Why it? Six degrees is phenomenal, better than many other TV programs! Until I heard that they were stopping him from a friend, it did not even occur to me that this could happen.
