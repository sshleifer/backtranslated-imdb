There are many problems with Mystery Men. First of all, there are too many different characters to get all of them complex or even interesting personalities. Special effects diminish history and are not so special. Paul Reubens is wasted in a pitiful, youthful role as a character who only farts and speaks inaudible accent. <br /> <br /> Now for decent parts. William H Macy, three celestial words, and his performance as a shovel is perfect. The Sphinx is an extremely funny character who is only mysterious and spits out only the traditional mystical proverb. Ben Stiller is also very funny, showing a weak character who is trying to get into big leagues of superheroes. All characters do, and this is an area that I consider to be particularly ironic. This is because all actors are Indian actors trying to get into the big Hollywood leagues. <br /> <br /> Honestly, the reason I thought it would not be at the box office is that America does not do it. ironic. <br /> <br /> In total, I loved this movie, but it seems to me that it would be better if more effort was made to improve the script than unnecessary landscapes and CGI effects.
