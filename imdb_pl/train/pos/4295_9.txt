Alain Chabat claims that this film is his original idea, but the subject of reluctant lovers who have finally approached him is so old, if not older, than Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> Chabat is "vieux garcon", cheerfully single, not wanting any member of the opposite sex to disturb his life. He has a problem, 5 sisters and a matriarchal mother - G7 - who decide that he should be married. Enter the charming, charming Charlotte Gainsbourg and what should be a simple plan. Charlotte must pose as a Chabata girl, and then she just does not appear on her wedding day. Never again talk about a marriage with G7. Of course, the best planned plans tend to get out of control. <br /> <br /> There are very strong supporting roles from Lafont as a mother and Osterman as brother of Gainsbourg. br /> There are several fantastic scenes in which Charlotte first has to charm and then rebel the family. French farce with English.
