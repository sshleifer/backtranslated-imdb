It's a great British movie. A cleverly watched script with many quotes that perfectly captures what magic mushrooms can do to people over the weekend. As usual, Phil Daniels is great compared to the most famous British actors Geoff Bell. Peter Bowles, with his mouth hanging jointly, is a masterful casting, and Gary Stretch with his deliberate gaze brings something strangely atmospheric to the song. Although it seems to be a movie for motorcyclists, I think that he will find the audience beyond that only on the assumption that many people have been made there and got a T-shirt. also a great original soundtrack with a blinding version of Freebird. This may be the heiress of the 21st century of the famous comedy of Ealing. Like a weed in the Welsh fields: it's a breeder!
