Shortly before the introduction of the code of morality, it tarnished the spirits of writers, directors and actors, the first film adaptation of W. Somerset Maugham's "Of Human Bondage," exciting countless moviegoers. There is no shock value today, just a great game. <br /> <br /> While the cast is excellent, this is the first great role of Bette Davis and one of Leslie Howard's best performances. Howard is English who wants to become a Parisian artist, Philip Carey, who is gently and decisively told that he lacks talent and that his dedication will not replace real genius. Taking a lesson by heart, he returns to London and enrolls in a medical college (one, incidentally, there are no female students there - at the time there would be at least a few of them.) Maybe the author / physician Maugham does not care about distaff medicos) . <br /> <br /> After tea, one day Carey is delighted with the waitress Mildred Rogers, Bette Davis as morally loose and basically wicked farrago. Her cockney accent is as sharp as that of Eliza Doolittle. His repeated attempts to make friends with her are greeted with less than an enthusiastic response: "I have nothing against", a sure sign for every man with his head screwed straight to his head that he submerges the depths. Maugham's Mildred completed her instructions to the waitress with a bit of old-fashioned street walking, something that was not clearly exposed here. <br /> <br /> Mad Carey prostitution serves the greedy need for Roger's support. He is desperately in love with her - playing him as an organist on Sunday church, he puts his instrument effortlessly. No sex here. Recognizing that he is nowhere to be found, he begins a clean relationship with Norah, a woman who adores him. Come back to Mildred, full of the child, and with her usual need for care. Get out of Nora's broken heart. <br /> <br /> Another separation from Mildred and Carey begins a long-lasting friendship with Sally, enthusiastically incited by her father, who seems to perceive a possible marriage as both a good thing for two young people and a chance to relieve one of his nine descendants. <br /> <br /> Film rationally, but it does not quite follow Maugham's excellent novel. Carey Howard is na√Øve and vulnerable, and for most of the movie his sad eyes resemble a servant standing in front of a two-barrel shotgun. Mildred is an unbridled villain, the user of the worst kind, her only preoccupation with her own needs barely hiding as she tries to persuade Carey with a thin patina of sensitive words (and offers - at some point he promises to do "everything" he wants "a bold statement in time and I am sure that the audience fully understood. <br /> <br /> It may be a pre-Code, but a quick solution to Mildred in March would satisfy the loyalty of Catholics, ending with the loss of conventional sin, triumphing the basic behavior. <br /> br /> Director John Cromwell made excellent performances of his two main stars, one well-established, and the other established mainly thanks to this film. London and time travel is worth taking. <br /> <br /> Available on DVD. <br /> <br /> 9/10 (for Davis and Howard performances)
