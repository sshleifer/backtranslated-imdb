This was the case of Angels in the Field. It was on TV last night and I believe I have not seen the movie since the second year of high school, and now I'm in my fourth year of college. Although the film has many disadvantages, it is so moving that you can not resist sitting down, watching it and having fun. It's also fun. Danny Glover's rage is so great that you can not refrain from loud laughter. It adds to the film and I am sure that exactly what the director wanted. In fact, you feel the characters of the movie, even if it is not the best. You must see. I highly recommend. <br /> <br /> 8/10
