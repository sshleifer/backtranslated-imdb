NOTORIOUS BETTIE PAGE (2006) *** 1/2 Gretchen Mol, Lilli Taylor, Chris Bauer, Jared Harris, Sarah Paulson, David Strathairn, Austin Pendleton, Norman Reedus, Dallas Roberts. <br /> <br /> Mol shines as the legendary Bettie Page pin-up queen in a great biopic. <br /> <br /> Gretchen Mol is probably best known for being tense as The Next-It-Girl for a few years ago, when nobody knew who he was, despite the infamous cover of Vanity Fair among other media dubbing, but despite several roles in the main roles here and there, her anticipated fame seemed to be less shimmering. Here, as the famous Bettie Page pin-up queen, Gretchen Mol is indeed a shining star. <br /> <br /> Bettie Page was born in Tennessee who was brought up as a God-fearing and family oriented, proper girl who seemed to find herself an unjustified object of desire and affection as she grew up. Rape that is rapidly withdrawn is wisely not represented graphically, nor does the subtle depiction of his father have decent projects for his own relatives, which is important to understand how she managed to escape a nightmarish career as an actress while going to New York in in the 1950s, when in reality it was time and place to catch lighting in a bottle. The party did not realize that in reality it would be just when it would arrive. <br /> <br /> A beautiful raven-haired lover with a divine figure, the party is spotted on Coney Island on a summer day by a black policeman asking her to take her photo which leads her to pose in his basement and eventually to the studio of Irving Klaw (Bauer ) and his sister Paula (Taylor), who satisfy their kitschy, but considered to be pornographic frames of exceptional customers: the types of fetishes. <br /> <br /> Although Page is rather na√Øve, she is undeniably smart and knows that her body is not a sin and she can see a forest for trees in the sense that she controls - or at least stays in what is offered to her in the fact that he is not indecent and has a lot of fun in less and less dressed portraits - until the Witches' Witches hunt for several scapegoats to make pornographic images a crime. <br /> <br /> The talented director Mary Harron and her writing partner, Guinevere Turner ("An American Psycho" and "I Shot Andy Warhol"), improve biographical traps rather carefully and maybe a bit too quickly when it comes to about who Bettie Page really was, although they do justice to presenting the era of restlessness at their zenith. A huge thank you to the talented cinematographer, Mott Hopfel, for his wonderfully black and white paintings, as well as color-sprinkled segments that resemble Douglas Sirk's films from the era for his melodramatic siblings. Part of the feminist treatise and part of the American dream fulfilled this story, perfectly harmonizing with the great performances of the band, including comic Bauer and Taylor as siblings in sadness, and Harris having a day as a photo-photographer with a taste for wine and talk. It is funny to see Strathairna in a bit of stunt as a senator in the campaign for integrity after introducing the bulldog of Edward R. Murrow in his recent performance "Good Night and Good Luck" as the opposite of the role at the table. <Br /> <br /> But hats for really great talents of Mol as uninhibited, but deeply morale and, most importantly, intelligent Bettie Page, which allows her childishly innocent to radiate through her bold nudity and now considered a familiar and peculiar borderline - kitschy poses that have attracted the attention of men for decades and are still a bookmark of human sexuality in this country and perhaps all over the world. Mol is perfect and remarkably reminiscent of her portrait, until her smile. True Bettie Page apparently was not involved in the project, but evidently gave her a blessing and still lives in a somewhat secluded life, which is referred to in the last moments when she found Jesus and once and for all evaded her "notorious" image. It is a pity that this film strangely embraces a loud decency saturated with its theme, radiating for everyone to see in its naked splendor.
