Like the streetcar called Desire (also directed by Gadg both on stage and on the screen), Panic on the streets presents New Orleans, in which his main claim to fame - the birthplace of jazz - does not even mention. It was the seventh film by Richard Widmark and probably he came a long way to recognize him as a great actor, which he really was, not just a psychic killer. Sam Gadg plays a minor role as a morgue's assistant, but the film is rich in talents, starting with Jack Palance (still called Walter Jack Palance), and the local Mr. "Big" was following Zero Mostel, Barbara Bel Geddes, Emile Meyer, Tommy Rettig plus solid reliable as always Paul Douglas as a policeman who comes to the point of view of Dr. Widmark. This is a very satisfying film because it is not very visible. Catch him if you can.
