This movie is great. The story is very faithful to the book, which is a classic written by Mark Twain. The film starts with the scene where Hank sings a song with a group of kids who are called "when you're on the moon." This reminds me of Sinatra's song "High Hopes". The music is great, and my favorite song is sung by the king, Hanka (Bing Crosby) and Sir "Saggy" Sagamore. For a great family movie, and even a great movie, Date. This is a movie that you can watch over and over again. The princess played by Rhonda Fleming is great. I love that movie!! If you liked Danny Kaye at Court Jester, you'll love this movie.
