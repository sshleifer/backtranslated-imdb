First, I want to say: "Thanks, Disney, for the final release of the movie" Cinderella "on DVD! Now you have all Disney animated DVD movies (including limited editions from 1999)! What are you going to do next? You're going to Disney World !!!!! Well, technically (I mean, look at the castle !!!!!) <br /> <br /> In any case, Disney remains magical in his classic animated film "Cinderella" from 1950, a film that puts films with fairy tales on the map . We all know the story of Cinderella, her half-sisters, date, glass slipper, pumpkin, who turns into a carriage for saying "Bippity-boppity-boo!" And, of course, the attempt to return home before midnight! <br /> <br /> What I like about this movie: It's a great old story that children like, now in the form of a movie (and also on DVD) !!!!! <br /> <br /> "Cinderella" - thank you, Disney !!!!! 10 stars.
