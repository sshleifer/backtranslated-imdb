It was a movie I'd heard about growing up all my life, but I never saw it a few years ago. His reputation really progressed. I knew about Michael Myers, I saw the mask, I saw ads of all the next dark sequels. But I grew up for a decade in which Jason and Freddy had a mortal grip in horror games and never thought about the Halloween series. Boy, when I was cheated by cheap knockoffs. <br /> <br /> Halloween is really a scary movie. Currently, according to today's standards, it is not so graphic and intuitive, but this movie meets all the other levels that most horrors fail to achieve. The atmosphere created by John Carpenter is so frightening, and the fact that it is located in a peculiar, midwestern city is a testimony to his skills. The light effects are frightening, and "The Shape" seemingly appears and disappears in the shade. A simple but brutally effective score only adds tension. <br /> <br /> The performances of all players are well done, with a special nod towards Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance. Mrs. Curtis is such a good Laurie Strode, because she is so nice and vulnerable. This is all the more frightening when it is persecuted by Michael Myers, because the director and the viewer have invested so much in it, we want her to survive and run away. <br /> <br /> Donald Pleasance plays Dr. Loomis a man on a mission and works well. It adds a sense of urgency to the situation in which the city is located, because it knows what evil is following their streets. <br /> <br /> In general, Halloween is not only a great horror movie, but also a great movie. It works on many levels and attracts the audience and never gives up. This should be standard viewing for anyone who wants to experience a really scary movie. And even more terrifying time, try to watch it alone with the lights off. Do not be surprised if you think you see "Shape" lurking in the shadows!
