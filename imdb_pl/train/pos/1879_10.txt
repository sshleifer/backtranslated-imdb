I was too young for a remmeber when I saw this movie for the first time. But I saw it a second time around 7 years ago. My sister told me that I have to see it. Now all my family remembered him. We quote him at least once a day. I really like this movie. I'm still laughing after this time. Sure, it's a really, very drunk millionaire who's irresponsible. The point is that he still has a humanity lost in the others that we see in the movie. And that he is willing to give it all for love. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to laugh. Lots of laughter. Its disgraceful, sweet, and if you're a movie fan, it will really change your "playful" idea. Watch it with a group of your friends or family and promise you'll never have the opportunity to talk to several of the Authur lines in your head. It will make you laugh for many years. <br /> <br /> It's really hard to find a movie in my family that everyone likes. But this movie, I think, has brought us closer. And I know he will do the same for you !!
