Here comes another, well, romantic comedy ... but unlike all other movies of this genre, this is definitely the best I've seen for a long time ... <br /> <br /> I admit that first I wanted to watch this movie from because of Megan Fox and a little bit because of Simon Pegg ... <br /> <br /> First of all, if you watched a decent amount of movies, you'll find out that Sidney and Alison will be together in the movie, in one way or another ... but from the beginning to the end of the movie you will not know how ... <br /> <br /> Okay, now this movie is made for Simon Pegg. I do not see any other actor in the role of Sidney, and I'm sure it would be a weaker film if it was not for Pegg's great performance. <br /> <br /> many great gags and jokes in this movie that made me laugh a lot, courtesy of Sidney Pegg ... but I think everyone in this movie is good. do not think of it as a simple act of ress, but it was really good in this), there is Jeff Bridges, there is Gillian Anderson and of course Megan Fox who plays the spoiled bizarre star Sophie Maes ... a great role for jej ... <br / >> In total, although I usually do not agree with IMDb grades, this time I will completely agree with them ... <br /> <br /> Go and see this movie, it is really light and positive, and I recommend it deeply ... My rating 7 out of 10 ... well 7.5 really ...
