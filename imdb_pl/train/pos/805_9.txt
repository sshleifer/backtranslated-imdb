"Return of the Jedi" is often remembered for what he did wrong, and not for what he did well, and it is a shame, because the last chronological part of the Star Wars saga is a great example of an epic story. It's possible to finish all the feature lines of previous films in one big finale and it's very convincing. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are Ewoks - cute and cozy bears that probably served to expand the demographic Star Wars - and in the middle the movie slows down a bit. But the last hour is probably the best piece of the whole saga, where Luke finally confronts Darth Vader, the most recognizable villain in film history. <br /> <br /> The return of the Jedi has done so well that people tend to overlook: he presented an amazing conclusion from the plot Darth Vader (which from a somewhat unbelievable in "Empire Strikes Back" was very convincing), an exciting opening at Jabba's Palace the masterful performance of Ian McDiarmid the Emperor, Luke finally comes to his own, the resolution of the romance of Solo and Leia, and the extremely powerful last moments on the moon Endor. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are slight irritations. But these are troublesome generation of moviegoers who managed to jump out of each scene. It is still a magical and moving piece of cinema that also serves as a great final chapter. This is not a "good" movie - it's fantastic!
