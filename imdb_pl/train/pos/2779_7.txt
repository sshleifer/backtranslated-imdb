"Bend It Like Beckham" may not mean much to us Americans who know very little about other football, but for English sports fans it is the equivalent of "Hit it Like Bonds" or "Dunk it Like Jordan". Every young football player dreams about bending the ball around one player and putting in the goal, like the star, David Beckham, like the young Indian girl, Jess (Parminder Nagra), in the movie Bend It Like Beckham. Jess loves to play football, the kind her traditional mother has forbidden. However, playing one day, passing friend Jules (Keira Knightley) sees her and invites her to try out all girls in the football team. After the coach's satisfaction, Joe (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) creates a band that he knows her mother disapproves of. The film is not about disobeying parents, but rather about a girl who does what she wants, even if it is against culture and not only with her parents. Humor appears throughout the film, especially when Jules's mother thinks she is a lesbian. The film appeals to a bit of a banal moment because a big football game is on the same day as Jess's wedding party, but it's not tacky but rather funny and light. The football action looks good, so sports fans will enjoy it, and the story of girls growing up in the boy's world, the world of football will inspire some in the audience. Bend It Like Beckham is not only football, but rather a girl trying to find herself and at the same time please parents, which turns out to be rather difficult.
