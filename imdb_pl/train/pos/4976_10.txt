A Frank Capra WONDERS OF LIFE movie. <br /> <br /> Keeping blood in our veins is the duty of the hard-working HEMO THE Magnificent. <br /> <br /> In the mid-fifties, AT & T and Bell Science joined forces with the well-known Hollywood director Frank Capra to produce a series of scientific CBS television films to educate society about the surrounding universe. Unlike the bleak black and white feed, so often meted up by young scholars, Capra's films were both instructional and entertaining thanks to vivid scenarios and eye-catching images shown in Technicolor. Four films - OUR MR. SUN (1956), THE STRANGE CASE OF THE COSMIC RAYS (1957), HEMO THE MAGNIFICENT (1957), THE UNCHAINED GODDESS (1958) - quickly became the favorite of the school, where they were shown in 16 mm format indefinitely. <br /> <br /> The star of the series was Dr. Frank C. Baxter (1896-1982), a kind professor of English at the University of Southern California. This excellent teacher turned out to be an ideal film instructor, ingeniously giving his listeners sometimes complicated facts in a way that never made them seem boring or boring. Dr Baxter, who won the Peabody Award for his achievements, continued to create high-quality instructional videos after the Capra quartet. <br /> <br /> HEMO THE Magnificent, which was produced, written and directed by Capra, tells the story of the human heart and circulatory system, with animation and gentle humor. Movie star Richard Carlson appears as a Fiction Writer, vigorously helping Dr. Baxter to tell the story of Hemo. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers recognize Sterling Holloway as a member of the television crew and Marvin Miller's voices, Mel Blanc, June Foray & Pinto Colvig as various cartoon characters, all unmentioned. <br /> <br /> The scripture that begins the film is completely in tune with the tenor and tone of production.
