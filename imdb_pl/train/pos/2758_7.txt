This film is about an extraordinary friendship between a businessman and a man with Down's syndrome. <br /> <br /> Character development in this movie is perfect. We believe that Harry is a businessman who neglects his family, and Georges is an innocent man who wants to love and care for a "normal" society. Acting is great, and the award for the best actor in Cannes is well deserved. <br /> <br /> The fantasy scenes in the film emphasize the fact that Georges suffers from his abandonment by the family and his desire to be treated like a normal person. The song, which is played repeatedly, also reinforces this message. The film shows that people with intellectual disabilities are good. We treated them with discrimination and neglect, which is emphasized by the scene in which Georges gives a gift to the waitress in the kitchen). If we understand and share the world of these people, both we and the mentally handicapped can become very happy. <br /> <br /> I was so drawn into the film and emotional experiences of the characters. This is a touching film for good souls.
