What an experience! Twisted and provocative for thought. Once again, Sharon Stone pulls out his wonderful, charming character Catherine Tramell. The original Basic Instinct takes place in San Francisco. Continuation takes place in London, where Catherine has moved now. Both vibrant cities known for excitement, haute couture ~ and the perfect place for someone like Catherine Trammel to live in. David Morrisey (Derailed) plays the smooth role of a psychiatrist, Dr. Michael Glass. The character of David Thewlis plays Roy Washburn with Scotland Yard, is a refreshing departure from the role of Lupine in the Harry Potter series. Brilliant cars, designer clothes, sex, drama, humor, tension - all "basic instincts". Bending the mind all the time. A great scenario. From the climax opening scene to the surprise - this movie is not boring! Everyone in the theater was glued to the screen.
