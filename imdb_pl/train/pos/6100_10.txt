It's really funny (and sexy) movie - it's not only stupid, but also great acting. It is a kind of movie in which the characters are so funny that you feel that you are connected to everyone in the theater. I saw it at a film festival in Boston and often laughed with others, and also touched some of the more serious parts of the film. This is a unique film about two doctors and I do not want to reveal anything, but there are also powerful scenes and really fun - plus dialogue is great. Wood Harris's character has a unique relationship with his girlfriend Zoe Saldana, and Brian White and Mya are also funny and sexy in their roles. If you have a chance to see - go - you will not be disappointed. It's worth seeing again. Wood Harris deserves a reward.
