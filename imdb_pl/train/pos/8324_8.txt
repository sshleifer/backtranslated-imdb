It is a romantic comedy in which Albert Einstein, wonderfully played by Walter Matthau, and his buddies play the match machine with his niece (Meg Ryan) and a talented car mechanic (Tim Robbins). The interplay between these major roles is supported by a great cast of famous actors. This movie is cute and funny ... "feel good"! Heartfelt recommendations.
