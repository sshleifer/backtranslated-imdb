WHERE THE END SIDEWALK deserves to be a better known film directed by Otto Preminger, the man who gave LAURA to the world. This time he has the same stars: DANA ANDREWS and GENE TIERNEY. It must be said that Tierney is insufficiently used here as an auxiliary, while the spotlight is directed at Andrews. <br /> <br /> Playing hard, hardened cop, used to dealing with a band of thugs in a way that is too energetic until one night, accidentally kills the man who arrests him. When the suspicion falls on the driver of a taxi (TOM TULLY), he goes to the investigation of the murder, but begins to feel guilty because he is in love with the daughter of the taxi driver (GENE TIERNEY). By the way, Tierney looks a bit too smart for the girl she plays here, and it seems that it does not fit the miserable elements of history. <br /> <br /> This story takes on a grim character, goes deeper and it was discovered that the murdered man had in his head a silver plate of service as a war hero. At the end he turns into a tale of morality, in which Andrews develops conscience because of his crime. <br /> <br /> It's fascinating, like a movie noir with strong performances from a strong cast. A good entry in the noir field, heavily directed by Preminger and nicely played by Andrews and Tierney, despite the slight depravity of her character.
