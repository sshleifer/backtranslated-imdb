Midnight Cowboy made a big fuss when it was released in 1969, earning X. According to today's standards, it would be difficult to get R. Jon Voight, who was better, is competent in his role Joe Buck, a stranger who wants to make him great with ladies from New York. He meets a clumsy street hustler named Ratso Rizzo, who tries to make friends with Buck for his own purposes. These two ultimately form a bond that is both moving and pathetic. Like Ratso, Dustin Hoffman just shines. Hoffman was often brilliant, but never more than in this performance. It is so characteristic that everything around it pales in comparison. The lost Oscar for John Wayne is one of the most absurd decisions taken by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Director Schlessinger has a clever hand in its production, but this film has a grungy underbelly that leaves a bad taste in the viewer's mouth. It's worth to see only Hoffman's performance.
