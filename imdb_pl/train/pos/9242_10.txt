It's difficult to judge such films because you rate them on production or just fine? <br /> <br /> I saw this movie around 1988/89, when I was a boy and I'm sorry to say that a long fascination with the ninja began. The plot is quite tragic, and the acting is of course terrible, but in this movie there is a mystic surrounding the ninja, which makes the atmosphere quite good. Combat scenes are important, although "rare" are really good. <br /> <br /> I must say that it was better when I was a boy, but now I can see the glaring points of unbelievable nonsense in the film, but as "sit with a few beers" a martial arts movie can not blame it, it provides and is much better than the "American Ninja" trash mountains that were thrown out in the 80's with hundreds of guys in black suits, but not really good fight scenes. <br /> <br /> In an interesting note, Dusty Nelson, scriptwriter and director Sakura Killers, made another ninja movie under the Bonaire film "White Phantom" I have no idea if it was supposed to be a sequel to Sakura Killers, but Sakura's clan for the time another is the main feature, including the same logo and similar history, this time with the White Ninja. he had a small sense of atmosphere, but the battle scenes are even rarer and to be honest they are awful. <br /> <br /> So, if you're a fan of martial arts, try to kill a few hours!
