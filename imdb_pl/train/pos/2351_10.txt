First, I want to explain that the inability to appreciate the imagination of the average user is frightening. What makes this show so special is the created hyper-reality. You do not need to know why Ned can bring people back from the dead or why it can only be a minute. Where the miracle of bizarre childhood tales has gone, just like a wrinkle in time. <br /> <br /> I say it is refreshingly original, because it is the polar opposite of masses of secular TVs, which leaves no space for imagination or reflection. <br /> <br /> It's nice to add a bit of escapism to the television experience. <br /> <br /> Hyperreality is my favorite aspect of the program. A scene from the 1950s, innocent and rare figures as well as scenery and physical surroundings that should not be treated as a pure reality. <br /> <br /> This performance masks the morbid nature of death, while others embrace it. During the entertainment, other TV programs took up the back shelf of the series. It really brought back the sense of curiosity, imagination and reflection to television. <br /> <br /> Pushing Daisies quickly reached the top of my list.
