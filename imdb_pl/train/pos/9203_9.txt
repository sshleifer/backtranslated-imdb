This is one of Dev Anand's films that gave great but different films to the Hindi film industry, such as Jewel Thief and Guide. The story is short (if you ask me what the story is), the plot is simple - the brother is looking for his missing sister. Sister joined the hippies who smoke from the pot and chant Hare Rama hare Krishna. However, the film shows several significant events that the world experienced in the 70s. Hippie culture, their subordination to drugs, freedom, escape from duties, family and the acceptance of something new, such as eastern religion (which was new to whites). They were perfectly serviced. Zeenat did his best, and Dev was unusual as always. The songs are best used (as opposed to overuse due to the possession of songs) in this movie. They have not been broken. A perfect example is "Dekho o devil ... Ram ka naam I am looking for a diamond." Every word in the song is very philosophical and meaningful. The end is tragic, but it is not the essence of the film. Overall, Devji, who believes in creating various films, has been successful in showing what he wanted to show here. It is necessary to see the hippie culture and beautiful Nepal of the 70's.
