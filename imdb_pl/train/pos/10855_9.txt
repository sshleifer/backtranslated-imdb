Looking back over the past 28 years (since my first presentation in the show), I can only say: when you do, it will stay with you forever. I remember my initial reaction: 1) irritatingly exaggerated, 2) below 3 produced) not like to form <br /> <br /> Well, two years later I looked again some episodes and did not think that it was so annoying. A year later, I managed to catch the whole series from the very beginning and quickly became absorbed in the bittersweet story of human guilt and the prospects of happiness. Yes, the show has a style that is not for everyone and I am sure that the outdated value of production would be difficult to solve. But I'm still thinking about the show at least once a month with a vague, tearing longing for what seemed simpler ... <br /> <br /> BTW I'm a married man ... (for all who think this is a show for women)
