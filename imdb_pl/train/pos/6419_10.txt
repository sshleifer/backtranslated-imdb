This film is an excellent military film. Maybe it's not a perfect Hollywood movie, but it does not matter. Hollywood has a reputation for sacrificing accuracy for good entertainment, but this is not the case with this movie. Other reviewers found the movie too slow because of his taste, but ?? as a retired soldier? I appreciate the pace that the film crew deliberately decided to tell their story as accurately as possible, given the two hours and nine minutes allocated. The story itself has been told and repeated several times, but remains for a professional soldier? and an African American in it? report the story presented by the film crew and presenting the American Navy to the world. The history of Brashear's work to become a navy diver, and his life as a navy diver beyond its completion, is not the only story presented. There is also a story about the Supreme Commander-in-Chief who defied his Commander's illegal order that a non-commissioned non-commissioned officer, Brashear, would not be taken in his trial dive no matter how well he did, and paid the price of one Strip and task change. He also told the real story of how Brashear found the third hydrogen bomb lost in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Spain in the 1950s and how he saved his life for another sailor who found himself on the line of a broken running line that would break him in two if Brashear did not push him out out of the way and he did not shoot himself. It was a complex story that was worth telling, and I admit that two hours and nine minutes were not enough to tell the whole story, and after the removed scenes from the DVD I can say that the crew tried to tell a story as full as possible. As a professional soldier, I was proud to see such a wonderful story told in such a comprehensive way and seeing the traditions and honor of the navy preserved in such a natural and complete manner.
