A preview of this movie has just appeared. It made me laugh every 30 seconds. The ending was so funny that tears were running down my face and I wished I had bought this big cola. There are definitely some stops, but overall, very funny. The film allows Steve Carell to shine after he took Jim Carrey in "Bruce Almighty" and Will Ferrell "Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgendy" in his films. Paul Rudd is always funny. I love the fact that he can be so funny in these wide comedies and continues to work in independent dramas (like P.S.). I think Seth Rogen should be more involved because he is so angry and talented. Leslie Mann also had some incredibly funny moments. I highly recommend it for those who just want to laugh like a maniac. However, if you are easily offended, do not watch this movie. If you're a furious feminist, do not watch this movie. And, no matter what, even if you think you're one of those "fashionable" parents, do not take kids to this movie. Sure, you should let teenagers go to see this movie, just do not watch it with them. It would make some incredibly uncomfortable moments for some.
