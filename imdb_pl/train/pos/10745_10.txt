Let me first misunderstand, James Hanlon is absolutely horrible, trying to describe what is happening to the debutants and events of that day. It really is in close contract with other firefighters without aspiring who are natural in their delivery. <br /> <br /> It is said to be an amazing movie that can not be watched without tears in my eyes. I am an Englishman from London, but I love New York and have visited him many times before and after September 11. This is a second home for me and I can not resist the impression that I am devastated by the loss of my life, but also by destroying part of such an amazing, beautiful city. This is a real matter in which firefighters have everything that collapses around them. I am very happy that the footage shows people how it was in the day. It is a pity that they did not use any footage from people jumping from buildings, because the friends who were there tell me that this is such an important part of their memory, they should be turned on to show future generations how terrible it really was. <br /> <br /> Conspiracy theorists can go to hell on occasion.
