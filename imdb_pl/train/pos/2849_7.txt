I can not say that this movie is a disappointment because I read some reviews before watching and I did not do it as well as I thought. The bar was not set so high, so the fact that my expectations were met did not say much. <br /> <br /> Okay: the city of New York. If you live in a city like me, you will recognize certain places and understand that the city is to be more than just scenery, but rather one of the main characters. There are really tender moments, humorous conversations and twists left and right that keep everything in business. <br /> <br /> Wrong: The first thing I thought after leaving the theater was that I wanted more, but not a positive fashion "leave them wanting more". Surely, good skits / scenes outweigh the bad ones, but there are many sketches that fit in the "between" category, too much in reality, which ultimately brings the film down. In addition, the diversity of New York, although suggested by many distant districts of the city and mentioned throughout the film, is never really implemented or analyzed to bring about the justice of the city. For example, many sketches engage well in middle-aged white. I mean, I know the city is home to many of these demographics, but come, the Paris story and the diversity of Je'taime characters make New York look like Lancaster, PA, or somewhere really white. It is simply disappointing that the city has changed in its heritage in this way. <br /> <br /> Anyway, even after saying this, I would like to give New York, I Love You a view. Who knows, maybe you will not agree with my opinion, maybe not. You'll never know until you see it. This review is not intended to discourage anyone from watching this movie because everyone's opinion about the art is different. I give you a very foggy head, what to expect.
