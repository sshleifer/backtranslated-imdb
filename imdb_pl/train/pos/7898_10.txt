This film had horrible reviews, but because it was unconventional and because critics usually "do not get" unusual movies, I thought I would try. Unfortunately, in this case they were largely accurate. <br /> <br /> The movie simply has an awkward mood that discourages him the most. It's a feeling that can not be described, but it's not good. To further confuse things, the script is a boring, pointless thing that is only vaguely interesting. <br /> <br /> Extremely talented Thurman simply drifts through this mess, creating only an impact. Hurt and Bracco in vain try to add something to the movie with an enthusiastic performance, but there is nothing in the script. Perhaps it was less embarrassing for them if they decided to simply drift and experience it just like Thurman did. <br /> <br /> One of the things that the "appreciated" film critic did not mention is quite funny. Are these moments of exact satire, or some scandalously strange moments, such as the question of cowboys who are pursuing the wounded with the smell of their unwashed ... um ... fronts. <br /> <br /> Due to the fact that it was not possible to recommend this movie, there is entertainment and watching "Even the cowgirls Get the Blues" is worth something else.
