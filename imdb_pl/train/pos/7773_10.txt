Fantastic movie! I recently rented a DVD and became stunned by this wonderful work. Douglas Sirk was a movie genius and his performances include Rock Hudson, Dorothy Malone (Oscar winner), Robert Stack (Oscar-nominated) and Lauren Bacall, whose words can not be described. Paul Verhoeven brilliantly paid tribute to this film when Dorothy Malone played the murderous inspirational guru Sharon Stone in his Basic Instinct. What a great joke! <br /> <br /> In turn the film is funny, riveted, camp, biting, kitsch, captivating and rolled into the eye! It's definitely the grandfather of every cheesy, big and small screen soap opera, but none of them has the dazzling style you'll see here: the camera's work is smooth and polished, the use of color is breathtaking, and the initial set up for the title song is not to remember, one-dimensional characters are unforgettable, and the final image will make you scratch your head, how censors come back, and then let you make the final touch! <br /> <br /> Although the most older, highly regarded films can sometimes be boring work, and writing in the wind contains so much and goes so fast that it is a shame when it ends. Thank you Sirka for the craft - and Todd Haynes for drawing attention to what has now become one of my favorite movies of all time! SEE THIS FILM !!!
