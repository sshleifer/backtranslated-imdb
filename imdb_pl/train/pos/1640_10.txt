"Heartland" is a great picture of how it really was to live on the border. Hard work and individual strength needed to survive difficult climatic conditions and lack of medical care mix with the comradeship and interdependence of settlers. The drama was particularly significant because history is based on the memoirs of real people whose descendants are still living there. It was nice to see the west inhabited by real people. No one was charming or looked like they had just spent a session with makeup or costume department. Conchatta Ferrell is simply wonderful. He is an example of strong, persistent people who came to Wyoming in the early twentieth century and did not allow any difficulties to stand in their way to a new life on the new land.
