I am 60 years old, I am a guitarist (lead / rhythm), and in the last forty years I have played in four bands, everything is there, fights, deceptions, rotten food, worse accommodation, always traveling, little or none, and everyone was drunk or tall. But clubs, fans and music have made everything worth it! Just like Strange Fruit! I'm too fucking old now, and arthritis in my hands and hips no longer means more rocking, but for the length of this movie everything has come back and that's all! Birds, brawls and alcohol! And I was young again! Like the voice of Billy Connolly, God likes those things from the '70s! Rock On Forever!
