it brings to mind the writings of Stephen King and memories of childhood filled with horror from stories such as IT - just the opposite. In these childhoods, there is no fear that one of your friends - still 20-year-old friends - remembers or seems to suffer. Everything up is described as a friendly pushing, perhaps periodically referred to as "picking" one or more of them, but everything is forgiven. There is no * angst * embedded in the film, and participants in later life describe relationships - we only see young people who have grown up on the same people. More mature, but basically still the same people and the same power structures. <br /> <br /> Completely amazing! Not only because people can actually grow relatively unscathed by social conventions - but also that friendships can actually last. In this respect, this film is a tiny pearl - as assumed, this was the purpose of the film: a portrait of unforced emotions that bind people. What, seeing in opposition to films from later years depicting the dark side of childhood - violent inhibitions in Bowling for Combine is what easily comes to mind, but from the mid-1980s with growing adoration of children and childhood (in the company of Thousands of ads, animations and serials directed directly to children) several documentaries and documentaries have been successful in showing the dark sides of growing up - abuse, loneliness, push to excel - as a result adults have dark and twisted minds. <Br> /> <br /> And here is a movie that says: "It is possible to have a happy childhood, look!" <br /> <br /> Thank you for that. OR illusion przeciwwagi ... <br /> <br /> 8/10
