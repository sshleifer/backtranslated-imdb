The epic novel by Anne Brontes THE TENANT OF WILDFELL HALL should be studied and read in schools and libraries as well as in folk salons. This is a fantastic story and tells the "real" truth about alcoholism and ruined marriages, and the mother is fighting to prevent her son from being a violent husband. It's similar to today's stories that we see and hear, and I believe that people can learn a lot after reading this book. Based on the possible real experiences that the author had in the 1840s. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie, its a great version of the book and very moving. I'm sure Anne herself would be happy with the way it was made. <br /> <br /> Excellent acting and great locations.
