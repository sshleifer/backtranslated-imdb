Has anyone noticed that James Earl Jones is the waiter who serves when Hagarty's wife reveals that she is pregnant when they are in a restaurant next to the lake. I watched this video on video, which I recorded from television. When I watched the scene, I thought I recognized Jones's voice when the waiter laughed at the end. I rewound the tape, and then slowly walked through it when the camera backed up and showed the waiter. Listen carefully when the waiter laughs when Hagarty looks up and tells him that they are going to give birth, and then watch carefully or slow the scene when the camera shows the waiter, though quickly.
