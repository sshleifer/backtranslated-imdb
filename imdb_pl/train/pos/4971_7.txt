This is an absurd dark comedy from Belgium. Benoît Poelvoorde (Man Bites Dog), perfectly sharp in black and white, is in great shape as Roger, the furious, obsessive father of a family in a small, grim Belgian mining town. Roger is a photographer who visits traffic accidents with his young daughter Luise to take photos. He is also obsessed with winning the car, taking part in a competition where the player has to break the record - and decides that his son, Michel, must try to break the record of eternal passage through the door - even employs an overweight trainer to train him. Michel dresses like Elvis and takes place on the radio show "Kłamstwa kina", where he describes the mistakes in the movies. Luise is friends with neighbor Felix, a pigeon fancier. Roger is a soulless character, because he pushes Michel over the border while trying to write, which almost causes him to die. Magritte's surrealistic paintings are intertwined throughout the film. It is undeniably charming and worth your time.
