When I saw the title for the first time, I had already deduced the subject of the film - clearly it was not a reference to the British currency, so it had to be Shakespearean and about a pound of meat - taking it or giving it to them. Will Smith is a good actor, so serial killers were out. It can only be about the man who gives it, so it must be somehow guilty. I broke the whole thing by looking at her and knowing the story before I watched, because the beauty of building is that the background parts of the main character are speckled to slowly light up the audience who he is and why he does what he does. <br /> <br /> Wine is a very difficult topic because it is deeply uncomfortable and sad, which is not an encouraging premise when you are hoping for a rollercoaster ride - you know it will be unpleasant. I would not say that the film glorifies suicide; he delves into the most extreme form of self-sacrifice - martyrdom. <br /> <br /> There is also a lot of symbolism everywhere, which is a warning sign that writing is cleverly thought out with great detail and leads to many meanings and profound reflexivity. The most famous subject that struck me was that he not only gave his heart to a girl whom he loves emotionally and metaphorically, but he gave it to her physically as the greatest gift he could. Determined to die, but his plan is thwarted by falling in love - what a complication to the second act. Absolutely masterful. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is very slow, but I'm hesitant about whether it would be better in a smaller time frame. I did not feel the tension and its horrible inner turmoil as much as I could, but maybe I just ruined it for myself earlier. After all, it is a deeply moving and original film, which is an incredibly powerful and provocative tragedy that deserves the prizes it will inevitably win.
