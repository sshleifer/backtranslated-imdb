A charming, fun movie that is solid. Recently, I saw the screener of this film at work. It was nice to see this movie as opposed to all horrible horrors that I see every day. So much so that I thought I would write. I'm not sure if this movie will go to theaters, but I hope so. It's a cool movie that you can see with friends, it's charming and has funny jokes. Acting was great (especially Howard Hessman and Larry Dorf.) The director was pretty good (not the film that required directing.) What really sets this film apart is writing, and the banter between characters is clever and has a nice rhythm. the screenwriter notices these things (I'm a dork.) In any case, a really nice movie that I recommend.
