Okay, we have extreme violence Verhoeven (Although not as extreme as other Verhoeven movies), we have plenty of sex and nudity, but something is missing ... Oh yes, there is a lack of intelligence, which Paul Verhoeven is known in his science fiction movies. I admire the way Verhoeven portrays the characters and their sense of humor, but unlike most Verhoeven films, the film itself is not humorous enough to fall into a comedy genre. Overall, acting was above average compared to most Slasher films. <br /> <br /> What makes Hollow Man a good movie is not history, cast or characters, but amazing special effects that would otherwise make the movie impossible. The crew really made the invisible man, without the use of things like a floating hat hung on piano wires and other practical effects (effects performed on the set). The most stunning scenes with effects are not visible, and Kevin Bacon is invisible when Kevin Bacon becomes invisible and visible. <br /> <br /> The problem is that this invisible man's story deserves more imagination. Here, it takes place mostly in the laboratory. I'd love to see how the invisible Kevin Bacon robs the bank and runs away, or let's say we steal something from people's bags or something like that. But what is shown is so decent that Hollow Man is a fun movie. Rating: B
