I reached the end and almost shouted: "No, no, no, no! It can not end here! There are too many unanswered questions! Involving the dishwasher? Mona disappearance? Helmer's power? Little brother rescued by her father? And what about the head ??????? ARGH !! Then I read that at least two cast members left and I have to say that I know that it probably would not be in line with Lars von Trier's vision, but I would gladly look at replacement actors just to see the ending that was planned! Of course, it would be difficult to find someone who would play Helmer when the character deserves it. Helmer, the doctor you love to hate! I think I have not seen a more preoccupied, unconscious, hypocritical figure on the screen! But I could miss the change of actors ... I just need to know how it ends!
