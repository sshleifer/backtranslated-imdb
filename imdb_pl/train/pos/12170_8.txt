Romantic comedies can really go both ways, you know? You will see one that is really awkward, and you will think that you want something more realistic. Then you will see one that is realistic, but it can be too boring to interest you. Or maybe you'll see one that does everything right, but it just does not make you smile. Romantic comedies are difficult films. You go in with a lot of expectations and usually, whether you like it, it's just a matter of whether the film winds up your expectations, or the guy or the girls next to you. <br /> <br /> Of course, if you have a girlfriend next to you and you're a guy like me, it probably does not matter if the movie is good, you have other things on your mind. For you I say, "Go for her, Tiger!" For the rest of us, I say, "Look," Guy Guy. It's great fun. <br /> <br /> Because _A Guy Thing_ knows that you are entering the movie with expectations, so he does not pretend that "The guy who gets married comes out with the woman of his dreams, and this is not his wife! "The conspiracy will make everyone happy. Sure, you may like it, but maybe it does not sound real or you think it's cruel. _A Guy Thing_ includes this. What the _A guy does is fill the screen with the best cast I've seen in a long time, so if you do not have the main story, you still have something that will make you smile. <br /> <br /> Are we talking about experienced veterans of big and small screen, such as Larry Miller (Pretty Woman, Best in Show), James Brolin (Traffic), Julie Hagerty (Airplane!), David Koechner (Saturday Night Live and Conan O'Brien regular, Dirty Work, Austin Powers II) or Thomas Lennon (The State and Viva Variety) or new faces such as Shawn Hatosy (The Faculty) or Colin Foo (Saving Silverman), we are talking about a few very talented and talented actors who know exactly how to use the inspired film characteristics, steal the show, every time, and continue to frame the song with the energy and joy rarely seen in romantic comedies. <br /> <br /> And this is not to diminish the real romantic line and the stars that carry it, because it is very sweet and terrib well done. Jason Lee (Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Dogma, etc.) Moves as a young professional whose life can get out of control, and Selma Blair shows unparalleled brilliance in presenting a novice woman with the profession and sophisticated career that every man wants to marry, with except for the guy who really is. <br /> <br /> However, many of the film's success falls on Julia Stiles, the right girl in the right place at the wrong time, and wears her well. Not since then, I do not know when I saw an actress in a romantic comedy that made falling in love with her so easy. Of course, everything is in close-ups, voice and subtle smiles, but it is magical and this is one of the main reasons why we go to the cinema first. <br /> <br /> But Julie Stiles's somewhat unusual sophistication would have been lost, were it not for the fact that the rest of the cast is so incredibly dead in its classic simplicity. It is a film that paints a broken world incompatible, makes them fall over, make you laugh, and then go with a big heart. <br /> <br /> The guy's thing is the movie you've definitely seen before, and the filmmakers clearly knew it when they set out to do it. We have not seen any new romantic comedies since Shakespeare; the relative success of a boy who is totally or totally dependent on the classic story is met by a girl. Guy Thing accepts this with a bit of metakinematical advantage, often moving scenes into an absurd, to give viewers a chance to recognize the powerful emotions and ancient role-playing devices in the game. <br /> <br /> For the album, it even manages to entertain with the rather traditional structural concepts of sex and sex, which are the center of every romantic comedy, so even feminists can get out of it. <br /> <br /> And guys, I think we can all agree that we wish our friends as cool as Jason Lee's friends in this movie. I'm not going to mess it up, but when you're trying to explain to your girlfriend why a pharmacist and a clothing store clerk are among the coolest guys in the cinema, I suggest you say, "This is a guy" and get away with it.
