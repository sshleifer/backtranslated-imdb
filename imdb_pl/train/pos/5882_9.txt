In Mexico, this movie was broadcast only in PayTV. Dietrich Bonhoeffer's life is a real example of a good German, especially a good man. The talks between Tukura and the Nazi prosecutor are particularly interesting. War of real ideas: believe two different Germans, both with faith. Bonhoeffer was a very complex person: a man, a fighter for freedom, a boy, a clergyman and a great intellectual; Ulrich Tukur is outstanding as Bonhoeffer. I highly recommend this film, especially in these difficult times for our planet. In Mexico, we do not know much about the life and heritage of Pastor Bonhoeffer, it's a great job to save a forgotten hero.
