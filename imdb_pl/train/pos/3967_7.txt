This is not the best movies of Jimmy Stewart - I admit it quickly. However, although some see his film as pure propaganda, I wonder what's wrong with that? Yes, certainly, like the TV show THE FBI, it is an obvious case in which the Bureau does some PR work, trying to get support. But, as entertainment says, he's doing a good job. Additionally, surprisingly enough for the time when it was created, the film focuses more on crime than espionage and 'communism'. Instead, he is a fiction of one of the earliest agents and career he chose. Now, given that the agent is Jimmy Stewart, it's pretty sure that acting and writing were good - because it was a real budget movie and a studio that did not intend to waste the star at a fast pace. In general, it's worth seeing, but not particularly.
