people say they are edited fun, but they had to significantly reduce them in post-production. I have harry as a professor at ucsd, and to be honest it's one of the best classes I've had, it's quite funny when it comes to what happened when making the movie, because harry is so animated. I originally saw the "joy of life" for another class in which harry made a voice in the film and started watching the movie after I started classes. Harry initially worked on performance and is really honest when it comes to creating moments that move you, especially when you have to re-edit things until you hit the moment, but it's something you see in this movie.
