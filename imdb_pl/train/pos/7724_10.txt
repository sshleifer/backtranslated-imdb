Sure Star Wars (a movie that I've seen at least fifty times) beats all other special effects, but this movie has everything else! <br /> <br /> Has horror (non-graphic), romance, robots, witty repartee, intelligence, (surprisingly good) special effects and drama. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie a few years ago in revival with a new hit print and I was amazed at how well it was halted today. I thought that electronics in the style of the 1940s would look like a hokey, but somehow it looked futuristic and modernist. rise from me. <br /> <br /> The Kreller monster appearing in the rays of the ray still frightens me with fear. <br /> <br /> Of course, we all know that the "Big Bird Galaxy" has probably modeled many of the "Star Trek" from this movie. <br /> <br /> Nobody has beat Robby yet, the robot, in terms of personality <br /> <br /> (sorry, R2D2 and C3PO). <br /> <br /> This film, in general, is the standard that all other Science Fiction films will have to face! <br /> <br /> A distinction for a haunting electronic result that kept us all on pins and needles.
