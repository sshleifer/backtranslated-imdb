A thin story with many beautiful shots. Here are three ladies from D.R.E.A.M. team. And, to a lesser extent, the guy accompanying them. Traci Lords convincingly works on the female half of a bad business couple who intends to poison the world with antrax. The original in this film is a bomb-bust, inserted in a captured member of the team D.R.E.A.M. Of course, he is saved by one of the members, three seconds before the explosion. Although it was clearly used by James Bond "Goldfinger" and "You only live twice", such a peak always works well. In total, a nice watch, James Bond replaced here three Angels Charlie.
