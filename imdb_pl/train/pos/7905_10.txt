I am very sorry about the people who go to the cinema with a pad and a pencil to write down the flaws and write down how bad the movie is. I also feel contempt for people who go to the cinema and CAN NOT suspend reality and / or allow 90 minutes of boring or busy life! Get people from GRIP. ECGTB is a very entertaining movie. If you take movies seriously, this is NOT for you. If you expect a movie to look like a book in ANY ways, it's not for you. But if you like the cheerful Priscilla Queen of the Desert or "what the hell I watch" Moulin Rouge. Or the disgusting comedy "The Sweetest Thing". Let me escape to Cowgirls. It has some really fun parts. Funny actually. He also has really good music, kudos to kd.lang. I also mentioned that Uma Thurman has 90 minutes ..... I have to say more?
