Some films manage to survive almost exclusively originality - "Wonderland" is certainly one of those films. The script manages to drop everything into an almost feverish tone, but does not make it inconsistent. The speed of this thriller is not to hide a weak scenario, but rather to accurately reflect the drug-addicted reality. <br /> <br /> As a director, James Cox is a very specific way of working with actors. Most characters are constantly on the edge, and often because they are rather ugly personalities. Val Kilmer described John Holmes as a merchant capable of manipulating and controlling. No offense to Kilmer, but his version of Holmes seems to be able to control the drastically weak. Nevertheless, it is a stunning performance. Comparing this with Kilmer's more "Hollywood" roles, as in "The Saint", he seems to argue that he is much more at home in harsh indie movies. <br /> <br /> The actors are the main force holding together. There are different small performances - especially women. Carrie Fisher, Kate Bosworth and Lisa Kudrow have limited time on the screen next to their male counterparts, but they're all fantastic. In addition to Kilmer, Ted Levine and Dylan McDermott give strange, stunning energy to their roles. <br /> <br /> I initially put off watching "Wonderland" because I assumed it was a movie about a porn actor, in the strictest sense. Yes, history revolves around John Holmes, but it literally has nothing to do with his professional career. Essentially, this movie is the secret of murder and as such - is perfect. <br /> <br /> ASSESSMENT: 7.5 out of 10
