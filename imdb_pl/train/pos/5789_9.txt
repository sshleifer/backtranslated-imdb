This is one of my favorites along with Mariette Hartley and Robert Lansing "Sandy" and episodes of Agnes Moorhead-the-tiny-spacemen. <br /> <br /> This is an important step, from the middle of 1961, of the long cold war in which the United States was entangled. A calm urban scene, a rare dialogue of hungry characters, their worn out uniforms and a minimal action "say" everything: the absurdity of a conflict that threatens to destroy human life, modern civilization and everything that is sweet and redemption. <br /> <br /> It is a "fairy tale" because it was created in times when events happened differently, like the second Berlin crisis (spring 1961) and the later Cuban crisis (1962), it would be a reasonable representation one of the major US cities, ruined and abounding in several unfortunate survivors. I also consider it a "fairy tale" because it is not just a warning, but because it is the most redemptive of all our popular myths: it is a love story, set in an impossible situation, with the participation of two highly unmatched lovers.
