It's a good movie, although people unfamiliar with comic books and Modesty Blaise books may find it a bit slow and devoid of action. For fans of Modesta, the film will be very pleasant, especially because it is very faithful in presenting the "history" of Modesty Blaise. Peter O'Donnell is mentioned on the list as a "creative consultant", and the filmmakers had to pay attention to him, because the story follows quite closely the details that have been presented in comics for years (although the events were transformed to the present day). The only thing a real fan can be disappointed is the fact that Willie Garvin is missing in history. This lack of Willi once again is true to the chronology of Blaise's Modesty, because the film takes place in the first days of Modesta's career. Alexandra Staden creates a very credible young modesty that looks very similar to Modesty. A change from the travesty of the portrait of Monesta Vitti Modesta is welcome.
