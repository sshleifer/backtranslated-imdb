As a guy who has seen all the seasons, I can say that JG still surprises me. I mean, after you saw him change from laughing into paranoia immediately after the seasons and after every little gesture that made you believe he was a gangster, you thought: OK, he's a good actor and he can get into the skin gangster. But when I saw him opening his eyes and fighting for life, it means I almost felt the pain that "caused" that we believe he is going through. I was so moved by his performance that I immediately thought about Robert De Niro, Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. These guys were by far the best of their generations, and even more. But now they're either old or dead (Brando) and they're fine, they make fewer movies, and their performances are "lighter" than they used to be. I can not wait to see Gandolfini in other movies, in which he has a completely different role. Can you recommend me some of your older films, which will give you an unforgettable performance?
