I can not stop talking about how much I liked this movie. This movie is one of the least known and the funniest movies I've ever seen. The film tracks the rap group's performance, NWH (Ni # $% rs with Hats). From the beginning of the group to the end of the group, after the tragic breakup of the group. After the group is the author of documentaries Nina Blackburn. <br /> <br /> The film has a modest budget, but it seems that it does not matter, it is a very well made, well-made movie, and the performances of all these actors and actresses are excellent. The main force of this film is writing, in this movie there are so many brilliant lines and rap races that it is unrealistic. <br /> <br /> SPOILER <br /> <br /> They are taking part in real rappers, such as MC Slammer, Vanilla Sherbert, Ice Cold, Tone Def, Tastey-Taste and songs (Booty Juice, Grab Your Dick, Etc.) Rusty Condieff made a great movie. In the film he plays the rapper Ice Cold. The film does not end, it is funny from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> The movie works so well because it sometimes becomes bizarre but hits a line that is funny without going too far. Listening to three guides tried to talk about some philosophy that was one of the best parts of the movie, like Tone Def telling the record producer, "when you're going by bus, you're there" and the producer says, ?? it's deep! <br /> <br /> The group portraying NWH has some natural chemistry for them. They work so well together and they manage to make this film where there is no week in the film. What really makes this movie so good is loyalty to some rap groups of that time. Many rap groups had problems with violence, with censors, and like the NWA, the group became popular only when the establishment started doing big things with controversial texts. <br /> <br /> I like this movie because it's offensive. There is something here that can offend everyone in a natural way. The film has a start on a large number of people who are out of rap, the funniest character of Spike Lee. Where they came up with this dialogue, I can not imagine. The film has a line on the line that will make you roll on the floor. As I said before writing, it is simply excellent. <br /> <br /> I am not surprised that this movie met with such a limited edition. It is an intelligent, controversial and even thought provoking movie. It is too much for the mainstream, although it is fun and almost flawless in its production. There are no major stars, but many familiar faces, including Marc Lawrence, who plays Tone Def. Watch this video, at least for sure you will have this opinion.
