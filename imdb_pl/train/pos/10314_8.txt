Ten and "Her Pilgrim Soul" are two of my favorite episodes in the new version of Twilight Zone. As I mentioned in my commentary on the new series, something is missing in this new series. Maybe they emphasize too much the lesson you need to learn. It's a bit more stupid and sentimental than the Serling version. However, this episode can also be considered quite sentimental. I think the appeal is that no matter what they do, lovers will never unite. I remember that I was not surprised by the Korean movie "Il Mare" (later reworked for "The Lake House." I think it was because I saw this episode first, so it ruined the influence of the later film).
