"Masks" is a movable movie that works on many levels. Simply put, this is the haunting story of a street performer who is involved with a small child, trying to convey his creative art (masks) to the next generation. Although sometimes history makes the old man become an Job, he is so well crafted (written, preserved, targeted, great production values) that it is easy to go beyond his difficult situation. And if you stick to it, the movie is ultimately very sweet and uplifting. Kudos around. This is a great movie for children and adults. The trick is how to convince Americans who may not like movies in a foreign language to see it!
