This film is another anthology of horror. It's rather good, but it could use a bit more. I compare it to the "House of Horrors of Doctor Terror", although it fits in this title. He has four stories that are connected by the house. The first story is about the writer and his wife who are moving in. He creates an assassin for his latest novel, and then he begins to see the killer wandering around the house. This one is in a sense predictable, but in the end introduces several twists and turns. The next story is a bit more unpredictable, and you really do not know where the hell is going. This one contains Peter Cushing and she was probably my favorite group. This guy buys a house, but it's not the house that's in the central place, but rather a weird museum of wax. The third story starts quite well and presents Christopher Lee. He has him as a bizarre father who seems terribly caring for his daughter. The problem is that once you know what is happening, the story does not end quickly enough. This leads to a very predictable conclusion. The last story concerns an actor buying a coat from a strange little store. The actor really gets what he paid for. Then there is a small story about the officer, who is seen all the time, trying to find out what happened to this actor, and then explaining why these things happened. Although I was not very happy with the explanations, I do not think that explains Cushing's story at all. I think they needed some more stories on this subject. All in all, it was an interesting set of stories.
