In the opening scene, an eye-catching band in the style of a desperate named Hawkeye has a smooth forehead, but when he follows Johnny in the pueblo, he is shown with a scar on his patched eye. This is just one of many continuities in this spicy western "spaghetti", but instead of discouraging the image, it adds a special character to the procedure. <br /> <br /> Another happens when Sanchez turns around in his three body corpses, they must be examined in terms of their identity - "You can not imagine how many false bodies we have in our city." Immediately afterwards, Carradine (Lawrence Dobkin) appears to collect her prize, not counting anything more than just the desired poster in her hand. <br /> <br /> Regarding the director of the film, Johnny Yuma (Mark Damon), he is shown alternately with a holster on the right and left hip throughout the movie after replacing the carradine rifles after a barroom fight. Johnny goes to San Margo at the request of his uncle, but will have to avenge his death from the hands of the wily wife Samantha (Rosalba Neri) and her co-participating brother Pedro (Louis Vanner). Achieving this takes some time, but it is great fun with one of the best music scores on the album. When it comes to fighting in the sedan, thanks to the sound effects of kung fu I got a kick every time the impact was combined. <br /> <br /> Take care of more exaggerated stories? After a duel with Pedro for the first time, Johnny wipes a small amount of blood from his lip, which he manages to smudge with Pedro's face all over. Similarly, when Pedro spins around little Pepe in a later movie, he does not cut him off, but before Johnny appears, Pepe's face is covered in blood. <br /> <br /> "Johnny Yuma" is probably one of the best genre in which there is no Clint Eastwood. As Johnny, Mark Damon is fairly adequate, but without a breeze from the outside. Carradine seemed to replace the obligatory character of Lee Van Cleef, without being a bad guy. Initially, the exchange of identity between Carradine and Johnny did not seem to make sense, but everything was related to the end of the movie. You knew every lieutenant would finish his case; setting time for everyone was part of the expectation. <br /> <br /> In case you are wondering, the title character has nothing to do with the character of Nick Adams from the classic television "The Rebel". In this movie, Johnny got his name after the shooting he once had in Yuma. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most unique element of this story was related to the way it all connected to the evil Samantha who pulled strings behind the scenes behind. After shooting, Carradine overcomes the hasty retreat before Johnny can get revenge. She's still alive, Carradine seems to try to shoot her and miss her, but it does not take long before Johnny and Sanchez track her down for dessert, where she died without water - Carradine aimed her canteen.
