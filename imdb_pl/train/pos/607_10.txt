Maybe I loved this movie in part because I felt off the beaten track and it's such a lovely little fairy tale. Whatever the reason, I thought it was perfect. Great, intelligent story, beautiful effects, excellent acting (especially De Niro, which is amazing). This movie made me happier than for a while. <br /> <br /> It's a very funny and clever movie. A fleeing joke about the history of the kingdom about the prince's savagery and consequences, the way in which magic, the witch and dozens of intelligent little things are charming. Very good; it's a complicated movie with special effects with more stories than most fairy-tale movies, but it's unbelievable to note small things. <br /> <br /> I feel that I want to go forward and watch it again.
