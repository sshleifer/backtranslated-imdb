I had almost the worst day in my life. Then I came across this charming movie, I watched it, and now I am ready to go out and kiss the street lamp. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I watched him only for two reasons: LEGAS VERA-ELLEN. But that's really a lot more. The plot is actually clever and creatively woven. It's almost like a Shakespearean comedy with all its wonderful misunderstandings. And of course there is also ... LEGS VERA-ELLEN. <br /> <br /> The only unfortunate aspect of this movie is that the version I purchased (the "100 Family Classics" collection from Mill Creek Entertainment) is not to have the best video quality and I have heard the same about the Alpha version. Brightness and contrast are a little too high, so many scenes seem faded, especially when Vera is dancing in a white dress. But I suppose you can compensate for this with the TV's controls. I can only imagine what it looked like on the big screen in '51. Stage sets, costumes and colors are otherwise dazzling and delightfully frightening - something like the "Cabinet of Dr. Caligari". <br /> <br /> When it comes to romance, it's just perfect. Not luscious, not invented, not melodramatic. Only 100% ahhhhhh. Too bad, poor schmucks, your unhappy life will never be as cute as this. Har har Wait, what I'm laughing at? My life is just as bad as yours. Go to hell. It's time to watch this movie again.
