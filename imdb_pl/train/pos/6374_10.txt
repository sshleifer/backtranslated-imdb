Atlantis was much better than I expected. In a sense, it had a better story than other films directed at people at a higher age. Although this movie sometimes required some serious attention. It was a great movie for all ages. I noticed that some younger listeners expected a comedy, but they had an adventure. I think everyone is tired of the endless parody of extreme parody. Many of these children saw only parodies. After a short time, everyone seemed to be watching Atlantis very intensely.
