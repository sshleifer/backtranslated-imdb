Telemundo should definitely consider creating a DVD collection with the Xica story! I know a lot of people, including myself, who would like to be able to buy novela Xica! This is a very funny novel taking place in Brazil. The costumes worn by the actors are beautiful, and the city where the short story takes place is beautiful. Xica contains many stories of this period. I would like Telemundo to teleport it again, even if it was two in the morning. I highly recommend watching Xic if he ever appears again on Telemundo. I have sent Telemundo by email a million times to show the short story again, but my requests have fallen on my deaf ears. The only warning about Xiki is that sometimes it contains a few sharp scenes, so I would recommend that children under 14 do not watch Xic. Overall, Xica deserves 10 out of 10!
