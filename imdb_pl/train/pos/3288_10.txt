It's a cool fantasy movie. One of my favorites, really cool. The director is Bernard Rose, who directed Candman, he made a great start to this film. <br /> <br /> A movie about a girl named Anna, who suffers from glandular fever on her 11th birthday. He draws a house on a piece of paper from his workbook and falls into a dream where the house is real. Each subsequent dream that he has, changes thanks to the presence of what he adds to the image. In his third dream, he meets a boy she thinks she created Mark. He makes friends with him and their relationship becomes stronger when the dreams become darker and frightening. <br /> <br /> Charlotte Burke, who plays Anna, is a great actress and it's very strange that one movie should disappear and never be anything again. It's really great in this movie. <br /> <br /> The result of Hans Zimmer is also an ace. Like Broken Arrow, the music is weird and mysterious. It is a pity that the soundtrack is no longer available on the CD. The DVD is only available in the R2 version.
