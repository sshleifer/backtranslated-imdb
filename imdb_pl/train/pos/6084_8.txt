I was happy with the cast of reputable players. History advocates putting things up, even if you risk yourself. At a time when violence and pain are often at the head of the film, this film focuses on old-fashioned good clay. Although similar threads have been repeated many times, these guys do it well. Go back and enjoy. Dennehy is the master of taking over the film.
