The only explanation that I can agree on why this film is not widely distributed is the fact that for some people it is too close to home. This movie was a real happy surprise, the satire is brilliant. This film turns on the light in the dark, which is an organized religion and large media, and cockroaches escape in search of cover. Rent a DVD and watch it, if you have not already done it, this movie is successful where many have failed (Dogma comes to mind) to poke it under the tent, both with humor and very clever analogies in conjunction with the background story and places. I can not comment in depth, without revealing significant spoilers, in this movie there are a few surprises that even an experienced film lover will be surprised.
