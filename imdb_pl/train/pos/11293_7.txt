William Wyler was to direct this adaptation of Broadway hit Broad Moss Hart with a poster about music / recruitment, but his own military commitments intervened and hit the most unlikely helmsman: George Cukor. The "feminine director" has some influence on many documentary sequences of the Air Corps training and invests it in more untamed humanity than the generally accepted genre, especially during the war. Sure, gee-whiz (and completely white, with the exception of one unregulated Sino-American recruit), the group of novices is prettier and more healthy than in real life, and the speech about the house and mother, wife and child gets quite thick, it is effective propaganda and undeniable movement. Also notable is the military cast of men, some of whom have not appeared in years: Lon McAllister, Edmond O'Brien, Martin Ritt, Red Buttons (in drag, as Andrews Sister), Peter Lind Hayes, Karl Malden, Kevin McCarthy, Gary Merrill, Lee J. Cobb and Don Taylor. Also a very early look at Judy Holliday, who does not appear for an hour and a half, but has some good little sequences, like an alarmed O'Brien husband in Brooklyn. It is a pity that his rights are tangled, and the only known print is 16 mm; apparently after the release of Twentieth Century Fox (for significant success) the law returned to the army, and if there is a good 35 mm print, it is probably somewhere in the guts of the Pentagon. It is hypocritical and dingy in spots, but it also clearly reflects the rigors of military training and war fears and deserves to be more visible.
