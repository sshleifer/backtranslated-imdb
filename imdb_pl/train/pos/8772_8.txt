Director Raoul Walsh was like Michael Bay from the '40s and years before. And I mean it in a positive way, because I'm definitely not a hateful Bayer. His films are simply a simple high-quality entertainment, like the films of Raoul Walsh in his day. <br /> <br /> "Gentleman Jim" is great entertainment. In addition to the first-class director, the cast also includes a cast of the first class, in which the main role is played by Errol Flynn, leading Raoul Walsh. <br /> <br /> It surprised me how well the boxing matches hit the screen. They used very dynamic work with the camera, which also made the boxing matches uplifting and exciting, and the fight for the championship with John L. Sullivan was the most important event. <br /> <br /> Biographies from the 1940s and earlier were, of course, very different from the biographies created today. Modern biographies often glorify their main subject and show their lives from birth to death and everything, mainly emotional aspects, between them. The "old" biopics were just the same as the films that were not based on real people from real life, which also means that the filmmakers often used the amount of creative freedom in relation to the personality of the main character and events that took place in his / her life. This film is not just a biography about the boxing legend, but it is also a nice portrait from the period when the illegal struggle to shave entered the modern era of boxing. <br /> <br /> Errol Flynn is doing a great job presenting the real life of the famous boxer James J. Corbett aka Gentleman Jim. Not many people knew about it, but Flynn did some really good acting tasks in the 1940s, of which this movie is one. Fysicaly also looks top. By the way, it also looks completely different, without its characteristic mustache in this film. The film also features great supporting actors and some great actors. <br /> <br /> A great and fun movie that's still good today. <br /> <br /> 8/10
