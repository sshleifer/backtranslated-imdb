Okay, here's the deal: if you're easily offended, you may want to stay far away from it. There are a few painfully funny moments in the movie, but I probably blushed as much as I laughed. Actually, I probably blushed more than I laughed. And if I did not blush literally outside, I blushed from the inside. If there is absolutely nothing in this movie that embarrasses you, just do not be ashamed. Regardless of whether it is a badge of honor or not, it is in the eyes of the viewer, I suppose. <br /> <br /> I will not deny that I was laughing a bit, but this is a movie I just can not give a cat recommendation because of his subject. If I said, "This movie is funny, check it out!" And some sweet little old man going to church goes to the theater and has a heart attack in one of the graphically clear sexual situations, well, that's something I do not need on my conscience . <br /> <br /> So how is it lewd? Hmm, try about 100 times worse than The Wedding Crashers. Honestly. My mom would go out during the first scene. I feel that it is my duty to at least warn you of what to expect. <br /> <br /> There is a cleverly intelligent comedy here, but this is what I expect from a man (Judd Apatow), who had both Freaks and Geeks and Undeclared. I'm joking with Michael McDonald; the only man whose hair and beard are white enough to give Kenny Rogers money for his money. Paul Rudd announces: "If I hear Ya Mo Be It's one more time I'll burn this place," it's hilarious, but it's one of those things that most of the audience will not appreciate. <br /> <br /> And when we see a quick, 3-second flashback from Steve Carrell singing to Cameo's Word Up, I laughed a good two minutes after the joke ended, while most everyone giggled, and then she forgot about it. <br /> <br /> Amazingly, despite the joke, in history there is an admirable moral. The film does not portray Carrell as a weird loser just because he is a virgin. He is really presented as a nice, admirable figure. Sure, it's a bit strange. In the end, he has a bound Asian poster, "more video games than an Asian child" and a collection of toys from the BOSS Million Dollar Man, but we never believe that there is something wrong about being a virgin. Though it may seem strange, there is some news "it's OK to wait." <br /> <br /> But man, oh man, please warn that this pushes his assessment R as much as possible. That was definitely Apatow's intention. According to him, he simply allowed some boys (especially Rogen and Malco) to improvise and talk in the way they normally speak, all to find many new ways to be dirty. If you can deal with it or talk like that, you'll love this movie. <br /> <br /> I am not a big fan of excessive curses and sexual jokes. I think that this subtle, smart humor is much more entertaining than about 200 uses of sexual discussions on the subject of f-word or fratboy. But it's me. As I mentioned, there are absolutely hysterical moments here, but you must ask yourself whether it is worth sitting in one of the most vulgar films you will probably see in the theater. I just do not know how most women will be interested in what men are saying when playing poker. Honestly, you may not want to know. If you've ever been curious why some girls think that guys are disgusting, it gives you a good idea. <br /> <br /> We're leaving - my humble, honest approach to what to expect. Be this your guide. Certainly, it should not be seen in the Sunday school class, mum, grandmamma, members of the opposite sex family, children of all ages, or anyone who is easily offended by excessive profanities or overt sexual discussion. If you saw it with any of the above, you obviously have no idea what it means to be uncomfortable.
