Due to the invention of the "collar of domestication", zombies eating meat are under control and become productive members of society; however, they do the miale tasks. Servants of the slaves deal with those who live in fenced little towns in the style of the 1950s, while unbridled zombies roam the "Wild Zone". In the city of "Willard" pre-teen K'Sun Ray (as Timmy Robinson) lives with her parents Carrie-Anne Moss and Dylan Baker (as Helen and Bill Robinson). Unfortunately, the Robinsons are the only family on their street who are not zombie owners; their new neighbors, Dna, have six. So to keep up, the Robins get the zombies Billy Connolly (as Fido). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Mr. Connolly's "collar of domestication" is damaged by the old lady's walker, and he eats her; then new and hungry zombies attack the city. Meanwhile, young Ray has become attached to Connolly (the boy and his zombie are like television "Timmy and Lassie"), and the Robinson family has difficulty cooperating with the controlling authorities "Zomcom". <br /> <br /> "Fido" does not go far enough into its intriguing "Wild Zone"; but it is a colorful, stylish and fun satirical addition to the knowledge of zombie movies. Ray and cast play well, individually; z nubile zombie Sonja Bennett (as Tammy) and owner Tim Blake Nelson (as Theopolis) the most memorable couple. Director Andrew Currie and the crew, including Rob Gray (project), Jan Kiesser (photo), Don MacDonald (music) and James Willcock (project), deservedly won prizes. <br /> <br /> ****** * Fido (2006) Andrew Currie ~ K'Sun Ray, Carrie-Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Dylan Baker
