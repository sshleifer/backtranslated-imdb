At the beginning I did not really like it, although I did. They did not include the third generation Trueba, the love between Blanca and Pedro would not be well explained, and some actors were too different from what I imagined. <br /> <br /> Later I realized that the movie was more loyal to the book, it would be five hours and it would be boring. Now I like it very much, because my favorite characters are there when I portray them. Clara really looks like an angel live, and her introduction to the story at the beginning of the movie was fantastic, loyal and short. Glenn Close to Ferula. I imagined her in this way, not only in mourning all the time. Esteban has enough. I never liked his character, and although I was interested in him, I hated him very much, especially when he hit Clara. As in the book, the last part is the most exciting and there is also a real story. <br /> <br /> The movie is really good, especially considering it was a gringo movie based on Latin America. It's amazing how many famous stars are there, do not you think?
