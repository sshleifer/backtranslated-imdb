I have not seen this movie for years, so my knowledge is a little rusty. I remember thinking that this movie is a double Braveheart movie. It is simply more realistic and has more credible characters. Ridb Roy looks like he could imagine Rob Roy, who would look like sloppy hair and beard with simple clothing. Also Liam Nesson has a Celtic look, looks like a Scotsman, and more importantly looks like Rob Roy. This comparison annoys some people, but compares it to Mel Gibson as William Wallace. Gibson supposedly plays a man whose legend has caused him to be described as a 6-foot giant, while Gibson is almost a foot shorter. The story contains a bit of romance, conspiracy and a frail history. Sounds like Braveheart? But instead of a movie that calls "freedom", freedom and nationalism, we get a film that talks about honor, love and justice. This makes the movie more interesting. Like Gladiator. The cast is fantastic, and Liam Nesson is a very strong leader in this venture. The story is great when it comes to heroism and humanity. After the scene in which Mary is raped and comes out of the burning house with the expression of real Scottish power, washing the crotch in extreme panic takes place. This is something that the Braveheart heroine would never do. In general, it is a great and almost flawless watch. Go and see it!
