Kate Beckinsale is as good, if not better than Gwyneth Paltrow, as Emma in this movie, though I really liked Gwyneth Paltrow in a different version of Emma. They are both good in different ways. Kate Beckinsale as Emma, ​​however, seems more interesting. And I liked the woman who played Harriet Smith better in this movie ... she was more credible and sentimental. There are, however, some things I like more in the Gwyneth Paltrow version, for example how the humorous side is more visible.
