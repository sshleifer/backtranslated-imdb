I saw this movie yesterday evening, after I started centuries and ages to come here in Canada (still only limited edition). It was worth waiting, and then a little. I am a very passionate reader of Margaret Laurence and I was excited to see that this novel was transformed into a movie. In fact, I liked the film more than the novel. I liked the fact that the figure of Bram Shipley was slightly less rough and it seemed that Hagar and Bram had more love stories, which made the scenes at the end of Brama's life much more moving. The loss seemed stronger. Hagar was not more like a movie than in a book, but Ellen Burstyn was a genius in the role. IT WAS HAGAR THROUGHOUT. Christine Horne was a genius and I have a lot more wonderful things to do. Her scenes with Cole Hauser were electrifying. I could continue, overall 9 * out of 10. Fantastic and can not wait to get out on DVD, must be the owner of my collection!
