Chase created a real phenomenon with The Sopranos. Amazing performances, solid writing and great music create what has probably become the best show ever. <br /> <br /> Everyone is strong, but Falco and Gandolfini deserve every inch of these Emma. Anyone who doubts it needs only a few episodes; especially from the first few seasons. James Gandolfini is absolutely sharp, absolutely frightening, and you still love him - hypnotized by him. <br /> <br /> Many people with whom I talked about The Sopranos (who have not seen him yet) say "I'm just not a fan of mafia movies / programs". Anything. Run - do not go - and take it. The same people usually love "E.R.", but I bet they do not care about hospitals ... It's not about the context.
