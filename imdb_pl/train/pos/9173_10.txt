I think it's a great version, I came here earlier to help me find the version that I should use, and I went to Jane Eyre 1983 and read the comments from users, and then I helped me get this version. I do not regret that I chose this version and you also do not. I tried to watch all the other versions and none of them matched it. There's nothing like the book and TRUST ME, if you're reading a book, you want something that fits with it. When you're looking for something real and moving after reading a book, it's difficult because you want something that will suit it. I would say that God personally led me to this version. Indicates true love for people. I would say that God's love is greater. If there's something better, I'd like to see it. but so far there is no such!
