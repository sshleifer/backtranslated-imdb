This movie hit me as a project that had many proper ingredients, but somewhere along the way they did not recover. I do not know who did it, but it has a bit of Disney's atmosphere. Although some of them are unlikely (eg When a pre-teen runs to a public office) and try to ensure that history is not taken seriously, there is a healthy dose of normality (whatever it is) to maintain balance and perspective. Acting is fine. Amazingly, the relationship between Frankie and her grandmother is convincing, but the relationship between Hazel and Frankie is a bit ... off. I wonder how hard she works to keep the balance between her best friend, grandmother and two passions: ballet and baseball. Being a baseball player himself, it was painful to watch Frankie try to stay in the boys' team, but he copes well with the struggle he faces. I read somewhere that she is not really a ballerina, but the editing in this film made her dance not only natural but also beautiful. Overall, it was a good movie about honesty and ambition, but his star Mischa Barton did not quite reach the level of realism that we saw during her appearances in "Lawn Dogs", "Lost and Delirious", and her small but shocking performance opposite Haley Joel Osment in "The 6th Sense".
