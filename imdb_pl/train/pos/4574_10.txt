Let me first say that I have Cerebral Palsy and went to this movie, expecting to have to consider the performance in the lead role. I left the theater half-convinced that they cast the role of an actor with cerebral palsy, although I knew it was not. The performances were generally excellent, with a special nod to Brenda Fricker and Hugh O'Conner (I believe that his name was) as a young Christy Brown. Christy is talented, bold, arrogant, sometimes vulgar and irritable - in other words, human. This film, along with Gaby: A True Story and documentary King Gimp, are perfect portraits of life with CP. In no way is it a full portrait, but beautiful examples of people with disabilities as human beings. Most recommended.
