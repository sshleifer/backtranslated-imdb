In the end, we get a TV series in which we'll see the talent of acting! The first episode was perfect! The script gave us a little more than usual, yes, it was still "I am not your father and I am your father and you betrayed me"! Nonsense, but the script allowed the actors to really feel and experience those real moments instead of showing how they would feel, if - as many television soaps. <br /> <br /> The work of the camera gave us a little more than usual, there were no boring shots with repeating angles for many hours, but there were no unnecessary "shots of arrows or hand-made nonsense" to add an "artistic" edge that he gave us what we wanted to see, as well as beautiful pictures of landscapes! <br /> <br /> Nothing was overly dramatized or melodramatic, they were real people in a real place, dealing with real situations, the show lacked anything in the drama and was absolutely important. It was a relief that we could be exposed to real acting and it was so nice to let our country see how talented our actors can be when they receive a real screenplay, a real chance! Thank you Tony Tilse, Sam Miller, tenth channel and the entire cast and crew - great work !! Please continue what you are doing, your efforts are very much appreciated and do not go unnoticed!
