"An Itch In Time" is one of the series of home hits that Bob Clampett chose for WB in the early 1940s, including "Horton Hatches The Egg" and "Tortoise Wins By A Hare". Steeped in a manic sense of time and exaggerated chaos, it is basically a flea saga that is busy landing in a new home and a dog whose land is broken. Because Master Elmer will give him a terrifying flea bath, if it's so much a scratch, an unlucky dog ​​is forced to endure a spiral of suffering because a house flea uses axes and power tools to clean the ground. Eventually, the little monster illuminates the fuse on the small top of high explosives, which he laid on the back of the victim! There is a huge explosion, and the unfortunate dog is covering his eyes when his back end explodes in the burning display of the fourth of July! It really has to suffer, and the dog runs away, but soon stops the action and says with a happy smile: "You better cut it because I think I like it!" For many years this perverse confession was censored, but the current prints restored the clip, thanks why viewers can enjoy it in its original, devilish glory. Still, the gag is closed, in which the cat blows out the brain after lamenting: "Now I saw everything!". It was a typical gag in WB, but has since been removed from this cartoon and several others, including `Horton '.
