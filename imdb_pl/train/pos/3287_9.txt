My friend and I chose the "Paperhouse" from a random stack of movies during our weekly trip to the Horror section - none of us heard about it, but the blurb on the box was really promising. And the movie did not disappoint, although I still probably would not call it a horror film only. <br /> <br /> 11-year-old Anna Madden draws a house and visits him in dreams. He definitely sleeps when he sees the house, but it is so real in the sense that it is almost a completely separate reality. What, in the light of later events, does not seem far from the truth. In any case, he discovers that he can add home, its contents and surroundings, simply adding a picture. <br /> <br /> When this happens, Anna is more and more ill with fever, and besides, she is more and more obsessed with the house and her drawing. In addition, she and her mother are dealing with an absent father; he has a job that takes him on long episodes, although one can get the impression that there is something more in history than this. <br /> <br /> OK, so things to draw sound nice enough - but to be honest there is something really dangerous about it. The world of dreams is incredibly surreal - for example, the house is just a gray block in the middle of an empty field. The people who made the film did a great job, making us very uncomfortable in this alternative world / continuous sleep ... <br /> <br /> One of the things that Anna adds to the house is a boy, Mark, who seems to be the same patient that her doctor talks about (I do not give it to you from the moment it seems to be the same kid). In fact, Mark can not walk because of illness; in the world of drawing Anna can not walk because she did not draw any legs. He blames himself for his real illness and tries to fix the situation, but ... everything starts to get really weird. He even draws an absent father on the drawing, with catastrophic consequences. Pieces with father are really scary. <br /> <br /> I do not want to reveal anything, so I will stop ... It seems that a lot is happening in this film. I am sure that after seeing this ball you will analyze this activity by doing death with your buddies. Is it a simple story, it seems, or are there really layers of meanings? I do not know, but it's fascinating anyway. There was "Nightmare On Elm Street" - the quality of this, at some point reality and dreams are crossing. I love such things. <br /> <br /> The only complaint is that it can end many times, but not. I am satisfied with the ending it has (some of the sensitive types may want to have Kleenex at hand!), Though it can really have many applications. In any case, it's not exactly as if it's over, but while watching and still disappearing, it's a bit nervous. <br /> <br /> Despite this, "Paperhouse" is really a good movie. It's well done, and acting - especially Charlotte Burke as Anna-- is at the highest level. Burke, who has never appeared in the movie before, is a real gem. I do not know why she has never done anything else, but it is really convincing and pleasant to watch anyway. <br /> <br /> "Paperhouse" is not exactly a horror movie, it's a kind of fantasy / suspense / something of a different type, with some definite moments of horror - but you can still watch it with your family and do not worry that your little brother or grandma will make money on blood spatter or something like that. <br /> <br /> Give him a chance, you will not regret it! Or maybe you should also read the book ...
