Deathtrap gives you a turn every step of the way, in fact its biggest problem is that there are so many twists and turns that you're never really oriented and often do not make sense, although they usually catch you by surprise. The story is very good, except for the fact that it has so many twists and turns. The script is very good with great dialogue and characters, but you can not catch the whole development because of twists and turns. The performances, especially by Caine, are amazing. The direction is very good, Sidney Lumet can manage. Visual effects are fair, but in reality most of them are in the game and are false. It turns into a lot, but it still works and it's worth watching.
