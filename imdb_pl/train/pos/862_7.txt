Carla is a secretary who is deaf without her hearing aids. When she gets overloaded at work, she can hire Paul to help her. Paul just got out of jail, and his past is not completely behind him. To say too much about a story that has many twists and turns would be a mistake. <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing about this movie for me is how the sound is used to indicate when Carla can hear and when you can not - something like a "point of hearing" (like a point of view). The early scenes that caused it, as well as the early development of Carla and Paul, were more interesting to me than the twists and turns that were later difficult to implement and / or somewhat more credible. There is also unpleasant violence. Returning to the positive side, the photos were very good. <br /> <br /> The movie is worth seeing, but maybe it is not looking. Seen at the International Film Festival in San Francisco on April 28, 2002.
