I first saw Jake Gyllenhaal in Jarhead (2005) a while ago and since then I've been watching every one of his films that appears on my radar screen. Like Clive Owen, he has an intensity (and even a bit like Owen), which just leaks out of the screen. I am sure that if he lands in some fleshy roles, he will one day break the Oscar ... <br /> <br /> This is not to slander the movie. <br /> <br /> This is a great story, with very reliable people (well, based on the early shenanigans of the author with a rocket), a great cast? Chris Cooper is always good, and Laura Dern is always on my watch list? with the right mix of humor, pathos, excitement ... and a great soundtrack with many old rock n roll songs to get a foot. <br /> <br /> But this movie had a special meaning for me: in 1957 I was the same age as Homer Hickham; just like him, I looked at the night stars to watch Sputnik, who flitted through the darkness; Like Homer, I experimented with rockets in my yard and used even the same chemicals for fuel; and like Homer, most of my trials ended with an explosive catastrophe! Jaka jest by≈Ço zabawa ... <br /> <br /> I did not achieve his great (metaphorical and physical) heights. But that's what you'll find out when you see this movie. <br /> <br /> Sure, it's a basic family movie, but it seems to be a dying race. Take some time to see it with children: everyone will laugh.
