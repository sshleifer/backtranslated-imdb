You would have to be very tired not to get carried away by this gem of the movie (and I've seen hundreds of Hindi and Bollywood films). Actors, beautiful surroundings, places and surroundings, deep emotions presented, sweet songs (especially the singing voice of Udit Narayana, my favorite) - everything was just beautiful. A human (imperfect) element was also woven to create drama and lead the story, and allow for a sincere solution. Alok Nath is such a great actor, so open to the emotions of the heroes he portrays, he almost steals the show of young stars. I highly recommend this film to anyone who loves real romances - those that go beyond superficial beauty and true love - as one of the best films out there, in Hindi or otherwise!
