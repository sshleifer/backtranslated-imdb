I've always liked this video from the video cover. In the end I bought it for a fiver for sale and a boy, what a movie. Simply stunning performance from all enclosures and so beautifully filmed. Even sometimes from a distance, so that you can barely hear what a dialogue is like if you really were in that distance, picking up pieces of the story. It's really moving, often fun and very pleasant. Not much dialogue, but it's filmed in a way that makes you feel so much. 9/10 from me. You must see.
