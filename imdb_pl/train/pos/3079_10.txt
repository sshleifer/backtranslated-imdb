While listening to the audio book, Cambpell Scott is a reader. I was so excited that I heard his voice, which caused my disappointment that "Six Degrees" was canceled. It seems that they never maintain good performances in the air long enough to capture the audience that can connect with the show's history. What a shame and shame on this network for not giving this show a chance for full seasons. It was a great performance to watch with a great cast. The network gave "Men in Trees" a second chance witch, which is also a great spectacle, but they took "Invasion" and it was something completely different to watch, not the same old motifs. Why networks can not do this well.
