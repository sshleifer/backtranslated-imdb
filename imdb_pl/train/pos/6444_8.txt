The line is of course from the Lord's Prayer - "Your will will be done on earth as it is in heaven." Sweden, and especially its northern land, is not my idea that winter temperatures in the sky of -30 degrees C are a little lower for me, but the good people who live there, no doubt think they are in their own country. <br /> <br /> The plot is known here. Recognized international musician Daniel goes through a half-career breakdown, returns to a small village in northern Sweden where he was born. Convinced by the local pastor to help in the church choir, he transforms unbelievable talent into a class act and participates in a competition in Innsbruck, Austria. There are echoes (sorry) of the players of the band "Brassed Off", models of "Calendar Girls" and dancers "Full Monty". But of course, it causes many emotional shocks, because some of the more oppressed villagers are aware of their values ​​and rebel against their oppressors. He faces the hostile husbands and the increasingly suspicious pastor, but nothing but his death will stop him. <br /> <br /> Despite the somewhat lean history, we get to know and like many characters who meet as people instead of caricatures, even though many of them are recognizable "types". I wondered if the wife's brawl was unpunished for so long? Sweden is one country in the world where such violence is quite discouraged (it was also a bit too young to be one of Daniel's youth persecutors), and a puritan pastor with a secret passion for girls' magazines was a bit of a stereotype, but miraculously realized by Niklas Falk. <br /> <br /> Michael Nyqvist is simply great as Daniel, a fragile but driven musician, and there is also cool music. I was delighted for the whole two hours, and the end of what you do with it, but it probably does not spoil, to say that Daniel achieves what he has decided to do.
