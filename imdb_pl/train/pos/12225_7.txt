I saw this movie and although I knew who the killer was from the beginning, I still liked to watch it. I recommend it to other people. There are quite a few in the Lifetime movie network. And I think that because Halloween is approaching, they can play more. So be careful if you want to watch it. I believe that Alicia Silverstone played her role very well. I really like her as an actress and person. It seems so nice and mundane. Kevin Dillon, who performed, was so for me. I'm not trying to knock him down or anything, but I believe that his brother Matt would be better able to spoil this evil serial killer. Kevin seems too sweet to me. But I think it's all right.
