I took a chance on "Hardcastle and McCormick", buying the value of the first season (release in Canada) from Amazon. When I got it, I started with the pilot and I came to it immediately. I rated it on 5 stars on Amazon and rated it 10 stars. It is simply good. What I liked were the topics of opening and closing, and of course the logo of Stephen J. Cannell at the end of each episode, but above all the relationship between the judge and Mark, because they worked together to break every case. I was so fascinated that I also bought a second season as a companion and I liked it. If you do not have this great series on the album, I think you should buy it and put it in your collection.
