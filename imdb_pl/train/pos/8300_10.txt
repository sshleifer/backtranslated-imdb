No wonder that Busey later developed a tumor in the sinus cavity, this film is also a poor decision, but I enjoyed it fully. The first 5 minutes are the most uninspiring 5 minutes in each movie; boring, bad dialouge, and then, with Spiderman, Busey screams the best worst line in any movie ever made ... "Your worst nightmare, but!" I coughed my egg a little, laughing so hard. This line resonates so well that it even exceeds the infamous Clooney line "Hi Freeze, I'm Batman". Other classic moments in which Busey is constantly nervous when people remind him that he killed his former CIA partner ... what he did by accidentally shooting him in the chest (all thanks to the flashback retrospection sequence in a super slow motion that makes Watching dry paints seem exciting). There is an ashtray to nads, punches in the face and "it was not my fault, and you know it!" Well, the material shows that he misses this bad guy and hits his friend, so ... Other flashy moments have to be his a former friend dropping a grenade to the ground to allow him to escape - a plan that denies all logic, physics and absurd. And finally, when McBain jumps out of the Thunderstorm during an intense guerrilla war and starts running and disturbs a small object, I'm almost dipping. By far Busey's best job, rent it or buy it today "but!" My vote is perfect 10 (on the coupon counter).
