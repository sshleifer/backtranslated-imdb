I had the pleasure of reading Martin Torgoff's book "Can not Find My Way Home", which is full of information about America's drug culture, from 1945-2000. This guy knows his stuff !! I considered him the perfect spokesperson for this document. I especially liked watching movie clips from the hippie era and the culture of the 70's stoners. The soundtrack was perfect. Whoever compiled it was definitely in touch with the melodies of each era. I hope they will pack them and sell them as a CD set. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in how the LSD experiments of the 1960s have forever changed American culture as we know it. There was no mention of George Jung (played by Johnny Depp in the movie "Blow"), who supposedly was responsible for the majority of marijuana and cocaine that came to this country in the 60s-80s.
