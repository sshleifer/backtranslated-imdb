I wrote comments in IMDb, but I do not do it anymore. It happens that IMDb has become enormous, and therefore subjectivity has ruined the results. What I mean? That everyone who does not like movies and has no knowledge about it, observes some nonsense (or vice versa), and if he likes it, he delivers 10, and if not, then he goes 1. This, of course, can not measure anything correct. Now for the movie. I really regret that I have provided some 10 films for very few films, because then I have to get that number 12 or 13, which is not possible. This document has something that I do not expect to see throughout my life in any other film. It is simply hypnotizing and it is not just a way of speaking; it really is. The last 25 minutes have a lot of energy, visual joy and wisdom - words spoken by the main guys - it really ... there is no matchability. I do not keep movies, it's rare in that sense, but this movie is a kind of movie that you should buy and store and watch from time to time, maybe 10 or 20 times over the years. I have nothing more to say. This is the real goal 10 for me.
