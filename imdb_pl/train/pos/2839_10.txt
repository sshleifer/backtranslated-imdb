I saw this movie at the opening show and found it perfect. <br /> <br /> New York I Love You is a real romance spin that reveals clever, funny and sometimes shocking situations around the most powerful emotions of the human race. <br /> <br /> The cast is huge, true Oceans 11 with Andy Garcia, Ethan Hawke, Shia Labouf, Natalie Portman, Bradley Cooper and others. They all stand out in one way or another. <br /> <br /> Not to mention that there is someone who is a director intertwining stories in a clever and interesting way. Brett Rattner, Shaka Kapur, Natalie Portman, I mean - WOW! This film is not romantic romanticism or romantic comedy, although it is both romantic and entertaining. He also has serious stories and notes. But in my opinion it's good. Go see it yourself and answer my review, I want to hear what others have to say.
