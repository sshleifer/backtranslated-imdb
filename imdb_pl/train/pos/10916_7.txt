The comic banter between William Powell and Jean Arthur is the culmination of this murder mystery, which has one of the most bizarre and unbelievable plots in history. Powell is probably the most satisfactory detective in the 1930s, and Arthur has a unique voice that often sounds like a series of tiny bells. They are extremely enjoyable to watch, so make the boldness of the story with a pinch of salt and just enjoy seeing it grow. Eric Blore also has a few comic phrases as Powell butler. <br /> <br /> Powell's contract with MGM contained a clause that allowed him to reject borrowing for another studio, but he wanted to work with Arthur again and he liked the script, so he willingly accepted the task. They worked together in two Paramount movies from 1929, The Canary Murder Case and The Greene Murder Case, both in the Philo Vance series.
