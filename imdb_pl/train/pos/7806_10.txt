"Cry Freedom" is not just a movie. It is a historical relationship, a heroic story and insight into the cultural background of an important event in history. Denzel Washington not only does a great job of impersonating a motivating, determined character, Steve Biko, but he also publicly announces the horrors of apartheid in South Arfrican. The story of Biko, the influential leader and his main "influential" Donald Woods, is very painful. But the ultimate success of his life can go beyond the atrocities committed in South Africa. "Cry Freedom" manages to convey to the audience an optimistic aspect of a seemingly disturbing plot. It is thanks to great films like this that the public can learn about the horrible events in history, the great leaders who have tried to end them, and how we can never allow them to happen in the future. For this reason, "Cry Freedom" is an amazing movie that everyone should see.
