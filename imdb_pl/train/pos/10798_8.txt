First I saw this jewel from Joe Sarno and I must say that after watching it I will never forget Jennifer Welles. At first I thought the movie was moving a little slower than I expected after Sarno, but when Jennifer came in, I saw her for the first time, and sat down and noticed. Her presence in this film is difficult to avoid, and evokes every scene she engages in. I saw most of Sarno's other films, as well as other films starring Jennifer Welles, starring Jennifer Welles. and Jennifer in their collective best. Sarno's direction in this adult drama film is excellent, and Jennifer has shown (figuratively and literally) the actor's prowess that makes you see it. Co-authors Rebecca Brooke (aka Mary Mendum) and Chris Jordan, both often appearing as celebrities of Welles, as well as the frequent stars of Sarno's work, prove to be credible performances as a pair of adventurous but normal housewives. This film is Sarno's classic.
