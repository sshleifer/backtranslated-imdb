Running away from life with his father (... and the waitress) who dies in an explosion, Lily Powers (Barbara Stanwyck, who just raves) breaks through the branches of the bank in the big city of Gotham. When the possessive lover murders, who was to be his next father-in-law (and the new Lily's lover), the sky is the limit for Lily, who wrote her various accounts in the journal and subtlety makes it known that the papers will receive if some money does not hit her hands. The newly appointed bank president, Courtland Trenholm (George Brent), sends Lily to Paris instead of scattering a lot of cake, but soon falls in love after meeting her in the City of Love. This makes the water in Lily's mouth, which now reaches the pedestal of success seducing a man of wealth and prestige, brings her wealth. Although circumstances make a decision that threatens its successful way of achieving these riches. Trenholm, now her husband, is accused of imprisonment and has lost a bank. I need money that Lily now has or will not have anything at all. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck is the whole movie, even though Warner Brothers is in the habit. Setting up in the pre-code era gives the filmmakers a chance to develop taboo topics, such as a sex-using woman, to succeed and how it can lead to tragedy. Good direction of Alfred E Green thanks to subtle tips in various manners and speech thanks to good action from Stanwyck's seductive performance, how to create something, without actually showing a clear act. Of course, the movie shows that money is not everything and all this jazz as love enters the heart of Lily's dead heart. This ending, in which Lily reached a wonderful metamorphosis in a lover, did not call me. She spent all this time to get onto this platform just to get in on a man who was not fundamentally different from the others she used in front of him.
