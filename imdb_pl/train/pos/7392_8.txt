I really like this movie. He has great chemistry between actors and tells a story that is quite universal, the story of the prodigal son. The aspect that I like the most was the way the bathhouse was more than just a background to the story. When my father told his son the story of his wife's family in the northern deserts of China, the element of water and bathing becomes almost a sacred ritual. The water was so rare that a simple bath had deep depth and meaning. In general, the film was very effective. There were, however, moments when he bordered "too" sweet ... bordering nausea during the recital scene in the park. But generally, I recommend this movie.
