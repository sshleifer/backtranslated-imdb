They had me from the first performance. <br /> <br /> Welcome to Trinity County. A sleepy little place resembling Mayberry with one small difference. The sheriff is really Satan. There is a spoiler. Anyway, you would not understand it in 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> Oh, but that's not all. It turns out that Satan has the son of Caleb. Some people try to maintain it, but it's a difficult battle. Sheriff Buck (Satan) knows who Caleb is and enjoys spending time with him teaching him the ways of darkness. Subtle. Insidious. He is not always angry. Most of the time he is a hero. Everyone owes him a great grace because he often sets up misfortune and saves it from him. So every time you think someone finally takes it off, one of his friends goes out of nowhere to sabotage him. <br /> <br /> In one of my favorite episodes, Lucas and Caleb were in the woods in the cabin and some of the pistols decided to rob them. Lucas used it as an excuse to teach Caleb the lessons of evil. <br /> <br /> The robber (Ted) hesitated to shoot them. Lucas told Caleb that Ted had half his conscience. If he had no conscience, he would have shot at them. If he had a real conscience, he would never become a criminal. So he started calling him Half-Ted. It was quite fun. He mocked criminals. And of course he was ten steps ahead of Half-Ted all the time. And of course he was in control of himself all the time. They actually had you favoring Satan. <br /> <br /> A very, very good performance. it was one of my favorite horrors of all time. Twilight Zone Night Stalker Circle of Fear American Gothic Supernatural <br /> <br /> It's good company.
