I loved this great movie. Farrah Fawcett played the role phenomenally and with a good heart. She plays a woman who is forced to take extreme measures to protect herself and her friends after being attacked by a stranger. After being rejected by the police, she realizes that she is alone. <br /> <br /> One day when a stranger herself breaks into her home at home and attacks her again. Not wanting to call the police or get him out, he is forced to spray him in the eyes and imprison him in the fireplace. <br /> <br /> I think there is a need to wake up to the rights of Earth. They are too easy for these criminals. It's time for more severe punishments.
