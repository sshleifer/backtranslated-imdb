This film has no history. It's just a group of guys who torture an innocent young girl to death. <br /> <br /> !!! SPOILERS !!! <br /> <br /> Here's what they do: They beat her, put her in the net and let her hang in the middle like bird's karma, turn her on the chair until she vomits, show her to loud noise, pour boiling oil, put the worms in her wounds, he will smash his hand with a blacksmith's hammer and pierce his eye with a needle. <br /> <br /> This movie was so realistic that if I did not know it was a fake, I would have thought it was a snuff movie. Although I was disgusted with this movie, I liked it a lot. It frightened me. I think it fills a goal. I give it 10/10.
