Stephen King was raised on such films. -Filicks NOT films. <br /> <br /> Films like "Jeepers Creepers" are "throwbacks" for good drive-in cinema. They are supposed to be fun, cheap and hopefully: some good fears. <br /> <br /> Anyone who is looking for a theory about the human condition should pass this trait of creation, because that's all ... everything will ever be. <br /> <br /> Stop destroying what has already been considered as junk. - Good, funny, garbage! <br /> <br /> If you liked it, I recommend: 'Jeepers Creepers'' Jeepers Creepers 2 '30 Days of the Night '' Scarecrows' ('88)' They Live '' Planet Terror '' Proof of Death 'and 'Halloween III: Season of the Witch'
