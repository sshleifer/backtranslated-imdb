Halloween Carpentera is a honest masterpiece of horror. He tells the immortal story of the fleeing psychic patient Michael Myers, who returns to his hometown on the Halloween night to persecute and kill a group of guardians. <br /> <br /> It was the first and without a doubt the best in the Halloween series. Carpenter shows great restraint in very slow tracking of history and building friendly characters; unusual for a horror movie. <br /> <br /> Even more unusual is the lack of blood and blood, and yet it remains the most horrible Halloween so far. Understand! <br /> <br /> Halloween set the film debut of Jamie Lee Curtis and was the decisive point in the career of the late great Donald Pleasance. A real classic.
