Before I watched the movie, I heard a lot about him and some of the scenes in the movie, but listening did not do it for me, so I planned to watch it and wow! Ned Beatty, Ronny Cox, Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds form an interesting group of people who are bending hell over the Cahulawassee and unhappy series of events that affect them. Character development takes some time to surround the viewer with a better understanding of each person, but in the end you know these guys as if they were your friend. Acting, dialogue is very real, as close to reality as you can do in Hollywood. Reynolds character "Lewis" was interesting as a guy who fell very hard, but under the masculine veneer lies a very soft and spoiled man (I was impressed with his performance!) Jon Voight seems to be the figure that is the center of attention, unfortunate circumstances that they seem to find him on every corner, really shape him and cast him at the end of another man (his character transformation was perfect). Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox really seem stupid lunkheads who like to joke and do not seem too serious unless they also have them, and they ... I was really amazed by the vision of director Boorman about Dickey's novel impressed. You can not go all your life without watching this movie. I give him eight out of ten stars, very impressed.
