Four macho rough guys and three sexy girls venture into distant forest areas to hunt the bear. A dapple coeducational group rages with the veteran of the Vietnam War, Jesse (terrifyingly frightening portrait of Albert Mejii Baron), who is not surprised that he does not come kindly to strangers entering his area. Director / co-author Pedro Galindo III talks about thrilling history at a steady pace, creates a lot of nervous tension and provides a lot of graphical aftertaste to brutal sets of murders (nasty slicing throat and hand shot down with the speed of a rifle as a clear, macabre backlight splatter). Capable of being cast, they all give solid performances, especially the praiseworthy works of Pedro Fernandez as a nice human Nacho, Edith Gonzalez as pugnacious Alejander, Charly Valentino as sympathetic Charly and Tono Mauri as the antagonistic moron Mauricio. What's more, both the beautiful blonde Marisol Santacruz and the charming brunette Adriana Vega provide tasty eye candy, wearing scant swimwear. Skilful, agile photos of Antonio de Andy, breathtaking forest landscapes, solid, shaking, captivating Pedro Plascenci score, well-developed characters and a pleasantly tight 76-minute working time further improve the overall sound quality of this rumble up winner hybrid horror / action.
