It's really an amazing movie. Not only does he document the eternal struggle of indigenous and civil rights people to get their just vote, but also shows the United States for their dishonesty, deceit and explicit disregard for human rights and self-determination. Chavez is portrayed as a very brave and charismatic leader struggling with what can only be characterized as a wicked elite deprived of a sense of proportion and justice. The creators of the film recorded a coup d'Ã©tat, unlike anything previously witnessed. <br /> <br /> And on the cross we can see the USA, pulling the strings again and obliterating all sense of reality. It is crucial to observe the initial stages of rebellion, which are well aware that the overthrow of the democracy we are witnessing is a tool that has long been used by successive American governments and their seemingly blinking citizens. The recording shows that it is not a manipulation of television or general film material, but an active documentation of people and their government fighting for its future. A real experience for anyone with a conscience. These Irish filmmakers deserve our gratitude. Long live Chavez. <br /> <br /> We must realize that every country must be able to choose its government and develop in a way that the majority deems appropriate. The first stage of this process is the need to learn the realities of the situation, and this document works well with it.
