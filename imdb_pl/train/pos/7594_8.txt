I do not know celebrities or contemporary Chinese teenage music - but I know a very funny movie when I see it. <br /> <br /> Kung Fu Dunk is pure Hollywood in its values ​​- it's played for laughter, for love and it's a great combination of Kung Fu and basketball. <br /> <br /> Everyone looks like they have a lot of fun, making the production value perfect - and modern China looks better than Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> The story of an abandoned orphan who grows up in a kung fu school just to be kicked out, and then discover the superstar as a basketball game (and love, etc.) is great - it's fresh, fun and extremely funny. <br /> <br /> Thanks to the great action and good dialogue, you can simply enjoy - for all ages - and for our money was one of the best family movies we've seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> Please ignore the negative reviews and give Dunk a chance - we are really happy that we did it - A good movie about sports comedies.
