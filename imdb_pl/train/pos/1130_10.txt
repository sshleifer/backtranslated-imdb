"Ifigenia" is a great achievement of Michael Cacoyannis. This masterly game is masterfully adapted to the screen and revived by a great cast. Cacoyannis reached impossible. He managed to film the Greek tragedy on the screen without losing its effectiveness and importance. He is assisted in this stellar Greek cast. Novice Tatiana Papamoschou is extremely impressive as Iphigenia. Equally impressive is Irene Papas, who, though she seems to sometimes surpass, is very realistic. A great Greek movie, beautifully adapted and directed by Michael Cacoyannis, with the perfect music of Mikis Theodorakis, perfect in every scene. <br /> <br /> P.S. Rumors say that the film lost the best Oscar in a foreign language film by only 1 voice !!!
