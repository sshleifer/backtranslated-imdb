I'm not sure how I missed it when it first came out, but I'm glad I finally saw it. <br /> <br /> This movie takes place in the nineteenth-century district of Okabasho and around it Japan. It tells the story of prostitution, caste systems and strong women in a society based on the power of the Japanese samurai code. <br /> <br /> It is a unique Akira Kurosawa! Although he died before he could make this film, his adaptation of the screenplay. His view of the Japanese world and the caste system is known and sheds light on the interaction of these systems. Characters can rotate around themselves, but the caste system remains intact when each character returns to the world to which he belongs. another way with a man who is part of her caste system ... the lowest of the low. Many reward the world of samurai over all others, but it is the inhabitants of the lower caste who can support each other and can love without limits. The samurai in this film turns out to be weak, while the classless lovers turn out to be honorable. <br /> <br /> The movie deserves a higher rating. This is a story about the survival of women in feudal Japan. At that time, men were considered survivors. Strong, while women were considered simply thoughtless and weak. This film highlights the strength of Japanese women and how they did what they had to survive, and how their strength enabled Japanese culture to continue. <br /> <br /> I recommend "The Sea is Watching" to everyone who is a fan of Akira Kurosawa and even if he is not a fan. It is a beautiful, silent and soul-supporting film that can be admired in every movie collection.
