I went to this, expecting me not to like it; I came to the conclusion that it would be terribly worthy and sincere, or rather stupid and boring. <br /> <br /> It's actually a lot better, and I really enjoyed it. I do not know much about Queen Victoria, except what is best known - married to Albert, who died young and mourned for him. Seeing the circumstances in which she grew up was fascinating; in fact I wanted to see more history and I imagine that at some point we can see the sequel. <br /> <br /> Visually, the movie is stunning. Sets and costumes are incredibly rich, without being too flashy and not on top. Acting is at the highest level from everyone involved. <br /> <br /> In a word, it was great!
