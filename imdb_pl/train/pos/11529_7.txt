As a biographical film "The Lady With Red Hair" (the story of how the director / producer / playwright David Belasco transformed the famous social divorced Leslie Carter into an international stage star) is certainly not in the league with this other Warner biographical film like vintage "Yankee Doodle Dandy" (what is it?), But "Lady" is a movie in itself - and has many features in common with the classic Cagney. <br /> <br /> Like "Yankee Doodle Dandy", "The Lady With Red Hair" is full of old show-business taste. (Both films include, among others, exquisite theatrical theater sequences and inevitable scenes set behind the scenes and in the offices of theater managers.) In addition, in "Lady", as in Cohan's biography, the supporting cast consists of well-known and beloved actors of the period, everyone doing the highest-class work that we remember. <br /> <br /> Do I have to add that again, like "Yankee Doodle Dandy", "The Lady With Red Hair" does not allow the truth to tell a good story? But, like "Dandy", "Pani" will manage - great! - to convey the essence of your giant personality from show-business-giant. Everyone knows that Cagney has been limiting Cohan all the time in his brilliant and tender performance in "Yankee Doodle Dandy" - but few viewers realize that Claude Rains performed a similar service for David Belasco in "The Lady With Red Hair" - and he did it's with a swing that almost equals Cagney's. <br /> <br /> Rains-as-Belasco perfectly captures this legendary galvanic personality of the showman in all its great glory. Rains gives an incredibly pleasant, perfectly observed and extremely faithful performance, as it used to be called "The Wizard". To watch Claude Rains in action (looking at every shot as if he had a good time!) In "The Lady With Red Hair", we'll see how David Belasco comes alive in the movie, as if he could not wait to shake up once again Main Stem. <br /> <br />
