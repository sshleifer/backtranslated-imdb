Insisting that the inspiring spirit of Martin Luther King lies not only in American civil liberties, but in the hearts and minds of people around the world, Danish helmer Niels Arden Oplev transfers this belief to a Danish gymnasium in 1969. More specifically, he goes to the crusade of a young boy named Frits (Janus Dissing Rathke) against his oppressively stiff and damn offensive director Svendsen (Bent Mejding). Made from true history, performances are done with confidence, and a refreshing command over its various characters makes it involved. The battle of ideology between the 13-year-old and insane discipline gives way to innate humor, but awkward changes in mood, despite keeping it cynical in the same spirit as the "Dead Poets Society" more than "Matilda." He walks along the familiar path, but the continuous and precise service of the young hero, including a personal story that complements Fritsa as a young boy who becomes a young man, manages to raise the film to a thrilling family movie with his nose straight for money.
