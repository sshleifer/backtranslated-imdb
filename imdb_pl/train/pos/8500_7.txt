Surprised to see the rather low score of this movie. I just saw this movie for the first time in 10 years and I remembered why I like it. <br /> <br /> Go back with me, children, until Michael Keaton was a simple comedian, and you can find joy in this movie. It's a delicate comedy - in which Ron Howard specializes - but if it is, you should check it out. Keaton's key charm is suitable for this project. <br /> <br /> "Gung Ho" is a bit outdated, because it takes place in the last stage of the world of the pre-global economy, when it still had meaning. The country where the business was operating. This means that it provides laughter and a lesson about how people can learn from each other, with great benefit. <br /> <br /> You can watch this movie and enjoy it without remembering one scene you particularly liked, but that's because the whole movie provides a slow but steady stream of laughter. It's like I.V. drip. And I mean it in a good way.
