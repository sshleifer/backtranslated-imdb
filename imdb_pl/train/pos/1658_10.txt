If you saw this movie, you were in Puerto Rico. I've lived in Puerto Rico all my life and I have to be ashamed to admit that we (PR) are now living in real chaos, drugs are the main reason for the shootings and killings we have almost every day. These people will shoot everyone, always and everywhere, and many innocent lives have died because of it. We no longer feel safe, and besides, our so-called "justice" is no longer moved by truth and equity, but by money, influence and power. "Ladrones y Mentirosos" is based on real, regrettable facts and really presents the three main problems of Puerto Rico: drug-related killings, money and power manipulating our courtrooms, and innocent people and children are corrupt and even die because of it. Ricardo and his wife Poli, with their true story and award-winning direction (**), were brave enough to portray it all so badly: Puerto Rico is a beautiful and friendly country, living a nightmare that does not end !!! ** Recently, they won the "Copper Wing Award" for Best Director in the World Cinema Competition at the Phoenix Film Festival in 2006.
