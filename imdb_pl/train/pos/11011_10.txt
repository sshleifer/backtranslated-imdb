The big money producer at RKO Radio, Bombardier, plays the role of Pat O'Brien and Randolph Scott as trainers in the school of bomber pilots. O'Brien and Scott argue about teaching methods while their students compete for Anne Shirley's feelings. O'Brien's methods work well during a Tokyo bombing raid. Scott and his crew are captured and tortured by the Japanese, but mortally wounded Scott manages to set a gas truck on fire, providing a perfect target for his bombardiers. Stylistically Bombardier is one of the most schizophrenic war movies, with moments of subtle emotion (death of Eddie Albert) alternating with the scenes of the funny melodrama "Yellow Danger" (the Japanese literally hiss through their teeth, torturing helpless Americans). Although today, nothing can be done about it, Bombardier remains a fun propaganda venture (the film is sometimes mistakenly mentioned as the debut of Robert Ryan, who appeared in front of the cameras since 1940. <br /> <br /> Anyone interested in obtaining a copy of this film, please contact us at: iamaseal2@yahoo.com
