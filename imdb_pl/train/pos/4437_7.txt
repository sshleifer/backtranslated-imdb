This police procedure is not worse than many other eras and better than a few others. Of course, he follows "Dragnet" and "Naked City" but he appears as a nice programmer. The best thing is without the ornaments that the world has long ago passed ... lower-class New York in the late 40's and early 50's. Here he is in all his glorious glory, from old school tattoo shops to cheap hotels and greasy spoons. These old police movies are like traveling to a bygone era and very bittersweet for anyone who does not like disinfected, soulless landscapes of today. <br /> <br /> Also intriguing is the emphasis on the scientific aspect of solving crime problems ... in this case, the murder of a tattooed woman found in an abandoned car. Our main characters, Detectives Tobin and Corrigan, do the work with their feet, but without the tedious and tedious efforts of "laboratory boys", they will not get anywhere. Although the technology is not in the same league, the cops use the stubborn persistence of C.S.I. a researcher to track down their man. <br /> <br /> The way some reviewers wrote about this movie, he thinks it would be directed by Ed Wood and acted by the extras of his films. What a buzz! I liked John Miles when a gangster former sea soldier turned into a policeman Tobin ... he had a cheerful, happy approach to the role, which is a welcome change on the part of ordinary histrionics with the stone faces of most film cops of that period. Patricia Barry is adorable and adorable like his dashing girlfriend who helps solve the crime. Walter Kinsella is stuffy and bored as a senior Corrigan detective. I rather liked the chemistry of these two, and this caused something a bit different than the "Dragnet" type of robot. <br /> <br /> The mystery itself is not too deep, and the final pursuit and shooting will certainly not be considered the classics of crime movies, but in a short time the "Tattooed Alien" was more interested in me than I was.
