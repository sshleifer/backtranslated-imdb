Because musicals are not just out of fashion and are incredibly expensive to play without all the talent needed to make a deal in the studio, I doubt if we'll ever get the real story of Enrico Caruso. <br /> <br /> But if everything else was in place, it was no coincidence that no Hollywood studio took up the task until Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer signed a contract with Mario Lanza. No one else would be able to do it, I doubt if it will ever be tested again. <br /> <br /> And why should it. I think that Enrico Caruso himself would be pleased with how his singing was presented on the screen. His tenor voice was his life, his reason for being on earth. <br /> <br /> The statement that his life was treated as freedom is to be modest. Caruso, like the man who introduced him, was a man of great appetite, though much more disciplined. He had many relationships with several women and he bore two illegitimate sons who are not in this film. <br /> <br /> His contribution to the recording industry is treated almost like reflection. Once he showed up in the recording studio late in life. In fact, he started recording at the turn of the last century and together with Irish tenor John McCormack for RCA, Victor made the recording industry become what it became. <br /> <br /> When Caruso and McCormack were at their tops, you had to virtually inherit a ticket to see how one of them performs live. But many immigrants from Italy and Ireland had a phonograph and a record of three or three of them. That's why they both became legends, which they are. <br /> <br /> The movie has several beautifully arranged operas by Mario Lanza, the taste of what he could have had if Caruso had his opera career. Grand Caruso won the Oscar for sound recording and received nominations for costumes and stage design. <br /> <br /> Mario helped to popularize the film thanks to the album Red RCA with The Great Caruso. Unfortunately, due to contractual obligations, we failed to get a real cast album with Ann Blyth, Dorothy Kirsten and Jarmila Novotna. <br /> <br /> Although Blyth sang it in the movie, Lanza had a big hit The Most Beautiful Night of the Year, which helps popularize The Great Caruso. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for Enrico Caruso's life, this is not it. If you're looking for a great singing artist at the peak of your career, you should not miss The Great Caruso.
