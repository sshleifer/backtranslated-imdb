Well, this movie was probably one of the funniest scary movies I've ever seen. The effects are so bad that you just have to laugh, and the acting, let's say there is no gibson. But Gary Browning, who plays a policeman, is so fucking bad, he's good. I do not know how, but he makes this movie 10th. You have to see it if your movies in horror / slashach cause its bloody and funny. The killer movie.
