Comedy LAUREL & HARDY. Short. The boys come to sweep the chimneys in Professor Noodle's house, a mad scientist who has just perfected his rejuvenating serum. Stan and Ollie are continuing their DIRTY WORK, spreading the destruction at home and on the roof. Then the professor wants to try his new elixir ... <br /> <br /> A very funny little movie. The ending is a bit violent, but most of the slapstick leading to it is great. The will of Stan and Ollie on the opposite ends of the chimney is particularly good. It's Lucien Littlefield as a professor.
