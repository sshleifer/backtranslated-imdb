"Chinese Ghost Story" is one of the most amazing Hong Kong movies I've ever seen. It's a great mix of fantasy, comedy, romance, horror and martial arts. The film has great visuals and amazing fights. the scene between Wu Ma and the language of the tree demon. Really original and refreshing movie and other good Embalmer's recommendation.
