<br /> <br /> In 1970, after a five-year absence, Kurosawa made his first film in color. Dodes Ka-Den is a film that focuses on the many interwoven stories that take place in a small Tokyo slums. <br /> <br /> The title comes from the sound that makes the mentally retarded boy doing as he imagines that runs the train. Slowly we get to know more people in a small community, two drunks who trade their wives, because they are not happy with those who have. An old man who is the center of the city who helps a burglar who tries to rob him. A very poor father and son who can not afford a house, so they imagine one. At the end of the film, the stories make a full circle, some turn out happy, others sad. <br /> <br /> Since it was Kurosawa's first color film, you can see that it will use it to your advantage and it shows. Maybe too much. This film goes in many different directions and it is difficult to settle in it. But do not get me wrong, Ka-Den Dodes may not be the best Kurosawa, but coming from the greatest director of all time is much better than 99% of today's movies.
