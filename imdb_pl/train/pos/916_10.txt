My comments on VIVAH: - This is a lovely, idealistic love story with Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao. The film takes us back to small pleasures, such as the families of the bride and groom sleeping on the floor, games together, their friendly banter and mutual respect. Vivah talks about the sanctity of marriage and the importance of engagement between two people. Yes, the central affair is naively visualized. But the insidious romantic moments between the wife and their stubborn resistance to contemporary courtship games make you want idealism. The film predictably ends with a marriage and the bridegroom tells his new bride, who suffers from burns: "Come, let me make your dressing" <br /> <br /> VIVAH - presents many good things - beauty an arranged marriage, the beauty of Indian culture, the beauty of an Indian woman, and finally a good IDEALISM of married couples waiting for a wedding ... playing with rules! Simple but beautiful; Such a simple story .... without a story ... not a villain - as in the case of most of Sooraj Barjatya's films. Sooraj sir returns to what he does BEST. He made a film with a FULL CONVENTION. It is a very sweet film - which teaches the present generation many good things about organized marriage and the relationship of two families. I think AMRITA RAO - looks very good and works very well. He has most of the good scenes - although I thought that the last half hour was completely for Shahid Kapura - who gives incredibly restrained performance for the change. I also liked the operation of all others, for example. Choti ie Amrita Prakash, Alok Nath, Anupam Kher, brother and sister Shahida. It seemed almost as real and recognizable as it could. Sooraj sir has another great family movie after Maine Pyar Kiya, HAHK & Hum Saath Saath Hain. The chemistry between Shahid and Amrita is AMAZING. <br /> <br /> Things like sanctity in marriage / marriage, avoiding courtship, mutual respect, care and space, waiting for the formal marriage, prayer / dedication for Ur Beloved - all these and other will be shown in Vivah. There is still a good audience who goes and enjoys this movie. Some people / audiences are already excited to see they are thinking about an arranged marriage :) It's a success if you ask me about it. it seems that AMRITA RAO - our actress from Vivah {Result of a nice performance} received the prestigious DADSAHEB PHALKE award for 2006 !! Hats for her for this achievement Chalo, although Vivah, Shahid or Amrita did not get any awards for film and other prizes; @ the least is the message for CHEER o !! Congratulations to AMRITA RAO - for showing us the visual Indian Bride-to-be in the purest form and Of Course to Sooraj Barjatya for the best performance :) Shud do not forget Shahid Kapur and all others who make VIVAH sweet and legendary today! ! Imagine sharing the same pedestal as the legendary Dilip Kumar .......... It does not matter the achievement !! Congratulations to Amrita Rao - for taking her career to another level with this award ... Personally I feel - she should only make movies with Shahid Kapuru !! They form a sweet couple, and their chemistry on the screen reminds me {SRK-Kajol} or {Aamir Khan and Juhi Chawla} ................. <br /> <br /> Several points I noticed, a few elements: - # 1 If you notice carefully, Amrita Rao looks so good because she always has traditional dresses on. It gives every Indian essence - in this movie !! Perfect fit # 2 Shahid Kapur is like most of us - not quite ready for a marriage or an early marriage .... but PREM listens carefully to the conversations step by step provided by his DAD - having full faith in Anupama Khera. Ultimately, "Honesty" and "Trust" are keywords that reflect in their first conversation with Amrita. Most people would think that such a first meeting with a stranger for a limited time is never enough to judge a person. But according to what I saw in this film, I have a feeling - that two people who are created for themselves can also join in the first meeting, possible! # 3 Throughout the movie - there are essentially 4 or 5 sequences in which Shahid and Amrita are together - or shown to be together. Unlike other romantic / wedding movies in which Heroine and Heroine always sing / dance or now - they do cheap things. But the beauty of each of these 5 sequences: - is characterized by restraint, innocence and respect for the other! # 4 I really liked the relationship between Chacha Alok NATH and Amrita Rao. These films should emphasize the indifference shown to daughters / girls in some parts of India. # 5 Romantic scenes between leaden steam are very nicely curly - no cheap scenes, songs are beautifully presented !! Words such as "Jal", "praarthana" e.t.c. they will be fashionable words for all the girls who liked this movie :) Personally, I really like a lot of dialogues in this movie. # 6 Finally, but not least - the entire Hospital Scene, in which Shahid places "sindhoor" on Amric while she is fighting for Life - is great. These dialogues between the couple are so moving and you feel LOVE / I-cant-do-without-U; It feels like a hat !!! <br /> <br /> *** In many respects, VIVAH reminded me Maine Pyar Kiya, DDLJ, Qayamat Se Qayamat Yes, Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam - for the freshness / screen chemistry of the pair LEAD:) :) *** IF YOU ASK ME: - With films such as Rang De Basanti, Lage Raho Munnabhai, DOR, CORPORATE and Kabul Express, VIVAH is one of the best films made in 2006. watching / business than Dhoom2 or Fanaa or Golmaal or all these films with interlace time / rozmyte / stylish / nonsense !!
