If you're a fan, you'll probably like it. If you do not know who Misty Mundae, Darian Caine, Ruby LaRocca or Seduction Cinema is, this is not a movie you can start with. It's very sweet, stupid, girls are hot and it's great to watch. Until the end of the 45-minute movie there is no sex, but the score is tacky and the plot is not boring. Misty Mundae has a bad look in this movie, and her hair is in awkward braids, so it's not as hot as it is in others. But her panties are quite cute (just see a movie so that it does not sound really strange). If you like this, you'll probably like "That 70's Girl", "Vampire Vixens" or "Erotic Survivor" (slightly more sexual graphics). If you prefer to watch Misty or Esmerelda in less sexual, more horror / based on exploitation (but lower budgets) movies, check out the Factory 2000 website.
