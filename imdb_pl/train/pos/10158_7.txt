Johnny and June Carter Cash funded this film, which is a traditional depiction of the history of the Gospel. The music is great, you have a real picture of what the world of Jesus looked like (I was also there), and June enters the role of Maria Magdalena with passion. The Cash narration is good too. <br /> <br /> Ale .... <br /> <br /> 1. The actor who played Jesus was unsuccessful. 2. There is no advantage in history, as Cash places in his music based on faith. 3. Because he is indomitable, I doubt if we will see it again widely disseminated. <br /> <br /> I would like to buy a CD. <br /> <br /> Tom Paine Texas, USA
