Wizards of the Lost Kingdom is a film about a young prince (Szymon), who was banished from his kingdom due to the death of his father (king) by a banal "bad adviser". This movie is about Simon's adventures. Special effects, plot, acting and generally everything in this film is BAD. However, it is so bad that it's fun. You will watch this movie simply because it is so bad that it is funny and, as another film reviewer said, it's so bad that it's good.
