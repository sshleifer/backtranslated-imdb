Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves are back when two drugs from San Dimas, which will be sent on the next journey of life, as someone from the future, feel exactly the opposite of the first movie. <br /> <br /> The only difference is that their journey is "somewhere" between Heaven and Hell and ends with both. When they meet the Grim Reaper, they have a chance to live after life to play it, to have a chance to return and stop the two evil robots from ruining their future. In addition to playing roles that have ... improved, they also play (and enliven some additional transactions) some classic games (I even have an original copy of Battleship in the closet). <br /> <br /> The reason why I liked this movie better than the original is that it concerns "how it can be" instead of "what was". Without breaking the film, I can not give you any more information about it (I think you'll just have to watch it and decide for yourself! 8 out of 10 stars.
