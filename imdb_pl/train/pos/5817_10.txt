If you want to remember MJ, this is a good place to start. This movie contains sweet melodies, MJ as a robot and a crazy, confused story. I remember many nights giving this great feature film in college, and wondering about the amazing wonders of who decided on the green light of this funny piece. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of singing. A lot of dancing. There is a lot of singing during the dance. MJ kills him as you would expect. But this movie has much more. It is claymation. There are fat children (clay). There is an anthropomorphic rabbit that Michael Jackson must fight in a dance (of course also in clay). There is also Joe Pesci (not from clay). <br /> <br /> RIP- we love you, Michael! It's a sad day for all of us.
