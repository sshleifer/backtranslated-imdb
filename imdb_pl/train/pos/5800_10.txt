THIS IS MY FULLEST FAVORITE FILM IN THE WORLD !!!!! I liked it when I was 4 and I still enjoy it at the age of 16 !! This is an absolute masterpiece! Without it, no video collection is complete !!! I'm happy every second of this movie and not only makes the movie have a special, special experience, but it also sends great news for the audience in the audience who may sound weird, but in reality the movie is really COOL! Although Michael Jackson is now in several movies, people still do not see him as an actor. In fact, he is the most talented actor I know! He is so talented! He is amazing !!! MOONWALKER IS VISITING !!!!!!
