Richard Brooks' excellent film from 1967 about the novel Truman Capote IN COLD BLOOD is a great addition to Oscar Philip Seymour Hoffman in 2005. They really have fun (try on separate nights). It's amazing that movies that have gone 38 years are so good. These two really reinforce each other. Although different actors play the roles of the killers Perry Smith and Dick Hickock, these two pieces blend well. Only part of the writer (played by Paul Stewart) in Brooks' films is weaker because they give it a different name than Capote. I suggest you first look at CAPOTE and then IN COLD BLOOD. It gives you a powerful experience!
