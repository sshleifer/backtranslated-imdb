Gundam Wing is a good anime for me. A bit slow movement (especially in the middle of the series), but above all, pleasantly. Before anyone jumps on my mailbox and calls me "winger", I admit that I watched all the original Gundam, Gundam 0080 and 0083, 08. MS team and Gundam SEED. <br /> <br /> I admit that there were a few problems with telling stories, and some characters may seem like a "rip-off" (eg, Marquis Zechs on the original Char Gundama), but this is an alternative show of the universe based on the original series, yes like SEED. <br /> <br /> If you want to see this series, make sure you watch the original Gundam first and then know that you are watching the AU series.
