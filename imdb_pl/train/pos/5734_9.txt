I consider myself a great admirer of David Lynch's works because he provides viewers with absolutely unique films with typical "Lynch elements". Seeing most of his work, I naively thought I could predict Lynch's next step. I was not right. Dumbland is something I could never imagine under the name David Lynch. However, after recovering from the first shock, I began to contemplate this extremely primitive main character and drew the conclusion that all the absurdities, cruelty, brutality and disgust presented here reflect the fragments of reality, stressing them distorting. There are things in our lives that we hardly ever emphasize because they are either disgusting or terrible, but they surround us, so I dare say that Dumbland focuses on these pieces. This is not a movie you can enjoy, although sometimes you laugh at a strange, warped sense of humor, it is a lively reflection on all things that we do not really notice, with their simplicity, disease and absurdity. Take it as it is, you do not have to like it. It simply exists. And finally, if you're careful enough, you'll also find elements that are typical of Lynch. I recommend for people tolerant !!!
