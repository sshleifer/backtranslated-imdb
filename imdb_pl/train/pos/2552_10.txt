Fatal Error is a really cool movie! Robert Wagner, Antonio Sabato Jr., Janine Turner, Jason Schombing, Malcolm Stewart and David Lewis are in the film. The cast of the film worked very well. Robert Wagner played his role well. The relationship between Saboto Jr. and the Turner was nice. There may be a big age difference, but they're a special couple. The two actors really worked well together. The music in the film is very good for Ron Ramin and fits the film very well. There are a few things that happen in a movie that you do not know what's going on and what's going to happen, and this movie lets you go from beginning to end. If you like Robert Wagner, Antonio Sabato Jr. and Janine Turner, watch this wonderful movie!
