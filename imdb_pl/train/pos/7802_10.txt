I was electrified when I saw it for the first time in 1983 or 1984. Steven Biko is in the middle of the movie, but the resonance of his courage and wisdom is not forgotten. I did not succeed in ending in South Africa in 1993. It is also a story about friendship and loyalty. When I was in South Africa and heard the audience singing Nkosi Sikelel and Afrika in a Natal dance recital, my hair stood at its end. You can learn a lot from this story for all people.
