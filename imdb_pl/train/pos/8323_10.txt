"Some nonsense is cared for by the wisest people from time to time." <br /> <br /> If you're too smart to watch this movie, then you are too smart to live. <br /> <br /> A wonderful romp, a wonderful message, a piece from the era made with attention to detail. <br /> <br /> Walter Matthau, Meg Ryan, Tim Robbins - and others <br /> Rent it, sit down, relax, take it, smile a little. Have fun. <br /> <br /> Then, thank you.
