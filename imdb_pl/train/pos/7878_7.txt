As the story in my family says, my dad, Milton Raskin, played the piano for Dorsey. After joining Sinatra to the band, my dad practiced with him for many hours. Then, at some point, my dad told Sinatra that it is really good to be associated with such a small group (band) and that he should set out on his own. At that time, Sinatra had enough credits to do it! Dorsey never forgave my dad, and the rest, as they say, is history. <br /> <br /> I have a few photos and records about it, like Berkley University in California. <br /> <br /> I've seen almost every Sinatra movie more times than I'd like to say and its films will never get old. . . Thank you, Frank
