It was a great 2-part episode, although I've never seen an older one, I never thought that the doctor would fight anything that is paranormal, of course terrestrial, but not paranormal. <br /> <br /> This episode brings the things that we fear the most and how we humans would fight with real live evil in a futuristic time when most chances say it would be impossible. <br /> <br /> Because it's a family movie I'm surprised that they brought some things, like fear and faith, especially if they're also going to entertain the American audience. But who cares about what the Yankees say, we rock! Doctor Who showed the potential since then from the first episode of the new series in 2005, initially so harmless to the frightening, from funny to serious, from light to dark. I hope that many old fans will one day say, "The old doctor who has returned." <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10
