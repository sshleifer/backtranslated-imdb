The Sunshine Boys is one of my favorite movies. I saw her for the first time when it was a Christmas attraction at Radio City Music Hall, when she first appeared and liked her since then. I ended up seeing him six times in cinemas, and if I played today, I went to see him again. <br /> <br /> A lot of reviews here mentioned great lead performances. Matthau was brilliant, but he had the misfortune to be nominated for an Oscar, won by Jack Nicholson, Randall P. MacMurphy in the "Cuckoo Nest." Burns won, although Richard Benjiman at least deserved to be nominated. Even the smallest roles were played to perfection, such as the interrogation of Fritz Feld for potato chips. <br /> <br /> Which brings me to the reason why I was reviewing this movie, the direction of Herbert Ross, a very underestimated. Ross, who previously brought two people to "The Owl And The Pussycat" on the screen and makes a full movie of it, does it again. He opens performances without making them look like a scenic photo game. <br /> <br /> Here we are 20 minutes before the film, before we get to the stage that opens the play, where Ben Clark comes to his uncle and tells him about a special comedy. play for the first twenty minutes, the sequence itself is completely new. A few years ago I saw a broadway revival of the game with Jacek Klugman and Tony Randall, which was great. But I think Ross and the screenwriter, playwright Simon have improved this. It's just a great movie.
