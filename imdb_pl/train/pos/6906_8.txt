I liked the movie. It was fun, sweet, silly and funny. We had a great cast and I was really beaten by some critics for reasons I really do not understand. No, it was not "The Grapes of Wrath" or "Casablanca" or even "Moonstruck", but it was a nice movie. <br /> <br /> Julia played the psychotic "man for a man". This story is a bit stupid, but it's not a drama, people. I happened to see a movie review, probably the only good one I got, and then I ran into it one evening, looking for a movie. I never heard him stink until I saw him and I'm glad I saw it. Eventually, I bought a VHS tape on a bargain pile and watch it several times a year.
