Sweet romantic drama / comedy about Stewarcie and Sullavanie, writing love letters to each other, not knowing who the other is. Naturally, they work together and can not stand. You can guess the rest. It is beautifully played by the entire cast (especially Sullavan, Stewart and Frank Morgan), has a witty, intelligent script and looks absolutely stunning. Takes place in Budapest and was filmed in Hollywood, but I believed that I see Budapest! Everything looks so perfect and dreams. One of a kind movie. Do not miss it!
