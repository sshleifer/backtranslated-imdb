Cinderella is a beautiful movie, of course with beautiful songs. In fact, it is one of the best films of the 1950s. <br /> <br /> I think all characters are portrayed amazingly. One can see the cruelty of Cinderella's half-sister and her stepmother, Cinderella's sweetness. Mice are also fun and sweet. <br /> <br /> I think it changed the story a bit, but I think it's the best. It's such a nice movie and I do not think anyone can resist it deeply. <br /> <br /> I give him 8/10. I do not think it's the best Disney movie. But it is certainly a real classic.
