Extraordinary Rosemary Forsyth is the main reason to see this movie. Why has it never become a bigger store, it will never be known. But he's unique and he steals every scene he's in. Garson Kanin has directed this piece of fluff, and the cast is first-rate, especially Robert Drivas and Brenda Vaccaro. "9" from "10."
