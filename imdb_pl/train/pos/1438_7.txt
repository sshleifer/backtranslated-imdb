Full marks for Pacino's speech about the dead child's coffin; Mark Antony Shakespeare would be embarrassed! They are rich and intelligent and worth your time if you like movies with good scripts. I believe that narrative narration is developing quite well, up to the voice in the postscript. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to talk about in this movie; even John Cusack did better than this. Interestingly, the film is very male oriented - women are just add-ons.
