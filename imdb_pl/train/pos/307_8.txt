"They All Laughed" is one of those small movies that I always recommend to friends looking for something unusual. It is firmly rooted in the romance traditions of the past, but it seems more contemporary. Even the decidedly early atmosphere of the 80s is not too big. Bogdanovich wisely maintains the whole enterprise so light that reality never brings him down to earth. But having said that, this sweet movie absolutely relies on actors to continue it, and "TAL" is blessed with a cast of dreams who understand the demands of this kind of story. It is a film that would not have remained in memory for a long time had it not been for the small moments provided by a great cast: Colleen Camp's simultaneous shouting of orders from John Ritter and her dog; Blaine Novak releases all the hair from under the hat; especially the moment Dorothy Stratten falls in love with John Ritterie and says, "How ... strange." It's a piece of fluff that you do not want to put too much for fear of crushing, but it certainly leaves a light heart and a smile on your face.
