The hit of John Van Druten on Broadway appears on the screen with the maximum power of the star in this romantic fantasy of a modern witch who cheats a successful publisher in Manhattan. James Stewart can get the highest bills, but Kim Novak steals the show as one of the most alluring witches who ever cast a spell on the movie screen. Lead evaporation is actually one of the few weaknesses of the film: gray Stewart seems to be a bit old for the role, and though it is easy to understand why he falls to Novak, it is a little harder to understand what she is attractive to him because they seem unmatched to temperament and perspectives. (This is one of the funny ideas that witches and wizards are portrayed as beatniks and bohemians from Greenwich Village). Interestingly, Stewart-Novak evaporation would generate much more heat in the "Vertigo" released the same year as the movie, but then "Vertigo" had a fascinating history of tension and the benefits of the direction of Alfred Hitchcock. <br /> <br /> The comic moments of the film are mostly delivered by a star cast, including the young Jack Lemmon (as the wizard of Brother Kim), Elsa Lanchester (their ditzy aunt) and Ernie Kovacs (!) as a stunned writer. Hermione Gingold even appears in a funny episode as a kind of Grand Witch. In this movie - jokes, love affairs and a great cast - there are many things that can be distracted from the charming Miss Novak. I've seen this movie half a dozen times and I can never.
