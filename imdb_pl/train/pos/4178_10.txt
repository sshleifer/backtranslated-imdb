This film is a true reflection of the Australian resourcefulness that was required for this country to become what it has been in the last 200 years. Not pompous like the British, not Gung-Ho like Americans. If one of these countries tried what the crew did, it would fail. Or because of ignorance about the British part, or too much faith in the higher firepower on the American side. "Real" Australians (ie Non-importers) are the only ones who can lead the way in contemporary armed conflicts because they had to improvise most of their adult lives. Just look at examples such as Gallipoli; Paschendale; Tobruk; New Guinea and Vietnam.
