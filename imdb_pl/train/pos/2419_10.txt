In addition to Planes, Trains and Automobiles and Uncle Buck, this is the funniest movie by John Candy. When he is hypnotized with a playing card (similar to the Manchurian Candidate) and becomes a horny guy who does not know what he is talking about, he makes two very memorable quotes (both of which concern male anatomy). The love scene with foodstuffs must be visible, it can not be described. <br /> <br />
