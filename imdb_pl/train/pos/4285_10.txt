This "tragicomedy" written by the famous Serbian theater / film writer Dusan Kovacevic is probably one of the best films in the history of comedy. And yet his appearance in theatrical art transformed into a feature film has nothing to do with its value. A masterpiece that can not be missed (preferably with subtitles, not dubbed). <br /> <br /> In an old bus going to the capital of Belgrade, the coming war decides about the behavior of passengers. Two Gypsy musicians sing about their unhappy life, but also anticipate the upcoming tragedy; their singing divides and connects stages in this extraordinary road movie (true Kostic brothers are amateur actors, but together with Stanojlo Milinkovic as a farmer who plowed the road, he gives a real performance). <br /> <br /> The specter of the characters gives a great picture of the society facing the war, an insight into the collective person of the nation: everyone realizes that the war is about to begin, but they try to live their own lives as best they can, hoping that ignorance can prevent a tragedy. Using a simple language of film, director Slobodan Sijan paints the image of a society torn apart by the previous war (World War I), but also highlights personal portraits successfully: singer's provincialism, lack of experience of newlyweds, seriousness of the veteran of the Great War who is on his way to visit his recently a son who has been picked up and grim prophecies from a man who seems to be a German spy. <br /> <br /> Brilliant in his narrative, with a memorable soundtrack (especially Gispsy songs) and adapted atmosphere, well photographed and edited this feature (Sijan's feature debut) was just an introduction to a series of bittersweet comedies, which they will define the Serbian cinematography of the 1980s: "Maratonci trce pocasni krug", "Kako sam Sistematski unisten from the idiot" and favorite by my second director "Davitelj protiv davitelja").
