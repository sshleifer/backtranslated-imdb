Director Samuel Fuller makes up a brilliant visual layout: a cocky pickpocket unknowingly lifts the microfilm from a woman's purse; it turns out that he is a courier of communists, and now she and the grifter are being watched by the police. The formula of Noir's movie is all his glory - before the ingredients became clich√©s - including coastal locations, floozy, saxophones on the soundtrack and infernal fistfight. The performances of Richard Widmark and Jean Peters are in place, and the intelligent, sharp script is quite colorful. Fantastic Thelma Ritter received an Oscar nomination for her role as a knockout as a "professional stool". Exciting, romantic, hard as nails. *** with ****
