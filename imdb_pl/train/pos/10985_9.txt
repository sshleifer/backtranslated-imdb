I was crazy and devastated after my first sight of it - many parts of GRAY GARDENS are very funny and incredibly surreal - documentaries do not, it really gives Fellini or David Lynch an escape for money in amazing lotteries. I kept focusing on how these women (who are clinically far beyond eccentric) reveal their own humanity in the most astonishing way, and I wonder if their retreat from the world was caused by something other than the breathlessness of life in the unreal blue-blood universe, maybe some abuse, or maybe just a series of rebellion and rebellion, which escaped their control and took their own life. It may be one of the greatest films that is dangerously close to exploitation, not completely crossing the borders - as Edie does, I noticed things like empty bottles of gin in a bedroom strewn with rubble, cats urinating on a bed, sheds emerging from holes in walls, and the last scene seemed incredibly sad - like a child's birthday party went wrong. It is definitely worth seeing and looking - you will never forget it, but it is very disturbing.
