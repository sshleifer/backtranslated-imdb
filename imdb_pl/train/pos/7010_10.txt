Before I see in this film, I see a lot of comments that everyone has a great view of a good or bad movie ... <br /> <br /> What I really want to emphasize is Woody Harrelson's acting may not be in the end many parts of the movie, but when it appears, or even an intro, I was surprised by the "message" of Will Smith and Woody Harrelson, who tried to create and maybe even fool the whole story to really understand what's going on. <br /> <br /> I am not a very sentimental person, I think that a good deed should not have remorse or pity. But the act of showing redemption does not have many films that I think can show it. It's one of them that can. <br /> <br /> I agree with one person who commented on the film, showing acts of "suicide" is a fall, but I do not believe that this is a "message" of the film trying to send, but "sacrifice". A bit to the end, but this is the message in MY opinion. <br /> <br /> This movie has potential. Acting is worth every penny, the script is unbelievable. from a person who does not really like watching dramatic movies ... if you like drama, then you have to watch.
