Erroll works for the Department of Public Security, and his job is to check sex offenders. Sometimes he moves the line in his job and beats sexual offenders. I do not blame him, but his boss is ready to retire, and with him Allison. Erroll trains her now to do her job and it's like tracking her job. Allison is a little naive about this job at first, but she does not realize how dangerous it is, and that's all Errolla's fault. He begins to go far with the obsession of finding a missing girl when his job is not to be a policeman. <br /> <br /> It's quite a decent movie about a crazy guy who moves the boundaries and works his "scope of practice". Erroll did a good job, but for Allison's safety. She also has a good secret in her and it was when I discovered her that there was more to her.
