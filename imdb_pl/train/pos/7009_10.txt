I thought it was a great movie. He touches every fiber of a human being. Love in the film is very intense. I thought it was Will's best performance so far. Great directing. I like the edition. The music was great. Good use of flashback. This is the kind of movie that everyone should see. I hope people will get something wonderful from it. Overall a great movie. I think Hollywood should do more content movies. Even action movies can have a caring story. I like the fact that Will was very subtle in his acting. He had a purpose and dedication that is rarely seen. I suggest you watch it yourself or with someone you really care about. For me, I discovered that the world stopped, and my only goal was the movie. The outside world was suspended for a moment. It was a nice feeling with all this chaos in this world. And with this generation, it was wonderful to see something (someone) who cared about other people more than he did.
