Hey, I'm in this movie! I did not even know he was on this site until I looked a few years ago and was so surprised! I played Pete, the hero's son. It was a great experience and I loved every minute. During the filming they needed me to be in two places at once, so they used my twin sister as a double body! The finger that pushes the radio button in the car does not belong to me. I still work and do TV, but not so much. Oh, and if you want proof, my name is first on the top of the scroll. <br /> <br /> Review: I thought the movie was fine, but if I was not in it, my favorites. I thought the game was really good, but the plot was just that.
