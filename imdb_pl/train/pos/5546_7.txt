Some say that this is the best movie PRC ever released, I'm not so sure, because I have a place in my heart for some of their secrets. I will say that this is probably one of the most unique films ever released, or any other studio, bigger or smaller. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple. The spirit of the ill-made carrier returned to the marshes to kill all those who lynched him, as well as all their invisible sources. In this mix comes the granddaughter of one ghost victim, the current carrier. She took over the ferry business when the spirit closes to the man she loves. <br /> <br /> Sheltered in thick fog and set mainly on the plan of a single swamp it is a more musical poem than an ordinary feature film. the rhythms of dialogue, especially in the early stages, are for them a poetic cadence. Similarly, with a similar cadence to work with a camera that travels back and forth in the swamps, as if going back and forth through the door between life and death, innocence and guilt. The film reminds me of a more operatic, oratorial or musical lesson of an object than a mere horror movie. This is an amazing movie song that is probably unique in the history of the film. <br /> <br /> This is not for Lilly's guild. It's a horror / secret with a low budget that tells you a slim little story that will keep you entertained. What counts is his story of love and revenge, not about the poetic filming that attracts attention above all (technical aspects are just dressing in the windows). If there is a real defect, then cheapness of production. The fog creates a mood, but also hides the fact that this swamp is completely on dry land. Continuing to fast forward is fine for a while, but even after 58 minutes, you want us to see something different. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I like the movie. It's a good little movie, which, as I wanted, was a little less affected by poverty. It's definitely worth a look if you can meet him.
