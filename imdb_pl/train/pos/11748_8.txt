Tripping Over. I must say that initially I was a bit disappointed in the first episodes, but having faith in this program and Abe Forsythe's unquestionable talent, I continued to watch. I can safely say that now I'm happy that I did it. History has developed quite well, and all characters have a strong base, and most do not have any missing information. <br /> <br /> The only thing I can blame in this production is the slightly annoying voice possessed by Lizzie. <br /> <br /> Some good acting in combination with the stellar story really make this show run in line. Here is the hope for the next season!
