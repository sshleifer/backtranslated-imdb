I did not expect the highest caliber of film production with Joel Schumacher directing this movie, so I was surprised that TIGERLAND was not a total waste of time. <br /> <br /> The technique is often derived from SAVINGS PRIVATE RYAN with camera tremors, grainy shots, sometimes the film works like skipping a gear - all the techniques that Speilberg used to make the movie seem more realistic, but in the end it was more distracting than anything else. <br /> <br /> But unlike SAVING THE PRIVATE RYAN, the emotional component was not as weak as the characters in the film seemed more like real people, and the story less imagined, not so wrapped up in the American flag (Speilberg gets "F" in subtlety. <br /> <br /> Next to the first part of Kubrick's whole METALLIC JACKET, this is the most realistic portrait of the starting camp I saw in the movie, and I think it's worth watching. <br /> <br /> This is not a great movie, but it's not a bad movie.
