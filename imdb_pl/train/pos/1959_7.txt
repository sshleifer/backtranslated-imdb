Let me be in the front, I like the pulp. However, this is one of those "easier dives" that you see at the Olympics. It must be a little marked, because it is easier to give a cheap thrill than to drag you into the world of, say, a late medieval painter. <br /> <br /> It's only a two-hour drive on a spectral train and often (or more accurately, most of the time!) ridiculous and unlikely that it always goes ahead and always entertains. If not always the right way. Familiarize yourself with the memorable section with quotes to giggle. <br /> <br /> (However, why did he receive "The Worst Movie" Razzie is surprising - I bet there were a thousand worse films in 2006, but this film got treatment because it was seen as a fashionable victim.) <br /> <br /> The case of the main and popular novelist Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone) is now in London, writing a novel, but death and destruction follow her like flies follow the horse in hot weather. God, she can not even visit the toilet without stumbling over at least two troupe, and I'm sure that if she opened the wardrobe in her huge apartment on the top floor, it would have fallen in a great Hollywood style. <br /> <br /> Yes, apparently a very dangerous lady that revolves around (if you want your pulse to be above zero), but is she personally responsible? I mean, why would anyone connect two and two and start thinking that he could be a murderer? Similarly, her reaction to such accusations seems very random. Is this however only a personality disorder (some form of dependence on risk b / s) or further evidence of its fault? <br /> <br /> For reasons I can not fully understand or explain, Stone is assigned to psychiatrist Michael Glass (David Morrissey) for rating, not overthrowing the cells after another "lover found dead in mysterious circumstances." Fortunately (for Stone) he is far crazier than any of his patients and has his own troublesome home / professional life. In the blink of an eye, the relationship changes from a doctor to a patient, and then it's hard to say because everything becomes a kind of rotating stain. <br /> <br /> In this amazing mix, Roy Washburn appears (strange Welshman sounding David Thewlis), who says that love struck the doctor - in his many years as a policeman - that a woman can be dangerous. I mean, keep the first page. However, the glass is now too glassy to be aware or care. Like a staggering boxer in front of Mike Tyson in prime time, he saw a great fight, but not before he learned that Washburn might have a secret or two. <br /> <br /> Now Millen Gardosh (Charlotte Rampling) is coming, a psychiatrist colleague and a rare example (in this movie) of someone who is not barking or suspected of murder. Assuming she had actually watched the finished film, she must look back with nostalgia when her underwear fell easily with Stone - fortunately (at least for us) these days have long passed. Strange that he does not think Stone is as dangerous as everyone else, because he does not think the script is good enough, or his test is big enough to do the right thing. <br /> <br /> After a few laps, the track roughly outlined above comes to a climax that connects a provincial representative with a hanger / cliff turn that, though equally farce like the rest of the movie, gives us enough space on Basic Instinct 3 - it is very unlikely that at this point on time.
