`Our song 'gives us the life of three teenagers Lanish, Maria and Joycelyn - the best girls hanging at the end of summer. Growing summer - even if we do not know the signals and landmarks of this particular area, Crown Heights, Brooklyn - is the same for all of us. Lazy rest from the pressure and hustle and bustle of the school. Welcome to heat and inaction. <br /> <br /> But if this experience of puberty is common, downtown in the 90s is a different place than most of us know - maybe as foreign country as any other. Young bodies carving new silhouettes ... evoking new territory ... a maze towards adulthood. The young mind comes into his own, speaks for itself, saying that who I am is what I want to be. It has always been. But that's how he plays in Brooklyn in the late 90s. <br /> <br /> Jim McKay is the screenwriter / director of this film project, but he admits that everyone was shouting at him for suggestions. The initial title slideshow "Film by" seems to list everyone in the universe. It's a gesture, but at the end of the movie we know it's real. [The final titles also have some of the most cherished and appreciated credits I have read.] The live sound recording of Jan McLaughlin deserves special attention. McKay is a modest leader who knows who tells this story - his three favors by Lanish, Maria and Joycelyn. They are real, their interactions have the fire of true friendship and concentration of reality. This is not a music video about teenage life. He has the seriousness of a long, unblinking look. <br /> <br /> I go out with them, we do not feel attached at all, but we feel honored that we can listen to them. These are real voices talking about crises. and dullness of everyday life. We are witnesses of the modern mathematics of teenagers' lives - how its problems are interpreted, calculated, summed up and solved. Small scenes illustrate whole thoughts. Lanisha hangs with his dad in his security work - it's the only way to spend time with him. We see the love that exists between them, but also the failures of family and fatherhood. In the combined scene of Lanish, he defends his father from mum and we see how much he needs to love them both and love her in return. Later, the three friends lay in darkness, sharing visions and dreams - and we remember how crazy / funny are children and more tragically, how realism builds idealism these days. And at the end Maria just walks down the street in itself. We see how he gathers up the courage to stop all his fears and doubts. Demonstrates us the strength needed to be able to accept the fragility that makes life bearable. <br /> <br /> 'The biggest gift of our song is that we really feel the deeply fleeting nature of friendship - how one day, alive and vivifying, this intimacy can just turn around and leave. It's awful, but it's the way it is, right?
