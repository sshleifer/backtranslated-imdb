Father of the Pride was the best new program to hit on TV since Family Guy. It was another work of talented people in Dreamworks Animation. Like The Simpsons, the show focuses on a nuclear family (in this case, white lions). It also contains many unforgettable supporting characters, such as Roger, surly orangutan, Vincent, Italian-American flamingo, eccentric white tigers Blake and Victoria, false patriotic Brothers and Chutney the elephant. Other stars of the series are Sigfreid and Roy. They are incredibly eccentric and do everything in an impressive way, making the most mundane activities are fun. The combination of cute animals with very adult dialogue and controversial problems (drugs, prejudices, etc.) is the source of the program's brilliance. <br /> <br /> NBC is responsible for the failure of this program. They decided to broadcast episodes without a particular order (perhaps influencing which visitors could be promoted) rather than the more logical order of production. Several times the performance was overtaken by an additional half hour of such thrill as The Biggest Loser (as if 60 minutes were too little)! This is indeed a bad omen for the future of television as an art if an original and bold program like this fails when Fear Factor and American Idol dominate. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the whole series has been released on DVD and the show now has the opportunity to get a bigger following. 10/10
