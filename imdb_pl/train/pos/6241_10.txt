first I had the reaction of many people who remained after seeing this: that the photos of fat people sunbathing, etc., were in some sense cheap shots. OK, so he does diane arbus. . . anything. . . but it did not take long before I realized that this is not done in a dehumanizing way, because the images are developing, I felt that the problem lies only in the audience: we are conditioned by Hollywood, as well as films from almost every place, feel that watching people above a certain age behaves in a sexual way is something unseemly, which should not be shown. If all this was offered, the movie would be great. however, the story of a woman with an offensive boyfriend and his drunk friend really hits a ton of bricks: very telling story telling, amazing performances and thinking that the scene is improvised. this blond is a brilliant actor. in the end, I want to deny those who say that this movie is about how pathetic these people are. The old man who is doing with a woman who is finally dancing for him is completely OK, which breaks this form, so do not simplify the movie without paying attention to him. yes, his dog is killed. this is not a pink picture of the world, but it is not. . . completely hopeless. Anyway, I felt really grateful to the filmmaker for making such a beautiful film. I would not say that each of the threads was as strong as the strongest, but I say that this movie is basically kicking the ass and I highly recommend it. . .
