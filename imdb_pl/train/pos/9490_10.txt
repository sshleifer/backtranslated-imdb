The first time I saw this movie in the eighties, but I have looked through this thriller is still valid. Some newer films focus on similar themes, but they do not match this French milestone. <br /> <br /> The president - of course JF Kennedy - is shot in an open car during a public performance. The enormous investigation resulted in the fact that the character "Lee Harvey Oswald" of the film is guilty, but one of the jury members insists on further investigation. He discovers surprising proofs ... <br /> <br /> Unlike Oliver Stone's JFK - a movie with the same story - this one does not play with emotions, but focuses on an exciting description of the plot and how everything fits together by drawing a new picture of the murder. For this explanation of the crime scene even a real psychological experiment is used. Compared with JFK, this movie is more sensible, intelligent and thrilling. Parts of the story can be found in many newer films, I had a kind of deja vu, sometimes sitting in the cinema. <br /> <br /> "And ... comme Icare" is "must see". His unique and brilliant, and the music of Ennio Morricone is great. This movie deserves a very good ranking, if it was a Hollywood production, it would certainly be known. <br /> <br />
