My two-year-old likes the Doodlebops program, it seems to focus attention for a moment. Characters are interesting, vivid primary colors and everything. There are not many educational contents from which potentially target recipients could benefit, but it seems that each of them has a theme and tries to teach children about sharing and respect and other basics, so I like it. It is well-produced with high production values. But it's really an average program like most TV shows these days. We do not buy for goods, and our son is wearing Dooblebop. I do not think we would spend money for a live performance if they ever came to the city. Going to the Zoo or Science Center is a much better experience for everyone involved and in my opinion it is better spent money.
