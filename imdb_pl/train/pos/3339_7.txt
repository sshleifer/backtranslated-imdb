The Farrelly brothers, Bobby and Peter, are back in place. With "Fever Pitch" the creators of other movies that coped with many thick topics, abandon this tactic when they decided to move Nick Hornby's movie to the screen, which would be difficult to do. The novel of the same title concerned the male obsession with football, because it takes place in England, where this sport absorbs the majority of British sports fans. This is due to the writing team of Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandella to transform the book into a language that will appeal to most Americans when they create a hero, a Boston Red Sox fan. <br /> <br /> "Fever Pitch" is a film depicting the obsessive fan Ben Wrightly, whose life goes on in the season of Red Sox, who is an eighth grade teacher with amazing ways of engaging his students in the subject he is trying to teach them . When Ben takes four of his best students on a trip to a local company, he meets and falls in love hopelessly at the brave Lindsey Meeks, a young woman who goes to places, but at thirty he has no life of his own. br /> <br /> The story follows two lovers through the Red Sox ritual of home games in Fenway Park. The fans of this band are probably the most loyal people in the world who are stuck in a team that does wonderful things, but by 2004 they never won the World Series. In fact, the ending, from what we heard, had to be changed, because it was the year in which they ultimately won the event that escaped them for eighty-six years! Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon are perfect as a couple in the center of the movie. Ms. Barrymore is a natural person who always surprises with her performances in front of the camera. Jimmy Fallon, a popular TV comedian who has become a movie actor, has a better chance here than in his last performance in "Taxi", in our humble opinion. <br /> <br /> Farrelly's film will also satisfy his fans as baseball fans with this baseball story.
