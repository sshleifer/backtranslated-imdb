Return to the 3th Chamber is the comedy continuation of the epic 36th Chamber of Shaolin, in which Gordon Liu played Shana Te, a young man who became a monk and an amazing warrior. In this part of Liu he plays a wretched loser who must learn kung fu after his friends are beaten. He imitates the original Shana Te, tries all the tricks to get to the Shaolin Temple to learn and eventually gets some unique skills to fight against some bullies. This is a classic tale of light-hearted martial arts, with the production values ​​of Ace Shaw Brothers and a sure step by Lui Chia Liang. Choreography is fantastic, both in the fight and in the slapstick comedy, as well as in the performance of Gordon Liu, as in other, especially the nice monk works perfectly for the material. The film is less epic or deeper than some of the other works of other celebrities, and there are certainly greater, more brutal and moving Shaw Brothers films. But few have such a magical blend of slapstick, unique training and fighting, with a subtle but warming story of a useless guy who does good. Full of light joy, it's impossible not to give the highest score.
