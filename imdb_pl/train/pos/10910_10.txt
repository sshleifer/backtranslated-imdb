The most recommendable masterpiece, not only because of the basic themes of the story, but also because of the incomparably brilliant and imaginative work of Angelopoulos, not to mention the acting of the giants, Mastroianni and Moreau and the unusual game of Ilias Logothethis. Gregory Karr's performance may seem darkened by his "hard" partners in the first position, but in fact he plays his character perfectly, which is revealed in his last scene with a girl (Khrysikou) and a man (Mastroianni), although suggested earlier. (Hence spoiler.) <br /> <br /> Get your expectations straight! It is an "artistic film" in any sense that the phrase has to offer and requires attention. Not to spend free time, but to watch a work of art with the necessary concentration, like reading a book or attending a concert. Due to the general photographic style, it is recommended to display on a large screen. <br /> <br /> Dialogues are used sparingly. But the film contains - apart from the standard Greek and English language - fragments spoken in Albanian, Kurdish and Turkish, which will be attractive to those who are enchanted by the beauty of listening to different languages.
