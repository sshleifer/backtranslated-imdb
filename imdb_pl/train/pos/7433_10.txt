My mother took me to this movie when it appeared around Christmas 1976. I know everyone is laughing at Barbra's hair, but I think it looks and sounds great! ... And it seems to me that I remember a number of women who at that time copied that lasting look! Also the scene in the tub between Streisand and Kristoferson is so sexy! The music is also great. It's the best 70's babe!
