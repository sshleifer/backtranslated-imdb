I just have to throw in my two cents. Relax, it's a comedy. Yes, most characters are widely written and working. I can not come up with many comedies in which they are not. This is not a new release, it is available on video and on the airborne cable almost every week. Would I see it in the theater? Sure, I did it when it first came out. It's funny ... it should be enough. <br /> <br /> Even if I did not like it at all, I'd still watch it on the cable for Michael Keaton. He is an underestimated and underestimated actor. I can not think of another who is so capable in any genre. I can not think about someone who will succeed. Comedy actor who is also the action star (short-lived but still), who is also a romantic hero who is also a dramatic actor; black character and hero. I can not come up with any, at least not in Hollywood. Certainly no one who has succeeded in all these genres. I mean, it's Tom Cruise, but for me it's better to be Tom Cruise than becoming a hero. However, this is not about Michael Keaton and Tom Cruise, so I will go further. <br /> <br /> Gung Ho is worth letting, damn it, it's worth buying because you can probably find it in stores like Wal-Mart. It is worth watching on the cable (if you have a cable or satellite). This is one of those funny movies. You can pause your brain and just relax and giggle. <br /> <br /> Ask for more, in my honest opinion, she demands too much.
