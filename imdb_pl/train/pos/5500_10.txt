This document (now available for free at Video.Google.com) is a fantastic demonstration of the power of ordinary people to overcome injustice. Everyone must see this. <br /> <br /> Chavez was elected in 1998 as a result of landslides. His platform was to reverse the fantastic wealth of oil from 20% of the middle class to 80% of the poor. It prohibited fishing for foreign networks drifting in the Venezuelan waters. He sent 10,000 Cuban doctors to the slums to heal the sick for free. He destroyed illiteracy and founded new free universities. <br /> <br /> But it was his 30% tax on the profits of oil companies that made him in trouble with the Bush administration. In 2002, while Irish filmmakers Kim Bartley and Donnach O'Briain interviewed Chavez at the Presidential Palace about his social programs, a coup d'Ã©tat supported by the CIA began. After turning the cameras, Chavez was caught and thrown out of the country. On national television, it was announced that he had "resigned". <br /> <br /> But the poor Venezuela did not believe in the media. They went to the palace in millions and demanded the return of Chavez. In the face of such overwhelming figures, the army turned against the leaders of the coup and the conspirators fled to the USA. Chavez was saved by a military helicopter and returned to joy.
