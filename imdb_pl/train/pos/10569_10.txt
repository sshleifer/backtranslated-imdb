Clever, robust, witty, fast, sexy, extravagant, dingy, erotic, honest and infernal, Footlight Parade is a first class entertainment, what's going on in the movies. <br /> <br /> Realistic, satirical processing gives freshness to the material, and its pace and delivery of the line is breathtaking. To think that they have just started taking pictures with a conversation 7 years earlier! The brilliance of dialogue can not be adjusted anywhere today, especially considering that realism has taken over and absorbed modern cinema. <br /> <br /> This movie was made while Hayes's code restricting content was ignored and the result is a fresh, self-appealing, critical and vivid cinema that appealed directly to contemporary audiences suffering from depression and general anxiety of the age . I recommend watching any movie from this period, 1930-1935, on the vision of what a potentially popular cinema can be.
