Emma is a real romance. If you love soppy, loaded with wit and madness, you'll love this movie! This is true to the novel, which is very important, with a few additions added for pleasure. Gwen is not one of my favorite actresses, but she does justice to the role that required everything she had to offer. She shines in a role I think that no other actress could do just justice. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Northam, as a hero. how shocked are you? I never looked at him so handsomely, but damn it! What the right role can do for you! It looks as good as the reasonable King K that I literally look at him in a new light. He creates and exquisite romantic lead. The charm and character that he brings to his role is great! <br /> <br /> Ewan McGregor, Greta Sacchi brings the rest. good cast. Good film. If you're a Jane Austen fan, check out this video, along with Pride and Prejudice - AND MOST IMPORTANT, buy books. Strengthens the movie to unusual heights
