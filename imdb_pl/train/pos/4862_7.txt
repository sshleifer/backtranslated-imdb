This musical is definitely mixed, and none of the elements fit together, but somehow manages to survive. The plot contains some elements of the Wodehouse novel, but none of its advantages, although co-author of the script. The songs, although cute, have nothing to do with this particular film and are extremely harshly pressed into the story, even according to standards from before Oklahoma. Burns and Allen do their usual tricks quite competitively, but they lack the tone of the rest of the movie by about forty IQ points. <br /> <br /> There are several important points. Reginald Gardiner does a good job of remembering that it's a talkie and stops attacking like a quiet actor. There are also a few pieces of the magazine that could have been written by Wodehouse, though most of the film seems to be the production of one of the Hollywood meetings that he later parodies.
