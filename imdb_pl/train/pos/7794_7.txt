Victor Nunez saturates this unsentimental story about the emotional journey of a young woman with a sense of poetry rarely seen in the cinema. Through poetry, I understand the sense in which literary and cinema enters. There is something very literary about the movie, almost as if the novel was adapted side by side to the screen. In this sense, the film reaches a lot of depth; but it is also quite slow in other times, undercutting the depths it once achieved in favor of boredom. The film's star, Ashley Judd, has not made a better movie than her debut here. It fits the role of Ruby as a glove, almost as if it did not have to work. She has the real presence of a movie star in the film and has not really managed to convey the same charm in her later films, although she was impressive in Normal life.
