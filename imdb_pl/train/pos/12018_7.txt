*** SPOILERS *** Boasting with the hatred and revenge of semi-races Zach Provo, James Coburn, he spent the last 11 years on a chain gang planning his escape. What Provo wants is freedom and even the result of the man who captured him and killed his wife Navajo during a savage shootout: Former sheriff of Pima Sam Burgade district, Charlton Heston. <br /> <br /> Escape after killing two prison guards Provo heads towards Yuma knowing that not only does Burgade live there, but also his daughter Susan, Barbara Hershey. Using his fugitive convicts to lure Burgade to the vast Arizona Desert, promising them $ 30,000.00 in gold coins he buried there, Provo plans to finish his bloody revenge on Burgade. But only after he learned that his daughter is brutally raped by other convicts or is not with a woman for years, like horny like a rabbit during the mating season! <br /> <br /> A brutal and very effective western who updates the classic The Searchers by John Wayne in 1956 in his father searching India's dangerous territory for his abducted daughter. Charlton Heston, accused of feeling guilty, Sam Burgade in his own hole, somehow responsible for killing Provo's wife, and then facing the fact that the same can happen to his daughter Susan, is perfect in the role of an aging and retired sheriff. Charles Coburn as a vengeful semi-rasa Zach Provo is also in the best form, like the obsession with hatred and murder that escaped the convict. <br /> <br /> The man who escaped from Provo is not interested in his personal affairs, but he has no choice but to know territory like the back of his hand, but to go with him. It's just the thought of dealing with Susan when Provo gives them the green light, and buried gold coins worth 30,000.00 dollars, which keep them from breaking and going their own way. <br /> <br /> Also along with Burgade is Susan's boyfriend, Hal Brickman, Chris Mitchum, who finally proves that he is as good as Burgade, who felt that he simply does not have it in him, both tracking down fugitive criminals and using common sense, which in this case is missing Burgade. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS **** The unbelievably brutal and bloody clash between Burgade and Provo is almost too great to sit. Provo, who hates Burgade, bordered on insanity, wanted him to suffer a slow and terrible death. it was the hatred that Bugrade took advantage of, and after taking half a dozen missiles, it ended up that they vomited crazy and thirsty for good, and thoughtless!
