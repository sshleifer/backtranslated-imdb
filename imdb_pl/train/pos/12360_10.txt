I loved this movie. It analyzes the Italian petty-bourgeois society beautifully, as the leftists of the '70s have abandoned all their ideals and will come to a happy arrangement that they do not want to disturb. For example, an aging psychoanalyst who is jealous of his son and does not want to be reminded of his radical youth. <br /> <br /> For a long time I wanted to buy a movie after watching the movie several times on the big screen and on TV, but it seems that it completely disappeared from the market, even in Italy no one in the bookstores knew about the film. shame. <br /> <br /> One scene of sex that everyone seems to say about whether the movie does not matter.
