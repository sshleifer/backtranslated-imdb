I showed this to my sixth grade about 17 years ago and the students liked it. I loved it too. The history of termites and their interaction with the environment is amazing. The cast of creatures is deep and all play their parts well. The fight between two cold-blooded titans is really a classic film material. <br /> <br /> Alan Root did an incredible job at the camera, which should win an Oscar for the best documentary. I have a copy of Orson Welles (Derek Jacobi), which is not called "Mysterious Castles of Clay", only "Castles of Clay". This makes me think that it must have been done with Welles added to the power of the stars and the Oscar thrust. <br /> <br /> I was lucky that I recently found VHS and it is now my children's favorite movie. They brought him to the last family meeting instead of the Disney movie. If you find this movie, you are really lucky.
