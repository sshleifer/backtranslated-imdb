I watched this program based on the fact that I was told it resembles David Lynch's Twin Peaks - a show that I love. The show quickly begins to introduce us to the main characters and, rather, an extremely pilot episode is for me the best of it all, its extremely dramatic and really brings out the whole evil side of the series ready to progress for the rest of the season. My biggest criticism is that I felt a little disappointed by the program - probably not through my own fault, because it was canceled after just one season, it seemed to have great potential and deserved a much better treatment than it did. Acting is great, and this program has some of the best characters (good and bad) I have ever seen that are well developed in a short time. There is a strange tacky effect for the first 5 or 10 concerts, which are a bit too dramatic, but this is repaired as the season progresses. Worth seeing, definitely something out of the ordinary!
