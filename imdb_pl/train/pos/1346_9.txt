The British Film Institute, as part of the "rebutts" for the 100 best AFI films, has developed a documentary with Martin Scorsese. <br /> <br /> Now. I am a big fan of the film and I pride myself on seeing many, many films. But I'm now compared to my idol. In this fantastic (though long) document, Scorsese leads the viewer through several stages of American film history. It is divided into several sections, including Western, Gangster and Noir. Full of resilient enthusiasm, Martin Scorsese is a great guide and a fantastic professor.
