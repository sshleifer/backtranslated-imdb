How nice to have a movie that the whole family can see together. Josie Bissett and Rob Estes (who are married in real life) play a couple who get married in Las Vegas on a whim, and then not only have to break this message to their children, but then have to try to connect their households (each has two boys and two girls) in a cohesive family. What happens when a group of four teenagers, two youngsters and two younger children, first wonders if Carrie and Jim can be happy. Struggles between the children (and one little affair between the two) make us wonder if everyone can get along. More interesting than Brady Bunch, which is a totally enjoyable way to spend a few hours. Recommended as a good movie for all ages.
