How can anyone claim that Urban Cowboy was and still is the best document of life in Texas during this period. Consider the following: men beat their wives, drink in the bars every night, get married to settle for battle, adultery and compete on mechanical bulls. Try to name a movie that vividly depicts real life. They do not do them anymore. It seems that the current films always involve people with a lot of money, live in huge homes, drive expensive cars and do not work. This movie has a celebration scene about getting a trailer because of Pete! <br /> <br /> In any case, I watch it at least once a week. No jokes. I separated the movie from end to end. write to me to learn more about my reason to call this document. Consider the following scenes: Bud sees Sissy - they are separated - he likes and waves to him, turns him away by a bird - he returns half of the peace sign, nudging the horn to add strokes and then tears. <br /> <br /> Buddy's mom calls him about 18 hours after arriving in town, on Sunday, to see if he has a job - everything he has achieved is getting drunk and location (x2), with the help of his uncle and aunts who cover him. <br /> <br /> "You all live like pigs". Think about why this scene is needed. Think about it. Was it necessary? Could not we understand this without showing the dirty sink? God, I love it! <br /> <br /> Sissy lets Wes help her ride the bull. Just a few days (or maybe the next day) after Wes dug up her husband's nonsense. Steve asks - Hey Sissy, do you remember Wes? Oh yeah, you did not beat my husband that night, so let's start this lesson, not to mention the fact that he's looking for comfort later during many duels Bud and Sissy, which by the way take place in public - in Gilley's! <br /> <br /> A session for a wedding party (for humanity!) could at least organize or move chairs out of the way. "Moje nogi sÄ… spocone" mamo "<br /> <br /> In conclusion, you do not put such scenes in the film to try to show insight into human psychology. This is a document about real life. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that there was no director cut ...
