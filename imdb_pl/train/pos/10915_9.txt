The RKO studios have decided to borrow both William Powell from MGM and Jean Arthur from Colombia, for one of their major budget efforts to earn the Thin Man's popularity. They succeeded to some extent. <br /> <br /> Many people forget that in addition to and earlier than Nick Charles, Bill Powell also played in several Philo Vance films in the title role. Until then, he was quite well placed in this role. Dr. Bradford does not do as many liquid lunches as Nick Charles, but the basic glow Nick is still there. The only difference is that while Nick Charles married an heiress, Dr. Bradford works as a doctor. This helps in his love for the detective, and in fact in this film. <br /> <br /> He has two murders to solve. The jockey falls off a horse entering the top of a large race and dies for no apparent reason. The trainer suspects something is happening, but he was pushed off by a more conventional way of a missile. This is after he comes to Bill Powell for help. <br /> <br /> Myrna Loy had more influence on Bill Powell than Jean Arthur. Arthur plays it more like a dumbfounded lover than Loy. But it works here, and she and Powell have good chemistry. <br /> <br /> Reliable James Gleason is the police inspector in the role of Sam Levene / Nat Pendleton. All they needed was Asty and maybe Eric Blore when Powell's butler considered this part. <br /> <br /> If Powell and Arthur were signed in this studio, we could see a whole lot of Bradford movies.
