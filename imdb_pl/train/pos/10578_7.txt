"Footlight Parade" is just one of several wonderfully humorous musicals produced by Warner Bros. in the early thirties to prevent depression. "42nd Street" and the Golddiggers series were also produced in this era, and they did literally, millions of Americans forget about their troubles for a while and enjoy each other. the great talents of Joan Blondell, Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell, only the Foolight Parade had an unrivaled James Cagney. Almost ten years before his most famous musical "Yankee Doodle Dandy." Here he dances in the most original style of dance, with his arms usually lowered at his side, and his legs perform all kinds of waves and kicks. It's easy to see that he is having fun, and that makes us enjoy it even more. <br /> <br /> Although almost all music sequences appear at the end of the movie, they are worth waiting. I believe that this movie was made just before the installation of the production code, so some costumes and scenes are a bit risky. But that's all in play. <br /> <br /> It does not matter what the story of the movie is, just know that there is a lot of laughter and a great cast. In addition to the ones I've already mentioned, Guy Kibbee is the most excited. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
