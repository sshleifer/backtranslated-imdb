Another classic study of the impact of wealth on the southern family was masterfully presented in Written on the Wind. <br /> <br /> Kyle Hadley has it all. Wealth, plane, call it. Kyle's best friend, Mitch, always led him out of hardship. Mitch graduated, Kyle was expelled. Mitch does not come from a rich home. The Kyle family of Hadley Oil controls most of everything in the city. <br /> <br /> Being in NY, Kyle meets the girl of his dreams, nicely played by Lauren Bacall. After a stormy affair, he marries her and takes her home. There he meets his father-in-law, who warns her how difficult Kyle can be. Kyle sleeps with a gun under the pillow. Bacalla meets Kyle's sister, Mary Lee, a tramp, if she was ever there, played fully by Dorothy Malone, who was chosen the best supporting actress. <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson plays Mitch, a loyal friend. br /> <br /> The wedding year for Kyle and his fiancee ends when the doctor tells him that he can not have children. When his wife reveals to him that she is actually pregnant, Kyle, thinking that the child is Mitch, falls into a drunken fever and is accidentally shot in a memorable scene. <br /> <br /> Mary Lee, who has always loved Mitch, but fails to blame Mitch for Kyle's death. In the memorable scene, Malone stopped, admitting that Kyle's death was an unfortunate accident. Her Oscar was well-deserved. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, Robert Stack, brilliant as Kyle Hadley, was nominated for Best Supporting Actor and lost in Anthony Quinn's sad victory as Paul Gauguin, in Lust for Life. br /> <br /> Douglas Sirk was a master of soap opera films from the 1950s. Written on the Wind is no exception. *** 1/2.
