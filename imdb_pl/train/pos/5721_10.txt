I'm not sure if I understand what all the enthusiastic people say about it, maybe some people just like to cheat on matters. <br /> <br /> The film was certainly imperfect (uneven acting, some might have difficulty changing time, actors too eager to go to places where I really would not like to go, etc.), but IMHO were some things that they have made up for the imperfections. <br /> <br /> First of all, I loved to "break the rules". NORMALLY, when you leave a haunted house, enemies leave you alone, giving you time to regroup, get friends and find a mysterious paranormal token. NORMALLY (half-spoiler alarm), when you are hiding under a duvet, you can only pass through this small opening through which you look. NORMALLY at the end, the spirits somehow become less frightening because you have learned that they are simply misunderstood or have been released or anything else. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the production was exceptional. While the movie was not overburdened with special effects, supernatural bits, while the short were very well done. <br /> <br /> Probably not the best kind of movie for those who think that Freddy and Jason are the best kind of horror (they have nothing against them), but great for those who started taking conventions as obvious and who have no problems with time disruptions.
