It is a neat, small crime drama that largely consists of a 65-minute working time. He has all the right ingredients - a mysterious corpse, a middle-aged middle-aged Corrigan (Walter Kinsella) and his novice Tobin (John Miles), a dark assassin in the loose and even love interest of Tobin in the shape of a woman botanist Mary (Patricia Wright) who helps to solve offense. There is also a great final of shooting, which takes place in the yard of stonemasons. <br /> <br /> Watch out for a great surprise at the beginning of the movie in which Lieutenant Corrigan calls a dead woman "Tatooed Tilly" Before the coroner reveals that she had a tattoo (confusing what?). Also later, when Tobin chases the killer in the back, it suddenly turns out that he is going in the wrong direction at one point - no wonder he did not catch him!
