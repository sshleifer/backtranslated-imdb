This is an important movie. Challenges the viewer and encourages attention. There is much to like here. The director seems interested in dismantling some of the more tired film conventions. Unlike many recent American films, this film is interested in what it means to make a movie in the first place. The DVD contains many additional features and there are two comments that explain that the video for viewers is still dazzled after the first look. When the film was screened at Sundance, it made more than a few members of the audience uncomfortable and bad. This is a Sunday film with coffee, not a movie from a Friday party. For the dedicated viewer it's a treasury.
