Like many series pilots, the Dark Angel opener shows a mix of great potential and a small problem finding your own feet. This is not unusual in any way, but there is the impression that it could have been better if the story was sharpened and focused a little more. In today's world, in which something must immediately catch or remove a face, the series itself has made some inconvenience, not leaving at least half of the focus, with all the guns burning. <br /> <br /> The 90-minute pilot really feels like two sticky episodes, and both episodes have a focusing problem. In the first half we introduce ourselves to Max and fill out what drives it. We also get some interesting procedures with Max using their ability to win bets, interact with PI or sort the problems of housemates. The problem is that it is not unusual for any human being with a normal set of genes, on television or otherwise. <br /> <br /> This is when we get into the other half, we get a story with a goal and focus. Max is in the center of the attention of a pirate journalist, who believes that the mission of life is to save the world by revealing one dirty dealer at a time. In the second half, repercussions catch up with him, and Max reluctantly clears up the resulting mess. This sets the premise on all the rest of the series and works, but not quite click, if you understand my meaning. It is like most songs, but the pair that creates the full picture has been omitted. Perhaps they will be filled in later sections, but it does not matter. It is a fact that the content of this episode could easily be told with twenty-eight smaller minutes. <br /> <br /> The last negative is that many casts are completely unjustified. Original Cindy is particularly annoyed, and I doubt it will change over the next twenty episodes. While acting is not as bad as soap during the day, there is no quality that I would recommend. Jessica Alba is not the worst actor in the world, but she is not very convincing when it comes to convincing when history needs it. <br /> <br /> The good news is that the premise and production values ​​are all excellent. In fact, this series was considered quite expensive to produce and it is unfortunate that it was canceled to replace it with another program that did not last throughout the season. Especially when there was enough time for both concerts - they could simply cancel one of the pieces of obscene trash that were splashing under the reality TV banner. It is a fact that we need more shows, such as Dark Angel, where imagination rather than excess is used to attract attention. <br /> <br /> In total, I gave the pilot Dark Angel seven to ten. It never rises above the level of one-off television and has never had the chance to meet the potential it shows in its time. But there is potential, and this is often important for pilots.
