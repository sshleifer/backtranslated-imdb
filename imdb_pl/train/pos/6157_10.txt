This is a movie I never even thought about until my 3-year-old saw him in the video shop and caught him after he liked pictures of animals on the island of Nabooboo. We've got it and since then we've been watching it many times; in fact, we've been renting it several times since then. There are few un-animated films that my son will watch and pay attention to; what a nice change from Dumbo and the Little Mermaid. Acting is outstanding, songs are attractive, deeply penetrate your head and you can not refrain from singing. The story, specifically WW2, is timeless in its own way and every time you watch it, there is something new. I heard this in comparison to Mary Poppins, but I think they are two very different films, both excellent, but somehow my son is not interested in Mary Poppins at all. This is one of those movies that children will want to watch over and over again and their parents will not mind. There are days when we watch it before naps and sleep, and I do not feel the groan coming when I want to repeat another movie.
