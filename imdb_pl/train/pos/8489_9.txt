I teach Japanese in high school online and I include cultural activities so that students can get to know the country and language. And watching "Gung Ho" is one of the requirements. Students can buy or rent a movie. Stereotypes or not, it helps students see that other people perceive the world and their lives differently than we do. Many of my students told me that they liked the movie so much that they would get a copy for themselves. It's really interesting to see what we value in this culture and what they value in their culture. I would just like to get a cleaned TV version. I do not like the primitive language that authors use all the time.
