Kusturika did it again. Another masterpiece. A coral comedy full of its own landmarks, with crazy rhythm and many glorious moments, we laughed and laughed, what a party! Music is everywhere, as well as shooting, animals, crazy bastards, sex and amazing gadgets and inventions, all colorfully visual only for entertainment. Clean cinema in essence. A great experience to watch. One is particularly grateful, because good comedies are so rare and wonderful. Well, that's one thing, and if you liked Kusturica's previous films, you'll love it, although, as in all comedies, it's about a chemical reaction and you must feel like it.
