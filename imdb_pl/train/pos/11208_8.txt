Oh, where are you going, my baby, tiny ... <br /> <br /> Turn around and you're two, turn around and you have four ... <br /> <br /> I remember those programs when they were they were broadcasted for the first time at Disneyland. I remember sitting there, electrified by Werner Van Braune's explanations about rocket science. I watched how history, science and humor intertwined with the immersive history of possibilities. <br /> <br /> That was fifty years ago. And the shows are back in the Disney Treasures series and what are the treasures. I watched them last night and tonight with my 8-year-old daughter who did not even come to the room at first, but later changed her mind when she saw that they were partially animated. As she watched her watch, at the end she was almost as absorbed as I was. <br /> <br /> Turn around and you're a young wife with your own kids ... <br /> <br /> Sure, some predictions about reaching the moon were wrong. But there is a lot of information that is still quite accurate and the overall presentation is still impressive. I found myself convinced that my daughter's teacher can show them to her class, not only as a 50-year-old artifact, but also as a fun and easy to understand lesson in history. <br /> <br /> Turn around, turn around, turn around and again ... you wonder how much has changed in 50 years.
