Let me be the first non-Australian who will comment :) I got a movie for Hugo Weaving and watched it to the end. This is one of these films, the "drama of life", as my mother used to call a film that depicts a real life story without any extraordinary events, and it is mainly descriptive. <br /> <br /> I liked the light and the girls. The rest was without too much mistake, but without too much merit. I missed something like an interview, or at least some element of a villain here and there, but nothing extraordinary. History teaches someone how to face their own destiny and free themselves from the environment that others build for you, but it happens when the peach plant giving life in the area is close to closure, so you do not have to make a lot of effort to change something. <br /> <br /> The "intelligent" American Beauty soundtrack could have been part of a larger soundtrack, but only that one game over and over again became annoying after 100 minutes of the movie. > <br /> In conclusion, I think his job was to portray part of Australian life, but for me it did not seem particularly Australian (it could be placed anywhere) and did not seem attractive as a story. <br /> <br /> I think you need to have a certain mood to like this movie.
