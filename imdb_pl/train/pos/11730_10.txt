What can be said about Elvira, which has not yet been said in the world press? A classic comedian that IS Elvira performs in his first feature-length masterpiece of a budget comedy. <br /> <br /> From the first film frame, Elvira packs an acting blow that the Big Movie clearly says ... heart, Bette Davis! See abandoned Elvira, see Elvira excitable, see jealous Elvira, see the murderous Elvira. You can not do anything else but admire her acting prowess! <br /> <br /> The heart of this comedy masterpiece is the desire of Elvira starring in Las Vegas. Despite putting "boob back in boobtube" as a horror hostess (with the most), Elvira finds the small screen emotionally ... and PHYSICAL! Nuff said, he's packing his purse and heads to the east ... a hot dog in one hand and a letter from aunt's lawyer showing her a "relegation" in the other. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie so many times, I can almost recite it literally .... (it literally just shows off)! <br /> <br /> Catch a copy, laugh silly, learn the line .... <br /> <br /> Why she did not win the Oscar for the best female role for this role is beyond me.
