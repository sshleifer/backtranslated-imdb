I have a two-year-old son who suffers from the same condition as Jonny Kennedy. I've never had a chance to meet him, but I've never heard anyone say a bad word about him. I hope he knows how much this program has helped other sufferers, raising awareness of this terrible condition. This man touched people in a way that a million leaflets could not. I believe that this should be mandatory viewing in schools. I also agree with other comments - what do I have to moan about? He took everything that life could throw at him, and he could still keep his sense of humor. God bless. I could not see the part that showed how his dressings were changing. I have enough trouble with my son.
