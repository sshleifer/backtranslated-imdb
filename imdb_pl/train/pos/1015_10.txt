I am waiting for each new episode, each restarted with expectation! The new sci-fi look created by Stargate SG-1 is a miracle that, I hope, will never end. The combination of the past and the future is a new element for me that fascinates me. Season 9 should be a thrill. I would like Richard Dean Anderson to appear more often in the new season because I love his dry joke, as well as his anger in his character as Jack O'Neill. Other characters add to their unique character the show, which makes him the winner, season after season. You cancel this program in the next three years and make a serious mistake. You also need a bigger role for Asgard - they are simply too cool.
