I love this movie. This is one of those that I can watch many times. It works well thanks to a good cast who does not try to be a star too much. <br /> <br /> The premise of a newly-widowed housewife who asks for a pot to sell, to make ends meet, could be transformed into an Americanized turd of a movie or action thriller. Or we would kill the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The movie takes place like Ealing Comedy with an amazing factor of well-being. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing only the scene with two older ladies and a box of cornflakes ... (no, it's not a spoiler!)
