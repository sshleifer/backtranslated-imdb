One of the best pieces of the television drama of the last decade. Within five hours, perceptions and sympathies are constantly questioned because they explore many aspects of modern British society. David Morrisey is as brilliant as ever. Initially, it is hard-filled copper in conflict with the heroine, but it turns out to be intelligent and caring because it works with her in discovering the truth. I've never seen Surrane Jones before. I believe it comes from the world of television soaps. Her performance was great because she is humorous and self-controlled, trying to balance the demands of the case and the stress of caring for her mother. I could go on and talk about every member of the cast who contributes to this amazing drama, but their efforts do not mean much without such an absorbing scenario that constantly undermines your assumptions about each character. Such programs restore faith in the television drama, and at the same time make it almost impossible to be satisfied with the majority of trash that is increasingly filled with radio waves.
