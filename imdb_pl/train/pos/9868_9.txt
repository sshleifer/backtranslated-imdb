This is obviously aimed at the same market as Monsters Inc and Shrek, but differs in the smaller sense of cardboard (despite the deliberately characteristic features of leading creatures). The story is not the one that had a massive moral face at the end (more like pulling at shirt sleeves), but it simply tells a story about the relationships between different "animals". You know the result, but you can not resist pulling yourself. <br /> <br /> Characters themselves are more than just their voices (the advantage of lesser-known actors performing voices), unlike most Disney movies. They are strangely rounded and completely reliable. The dynamics of the group are well presented, and the revelations of characters and quirks are subtle and pleasant. You will find that you support them much earlier than you would like to think. <br /> <br /> Animation is brilliant, as you might expect, and you'll be praying for the possibility of going to the ice slide in the movie. You will fall in love with heroes, especially in the comic relief of a prehistoric squirrel and her desperate attempts to bury nuts. I left, wanting compulsory goods, especially toys of laziness, to be disappointed the next day when I could not find anything related. <br /> <br /> Strangely, it makes the film even clearer. <br /> <br /> Better than Monsters Inc or Shrek.
