First of all, I have to pass it on to people who have it all together. 9/11 is such a delicate issue that making a movie that dares to be controversial requires a lot of courage. It is a pity, though it is not surprising that the film was banned in the United States. <br /> <br /> Having said that, I think that the film is excellent in several weak moments. The film begins with the Iranian segment, which is somewhat reminiscent of the work of Majid Majidi (absolutely beautiful "heavenly children" and "color of paradise"). Like these two films, the clip shows what happened to the innocent eyes of a refugee class from Afghanistan in Iran. Absolutely beautiful clip. The same applies to Sean Penn's clip, which is also great. But just as some clips are beautiful, others are absolutely brutal. Alejandro Gonzáles Iñárritu makes a Mexican clip and, like his "Amores perros", who disgust himself, he does it as brutally as he can. Most of the clip is a black screen with a few sounds playing in the background. These are the sounds of reporters and their shock when the second plane crashed, those who called home from the burning towers and left messages for their families, those who were angry ... and it connects with the flashes of people jumping from the towers. . A very heavy clip to watch and one you will not forget. <br /> <br /> Some clips may turn out to be very difficult to watch for Americans because some clips can be interpreted as "you are not the only ones who suffer". In particular, Egyptian and British clips, which not only say that they turn away from the table and say how much suffering the US did to other people. <br /> <br /> I will also mention clips from Bosnia-Herzegovina, France, India and Japan (although the latter may seem terribly out of place, it really is not). <br /> <br /> However, not all clips are great and I make a special mention on a clip from Israel, which in my opinion is extremely weak. Although the idea was good (the reporter is in the place of a terrorist attack in Tel Aviv, but his story is confronted with what happened in New York, it is something that many of us who live in war may be involved), the implementation is terrible. The clip ends as an entertainment reporter who tries to get some time at all costs. The guy says that he is a witness and he hopes that he will be able to enter television, and soldiers and paramedics shout "because". The clip did not capture any drama of such a situation. <br /> <br /> If you happen to see this, you should, I mean, unless you're conservative, in which case you better stay, because you can be offended. But if you are not, you can find out how many of us outside the US survived on September 11.
