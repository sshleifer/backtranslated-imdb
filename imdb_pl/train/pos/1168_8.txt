Tony Arzenta, a Sicilian hitman or a professional killer, decides to leave the business and his former employers disagree. When it comes to content, this very nice action movie is not like that; when it comes to pure entertainment, is it fun? is very melodramatic, violent, quite brutal, car chases are noteworthy. "Arzenta" is an unpretentious, and at the same time very nice movie? Much better than current Hollywood trash that has the same label. It comes from a rather short flirtation of Delon with Italian cinema B 70s. He carefully uses Delon's tough personality, belonging to the gallery of sinister thugs he did in his youth. <br /> <br /> I really liked the fact that Delon made the film that he had a role in a good Eurocrime flick. <br /> <br /> The result is very good, with a good introductory song he felt the enthusiasm that Italians had for a film considered a synthetic work, in which musical art has an important role. <br /> <br /> In Tony Arzenta / Big Guns / No Way Out very attractive Erika Blanc (31 years old in 73) appears as an unnamed slut. Meanwhile, Arzenty's girlfriend, Sandra, plays Carl Gravin (an asterisk that practically left the movie after '75). <br /> <br /> "Arzenta" was interestingly filmed with an ambitious visual concept, some expressionistic peculiar angles. The film was directed by prolific Duccio Tessari, the one who also did Zorro (Delon's comedy). Not to mention that these two films, Tony Arzenta (1973) and Zorro, are very dissimilar. The first is a bloody melodramatic rape action movie - the second is a light comedy, more akin to parody, though extremely coherent and skillfully made. Duccio Tessari has directed films such as Kiss Kiss ... Bang Bang (1966), Sons of Satan, The Bloodstained Butterfly, Â¡Viva La Muerte ... Tua! , Tough Guys (1974), Safari Express (1976), etc.
