This is one of the videos that improves every time you see them. It is full of so many original and unconventional ideas that you will always find a new detail. As in the subsequent Sabu films (I have not seen the "Unlucky Monkey" yet, but the others are so big) defeat, chance and humanism play great roles. Cutting and editing are ingenious and artistic, and the film is not an "artistic" painting, but very funny. Comparing it to "Run, Lola, Run", you have to remember that "Dangan Ranna" was made several years earlier and was shown on German television already in 1997 ... Tom Tykwer's film, not the other way around. Completing other reviews, I must add that I really like acting and ending. This movie is great fun in many ways and manages to deliver a message without being annoying or pretentious.
