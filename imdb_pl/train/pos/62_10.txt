I loved this movie. I bought it when I found a copy of it. This movie had so much emotion and was so real that I could really sympathize with the heroes. Every time I watch it, the ending makes me cry. I can really identify myself with Busy Phillip and how would I feel if it happened to me. <br /> <br /> I think all schools should show this movie, maybe it will stop people doing the same. I recommend this film to everyone and everyone. Especially those who have been touched by any school shooting. <br /> <br /> It's really one of the best films of all time.
