It's a refreshing breath of air when a movie gives you a story with a beginning, middle and end, a nice, wise secret, with an attractive heroine for all ages who gains us with his wit and charm. Andrew Fleming's film is indeed a modern miracle, a return to a good old, credible story that was the norm in Hollywood. He puts away the excessive reliance on special effects, which are now entertainment and give us a great movie, with a very talented young actress and a talented supporting cast. <br /> <br /> The movie is based on an old book, but it was given sufficiently updated to put it in this century; however, props may be different, the heart is still a good secret, and it is clever here that combines the traditions of the past and nuances of modern youth. Emma Roberts is an old-fashioned girl who believes in good behavior and respect for others; details that are very much missing in today's movies. He is still good enough to get boys, but he also knows how calm and self-respect is present. He earns his medals, works hard and is not afraid to show a bit of deception when it is necessary to achieve its goals. <br /> <br /> During a holiday in California, our heroine gets dragged into the secret of Hollywood actress who was a victim of impure fun; suddenly she is "visited" by her spirit, which causes a series of events that can solve the mystery or lead to something terrible for herself. What makes the movie quite amusing is the small details, because it discovers that its usual world is nothing compared to the California scene, and it's well presented, without resorting to unnecessary vulgar language or something graphic or explicitly sexual. Ultimately, the director has enough control so that everything is very tasty for all types of audience, from young to adults in the audience. It's a movie that deserves to be seen, appreciated and enjoyed, a movie that is rare and delicate, and is not afraid of being qualified as fun! Five stars
