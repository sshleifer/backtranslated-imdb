It takes a very special kind of person to make a movie that is so miserable, captivating, disgusting and repulsive, but to make it in a way that also makes it a brilliant and quintessential personal film release. Crispin Glover, in all his "pricks" and predispositions, really did something special. In a world that has become extremely biased, this film seems to avoid the standard lines of creativity and art and successfully surprise everyone. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning, the film takes on a rather distant paradigm (if there is a model at all) and it is initially shaped by a man with cerebral palsy with the participation of Shirley Temple in front of the swastika and pleasant nude women. It's rather shocking things, but if you've had the opportunity to attend question and answer sessions after the screenings, it clearly opens up the bag of worms that make you wonder if it's art or just the lowest common denominator. In each guise you can feel the shaking that will ultimately cause this movie. It will never be accepted, even by alleged authors of the world, who are boring about the human condition. You may not like it, but it is definitely something worth watching.
