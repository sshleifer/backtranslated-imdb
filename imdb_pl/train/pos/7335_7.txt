In the case of Ralph Bakshi, most of his films appear to be like two-edged swords. You'll get something amazing from it, but only if you endure stupid and unnecessary cheezy. The Lord of the Rings was a great adaptation of history, which maybe not always shone in the animation department. <br /> <br /> Fire and ice is Bakshi's great achievement from the point of view of animation. Rotoscoping is much more detailed, and the animation has a vivid appearance. You still have some dumb immobile cells and slightly blurred background images, but certainly the look has definitely been better than the last epic fantasy of Bakshi. Animation has an almost realistic, naturalistic style, and unlike LOTR, where this style often quarreled with real content, here it improves the unique atmosphere of the film. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film does not create a meaningful story from its simple surroundings, and in fact most of the motivations of the characters are quite blurred. Lorn and Tigra are easy cases, but even the main villain Necron was difficult to follow, not to mention this guy from Furry Face Mask (also known as "That Guy"). Even though most voice actors were right, weird weirdies appear in the audio section, and Tigra sounds really horrible when she screams. <br /> <br /> I believe, however, that the inherent film value exceeds the unnecessarily silly performance of the storyline. The scant cloak of heroes is something you'll never get involved with, but it helps you remember that maybe this movie is not even taken too seriously. It's still cool and fun.
