Excellent and accurate video ... McGovern makes great efforts to explore and document his writing and it pays off. He is not afraid to tell the truth, even if he can draw unfavorable reviews and comments from some who like stories that are clean, sweet and shiny. <br /> <br /> Once again, McGovern introduces Christopher Eccleston, though not in such a high profile as the role in Hillsborough. I consider this movie to be accurate, well-played and well-presented, as Hillsborough and I applaud McGovern for his moving, uninviting writing. Bravo and my hat is for the writer, the actors, the production team. Great movie!
