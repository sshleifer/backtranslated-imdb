I never heard about this movie until I came across it accidentally while browsing IMDB. I saw that he got a lot of awful reviews containing very colorful explanations about how stinks he was. Of course, that meant that I had to see it. I was pleasantly surprised because Whipped is actually a good movie. I watched him with a group of friends and laughed more than any of the many recent Hollywood comedies. It is an independent film and as such presents its subject (sex and dating) without the usual Hollywood scam. I clearly suspect that the opinion of people about this film depends to a large extent on their life experience. If you've never dined or partyed a lot, you will not get this movie because you will not meet people like these characters. If so, you will recognize many of the situations presented here in a comedy fashion. The ending was also good because it did not portray women as unreal, helpless, virgin romantics as opposed to many Hollywood movies.
