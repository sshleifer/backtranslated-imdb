Considering the fact that it is based on the most infamous mass suicide incident these days, it would be enough for this two-part remark dedicated to the 1980 film. But the fact is that it is an excellent reproduction of the life of Fr. Jim Jones, who built the church into a virtual empire, then encouraged him to disintegrate into a poor cult, in which the congressman and his entourage were murdered, and 917 worshipers committed suicide by drinking Kool-Aid drenched in cyanide. <br /> <br /> Done very tastefully, but scarier enough, in contrast to the terribly sadistic WATCHED FOIL, GUYANA TRAGEDY has an all-star cast, including Ned Beatty (as Rep. Leo Ryan), Meg Foster, Randy Quaid, Brad Dourif , Brenda Vaccaro, LeVar Burton and Madge Sinclair. But it's Powers Boothe (in its first major role) that really stands out as Jim Jones. In fact, he FEELS a man, and his performance is riveting and chilling in his veins. It is no wonder that this film continues to attract attention after more than twenty years.
