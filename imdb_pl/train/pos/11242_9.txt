Anyone who is interested in pop music and does not know British music trends from the late seventies should at least once see Breaking Glass. The film tells about the young woman's striving to stand out in the world of music, perfectly reflects the times, from overt sexism, difficult economic times, social upheavals, to changing pop culture from brutal punk to terribly fey and pretentious futurism / new romanticism. Music and fashion styles created daily in Great Britain in the late 1970s are still rediscovered and recycled (since 1980 there was nothing new). It was a brilliant time, and Breaking Glass both tells a very personal story and explores the cultural landscape, and does it very well.
