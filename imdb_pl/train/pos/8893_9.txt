The 1960s is a well-balanced mini series between historical facts and a good story. In four deliveries, we follow a family from North America with three members. But we do not only see them. We also follow the story of several characters as black Reverend, extremist student leader and soldier in Vietnam. Filmography is simply extraordinary. In the first chapters, we see several shots of the Vietnam War between scenes. The next chapter does not start where the last one ended, it starts some time later, giving us some secret about what happened. In general, a mini series from the 60s is a must, not only for hippie fanatics, but for everyone with little curiosity about the subject.
