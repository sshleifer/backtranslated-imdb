Over the years, I've seen a lot of "80s horror movies," from rubbish, such as "Terror on Tour", and funny gems like "Slumber Party Massacre 2". Somehow I managed to postpone what is strange because it is probably the most popular and well received. Well, in the end I caught up with him and it's easily the best in this horrible (but almost always endearing!) Subsoil. The plot (which is largely included in the film "Black Roses") concerns a wrinkled missionary named Eddie, whom everyone in his high school mocked for his taste in music. He loves metal from the 80s, especially his idol Sammi Curr (played by the great Tony Fields.) After killing Sammi, favorite DJ Eddie gives him the last recording. When Eddie plays the record back, he discovers that it is a little harder and that bad things begin to happen to those who mock him. Is Sammi's music composed? "Trick or Treat" is well made and complete. Special effects are amazing, although they have typical laser beams from the 80's. I grew up in the 80's and although I was not a heavy metal fan, I remember the city legend of playing back the disc, hearing the sounds of Satan's worship. Ha ha! I also remember that my older siblings and neighbors told me that both KISS and Ozzy worshiped Satan, so it is very funny to see how they both create episodes as a harmless radio DJ and anti-rock priest. If only I could see this movie as a child! While the movie seems to joke about the popular connection in the 1980s between the alleged devil worship and heavy metal, the viewer will never know why Sammi Curr returns from the dead, creating havoc and killing anyone who stands in his way. This is the weakest point of the movie, but if you can overlook it, there is a lot of fun.
