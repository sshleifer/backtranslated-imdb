This movie is perfect and I recommend renting it to anyone who owns a local video store. Or even better, you can buy it, because chances are you'll be watching it over and over again. I remember watching this movie as a child and then it was great. But after seeing him again yesterday, I discovered he was amazing. <br /> <br /> A good mix of comedy (though not as good as "Mr Magoo" - another of my favorites) and shares. It deserves to be 10/10 and I hope they will soon make a sequel (thumbs up). If you take care of children or take care of small children, I recommend renting this movie, because it will provide entertainment for many hours :).
