The film focuses on his relationship with his married lover, to whom he is often hostile, as well as on his contacts with other victims of accidents, in particular with a black pervert and white cyclist. The film is often humorous, often sad and always credible. Leave the kleenex box and watch it on a cozy Sunday afternoon with your partner.
