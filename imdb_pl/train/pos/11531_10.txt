I remember being a kid, when I first saw this movie, it was my first horror movie (maybe that's why I still remember some of it). I do not remember much about acting, nude scenes or other things, but I remember a man with his head blasted with a grenade, a man dismembered over a tree and a man lowered by a truck and shot in the head :), Kenny Johnson and Kevin McParland). I also remember the last scene in which Jennifer McAllister took her deadly stomach to get the keys of the truck. It's a movie that gives you creep and is worth seeing. But where to find him? How can I download it?
