I have watched it many times and plan to purchase a full function. I love all of Jason Steele's comedies. It is very different and unique and is very pleasant. I love indie movies and this one is just great. The plot is strange, but very funny. This short film is about a talking spatula named Edward. The order of events is a bit confused, making this movie very interesting. At first you see Edward struggling with spoons, but then the focus changes to earlier in his life. It's a stupid movie, but of course it's still great. I highly recommend watching this movie at www.spatulamadness.com or www.filmcow.com. This is very funny. Humor may not suit everyone's tastes, but watch it anyway. It will take you only 16 minutes, and it costs nothing. GO WATCH SPATULA RURAL!
