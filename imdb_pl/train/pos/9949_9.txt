This is quite a nice surprise. A beautiful little story about the heroine's expedition, a very surprising metamorphosis of the four-eye prissy, which will soon be the spooky type in the lewd-queen of DD-cup sex. <br /> <br /> Visually looking for aching eyes, not only for two amazing actresses, but also for (most) costumes and make-up actors. Unnecessary cheapness appeared in some absurd imitation of the castle. <br /> <br /> Return to positives: The movie is spiced up with amazing camera shots that you would not expect in a soft core. I loved this scene with icicles, the absolute potential of the classics. A slight minus only for (very) a few strange scenes, in which the bad behavior by small casts soon suspended the suspension of disbelief. <br /> <br /> 9/10, including an additional loan for a serious drooling effect.
