While this may seem unbelievable, Gojoe is an inspired anime and Hong Kong samurai movement with a pacifist message. This cube of the film is effectively portrayed by the main character (great acting work done by Daisuke Ryu), a killer-monk-bendi-monk-benkei. Benkei swore that he would never kill again, but he still takes the sword to fight what he considers to be an invasion of demons ... Gojoe is a difficult movie to judge. This visual image is stunningly beautiful and beautiful, but it uses too many scams (circling camera and fast drives, expressionistic shots, colorful colors, digital effects, etc.), So the end result is a bit tiring. Nevertheless, the beginning and end of the film are both elegant and powerful. If only the director Sogo Ishii would be smart enough not to overuse his trick. <br /> <br /> Another problem with Gojoe is the amount of violence. In the case of a movie with such a brutal message, Gojoe wastes too much energy and time on the screen to visualize endless battle scenes. Also the way violence is shown is always on the verge of being indulgent; in fact, the shower of blood in the night sky seems to be one of the images of movie signatures. Fortunately, Ishii is wise enough to show the ugly, tragic side of violence. Still, it seems that Ishii is not sure whether he is creating a traditional action movie or deeply moral allegory. The audience can not be sure until the very end of the movie. A strong (though cynical) ending is what saves Gojoe; clearly emphasizes that this film is more than just a traditional festival.
