A great cult movie from 1979, in which the students of Vince Lombardi High School meet with a new dictatorial director named Miss Togar (Mary Woronov). Togar is a music lover and blames students' musical tastes for their misdeeds. The manager against her is Riff Randell (PJ Soles) who loves to play, fan # 1 Ramones, who more than anything wants a rock band to record their songs. <br /> <br /> Now * this * is a movie that can not be resisted. First of all, the soundtrack is amazing, with songs by artists such as Alice Cooper and Velvet Underground in addition to the infectious non-stop range of Ramones songs. "Teenage Lobotomy", "Sheena is a Punk Rocker" and "Blitzkrieg Bop" are just some of them. Then the cast really gives her everything, and Soles is the perfect choice for the role of Riff; it is a real delight. Vincent Van Patten and Dey Young are as passionate as Tom and Kate, Woronov is well-mannered against the type as a snobbish and contemptuous Togar, Clint Howard has one of his finest parts as an Eaglebauer entrepreneur, and New York regulars such as Dick Miller, Paul Bartel (especially funny as music teacher Mr. McGree) and The Real Don Steele are as funny as ever. And of course it is a pleasure to see The Ramones playing themselves. <br /> <br /> The movie has a real spirit. The energy level is high, and the co-founder and director Allan Arkush contributes a lot to the proceedings. There is also a great sense of humor. The paper plane's gag is a perfect example. This extends directly to the scene transition style. There are even hilarious giant mice created by the future effects of makeup, noticed by Rob Bottin, in one of his earliest concerts. <br /> <br /> More or less as good as opposing authorities, he can defend a movie that has the right to party. "Rock 'n' Roll High School" is simply a great cult movie. <br /> <br /> 8/10
