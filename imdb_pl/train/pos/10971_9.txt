Gray Gardens are shocking, funny, sad and mesmerizing. I watched with amazement as Ediths Jr. and Sr. they argued and acted out, remembering their past. Their existence in the destroyed residence (which they have not left for more than fifteen years) is both a comedy and a tragedy. It's a movie you will not forget.
