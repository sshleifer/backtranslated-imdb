Life Pod is one of those movies that you watch and try not to analyze too much. Acting is amateurish at best. The special effects are of course a low budget, but not so bad. The plot is rather joint, but with an interesting twist. The computer works amok, but not exactly the computer and the operating amok is very understandable when the truth is revealed. Despite this, the film has its moments and is quite visible. For me, at least part of the charm of this film is the outstanding role of Kristine DeBell. Maybe she's not the greatest actress in the world, but being an old companion of the month, she's pretty enough. In total, Life Pod is similar to other low-budget Sci-Fi movies from the 80s and somewhat predictable. <br /> <br /> The piece of White Star Lines is sweet if completely inaccurate. The last of the stocks of the White Star Lines Company was purchased by Cunard Lines in 1947, and the last ship to sail under the colors of White Star was Britannic (not the sister of Titanic), which was sold for scrap in 1960.
