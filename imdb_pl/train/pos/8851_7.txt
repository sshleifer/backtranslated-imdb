While the title "Before the devil knows you are dead" comes from the Irish proverb that the movie is played out like a Greek tragedy. It all starts with an unsuccessful attack and is still out of control when the two brothers try to escape the clutter they've got into. <br /> <br /> The cast is well-assembled with Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke playing the above-mentioned brothers. Notable support includes Albert Finney as their father and Marisa Tomea as the wife of one brother and another lover. In addition to these principles, acting is nothing short of extraordinary. <br /> <br /> The story is convincing and told with some measure of verve. The narrative structure keeps things interesting, providing different points of view and frequent changes of time. Taking this into account, the unpredictability of the film is somewhat subdued, because at the beginning it can be seen that this story is a tragedy. In conclusion, the pretty impressive debut of the first screenwriter Kelly Masterson. <br /> <br /> Sidney Lumet's direction is well served, but I'm more impressed by the fact that he's still directing at the age of over eighty. I was less impressed with the score of Carter Burwell, but it is not a big distraction. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the film turns out to be an attractive viewing experience, and the story and presentation may have superficial similarities to other films that will remain a unique experience.
