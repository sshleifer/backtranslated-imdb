In today's world of digital fabrication, there is no computer that could replace the actor and writer. Unfortunately, this kind of film "driven by heroes" is currently too rare. Duvall's performance and James Earl Jones are faithful to the high expectations of the audience. I wonder if this movie was made for TV? It has a character similar to the narrative. It's hardly said that the performances are exceptional. The only thing that does not allow him to be a cinematic masterpiece is the lack of a great operator, but pretty pictures are not everything. How talented people like Jones and Duvall can still create such a good job in times when actors pose for digitization?
