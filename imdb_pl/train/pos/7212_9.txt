I would not hesitate to put this adaptation of "Death Trap" in the top five best stage adaptations to film ... Caine and Reeves (an underrated actor who never had the chance to do more than fuzzy romances and "Superman") are playing very well here. Even Dyan Cannon - which I normally do not care about - is perfectly manned in a role that uses her irritation as an actress. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if the comparison of "Deathtrap" from "Sleuth" - another brilliant stage adaptation with Michael Cain - is important and even honest. Yes, these two stories have a lot in common. But "Sleuth" is the same about class war as the battle of reason, and the house in "Sleuth" is set at least in the form in the movie, like two actors - the house does not really have an equivalent in "Deathtrap". And "Deathtrap" is not a battle of cunning, because it's a pointed vignette about how people are not damn good (and never as smart as they think) and deserve everything they get. I will just say that both films are great examples of the genre and worth your time and money. It's America after all. You do not have to choose! <br /> <br /> I will not reveal the twists, but I do not think it matters. I've watched the DVD eight or nine times in a dozen or so years, and I still enjoyed chemistry, timing and mean, terrifying moments when everything was "pear-shaped." Everything is done so well that driving becomes more important than the actual destination. <br /> <br /> Anyone who likes Hitchcock's black comedy and suspense will probably be enormously enjoying the "Deathtrap".
