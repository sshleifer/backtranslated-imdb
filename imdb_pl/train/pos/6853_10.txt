Dressed to Kill (1980) is the mysterious horror of Brian De Palma, who really works. The atmosphere is there. An atmosphere that scares you. And is not that what a horror should do. All actors Michael Caine is perfect as Dr. Robert Elliott, shrunk with a bit of secrecy. Angie Dickinson as Kate Miller, a frustrated mature woman is great. Keith Gordon as her son Peter is brilliant. Nancy Allen as Liz Blake the call girl is fantastic.Dennis Franz performs his typical role as a detective. His detective Marino is one of the most colorful in this film. There are a lot of scary scenes in the film. The elevator scene is one of them. a comparison between this and Psycho by Alfred Hitchcock (1960). There are some similarities between the two films. Both of these films can cause sleepless nights.
