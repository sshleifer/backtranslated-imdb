"Against All Flags" is a classic swashbuckler. It has all the elements that a fan of adventure can hope for and more, in the fact that the lady in danger is not really in danger. As Spitfire Stevens, Maureen O'Hara is the best in her sport, defeating enemies despite the social norms of this period. Anthony Quinn sums up the top three billed actors as ruthless captain Roc Brasiliano and turns out to be a cunning and capable nemesis for Brian Hawke (Flynn). For the classic adventure fan "Against All Flags" is a must-have. Although it may not be in the same league as some of Errol Flynn's earlier works (for example, Captain Blood and The Sea Hawk), it is still a very fun game.
