The Artemisia film can be regarded as betrayal or as a real artistic license. <br /> <br /> Which of them can do? <br /> <br /> In a documented history, Artemisia Gentileschi was thumbed, and yet she confirmed that she was r ***, Mary Garrard and Gloria Steinem confirmed eloquently. <br /> <br /> In the film, under another torture, she refused to condemn her lover / rapist. <br /> <br /> How can a movie differ so much from the history it received, but still inform the human heart? <br /> <br /> The answer is not difficult to find. In the film, the director and cast filled the hole in history with the power of imagination. <br /> <br /> This led to a conclusion that is different from the record. <br /> <br /> Let it be so. I think that both the album and the film are attractive. <br /> <br /> In the film and (as it seems) in history, Artemisia was a painter, above all. <br /> <br /> For this vision, bound in a thrilling (sic) movie composition, I am really grateful. <br /> <br /> I rarely saw a movie that forced my eyes to do it. <br /> <br /> David Broadhurst
