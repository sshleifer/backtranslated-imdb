A few years ago I came across a second syndication of this program and fell in love with it. There is TÃ©a Leoni and Holland Taylor and I laugh, one episode after the next. I think it did not make it so big and it was canceled after a few seasons, but I think it was a good run and I would suggest to watch it ... if the opportunity arises.
