I saw this program about 3-4 years ago. It was a funny dam! When I saw for the first time that he was playing on ETV (Estonian TV) and I started to like it. It is a pity that this concert is bad for me. Hyde is like a cool guy who likes to sing Frank Sinatra! And he comes up on stupid ideas. He got those glasses that are brown. I like this . And there is FeZ. The Pervert Group. We all know what he does when he is alone ... He wants to lie down badly. He even had it with his boss in one episode. He comes from India. And there is Michael, the stupidest guy in the whole group, probably the dumbest in town and his policeman! He is so stupid that I remember: Hyde says: Did you call for clay? - Michael does not come and say. Does anyone know how to turn off the siren? He is an urban playboy. Then comes Jackie, who is Michael's ex-girlfriend, and then Hyde's girlfriend. Then there's Eric's son, a grumpy war veteran and Kitty's son, a housewife. His one big pussy. But he loves Donna, his girlfriend, with whom they plan a marriage. Donna is one hot girl. Hmm what I forgot? ah Hyde lives in the basement.
