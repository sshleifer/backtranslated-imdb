Dr. Mordrid, what can I say? Jeffrey Combs did it again! <br /> <br /> Anton Mordrid has been on Earth for 100 years, waiting for Kabal, the evil wizard to kill him. Mordrid and Kabal used to train together as children, so Mordrid knows all of Kabal's tricks. <br /> <br /> The movie at the beginning is a bit confusing, but soon you feel part of the action. I will not reveal the ending, so go and see Dr. Mordrida! <br /> <br /> I think the movie is very pleasant because there is not much violence or sexual scenes in it. The film focused on the story and that's what I like! I believe that the best films are those in which times seem to fly. That's because you're so caught up in the movie. Dr. Mordrid is a fantastically engaging movie! I give him 20 out of 10. Worth seeing! <br /> <br />
