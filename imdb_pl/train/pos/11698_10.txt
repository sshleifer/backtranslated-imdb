I would say that the time has come, this movie was amazing ... and yes, if you do not feel like becoming a Christian, why watch it. I saw this movie after I was already saved and it turned out to be very moving. I can see that they have now moved these films to a different level and created the Left Behind series ... they carry out a close comparison and they are definitely more modern to reach people. I think that in order to properly evaluate this film, you should see it, there are 3 or 4 of them in the series, if I'm not mistaken ... do not use our comments for the evaluation, see the movie for yourself! ! God bless you, if that's why you're watching them.
