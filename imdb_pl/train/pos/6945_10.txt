My favorite movie genre is western, it's really the only movie genre of American origin. And despite Sergio Leone, no one does them like the Americans do. <br /> <br /> At the very top of my list of ten favorite westerns is Winchester 73. It was the first steaming and only black and white film of partnership between director Anthony Mann and actor James Stewart. It was also a groundbreaking movie in which Stewart chose a percentage of profits instead of the usual salary from Universal. Many such offers were for players, which made them as rich as the potentates who hired them. <br /> <br /> Anthony Mann has been doing mostly B photos, noir stuff without real budgets. Just before Winchester 73, Mann made a great western with Robert Taylor, Devil's Doorway, who is never praised enough. I'm sure James Stewart had to see this and decided that Mann was the person he'd decided to cooperate with. <br /> <br /> In this movie, Mann also developed a mini company in which John Ford was legendary. In addition to Stewart, others in the cast like Millard Mitchell, Steve Brodie, Dan Duryea, John McIntire, Jay C. Flippen and Rock Hudson will appear in Mann's future films. <br /> <br /> This is a simple plot, James Stewart is obsessed with finding a man named Dutch Henry Brown and killing him. Why do not I say it, but we have never seen the cold fury of James Stewart on the screen so far. Anthony Mann reached into the soul of Jimmy Stewart and pulled out a few demons that we are all afraid of having. <br /> <br /> Hatred is aptly shown at the big moment at the beginning of the movie. After Stewart and midfielder Millard Mitchell are disarmed by Wyatt Earp, played by Will Geer, because the weapon is not worn in Dodge City in Earp. In Dodge City there is a shooting competition for the Winchester rifle, and the favorite is Dutchman Henry Brown, played with a threat by Stephen McNally. Stewart, Mitchell and Geer enter the living room, and Stewart and McNally meet at the same moment and reach for a weapon that is not there. Look at the close ups of Stewart and McNally, they say more than 10 dialogue pages. <br /> <br /> The next character that Stewart falls in is Waco Johnny Dean played by Dan Duryea, who almost steals the movie. It could have been the greatest moment on Duryea's screen. He is a psychopathic outlaw who is deadly left-handed, even if he has two rifles. <br /> <br /> The next person Stewart meets is Shelley Winters, whose fianc√© is brought to a duel by Duryea and killed. Her best scenes are from Duryea who likes her. A game on time until she can safely escape from it. Guess who eventually ends? <br /> <br /> There are some great performances in some small roles, no sour note in the cast. John McIntire as a variable Indian trader, Jay C. Flippen as a gray-haired military sergeant and Rock Hudson got his first real mention as a young Indian chief. Even John Alexander, best known as "Theodore Roosevelt" in Arsenice and Old Lace, has a short but impressive role as the owner of a retail outlet where McNally and Stewart stop at different times. <br /> <br /> Mann and Stewart made eight films together, including five westerns, and they were ready to make the sixth western, Night Passage, when they had a fight, and Mann left the set. The end of a beautiful partnership that produced high quality movies.
