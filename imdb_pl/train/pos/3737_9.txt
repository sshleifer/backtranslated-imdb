First of all, this movie was a crazy ride all the way. The history of training soldiers, fighting with superiors, and finally grouping. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning to the very end. This is one of the war dramas worth seeing if you are in a constant struggle (sometimes beyond reason) and the horrors of what a boot camp is. <br /> <br /> The dynamics of the actors' interaction were sometimes amazing and sometimes humorous. How Bozz (Colin Farrel) copes with Paxton (Matthew Davis) in the story, from the camp to Tigerland, and eventually helps him. <br /> <br /> Innovative filming from a free hand has added a taste to the film. Continuous movement, continuous operation and constant confusion. Sometimes it was help. Others, not so much. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, it was more and more realistically. Some of the points in the film (sex scenes in particular) seemed a little too realistic, even though they added effect to a movie that would not be without them. it was a very difficult movie. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is one of Colin Farrel's better films (if not his best performance). Acting for each character was great. 9/10 -sysnuk3r
