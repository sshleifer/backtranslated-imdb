I almost did not see the movie, because I remember that the penguin march was not so exciting. I went mainly because Disney promised to plant a tree if I see it on the opening weekend, but after I saw it, it was just amazing; the fact that photographers can capture impossible images is simply worth the price. You can also see different habitats, other vegetation, animals and natural phenomena that will not only shock you - simply because you would never expect nature to be so magical and dynamic - but also touch your souls and raise the issue of humanity versus the world, how our lives have changed in nature to such a degree that we accept as natural beauty and wonders that are the quintessence of our biosphere. You do not have to be a land lover or an environmentalist who appreciates the ordinary grotesque of this document. You just have to be an inquisitive soul who questions the value and the miracle of life. Enjoy!
