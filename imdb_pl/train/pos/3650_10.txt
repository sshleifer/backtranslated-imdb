Sometimes Lady Luck smiles at me. Originally I did - and I copied - a VHS tape from this great TV presentation. I was heartbroken when I realized what I did because I could not get a copy of it anywhere else. <br /> <br /> Recently I subscribed to a digital cable and during the search of upcoming films, there was a movie broadcast planned for my surprise. This time, however, I made a copy of it on DVD, so there is no chance of repeating my mistake. <br /> <br /> After all, I could see him again after eight years and it was just as exciting and tense as when I first saw it. There is a bit of an introduction to this story, because my first contact with "Pandora's Clock" came with reading the book live on public radio. I just happened to tune in to the broadcast station on my way home for dinner, and from the first installment I was addicted. Every day I was waiting impatiently to read the next chapter. <br /> <br /> When I found out a few months later that the book will be broadcast on television as a movie, I made sure I cleared out my schedule for this event. <br /> <br /> First of all, I would like to say that the film was very faithful to the book, in contrast to what another reviewer said. This in itself is a rare achievement for television films. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I agree with others about the casting. I could not have imagined a better choice of the Dutch captain than Richard Dean Anderson. Literally, the movie could have broken up and burned without the proper cast for this key role. Anderson was never better and it's a pity we did not see him again. In fact, all cast members did a great job. <br /> <br /> The only complaint about this movie - and the book - was the inclusion of a "terrorist plot" in the arming of a private jet with air-to-air missiles and have its pilot stem and shoot down the shot down aircraft. Basically, we're talking about less than 36 hours to arrange and make such a plan, and people are not at all realistic considering all the players involved. It was also unrealistic how a small plane was hit by the first, and then two of its engines blown away. <br /> <br /> This beef aside, I enjoyed the tension of the building and it turned out to be very reliable, as foreign reactions governments were presented in the film, as well as in ours. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity to see this movie, do it at all costs.
