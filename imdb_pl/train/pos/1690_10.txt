I found memorable quotes looking for video clips; they forgot about one of my favorites ... <br /> <br /> Old person 1: You know, I remember when they first played this thing. <br /> <br /> Old person 2: Remember the pterodactyls. <br /> <br /> Old person 1: And I remember that you fell on it, hook and sinker. <br /> <br /> Old person 2: Oh, I'm not. <br /> <br /> Old Lady: You did it. You put a big bucket on your head and took army boys with you to fight the Martians. <br /> <br /> Old person 2: You are not dead yet?
