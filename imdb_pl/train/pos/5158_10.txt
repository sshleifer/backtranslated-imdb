There is something fascinating and strangely credible in this episode. From the very beginning, the atmosphere of tension creates the knowledge that a certain planet will break out within a few hours. Kirk, Spock, and McCoy set out to evacuate residents, all of whom seemed to be leaving unknown parts, with the exception of the senior librarian. <br /> <br /> Polite, but mysterious librarian's advice, where all citizens came to a break in the crisis, in which all three of the Enterprise's crew were unexpectedly in different eras of the planet's past. Kirk is in a period reminiscent of seventeenth-century England, while Spock and McCoy are trapped in abandoned, frozen waste. <br /> <br /> The indentation between the two stories and the various dangerous situations in which men are found is perfectly handled, back to the present with an unknown chance, while the minutes count towards the planet's outburst. <br /> <br /> Ingenious writing and good acting characterize this episode, with the moving performance of Mariette Hartley as a woman banished to the ice age, and Ian Wolfe as a charming librarian. Recalling the classic episode of City On The Edge of Forever, this tale of time travel is a rich and fascinating finale of the series that ended one episode later. It has to be one of the best in the whole series, especially remarkable, considering the generally lower quality of the third season.
