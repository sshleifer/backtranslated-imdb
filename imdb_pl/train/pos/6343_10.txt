Let me set the stage. It's school holidays and there is absolutely nothing in the movies. I am with my friend deciding what to see. We're looking for a movie that starts soon and "The Grinch" appears. We buy tickets without knowing what to expect. We got a fun roller coaster. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey (who I can add is my # 1 actor in the world) was absolutely great as Grinch in Ron Howard's best film (next to Apollo 13). The way the movie, scenery, actors, props and music were made was simply amazing. It really animated this childhood movie. <br /> <br /> The story is based on the story of a smile. As we all know, Grinch is a terrible person who can not stand Christmas. He lives high above the house and has never mingled well with the urban people. But one little girl will change the Grinch's look on life and others drastically. <br /> <br /> Cindy Lou Who (played by a charming new actress Taylor Moms) meets Grinch, who finds a nice place right away. He tries to break the barrier and help Grinch interact with the city's inhabitants. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is a barrel of laughter for the whole family, both children and parents. SOLID 10/10. Well done Jim. <br /> <br />
