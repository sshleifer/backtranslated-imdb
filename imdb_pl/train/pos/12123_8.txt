The electrifying performance of Bette Davis is such that it is difficult to remember other players. They were as perfect in their parts as Davis was in her - they just did not have so much to do. Some reviewers thought that the book is much better - but to give the film the due date, condensing a 600-page book to 83 minutes is no mean feat. The first part of the book did not even reach the screen - she talked about the childhood of Phillip, and then moved to Germany and Paris, where Phillip went to do something good as an artist. It is also the chronicle of his first affair - with Fanny Price, who kills himself when he realizes that Phillip can not bring back her feelings of love. It is a great book, but a wandering and I think that anyone who does not think too much about the film should read the book and realize how good the movie is. <br /> <br /> After realizing that there will only be an average painter, Phillip Carey (Leslie Howard), he returns to England with the hope of taking medicine. In the teahouse, he meets a grim waitress Mildred (Bette Davis). Although he is not interested in him and basically treats him like dirt, Phillip is obsessed. It is difficult to look at his efforts to find any kindness in this malicious vicious. In one of the scenes, he promises to meet him in the railway waiting room in the second class, when they almost miss him, making fun of him "why would I have to wait in the second class waiting room when the first class is available". You just want to shake him. The only moment he is pleasant to him is that he tells him that he will marry another man, a rough seller, Emil Miller (Alan Hale). With Mildred in the picture, he meets Nora (Kay Johnson), a beautiful woman who writes romantic novels under a male pseudonym. He jokes about the popularity of books among the servants (in the novel he saw Mildred reading them). Nora gives Phillip all the love and trust he needs, but he can not give her love. When Mildred returns (Miller does not marry her and has a child), of course, she deals with her and helps her child (in the film is treated as an object - always called a "child", never given name or sex - he repays him by escaping with his best friend **************************************************************************************************************************************. Philip takes her in. But he's changed and he just feels disgusted when he tries to show gratitude, the only way he knows how. Then comes one of the most cruel, verbal fights in the movie with phrases like "you cad, you dirty pig "," I kissed you just because you were begging me "and" when you went, I wiped my mouth, I STRESSED MY BIRTHDAY "!!! In the book, many Mildred actions, such as "you are a gentleman in every sense of the word", "I have nothing against" and "Lord of high and powerful", was connected with prostitutes and when Phillip meets her for the first time he hits him. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie shows that Phillip (really free from Mildred in the only way possible) can now love Sally. Again in the book, Sally tells Phillip that he thinks he has a child, but that only increases his self-confidence. This ending, like Mildred's "illness", could not be in the film - even pre-code. <br /> <br /> Kay Johnson has always been called to play sensible, reliable women - which she played to perfection, as she was obviously reasonable. Her Nora was a woman with whom Philip should stay. Frances Dee was one of the most beautiful sceneries. Apparently, she was being prepared for fame with some roles that proved she was not just a pretty face ("The Silver Cord" and "Blood Money"), but when she married Joel McCrea, her career began to fade. Her Sally did not push her talent to the limit. Apparently, Leslie Howard was not very helpful to Bette Davis on set - he was irritated that the English actress did not get the part. He used to throw her lines "while reading a book from the camera." He became interested when the newspaper reported that "the child escaped with the picture" !!! <br /> <br /> Very, very recommended.
