I caught the end of this movie channel surfing the cable channels and was so intrigued that I was looking for the next show. <br /> <br /> I really did not know what to expect after reading the program summary, but I left the movie feeling quite moved and worried. It also gave me as an adult who attended high school in the 80's, a little better insight into what our children have to face these days. <br /> <br /> The fact that you do not see shooting, just adds the coolness of the story. To see both children and adults struggling to understand and come to terms with senseless shootings was sometimes overwhelming. And I admit that I shed a lot of tears. <br /> <br /> In general, it was not the movie I was looking for, but I'm sure I saw it.
