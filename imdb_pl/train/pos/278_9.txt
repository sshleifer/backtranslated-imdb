I must say that Clive Barker's Undying is by far the best horror game ever made. I played Resident Evil, Silent Hill and Evil Dead and Castlevania, but none of them captures the pure joy that this game deals with its terrifying elements. Barker is good at what he does, which means joining the horror into our world and shows that his hand is clearly visible in this game. Heck, even his voice is in the game as one of the main characters. Full of lush graphics and enough atmosphere to shake the stick, Undying is a game that I beat in my books as the best horror title. I would only like it to reach the console system, but unfortunately the poor sales of PCs have ruined it in the bud.
