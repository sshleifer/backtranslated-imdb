A surprisingly complex and well-made study of the "First" serial killer in the USSR. This intense song, set in perestroika, is fully realized thanks to the performances of Stephen Reah and Donald Sutherland. <br /> <br /> Cicatillo's assassination is well-rounded and suggests some of his behavior while others are clearly visible, there is subtlety that is convincing without being explicitly graphic. Not for weak hearts, because its subject is often disturbing, but essential for the full development of the main participants of this fact-based story. <br /> <br /> HBO has provided us with a great movie in an unusual way. Congratulations to the director and editor of this amazing song. It's on my list of Top 10 Must see.
