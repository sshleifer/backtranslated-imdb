A good movie, as I said, but you definitely have to watch it, because it's worth watching. It's about two boys, Mac and Sam, who are great friends and work as fashion photographers, and the time of laughter begins when Mac (Akshay Kumar) begins to meet up with three air hostesses, leaving at the same time a suspect wife. Sam achieves a fortune and almost forgets his friend, but not quite. But Mac thinks so, so he starts meeting with hostesses. every step of the movie is garam masala, rock songs, but something is missing. The comedy does not live up to expectations and deserves a reward. It's nice, but not so perfect. Some laughed until their stomiks ached, but it did not deserve many to laugh. But of course everyone is different. So if you want to watch a movie, you can do it.
