When the movie "The Night Stalker" was originally screened in America in 1972, it became the highest-rated product created for T.V. a movie in history. Based on an unpublished novel by Jeff Rice, he told how an intrepid investigative reporter named Carl Kolchak (the late Darren McGavin) discovered the existence of a vampire in modern Las Vegas. When he appeared on British television four years later, it did not have the same impact, but my friends talked about it at school on Monday morning, as it was. We all agreed that it was one of the most exciting things he saw. <br /> <br /> I did not know about the existence of "The Night Strangler" until it appeared almost ten years later. I. V.V., who showed the films "Kolchak", apparently decided to hand over a spin-off series; felt that Barnaby Jones played Buddy Ebsen to be more like a drawer, and besides, the viewers could confuse "Kolczak" with "Kojak"! For years, my only source of information about the performance was an article in the Fangoria magazine. I could not even buy Jeff Rice's novel. <br /> <br /> Then something wonderful happened. In 1990, B.B.C.-2 staged a program as part of the Friday, late series dedicated to the supernatural "Mystery Train" hosted by Richard O'Brian. "Kolchak" found himself in trouble with "The Brain Eaters" and "Earth Vs.The Spider". The opening titles were trimmed, removing Kolczak's whistles and closing the inscriptions ... well, there were none. <br /> <br /> The first episode was shown "Werewolf". I can not say that I was very impressed, but I'm stuck in it and I'm glad I did it! <br /> <br /> I would really like to see it in 1974. My twelve-year-old would love it. Terrifying, full of humor, exciting, no wonder he fired Chris Carter's imagination. <br /> <br /> The biggest advantage of the program was of course McGavin. In contrast to the recent Ko≈Çczak, the original was a figure of every man, eccentrically dressed, rather conservative. He was for the supernatural, which "Columbo" was a crime. The late Simon Oakland was also the great boss of Kolchak Tony Vincenzo. The scenarios were filled with a wonderful, dry joke. I was happy to use the program because of the content of humor rather than horror. When I finished twenty episodes, I felt orphaned. <br /> <br /> "The X-Files" appeared a few years later and filled the void - but only to some extent. I wanted to recover Kolchak and Vincenzo. I am glad that the series has never been reborn. Without Oakland, it would not be the same. <br /> <br /> I now have Rice books and have read them several times. I was very surprised when Stephen King gave the first (in his book "Danse Macabre") because he is as good as everything he wrote. <br /> <br /> All right, so some monsters were not very modern, but so what? The new "Kolczak" completely lost the sense of the original. What you do not see is sometimes more frightening than what you do ... <br /> <br /> The best episode - "The worst episode of horror at height" - "The Sentry"
