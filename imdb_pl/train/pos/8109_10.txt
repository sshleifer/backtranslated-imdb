The story of HG Wells, the shape of things that were to come, was transformed into a film from 1935. A very well made science fiction story about a war that has lasted for decades. Including: Raymond Massey (arsen and old lace) Sir Cedric Hardwick (Frankenstein's ghost) Ralph Richardson (time bandits) and Margaretta Scott. Early flashes of helicopters, holograms, rocket ships and futuristic cities. This movie was ahead of its time. Led by William Cameron Menzies (invaders from Mars), it is very pleasant, like the earlier film metropolis (1927), but avoid the so-called sequel of the shape of things that were to be created in 1979. this movie has nothing to do with the original. wells such as Jules Verne had a vision of the future with their stories. A classic science fiction movie.10 of 10
