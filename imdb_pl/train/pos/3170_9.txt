Scenarzysta / director / co-star Adam Jones is heading for great things. It was the thought that I had after watching his feature film "Cross Eyed." A rare independent film makes me feel as good as his. A cleverly written and masterly directed "Cross Eyed" movie makes you involved from beginning to end. Adam Jones may not be a well-known name yet, but it will be so. If this movie had one or two "named actors", it would be a sensational "box office". It seems to me that it still has a chance to be noticed by mainstream audiences if only one film distributor devotes time to work on this film. Regardless of where it ends, if you have the opportunity to see it, you will not be disappointed.
