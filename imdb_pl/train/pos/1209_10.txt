In the era of such horrible cartoons, I am shocked to see a movie with such good morals that it will be on the IMDB list for animated films. <br /> <br /> This video is against the first one. I will not deny it. However, when I was in the target age group for this movie, I did not even notice it or it would not matter if I did. The people who made them use the "New Generation" have noticed that this is another way the Caretaker Family could start. Perhaps we have to decide how the Care Bear family really began. <br /> <br /> It was my favorite movie at the age of 3-6 and it did not scare me or make me wrong. > <br />
