A real classic. Beautifully filmed and played. Reveals the area of ​​Paris, which is lively and full of comedy and tragedy. Although the "Hotel du Nord" and the hotel itself still exist, it is not as cheerful (in the original sense of the word) and as joyous as it used to be. The film makes me miss the past, which has gone missing with a sigh and a bittersweet note.
