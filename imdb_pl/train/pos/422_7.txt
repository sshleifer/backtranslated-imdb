"The Plainsman" represents the director's prowess of Cecil B. DeMille in his most inaccurate and outdated condition. Establishes parallel themes for no less wonderful environment than Wild Bill Hickok (Gary Cooper), Buffalo Bill Cody (James Ellison), Calamity Jane (Jean Arthur), George Armstrong Custer and Abraham Lincoln to interact, even though in reality Lincoln was already dead when history takes place. Every now and again, DeMille rises dangerously close to the truth, but it just as easily leaves an undisturbed performance and spectacle. The film is an attempt to deepen Custer's last position with a lot of fiction, which is loosely based on the lives of people who were already the product of manufactured things and legends. Really, this is the world according to DeMille - the spirit of the time in the chronicles of entertainment, but a nice camping relic according to today's standards. <br /> <br /> TRANSFER: Taking into consideration the year of the film, it is a moderately attractive transfer, with often pure white and extremely solid blacks. In some scenes, there is a significant amount of film grain, and in others there is a lack of it. In conclusion, the picture quality is somewhat inconsistent, but it is never so bad or good? a little better than the middle of the road. Age-related artifacts are kept to a minimum, and digital anomalies do not distract attention. The sound is mono, but nicely balanced. <br /> <br /> SUPPLEMENTS: Forget it. This is universal! LINE LOWER: As a pseudo-story painted on celluloid, this western is fascinating and entertaining. Just take his heroes and history with a grain of salt? in some cases ?? the whole box seems more appropriate!
