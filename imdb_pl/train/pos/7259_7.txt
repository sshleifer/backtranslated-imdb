How can the viewer's rating for this movie be only 5.4 ?! The charming young Alisan Porter should automatically launch you at 6, when you decide your assessment. James Belushi is good at it too, his first good serious role, I did not like him in anything except About last night, until that. He was pretty good at Gang Related with Tupac. Kelly Lynch, you must love her. Well, yes. I'm just wondering what happened to Miss Porter? <br /> <br /> I gave Curly Sue 7
