A classic series that should be at least repeated or released on DVD. Billy Toth, after realizing that he was adopted after the death of his parents, embarks on a journey to find his real parents. After various rituals of the passage of his search, the discovery that the identity of his fathers has been stolen and used by a human trafficker in Europe ends! If I remember correctly, the series ends with Austrian (?) Ski slopes and a chase at the top of the cliff, leading to the death of Billys' father traitor filmed on the spot in various places in Europe and seemed to be refined and incredibly well executed, with several sections passing In the land of the movie noir and the thriller of the crime, the main arc was often overshadowed by the slices of life that Billy had gone through during his years of work to find the secrets of his mother and fathers, a class act, but undervalued and forgotten.
