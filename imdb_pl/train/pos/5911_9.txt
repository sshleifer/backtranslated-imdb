Do you remember Ralph Bakshi? A guy who was an animator at Terrytoons, then at Paramount Cartoon Studios, then he was a director at Fritz Cat 1 & 2 and Heavy Traffic? This is Coonskin. And it is really quite good. Racist, but good. The film takes place in Harlem Nights (no, duh, it was a working title), but with a surprise that becomes a lampoon of the Disney movie, Song of the South. <br /> <br /> It's about Sampson (Barry White) and Preacherman (Charles Gordone) are hurrying to help their friend, Randy (Philip Michael Thomas) escape from prison, but are stopped by the blockade and end up in the shooting with the police. While waiting for them, Randy reluctantly listens to his friend Pappy (Scatman Crothers) when he begins to tell Randy the story of "three guys I knew, just like you and your friends." The story of Pappy is told in a set of animations with photos and background materials live. <br /> <br /> Rabbit brother (voice of Tomasz), brother Niedźwiedź (voice of the White) and Preacher Lis (Gordon's voice) decide to pack and leave their southern settings after the bank will set their house and sell it to a man who he will turn them into a brothel. Coming to Harlem, Królik, Niedźwiedzia and Lisa, it turns out that this is not all. They meet with a crook named Simple Savior, a false revolutionary leader who is supposedly a "cousin" of Black Jesus and gives his followers "the power to kill whites". In a brilliant stage performance in his "church," Savior is brutalized by the symbols of black oppression, represented by images of John Wayne, Elvis Presley and Richard Nixon, before he asks his parishioners for "donations." <br /> <br /> The rabbit first appears against Madigan, a viciously racist and homophobic white policeman and mafia person who in various ways demonstrates his contempt for African Americans, including refusing to take a bath before the anticipated encounter with them (he believes they are not it's worth it). When Madigan finds out that Rabbit is taking his payoff, he and his cohorts, Ruby and Bobby, are brought to the night club "The Cottontail." <br /> <br /> The black stripper disperses him while the LSD sugar cube is thrown into his drink. Madigan, under the influence of the barbed drink, is then directed to a sexual connection with stereotypically effeminate gay and then put into clothes that the women represented a racist archetype, decorated with racist stuff, and finally pushed out of the club where he discovers that Ruby and Bobby are dead. <br /> <br /> Then, returning to himself after delirium of being a drug addict, he shoots around randomly and is shot by the police after shooting one of them. <br /> <br /> A rabbit, a bear, a fox and an opponent's boxer jump out of the boxing arena when it explodes. The story of the live action ends with Randy and Pappy's escape when they are shot by various white cops, but they manage to get out alive. <br /> <br /> This movie was controversial at the time and was re-edited by the director several times under the title Street Fight, which is obvious because Street Fight is a 2005 documentary about racism on the streets. In fact, this movie has the same theme as a documentary. <br /> <br /> This caused Bryanston Pictures, the distributor of this movie and the original classic Tobe Hopper, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, to retire from business. Because Paramount wanted to produce and distribute this movie, but because of racism, Bryanston took over Bakshi's production. <br /> <br /> Despite the controversy, it was worth it. The animation was amazing at the time, the plot makes sense and it is also fun. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERSION: 9/10
