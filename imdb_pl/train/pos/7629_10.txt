Kurt Russell IS Elvis, simple and simple. His involvement in this role resulted in what I think is the best bio film in history. If you're a fan of Elvis, see if you can. <br /> <br /> The film was made two years after Elvis' death. <br /> <br /> One council there are two versions - one after 180 minutes and one after 117 minutes. The only one to watch is longer. The shorter one has over an hour of recordings. It just does not work because the scenes in it often depend on the cut scenes. <br /> <br /> This masterpiece takes you from Elvis' childhood through his emergence as the greatest entertainment star. Shelley Winters and Bing Russell (Kurt's real father) are great as Elvis parents. And Pat Hingle provides a very competent colonel Tom Parker. <br /> <br /> Long live the king!
