Reading all comments is very exciting. but can anyone tell me the name of a real artist who painted pictures for good times. I realize that everyone refers to j.j. as an artist in the family, but there was a real family who has a real artist, and he has not yet gained recognition in this view. So if you do not mind that someone can say the name of a real artist, I would like to tell him "a job well done". I know this View is for a cast of GOOD TIMES, but would not you agree that he also touched us all. I'd like to know if he's still painting and if he's still alive. I would like some of his works to be displayed in my home.
