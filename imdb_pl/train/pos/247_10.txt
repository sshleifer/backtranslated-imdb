I love this movie because it showed that they do not kill it for fun, but that they save those they love! Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom did a great job playing Ned and Joe. He has some quick inappropriate scenes, but he's fine. The language is very gentle and sometimes it does not even know it is there. This movie shows that only because they are outlaws does not mean that they are malicious killers! I hope people will watch this movie and learn about important times in history, such as this one. There is one thing that fascinates me in this film, that they drew inspiration from their armor from the book that Ned was watching! Also how people remember them with their armor. I hope people will watch this movie and get interested in it just like me.
