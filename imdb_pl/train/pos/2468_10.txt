I went to see Hamlet because I was between jobs. I thought 4 hours would be great, I was a Branagh fan; Dead Again, Henry V. I was totally overwhelmed with the direction, acting and cinematography that this film won. Like other reviews, 4 hours pass quickly. Branagh does not play Hamlet, he's Hamlet, he was born to it. When I watch this movie, I am constantly trying to find mistakes, I looked at fools and did not notice them. The way he was able to move the camera into and out of the room with all the mirrors is a mystery to me. This movie was filmed in 70 miles. It is a pity that Columbia did not release this panorama version on VHS. I am the owner of a DVD player and I would take it to the Titanic every day. So Columbia, if you're listening, let this movie go like it should be watched! And I do not know what happened during the Oscars. It should be the best picture, best actor, best director, best photos. What movies did you watch? I was sorry for Branagh during the Oscars, when he paid tribute to Shakespeare on screen. They should have paid homage to Branagh for bringing us one of the greatest films of all time.
