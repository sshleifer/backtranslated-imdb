Zero Day leads to thinking and even rethinking why two boys / young men will do what they did - commit mutual suicide by killing their classmates. It captures what must be out of the bizarre way of being for two people who have chosen to withdraw from common courtesy to define their own / shared world through related destruction. <br /> <br /> This is not an ideal movie, but considering how much money / time the filmmaker and actors had - it is an extraordinary product. When it comes to explaining the motives and actions of two young suicides / murderers, he is better than the "Elephant" - when it comes to being a film that goes under our "rational" skin, it is a much better movie than almost anything you are likely to see . <br /> <br /> Faulty, but honest with terrible honesty.
