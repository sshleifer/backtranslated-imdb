This is definitely the funniest shortcut of two comic geniuses. From the moment they came in, Hardy just falls off the roof, which makes me laugh hysterically. I strongly suggest that every fan of Laurel and Hardy should see this short one. I also recommend all Ghost series. If you're looking for laughter, check out this video and you'll be happy.
