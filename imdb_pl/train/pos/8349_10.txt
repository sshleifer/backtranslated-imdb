The most-known film by Depardieu is the (1974) groundbreaking film by Bertrand Blier. It contains many highly sexual scenes bordering the X-rating, including one of Jeanne Moreau performing a hot version of Jules and Jim from the seventies, and trois with two hairy French hippies (Depardieu and Deware). In this movie, there is no such thing as sacred territory; everything is fair. <br /> <br /> It's very strange that Americans do not like this movie, while many of the French people I have met consider it to be classic. Something in this contradicts what the Americans have programmed to "like." <br /> <br /> Gerard and the late Patrick Deware are two whores, hippie bums with many sexual uncertainties, walking around women's abuse and committing minor crimes. They want to kick and anti-capitalist, euro-commie, slacker "freedom." Blier sows the hell of these two guys, and at the same time makes the bourgeois society itself look much more funny. The best, however, is how great the result of Stephane Grappelli gives the restless soul of tramps, a deeper subconscious or "higher ideal" that motivates all the madness in which they engage.
