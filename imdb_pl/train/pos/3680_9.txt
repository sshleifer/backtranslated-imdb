Paris, je t'aime (2006) is a film composed of 18 segments. You can do math - 18 segments in 120 minutes means that each director had seven minutes to tell his story. The film is based on the assumption that you can tell a story in such a short time. Founding works. Almost all segments are powerful, complete and satisfying. Each of them presents a different aspect of the Paris experience, and almost every director draws outstanding performances from the cast of great and almost great actors. <br /> <br /> There were so many powerful portraits in this movie that it's hard to choose one or two favorites. Juliette Binoche was probably the most memorable for me as the mother of mourning in the "Place des Victoires" segment, Gena Rowlands as an aging beauty in "Latin Quarter", Catalina Sandino Moreno as a maid in the "Loin du 16ème" segment and Margo Martindale as a mail carrier with Colorado, who learned to speak French, so he can visit Paris (segment "14ème Arrondissement"). <br /> <br /> Particularly noteworthy is Gulliver Hecq, probably the ugliest little boy who ever plagued an American tourist in a Paris metro station (the "Tuileries" segment). <br /> <br /> This is a great movie. My wife and I decided to rent her in a few months so that we could catch some of the subtle points that we definitely missed. Paris, however, is so beautifully photographed that I would suggest that you try to see it on the big screen. In any case, do not miss it!
