Wrestlemania 14 is not often considered one of the great Wrestlemania, but personally she would put it in my top five, if not in the top three. She has so many great things and really meant the birth of the Age of Postava, which was the best WWE age, in my opinion. HBK has the heart of a lion, and he, when he left Austin, was in his class a pure class. He's one of the hottest crowds you'll ever see, and he's got J.R and The King! <br /> <br /> Matches. <br /> <br /> 15 ?? team battle royal LOUD pop for a return L.O.D. I am not a fan of royal battles, and this is another average. Very predictable, even when you see it, it is obvious that he would have won L.O.D. Looking at Sunny for 8 minutes, definitely helps. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> World Championship in Heavy Weight WWF <br /> <br /> Taka Michinoku | C | Vs Aguila. <br /> <br /> Taka gets a surprising pop, with his entrance. Fast, fast and very exciting. If the two of them had more time, they would surely break the roof with their belongings. Taka wins with the driver Michinoku. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> WWF European Championship. <br /> <br /> Triple H | C | Vs Owen Hart Stipulation here, Chyna is chained to Slaughter. A good pop for Owen, a mixed response to Trips. Really, really underestimated match, which actually belongs to my favorites in Wrestlemania. They both mixed well together, and Owen can go with everyone. Expeditions win, with interference from Chyna. <br /> <br /> 4/5 <br /> <br /> Match of mixed tags. Marc Mero and Sable Vs Goldust and Luna. Defining pop for Sable, unprecedented at that time, for a woman. Sable looks really hot, and the crowd just eats it! Permanent sable songs, and they burst almost every time they enter the ring. Not bad for a match of mixed tags, he had fun antics and spent time well. The Sable team wins when Sable hits the TKO. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> WWF Intercontinental Championships. Ken Shamrock Vs The Rock | C |. Before I get to the match, I would like to note that The Rock presented its huge potential by interviewing Jennifer Flowers before his match. Nice pop for Shamrock, great heat for The Rock. Too disappointingly short, and I thought the ending was a little stupid, though Shamrock's burgeoning antics were amazing and the crowd went crazy. Rock retains the title when The Ref reverses the decision. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> Dumpster match, for WWF Tag Team Championship. <br /> <br /> Catcus Jack & Terry Funk Vs. The New Age Outlaws. Banits are not as far away as they were supposed to be at that time. The crowd is actually a bit dead for that, but I thought it had some great hardcore bits, with a few sick looking bumps. Cactus and Terry finally win titles. <br /> <br /> 3/5 <br /> <br /> Undertaker vs Kane. Big ovation for The Undertaker. Much better than there at WrestleMania 20, as well as in large and large matches, it was really good. It was a great fight, in which The Undertaker fell on the table, sick, looked sick. WWE was smart, which made Kane look strong, even by failure. After 2 kicks, Taker finally rejects him, having a third. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> WWF Championship. <br /> <br /> Special guest Enforcer "Mike Tyson" <br /> <br /> HBK | C | Vs Steve Austin. Big heat for Tyson. The crowd follows Austin, definitely one of the biggest pops I've ever heard. Mixed reaction, for HBK. It's a really special match, one of the biggest events in the history of wrestlemania that you can sense when J.R is even breathless. HBK gives it all, in what was to be his last match, and Austin was rarely better. The dislike and electricity from the crowd is amazing and is as exciting as it gets. Austin wins with a daze, and Tyson joins 3:16, knocking out Michaels. Austin's official victory is a miracle to see, with one of the nosyest crowds you'll ever see, King said it's true, they're going crazy. Bottom line. Wrestlemania 14 is one of the biggest truths. It has everything you want in Wrestlemania, and really kick started Era Postawy. This is special for me, because it was the first Wrestlemania I saw in 98. "The era of Austina started!" <br /> <br /> 9 1/2 / 10
