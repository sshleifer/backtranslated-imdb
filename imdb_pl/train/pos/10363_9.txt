Spoilers. The following: I started the book Evil Angels when she first came to light without knowing about the case. To give the press and the Austrians a break here, I was quite far before I questioned Chamberlain's guilt. The author apparently wanted the reader to understand why the public reached the conclusions they had made. John Bryson told the story in the same way he was presented to the jurors (and the press picked up by the press) of the arterial aerosol, actelone (??), the certainty of Dr. James Cameron that the collar was cut with scissors that the child could not be take all of the clothes when the buttons are still fastened, bloody handprint etc. all quite convincing. After all, they were experts in their fields who testified for no apparent reason, and the fact that the evidence was completely wrong was not obvious to me. It was also a very technical proof, difficult to understand for a layman. Up to this point, except for some rumor in the trials, hardly anyone has ever heard of dingo attacking a man; people did not believe it was possible. The audience was suspicious of the Seventh-day Adventists, whose origin made them worshipable, and all kinds of wild beliefs about them contributed to the appearance of guilt. Were it not for the devoted, gratuitous lawyers who worked tirelessly to investigate and oppose trial testimony, finding Azaria's clothing would not be enough to free Lindy from prison. The book shook me because of this and since then I have been reluctant to reach a conclusion about the guilt of anyone (except for OJ, of course). I was excited that a film about the case would be made and I do not think it would be better. I always liked Sam, with whom I could completely identify myself, and Meryl was as perfect as ever. Beautiful photography, haunting music. I think it is not only a very good but very important movie. It is a pity that at the time of the release she did not receive a larger advertisement.
