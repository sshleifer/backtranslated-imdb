so yes, it is quite nostalgic watching the first episode, because this is one episode I definitely remember. I like watching the first season and in comparison to the action shows we have now, this concert seems bad. but honestly I like the "less brutal" part of the series, and the plot has more content than new ones. I thought it was interesting that Airwolf and JAG Belisario have a similar theme - the main actor (Hawke and Harm) both are looking for a relative of MIA (brother, father). I wonder if Robert Belisario's personal life imitates these two show motifs. <br /> <br /> Question - does anyone have pictures of Hawke's cabin? I love this cabin (a bit like my dream cabin) and this is one of the scenes I remember about Airwolf.
