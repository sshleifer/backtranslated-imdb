This movie shows people in the middle of the hottest 2 days in Austria. It shows people humiliating other peoples and cruel towards other nations. It shows the inability of people to communicate or talk to others. <br /> <br /> During the show I participated in the people's trip, because they could not watch the movie anymore. And rightly so. Because the movie is not easy to watch. He has a very depressing message and there is no moment of mercy in the film. It's a very cruel movie, not for everyone. You can not talk about the pleasure conditions of this movie. It grabs you in the throat and never lets go, and in the end you just feel breathless because of its intensity. <br /> <br /> I can not "recommend" or "not recommend" this video. You should make your own mind based on what I said earlier. Just be aware that it is not an ordinary movie and is not intended for everyone.
