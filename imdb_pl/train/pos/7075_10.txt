Time paradoxes are a devil's snare to the indigent minds. They are really wondering about "what if?" The type of road. Creators and authors have dealt with this in many films and on television, including "Star Trek: First Contact", the trilogy "Back to the Future", "Excellent adventure of Bill and Ted", "Groundhog Day" and Stargate SG1 homage, " Window of Opportunity. " Heinlein's "All You Zombies" was made several dozen years ago, and yet for the first time, he will visit people reading this story. <br /> <br /> In the case of Terry Gilliam's excellent "12 Monkeys", it's hard to determine what continuity problems can be compared to plot elements that will lead us to rethink our film concept. Repeated viewing will lead us to different conclusions if we keep an open mind. <br /> <br /> Some, seeing this movie for the first time, will recognize Cole, played by Bruce Willis, for schizophrenic. Most will see Cole as a man concerned about what Adams describes as "the constant tug of experience" he visits during his travels. <br /> <br /> Unlike other stories about travels during "12 monkeys", it is not clear if the future story can be changed by manipulating events in the past. Cole tells his psychiatrist, Railly (Madeleine Stowe), that this time can not be changed, but the phone call from the airport is intercepted by PO scientists as he was sent back to 1996, in his own personal time line. > <br /> Even this can be interpreted as an event that must have happened in one universe of the time line to ensure that the timeline does not change ... Cole must die before the eyes of the younger Self for fate. If this is the case, time is like a fluid, it always finds its own level or path, regardless of the external forces acting on it. It is disturbing that the mind is too divorced over such things. <br /> <br /> If you can change future events that will guide the actions of those who have the power to send people in time, as we see on the plane at the end of the movie, it means that the future CAN be changed by manipulating past events. .. or so? The film probably led to many drunken fights in bars frequented by physicists and mathematicians
