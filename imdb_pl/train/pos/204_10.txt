First of all, I do not like almost all of Neil Simon's films. But there's something special about it that draws me in and I'd say it's one of the most fun comedies I've ever seen. The second time I saw it, the connection was clear. When did Neil Simon meet my grandmothers? <br /> <br /> Ah, afraid that they can sue, he changed them into men. And how boring it would be if they were just housewives, showbiz stars are more fun. This is a personal review, and my still living grandmother at the age of 97 (she even experienced a great incarnation of Walter Matthau!) She would deny it - but some of you have to find a resonance in these characters. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I have little tolerance for George Burns, but somehow he played in one of the greatest supporting performances I can remember (and my deceased grandmother even liked it, although she did not recognize the extraordinary similarities that she shared with the main character of the film). br /> <br /> Very ethnic in taste, and upstairs you will either laugh and laugh or turn off. For me, the pleasure lasts.
