This movie is really special. It's a very beautiful movie. What begins with three orphans, Sho, his brother Shinji and their friend Toshi, They are poor children living on the street, but one day they managed to steal a sack full of money, and then they could live, buy a house, and their life seems to be much better. They create new friends, friends of life. But something went wrong and become enemies and everything ends up killing each other. <br /> <br /> At the beginning I was negative about this film, because when singers (Gackt - Solo, former vocalist in Malice Mizer, Hyde - Solo, singer in L'Arc ~ en ~ Ciel, both very well known in Japan and Wang Lee-Hom - a Taiwanese singer) trying to become actors, but it's not like other actors singing - cinema. They do a great job and have no previous experience in movies (except Lee-Homa, who was previously in two films). <br /> <br /> This is absolutely one of my favorite movies. Maybe it's a bit because I'm a big fan of Hyde, but - it's the movie that made me discover it. <br /> <br /> Well, Gackt (playing the protagonist - Sho orphan) was part of the group that wrote the script, and he insisted that Hyde play a friend Sho, vampire Kei. At the time, they did not know each other, at least not like friends. But after the film, they became really good friends, which also shows us that they really worked hard on this film and that they had a good cooperation. <br /> <br /> The film has many different feelings from history, Love, Hate, sadness, pain, loneliness, happiness and so on. I think the first hour is the best, it's so beautiful. After that people die, Kei leaves and everything changes so much. But it's still a great movie, it's the only movie that ever made me cry, it ends so sad but still beautiful. <br /> <br /> So if you have not seen this movie, you really should. Because it's wonderful, but sad. You will not regret. ^^
