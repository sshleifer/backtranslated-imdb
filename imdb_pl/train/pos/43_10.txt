I really liked this movie. It really intrigued me how Deanna and Alicia became friends with such a tragedy. Alicia was just a restless soul, and Deanna was so happy that she saw someone after being shot. My only complaint was that at first it was a bit slow and it took some time to get to the basics of things. Other than that it was great.
