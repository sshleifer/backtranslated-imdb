Sleepwalkers are creatures that completely suck the human life force to survive ... but they can only use virgins (it is not explained why). Charles Brady (Brian Krause) is one who has to feed his mother Mary (Alice Krige). He follows a nice Tanya (Madchen Amick). Will she run away? <br /> <br /> On one side is a GREAT horror movie. Fast, lots of blood and blood and a nice, twisted sense of humor. There are many humorous references for horror lovers (Castle Rock is mentioned once). Krause is also perfect (who would have thought he could run after "Return to the Blue Lagoon"), like Kirge and Amick. But I think this movie is annoying. <br /> <br /> It has been written on the screen by Stephen King and is insanely foggy. Sleepwalkers are never fully explained. From where they are? Why are they called? Why does the son have to feed his mother? Why do cats hate them and kill them? What are their powers (at some point Krause makes the car disappear, changes color and style!)? Why do they have to feed themselves with the life force of people? Why do they only have to be virgins? Why is the son having sex with his mother? None of them has been explained, leaving the story misleading. It is really a pity, because these questions aside are a perfect horror. Perfect makeup and special effects. <br /> <br /> Quick, bloody and a lot of fun. If only the script was better. A fairly explicit sex scene was also modified between Krause and Krige (you could say) to get R. I can only give it 7.
