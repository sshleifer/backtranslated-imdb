A real dark noir movie and a very graphic movie, a nice story about a man seeking redemption, who may have left it all too late. Visually there are some really cool artistically amazing scenes, which you can do with a minimum budget. A full assessment of Gareth Maxwell Roberts and the band, I am waiting for the next project with new ideas, although I hope that more British actors will be great. Lisa Ray looked beautiful without seeing her before and I hope to see her in the future. The topic of all the interesting sex, drugs and violence. Bring it. I would definitely say I borrow this one and see if you are in the mood for a half moody noir.
