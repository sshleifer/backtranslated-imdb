I agree with another user here and I must say that this is one of the best Kung Fu movies ever! I watched it as a child and I loved it! Scenes of scaffolding are brilliant and you can really empathize with this guy because he is treated as an outcast. Good humor and fantastic kung fu is a movie theater! If you like Kung Fu, you'll love it!
