Events of September 11, 2001. They do not require additional interest on the part of people in the form of following the training of the debutant or the progress of two French brothers. In my opinion, it would be better to skip it. I think the directors have tried too much, maybe felt that the events of the day need history as a background. The comment of one of the policemen - "this is for Disneyworld" is apt. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it is fascinating to watch events. The filmmakers were in all the right places at the right time, no other material on that day matched what they were doing.
