Who votes in these assessments? "Jacknife" is a beautifully played, well-watched work, with the actors at the helm, especially Ed Harris and unsurpassed Robert DeNiro (please do not mention Marlon Brando in the same breath of the man-seeing "Taxi Driver" to confirm this point). Is this a "mundane" movie because there is no sex / senseless action / nakedness in it. This film is about the complexity of the characters involved. Ed Harris makes you feel at all times with him, and his emotional outburst at the end is painful. The part where he orders a young man in the bar to take off his military clothes is a wonderful observation of how fashion and movies take advantage of the tragic situations and how frustrated the real men must feel to see a young, sporty outfit. In this topic, "Casino" 7.8 out of 10? One of the greatest films of all time, from one of the greatest directors, with the participation of the greatest film actor of all time, with the most terrifying film psychotic gangster in history, only orders just slightly above average? COME ON!!!!!
