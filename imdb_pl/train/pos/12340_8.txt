You can complain about this movie version of the mystical game of Molnar - Farrell looks good in his title role, but his line readings, to be honest, stink. To a large extent this is also due to the fact that it was considered the first film using back projection. The sets look stunning. <br /> <br /> However, there are two strengths of this series: although the dialogue reads get stuck, the visual performances are excellent. Rose Hobart, like Julie, is scarcely remembered today: mainly for ROSE HOBART, in which Joseph Cornell cut out the EAST OF BORNEO programmer to simply photograph it. Her wonderful beauty and simple (though amazing) performances help to repair some of the damage related to the ground in the sections of this movie. <br /> <br /> However, one of the themes of Borzage is the mystical power of love and is to deal with the heavenly sections that make it great, from the arrival of the celestial train to the journey to the "Hot Place". H. B. Warner's performance is as perfect as ever. <br /> <br /> So we have a flawed but very interesting version. It seems to me that the Lang version from 1934 is better, like the celestial scenes in Henry King's CAROUSEL version, a watered down remake of music. But I still liked this version very much and I think you should give her a chance.
