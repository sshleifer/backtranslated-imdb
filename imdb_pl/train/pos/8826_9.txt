If you're amused by straightforward events that are logical in a given illogical situation, you'll love this whimsical, 8-minute Spanish movie. <br /> <br /> A woman enters a small cafe. The scene looks ordinary, but the opponent, customers and two musicians seem strangely toned down. <br /> <br /> Suddenly, the musicians play and one man starts singing the title song, dancing on the countertops with music and comedy gestures. Customers, initially immobilized, in intervals, called (wrong, but cheerfully) phrases from the song, read from pieces of paper in their hands. From time to time, they jump and dance (awkwardly but seriously) in choreographic movements, like assistant singers. <br /> <br /> But why ??? the woman is wondering. The answer is revealed when the soloist's jacket opens and she sees what is pinned on her chest - just before the explosive climax ... <br /> <br /> Even if you do not catch the song (probably ironic), perfect situations should give you smile and giggle ... I would like to see it again!
