This complicated story begins quite simply, and the English journalist accepts the bet of Edgar Allen Poe and his friend Lord Blackwood that he can not spend the night in the haunted Blackwood castle. There, the writer circulates in dusty rooms and corridors, until the music and gaze of a Waltzing couple lead him to an empty room. He sits at the harpsichord and starts playing the melody he has heard, and is surprised that he has been hit on the shoulder by the stunningly beautiful Elizabeth Blackwood. She informs him with an ambiguous, charming / weird way that she has prepared his room upstairs and that someone always awaits this evening ... The night of the dead. In this way, a surprising series of supernatural events that stun the journalist for the rest of the night begins. SPOILER AHEAD: Probably will not surprise too many viewers to find out that the lovely Elisabeth is actually a ghost. It does not bother her to fall in love with a journalist, but she does things more complicated for them than for the average couple. It's a funny movie with absolutely everything: ghosts, a horrible castle, repeated visions of past events, sex and violence (although both have been toned down in the version that most Americans have seen for years). Seductive, captivating Barbara Steele is the main reason to see it. He has a strange charisma that no one else has seen in movies. Recommended!
