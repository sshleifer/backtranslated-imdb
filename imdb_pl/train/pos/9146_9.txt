This electrifying musical has more than a whiff of egotism from his star, the musical genius that Prince is. The film has about 90 minutes of posing, but it is really easy to understand why it is such a cult classic. <br /> <br /> Like other films that are focused around a fighting young musician who is trying to be big, it has a note of drama that gives the music numbers a dimension. Although this last movie is not as good as 8 miles, it's fun and the soundtrack is much better. On the dramatic side, the story focuses on Kid (Prince), a young artist and a permanent place in the club. The club's owner is frustrated by the arrogance of Kid and does not know much that a Kid can be fired and replaced by a rival. On one side, the Kid's parents are in trouble, and his father brutally uses her. During the film, Kid learns a few lessons of life and learns to appreciate his friends more. That's all, of course, we've seen in period dramas, but it combines it as a musical, very stylized musical. <br /> <br /> The cast is good. Prince is pretty good at the drama scene when he does not pose. He seems to be human and is relative. Clarence Williams is also very good as an offensive father. Appollonia Kotero will debut as sexy interest in princesses. <br /> <br /> The main advantage of the film, however, is the excellent soundtrack. Music numbers are well staged and electrifying. Prince is undoubtedly a musical maestro, albeit very eccentric. When he's inspired, he's great, but on the other hand he often makes songs that are only for his own taste, and from time to time his experiments may overlook, but the same applies to many musical geniuses. The soundtrack for this movie is excellent, and the only weak point is Sexshooter. The break in the performance of Purple Rain is however exceptional. This is one of my favorite songs. *** <br /> <br />
