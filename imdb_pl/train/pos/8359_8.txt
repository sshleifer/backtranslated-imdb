Bertrand Blier is indeed the l'enfant terrible of the French cinema, and in the seventies he could always shock public opinion. Filmed by his favorite duo (Depardieu and Dewaere) and the usual dose of sex (Miou-Miou plays his typical role, at least the one from the seventies as small, we could know that ten years later will be the best French actress). At the beginning, "Les Valseuses" is also one of the first roadmovies, because the viewer is taken on several trips by two small criminals. Those who are only happy with family life or just do not know anything more, the film would be shocking, but this movie is more than just that lets you think about all the usual things in life (working in the car, being limited at work etc. .). This is a kind of criticism against the society of the hypocrites in which we live. A great job and it only makes you want two things: Dewaere died too young because he was a toptor and of course Depardieu, better get stuck with French movies as it proves here that no one can beat him. A timeless classic and 20 years later will still be shocking ...
