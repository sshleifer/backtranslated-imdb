I did not expect a strong movie experience "Girlfight". This is India; low budget, no big actors, first year director. I heard that it was good, but not so good. <br /> <br /> Placed in a modern, ethnic, working-class Brooklyn, Karyn Kusama has done an extraordinary job of capturing the everyday Latin city struggles. Diana, the heroine, seething with anger and attacks her peers, getting into trouble with the school and her friends. He is raised by his lonely father who seems to love her and her brother, but applies a strict, gender-based, double standard to his children. The father's dual standard illustrates the fact that Tiny, a brother, takes boxing lessons at the local gym, but Diana does not have similar jobs. In the case of a task at the gym to meet Tina, Diana is fascinated with boxing. Tiny does not like boxing, so he and Diana occupy space; he gets money from Dad and then passes it on to Diana to take lessons in his place. <br /> <br /> This is a really good movie because Diana grows up and learns about herself through boxing, meets a guy, and deals with very serious problems. There are no chuckles, "everything that can go well, goes well" resolution a la "Bend It Like Beckham". The reality and related personal problems are too big to be solved, but in my opinion "Girlfight" is a better and more satisfying film.
