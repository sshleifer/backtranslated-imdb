I've seen this movie several times and watched it today (in TCM) only because of Geraldine Fitzgerald. She is a very underrated actress and I must admit that I have fallen in love with her since I saw her (probably in "Wuthering Heights" 40 or more years ago). The real star in this film, however, is Paul Lukas and he deserved all the distinctions he received. He explains whether we like it or not, that the end justifies the means. Nazism had to be stopped and everything that helped was good. He gave his children a line about being angry, and that should not be bad, but as he said before, talking to adults, he would do it without hesitation. Lukas gave the perfect picture of the man caught in this situation and made it clear that what he did was very difficult. <br /> <br /> Some people think that his victim was a Nazi, but I do not think so - I think he was only for money. His Nazi collaborators knew this and therefore they did not have much use for him. <br /> <br /> An interesting point in the film, and probably in art, is the fact that Muller (Lucas) is German. While the anti-German hysteria of World War I did not repeat itself during World War II, there were significant anti-German moods, and some Germans were buried similar to what happened in California with people of Japanese descent. Hellman wrote a play about good Germans at that time (maybe she thought they were the ones who signed the Hitler-Soviet pact!). After all, the American and British air forces bombed German cities and did not scruple by killing innocent civilians. I think, however, that the bombing of Dresden and the firestorm took place later, after the release of "Watch on the Rhine." <br /> <br /> The title is something like a word game because the watch looks west from Germany. In fact, Watch am Rhein was a German marching song - used in World War II, but the Nazis had their own marching song, which was also used. But Muller IS a German and engages in his own "Wach am Rhein". <br /> <br /> All other actors did a great job here; Although Bodo was too much, there are children like him. I'm surprised he did not betray his father's secret. In real life, he can do it.
