Lost is the best television series. First of all, he has GREAT actors and great directing. Writing is a very controversial issue because writing in the first two seasons was extraordinary, but after season 3, writing became very complicated. Who is Jacob, why are the polar bears on the island, what is the fog, how the island disappeared, who is Richard Alpert, many people think that the writers are lost and that they arouse many questions and secrets that they can not explain. I believe these people are wrong. I have confidence in writers. I think that if the secrets are revealed from now on, all the charm of the series will disappear. In any case, the biggest TV series is undoubtedly lost and it will last for a long time.
