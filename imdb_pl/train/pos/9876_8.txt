The Lily Mars presentation is a really nice little movie that shows the comedic skills of actress Judy Garland along with her standard singing moments. The plot consists of Lily Mars marking for the producer John Thornway for her great break. I think the comedy is light here and it is not too heavy. I really recommend this movie to everyone. Judy is breathtaking in this role!
