I've seen this movie literally over 100 times ... it's absolutely full of entertainment !!! Powers Boothe gives great results. As a fan of actors such as William Shatner (Impulse, 1974) and Ron Liebmann (Up The Academy, 1981) I never thought that an actor could capture "intensity" like Shatner and Liebmann in these roles until I saw Boothe as Jim Jones ! As for me, Powers Boothe IS Jim Jones ... this movie captures his best performance !!!
