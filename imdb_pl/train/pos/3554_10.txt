Marlon Brando and Frank Sinatra hated each other during this film and in the following years. Brando asked Sinatra for singing lessons, but Sinatra (who was already upset by the fact that he was cast as Nathan Detroit when he wanted this role Skye Masterson) wanted to be a star in production and he did not want anyone to be better than him. He told Brando to get lost, so to get back to him, Marlon was still filming a scene in a restaurant where Sinatra ate cheesecake so he had to eat, eat and eat. In later years, Sinatra gave Brando the nickname "Mumbles" or "Mr.Mumbles" because of the way he speaks.
