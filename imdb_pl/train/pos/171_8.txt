I do not agree with anyone who could dismiss this movie as "just" entertainment. Dancing carefree, roaring in the 1920s, in the early days of the Great Depression, Dance, Fools, Dance is the heart of a serious warning, with a clear message of how best to survive these hard times. However, this dynamic and tightly filmed movie is far from a grim story about morality. <br /> <br /> In the 1930s, Hollywood had the talent to break up one entertaining * and * enlightening audience after another, all without wasting a movie frame. Dance, Fools, Dance - one of * four * films that Harry Beaumont directed in 1931 - has only 80 minutes, but his characters are well developed, his story never seems hasty and despite many twists, the audience is never left behind. <br /> <br /> With the sole exception of Lester Vail, just how crazy the interest in Bob Townsend's love is, the supporting cast is equally strong. Noteworthy are William Bakewell as Crawford's brother, Cliff Edwards (best known as Jimina Cricket) as reporter Bert Scranton and Clark Gable in the early supporting role as gangster Jake Luva. <br /> <br /> But this is Joan Crawford's movie, and she absolutely shines in it. This less-known version of Crawford, produced at the age of only 27, will probably be unrecognizable for people who are more familiar with its later work. But here's the proof that long before she took the Oscar home for Mildred Pierce, Crawford was a star in the true sense of the word, a great actress with the charisma to wear the image herself. <br /> <br /> Result: EIGHT OF THIS
