Yes, the archetype of a simple but inspiring movie. The end, when all the crowd in the stadium gets up and people raise their hands, gives me a chill when I see him. It's just genius. Joseph is wonderful as a lonely and sad kid who until now was disappointed by anyone and everything in his life. The way he interacts with Danny Glover and tries to convince him to magic and angels is fun and joyous. Very nice family movie with - I admit - quite a lucky happy end. But hey, it does not matter, the film retains its basic quality through good actions and inspiring themes.
