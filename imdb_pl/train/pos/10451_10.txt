"Before Sunrise" is a great love story that must belong to my 5 favorite movies. Dialogue and acting are great. I love characters and their ideas and thoughts. Of course, romantic Vienna, introduced in the film, does not exist (you will not find a poet sitting on the river in the middle of the night) and you can not reach all places only one night, or (especially if you are a stranger and this is your first night in Vienna). But that is not the point. The relationship of two characters is much more important and this part of the story is not unrealistic at all. Although nothing really happens, the movie never gets boring. The ending is really sad without being a "Titanic" or something like that. Even if you do not like love stories, you should watch this movie! I am a bit skeptical about the continuation, which will be released in the summer. The first part is, I think, perfect.
