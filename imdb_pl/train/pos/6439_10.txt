I went to see this movie twice a week and I can summarize it in one word (which I usually do not use lightly): Wonderful! In my opinion, the best movie ever made. Who deserves Oscars and other awards, if not the Swedish crew who created the film perfection in the last scenes of the film, when everything that was said (and not said) in all of history is drawn together? Just as Daniel Dareusa's character evokes so many feelings and long-suppressed feelings among the people around him, the film does the same for the viewers: you go out with disgust and the heart is full. A great thing! Next time, when you ask yourself the question: "What is the meaning of life", maybe think about how you feel after a rich experience, such as "Is in heaven": Happy, satisfied, fulfilled. Speaking this to Mrs. Dalloway from Virginia Woolf: "Such moments are enough."
