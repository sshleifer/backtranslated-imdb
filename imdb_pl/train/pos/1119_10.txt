Sandra Bernhard's Without You I'm Nothing, a film released in 1990, followed in the footsteps of her off-Broadway production from 1988 ... what she and others call in the film as her "hit-hit". "<br /> <br /> There were a few changes in the monologues and single lines, and the movie version visually restores the story, taking Sandra from a fabulous existence as a successful stage artist in New York, during what she calls her" superstar summer "to an illusory, almost desperate existence back in her home in Los Angeles - her fictitious manager in the film refers to the fact that Sandra returns "to her roots, to ... exclusive clubs such as the Parisian Room. "<br /> <br /> There's something here that needs to be done. Sandra tries to appeal to her liberal worldview and her harsh criticism of American pop culture to the public who does not quite see it. In L.A. he plays with the audience mostly black, trying to connect his ideas, when it seems that all these people want a "Shashonna", a striptease similar to Madonna. And even when Shashonna dances to drums resembling those of "Like a Virgin," there is not much to say about the joy of the viewers. The scene in the club throughout the movie is drier than the bone. A funny scene to catch is from a mad man from the audience helping Shashonna in pants. <br /> <br /> But if it goes down, Sandra does it with style and strength, passing everything from helpless self-confidence to piercing vulnerability ... to the point where she is naked (literally) begging for acceptance, yet he is still swimming in the pool of his transparent star. Her descriptions of interaction with Calvin Klein, Jerry Lewis, Bianca Jagger, Ralph Lauren and (what we believe is) Warren Beatty are fictional and fun. <br /> <br /> Sandra begins her performance in her most awkward moment, performing a silent but mysterious interpretation of Nina Simone's song "Four Women", dressed in mufti and other African costumes, singing lines such as "my skin is black "" My hair is woolly "and" they call me Sweet Things. <br /> <br /> Resurrects and celebrates the ghosts of underground art in an incredibly funny description of the crazy real estate auction for Andy Warhol: "Leave Andy the wisdom and sensitivity for hours and hours of hardship and work that have become an Indian product. .. that they were so fortunate that they could earn at this whole event in Santa Fe. "<br /> <br /> Explains the Hollywood excess, comforting a desperate friend, then reprimanding him, saying," Lord, when it comes to Ishtar, I get up now and leave forever because it's too lenient for me! "<br /> <br /> Sandra illustrates the expectations of women in the era of feminism. Dressed like a Cosmo girl, Sandra talks about her fantasy of a young girl to be a secretary and marry her boss. Finally he concludes with relief: "I will never be a statistician, not me. I am less than 35 years old and I am going to get married! "<br /> <br /> Sandra praises the openness of sexuality in society:" When he touches you at night, does he feel good or does he feel real? I say it's real ... MIGHTY real. "<br /> <br /> Finally, he cries for a change in progressive American society, disco-guided by Patrick Cowley's and New Year's fans and proclaiming:" Ultimately everyone will have fun! " /> <br /> All this is in the form of brilliant, great but wonderful performances of cabaret songs written and written by Billy Paul, Burt Bacharach, Hank Williams and Laura Nyro, just to name a few. At the same time, the idealized, fictional incarnation of Sandra - her self-generated mirror reflection - rises around the city, a beautiful black model with flowing dresses and tight corsets reading Kabala, studying chemistry and listening to rap music NWA. br /> <br /> Sandra Bernhard in Without You I am nothing, I am studying the emotions and existence with which she has only been playing as a regular guest in Late Night With David Letterman. Her almost childish enthusiasm for shock, presented throughout the 1980s, is rejected in the face of a more subtle charm, and her self-confidence in the face of materialism and the American celebrity turns out to be refreshing. Such an approach to comedy would change Sandra's direction forever and would mark a more mature, more friendly artist who will come. <br /> <br /> If you like subtle humor to the extent that you engage in internal jokes about glamor, celebrities, sex, loneliness, despair and shallow expressions of love and kinship, this movie will keep you seam. It may not be fun. Maybe for some it is a bit disturbing and even strange. But think about the emptiness of the world that Sandra paints for you and you will understand how funny and genius it really is. <br /> <br /> But see without you anything with a friend "in acquaintance" because it is definitely more fun this way. Before you know it, you will both be trading sandra Sandra and confusing everyone else.
