One of the most interesting elements of Gilliam's movie is that well-imagined visuals, disturbing backgrounds and frustrated heroes are proof of the creator's commitment. Instead of the majority of films (where the filmmaker is a rental director who is paid for a star or two), you can feel the presence of Terry Gilliam thanks to this experience. "12 monkeys" is proof of Gilliam's own vision and style, in contrast to making unconventional films for themselves. "12 monkeys" is a variation on similar themes of Gilliam's repertoire: oppressive / recessive societies, loneliness of the hero, frustration associated with disbelief and parallel kingdoms. In this movie, Gilliam does a great job, blurring the lines between the two worlds, using ambiguity to force the audience to believe, not get to know. This tendency of Gilliam to disregard certain gaps leads to criticism of the art-house pretentiousness. The difference between Gilliam and the artistic poses is that Gilliam's choices clearly have a purpose, and all his paintings have meaning. Two almost identical Cole bath scenes at the beginning are aimed at a comparison that leaves viewers uncertain. His bald head is a sign of uniformity in a world immersed in illness, but makes him recognizable in the world of 1996. The title itself is a sign of Gilliam's creativity because it requires a lot of history to make its meaning fully understood. In conclusion, Gilliam's involvement in creating creative films that are interesting to watch requires viewers to think and interpret. The film has tremendous value because there are subtle details and tips that can be omitted at the first viewing. Definitely one of my favorites.
