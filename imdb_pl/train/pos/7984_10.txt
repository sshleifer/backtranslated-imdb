Man on fire is definitely one of the best dramatic / criminal thrillers I've ever seen. Despite the slow start, the story is so amazingly complex and sensitive that it sticks well. This is the perfect role of Denzel Washington, in which he plays the guardian of the body, called Creasy, who is tormented by his past and is an alcoholic, but he never gives up his duty to save his last protege, Pita. Dakota Fanning plays Pita, a very smart, enthusiastic little girl who loves so many things and behaves very convincingly, has a great future ahead of her. As I said, the story is a bit complicated to fully understand it, you have to watch it a few times. <br /> <br /> This film consists of two parts, is the first hour everyone is happy, nothing happens, everyone lives happily until the kidnapping of Pita and where Creasy is almost killed. Then there is the second part, the rest of the movie, where everything becomes complicated and a bit gruesome and disturbing when Creasy regained strength after serious injuries and began chasing and killing numerous criminals and "La Hermamdada" who were responsible for planning and execution of Pita's abduction. <br /> <br /> Denzel Washington shows us his latest acting talents along with many other talented actors who have a great future ahead of them. It is a pity that this film was not appreciated enough, Washington really deserved another Oscar for his role, as did Fanning and the director. And maybe even visual effects that were very high quality. <br /> <br /> If you like perfect, slightly mad, thrilling thrillers, this is what you have to see. The most amazing thing is that the elements of this movie are actually based on real history and real characters! 10/10
