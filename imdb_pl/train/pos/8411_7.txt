This early version of the story "Student of Prague" was made in Germany in 1913, with the participation of Paul Wegener (who a few years later he was also in "Golem"). In this film, he plays a double role (technically impressive for a 95-year-old film to see them in the same shot) after meeting a mysterious old man who made a gold pact with him - the gold he needs to get the countess he previously had. saved from drowning. <br /> <br /> Moving quickly (the film lasts over an hour) and quite well written and characterized, "The Student of Prague" has echoes of Faust's legacy, as well as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, starting with the mysterious pact form of potential evil and developing into good and bad sides of the same person.
