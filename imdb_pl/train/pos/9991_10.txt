I thought this movie was hysterical. I watched it many times and I highly recommend it. Mel Brooks was perfect. The cast was fantastic. I do not understand how this film gets a rating of 2 out of 5. I loved it .. I saw other of his films and they were also fun, but this one really sticks out because of humor ... I can not say enough about this movie. I am looking for it to be periodic, but never enough. People playing in the homeless were comparing themselves to the funniest standards. Put this movie more often. I do not see it enough. Lily Ann Warren has also been my favorite since Cinderella. I always thought she was not really funny, but she loved playing. In this movie she was very funny ... and together with Mel did a great job. They should put more of their films on TV.
