This movie that I have loved since I was young! This is great. Although the average observer of the film may be a bit too much, if you can not interpret some of the subtleties in the film (for example, our hero is called Achilles, and in the final battle between him and Alexander is shot in the heel rocket, just like Achilles in mythology was shot in heel). It's just a small fact that is fun! Anyway, a great movie, a good story, it would be great to see it reworked thanks to today's special effects! Oddly enough, Gary Graham achieved average success on T. Show Alien Nation TV. This movie is a fun watch and should be more appreciated!
