I saw this movie for the first time when I was a small child and fell in love with it right away. The scenes are breathtaking, and part of the script is damned good: "You sons of a thousand fleas". <br /> <br /> It is always shown on TV late at night or really early in the morning I woke up around 3:00 once and it just started. TV companies must show a little more respect and put it on Sunday at the best time so that everyone can see this wonderful job. <br /> <br /> 10/10
