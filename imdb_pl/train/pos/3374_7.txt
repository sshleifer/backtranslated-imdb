"Soylent Green" is one of the best and most disturbing science fiction films of the 1970s and is still very convincing even by today's standards. The apocalyptic touch and environmental premise (typical of those times), though flawed and a bit outdated, are still very disturbing and incline to think. The quality level of this film exceeds the majority of contemporary SF films due to its strong cast and several intense sequences that I personally consider to be classic. New York in 2022 is a depressing place to live, with an excessive population, unemployment, unhealthy climate and total deficiency of every important food product. The only available form of food is synthetic and distributed by Soylent. Charlton Heston (in great shape) plays a policeman investigating the murder of one of the most eminent directors of Soylent and stumbles over scandals and dark secrets ... The scenario is sometimes too sentimental, and the culmination really does not come as a great surprise, still the atmosphere is very tense and amazing. The riot sequence is really exhausting and easily one of the most macabre moments in the 70's cinema. Edward G. Robinson is ultimately impressive in his last role, and Joseph Cotton ("Baron Blood", "The Abominable Dr. Phibes") has a great (but too modest) supporting role. This is Science Fiction in my book: horrible and inevitable disappearance of humanity! No fancy spaceships with hairy monsters attacking our planet.
