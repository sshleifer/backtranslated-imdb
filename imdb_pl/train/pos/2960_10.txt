Well, the main reason I wanted to watch this movie is that Trey Parker and Matt Stone of South Park did it. However, as soon as the film started, the laughter started to burst from my stomach. From subtle gestures to jokes, glaring humor in the toilet, and constant reliance on very witty insinuations. This movie can ruin an event that deals the most with poker, let alone its poker lingerie. Some of the funniest ones are blinking and you will miss the witnesses ever presented in Hollywood, along with the constant criticism of themselves thrown into the system. <br /> <br /> I just show that Trey Parker is not only fluent in writing, nor is he too dirty in an old acting game. I was surprised by the amount I was consumed in this film. However, I'm afraid you can not buy it online, here in the UK. Sort the boys! <br /> <br /> I am and I will continue to show all my friends annoyingly pointing to funny passages and from time to time sniffing at my beer. All in all a great movie if you're a fan of unnecessary comedy. However, if you do not have a sense of humor about stupid or naughty things, go well! However, I am sure that the inclusion of Jenny McCarthy and Jasmine Bleeth can make you gurgle over these prejudices.
