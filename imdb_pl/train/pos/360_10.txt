11 nominations for an Oscar and zero wins !!! I still have to understand why - it's not that the actors in the movie did something better later, that you can do it by rewarding them for trivial roles, as did Halle Berry and Denzel Washington - Whoopi, Oprah, Margaret Avery, Danny Glover etc. - all were amazing - I'm curious how to get scenarios for discussions at Oscars this year ...... should go to the Shoulda-coulda-coulda category for judges .... <br /> <br /> it's an amazing book - but according to the style of writing, Alice Walker has a way to seem overreacting with her characters - so I'm glad that this screen adaptation has done a few things. <br /> <br /> The photos were amazing - African scenes live very desirable - the African part of the book is to be set in Liberia - somewhere in West Africa - BUT NO! Steven Spielberg thinks the world is so stupid that they can not think about Africa outside of Safar - so yes, we had to have a free scene of Zebra and wildlife, when we all know that there is no West Africa ---- and above all why people say after Swahili --- who says Swahili in West Africa? I just had to do it out of the way ....... <br /> <br /> But as a story - amazing, filming - from this world - CLASSIC yes !! <br /> <br /> I have it and watch it when my soul needs some rejuvenation.
