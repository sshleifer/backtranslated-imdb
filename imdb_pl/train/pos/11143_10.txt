I saw it as a young naive punk when it was released for the first time. I was to sniff me like a child when I left the theater, trying not to let anyone see. So when I saw it again in '07, I knew what to expect, and the sobbing was ready and primed when their required moment was approaching. Fortunately, this time I was at home. <br /> <br /> What I did not remember from my youthful watching - or maybe I did not notice it, was the technical brilliance of this movie. Use flashbacks that tell so many stories without resorting to dialogue. Working with a camera that seemed to place the viewer with the characters in the scene. Think about opening when Joe crosses the street to the bar, the camera moves behind the woman and the child sitting on the bench in the foreground, framing the street scene. <br /> <br /> The very history and characters - dingy, sad and brutally true. It is very moving to get so caught up in the human drama as the one that most of us probably will reject. On the other hand, Joe and Ratso could be one of us. I had to be 70 when I saw it. I remember that after leaving the theater I was forced to find friends. During all these years I'm happy that I am not alone today. It's the hell of a great movie.
