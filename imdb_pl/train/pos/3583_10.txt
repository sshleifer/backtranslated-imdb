It was a great movie, but it had the worst ending I've ever seen !!! The actors were great and showed great talent. The whole story was twisted and unexpected, which made it fun. As good as a movie, the whole movie is judged when it's finished, which was awful! Maybe the sequel can eliminate this bad ending.
