H.G. Wells Classic had several lifetimes. Version 05 'Speilburg and classic version 53' But only this version remains completely faithful to the book. Nothing changes, nothing is removed. <br /> <br /> Originally released as a 3-hour movie. Re-Cut film director for 2 hours of pure perfection. He has visualizations of the chapters of the novel, the chapter "Wells would be proud." History is just as everyone remembers. The Martians invade Earth with capsules containing an army of tripods going by war machines. People from the nineteenth-century land are not prepared to repel alien forces and fight canons and departments who drop bullets directly related to the Walkers, and when humanity is no longer a world power, they are saved by the smallest organisms on earth. <br /> <br /> The film is a great achievement for director Timothy Hines, who has enormous potential when he implemented this vision thanks to a modest budget of 5 million. Today, B movies have bigger budgets.
