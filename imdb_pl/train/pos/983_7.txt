I think this movie has a lot to offer, especially the particularly ominous performance of David Morse and more than a good performance always worth seeing Mr. Foxx. Although there are many holes in the story, and the motivation is very, very difficult to do in some cases, in total makes it nice to spend time in front of the lamp.
