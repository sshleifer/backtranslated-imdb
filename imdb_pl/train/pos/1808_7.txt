All Dog's Go to Heaven is an animated film for children like no other. Gambling, drinking, death, weapons and hell are visible on the plot, and although children will not be successful, adults will scratch the head, why this movie made him feel like a gangster movie. The real movie is in no way clear, it's just a strange combination to make a movie for children. <br /> <br /> Charlie Barkin (Burt Reynolds) is the dog-player who owns half of the casino with his partner Carface (Vic Tayback). After getting drunk (the dog ... gets drunk ... in a children's film, it just sounds weird.) Charlie gets cheated and murdered by Carfax. When in heaven, he finds a way to return to Earth, but he will no longer be allowed into Heaven. He is still coming back to Earth and meeting his old friend Itchy (Dom Deluise) and planning a refund at Carfax. Meanwhile, Carfax has a small orphan girl Anne Anne kept in captivity because of her incredible ability to talk to all species of animals, which helps to predict the breed. Charlie and Itchy release her and try to help her find her family while learning a lot about herself. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the few non-Disney games that will appeal to both children and adults. Children will enjoy funny characters and lively animation while adults will enjoy a nice, sweet story and more than normally developed characters. One of the things that's holding it back is that it's a musical. It's usually a good thing, but here the music is really terrible. They have a tendency to jump, almost sounding ad libbed, without an instrumental background. In fact, these are probably the worst songs I've ever heard in an animated film, but fortunately the rest of the movie is strong enough not to fall apart because of bad notes. <br /> <br /> The end of this movie works, but I honestly hate it. It's sad but happy, but more sad than happy and makes the film want to continue. Considering how bad the sequel was made, I would like the ending to not guarantee the continuation, and would end in a nice, super happy ending. This is one of the few movies I feel this way, but I do it. <br /> <br /> In general, it's a nice family movie, with strange themes thrown in, but still good entertainment. <br /> <br /> My rating: *** from ****. 85 minutes. SALT.
