I just used this movie and watched it last night. Acting started very badly (hey ------ hey ------ twister), but it went very well after the wards. The tornadoes looked very untrue, and many CGI effects were very suspicious, but the scene with the sprawl of the house and the content inside the blown and sucked was exceptionally well done and almost on par with movies like Twister. Devastation scenes were also very well made. This story was very well written and refreshing is watching such a movie away from the same old "disaster formulas" of this genre that have been stuck in memory for 30 years. <br /> <br /> Although this movie had a very strange mix of FX and the quality of action, which deserves A in my book.
