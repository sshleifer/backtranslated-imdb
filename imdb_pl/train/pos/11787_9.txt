This is a short film by David Lynch in just 8 minutes, but he has all the "Lynchian ingredients"! It is mysterious, dark, ambiguous, amazing and strange; and before the blond girl starts talking, it's even a little scary! The soundtrack is unique to create this strange atmosphere because it is also ominous and mysterious? <br /> <br /> There are no "traditional" red curtains on the same setting, but it has violet-painted walls that also give an amazing effect. the plot is about a girl who is locked in a dark room and cries for help; then comes another girl who starts talking to her in a mysterious way, saying that she is there only because of her guilt? We do not know what happened or what will happen next? ended unsolved and enigmatic, because a good Lynch movie has to end! <br /> <br /> It's a great shortcut, despite amateur acting. Girls are professional actresses, but I think their acting could have been better in this short one.
