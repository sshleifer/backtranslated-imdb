In one of her first films, Romy Schneider shines as a young queen of Victoria of Great Britain, who suddenly is planted on the throne at the age of 18, learns to rule despite the machinations of politicians, and finally affirms and marries Prince Albert of Saxony. Kitsch and camp (although surprisingly true to real events), this romantic piece is irresistible. Watching this movie about the British royal rulers used in German adds to its peculiar charm. On this front, he wonders why an Austrian film about an English queen was made; but then it is recalled that in 1954 Austria was still occupied by allied troops, including the British. Maybe it was one of the reasons for the existence of this film.
