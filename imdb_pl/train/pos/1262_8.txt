A young and seemingly promising college graduate (played by Blair Underwood) is sent to prison for the murder of an innocent young girl and put on death row. Sean Connery plays the "happy go lucky" lawyer, whom the young man's grandmother pulls out of retirement and begs him to take care of the case in the hope of freeing her grandson. Laurence Fishburne plays a police officer who was well involved in the case and is hell-bent on overthrowing the theory that Connery can dig up to try to free the boy he and the entire police department swear that he is guilty of crime. Ed Harris, Kate Capshaw, Ruby Dee and late Lynne Thigpen will play in this very intense dramatic thriller.
