I did not write reviews about IMDb the longest, but I felt compelled to write it! While browsing this video, I found one particular review that urged people NOT to watch this movie. Do not pay attention to this ignorant person! NOTHING is a fantastic movie, full of laughter, and above all ... imagination! Are you sick and tired of being fed the same old cycle of chewing gum? Sometimes a movie like NOTHING appears and gives you something you've never seen before. I do not even care if you do not like (even hate) the movie, but no one has the right to discredit the movie. IMDb has a huge impact on reputation, and no negative opinion should not discredit such a movie. Just say you hate him and why you hate him ... but do not try to tell people that they should not see it. We have our own minds and we will seek our own thanks. <br /> <br /> If my judgment is good, I would say that more people will enjoy this movie, unlike those who hate it. <br /> <br /> Treat your mind with some sweets! See nothing!
