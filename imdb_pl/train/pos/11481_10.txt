High school friends Andre Kriegman and Cal Gabriel declare war on their classmates and plan a terrifying attack on their high school. When they start a deadly countdown to their last revenge, they both start a video diary to explain their feelings and journal their mission. <br /> <br /> There is another similar movie, such as "Elephant". Why am I talking about it? To compare both films, of course. I must say that although I liked the "Elephant", it is a much better movie. What's the difference, you ask? Well, for starters, it's curly differently, as in "Cloverfield", "Blair Witch Project" and "Diary of the Dead". This makes the film the better because it is much more painfully realistic. <br /> <br /> But what convinced me prompted the film to show "the other side of history". You meet these two shooters, unlike the Elephant. Actually, I took care of one of the shooters and understood their actions and why they did what they did. This movie makes you feel sympathetic to these people and that's a good thing because it's not always black and white. <br /> <br /> To be honest, that's why I almost cried in this movie. The heroes are real people with logic and reasons for their actions. You must understand them. They do not want to kill people for attention. In general, this movie is emotionally thrilling and very haunting and much better than the "Elephant".
