One afternoon I caught this film on the cable. I must admit that I have never been a big fan of baseball, but sometimes I can get into a good movie related to sports. The introduction of a foster family system turned out to be more interesting. As a therapist who saw both the good and the evil of the community mental and substitute health system, I think watching a movie showing both the ups and downs of the system: people jumping from the family, biological parents do not always take active part and changes that can to be only painful for the heart and melting heart. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Danny Glover are the anchor of this film and both bring very credible performances. Maybe it was just my emotional state, but I discovered that I had shed a tear at the end of the movie.
