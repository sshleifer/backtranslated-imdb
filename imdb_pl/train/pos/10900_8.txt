It was a documentary that I had to see when I missed the opportunity in 2004, so I definitely wanted to watch the replay. I really sympathized with the protagonist of the film, because it's true that I have a milder cutaneous problem, which is the distrophic epidermolysis of Bullos (EB). It is a sad, sometimes funny and very emotional documentary about a boy with a terrible skin disorder. Jonny Kennedy speaks like a child (due to wasting vocal muscles) and never has matured, but is 36 years old. The most compassionate moments are seeing his terrible condition and taking off his bandages. Jonny had a rather naughty sense of humor, even told from beyond the grave, showing his body in the coffin. He tells his story with the help of his mother, Edny Kennedy, his older brother and celebrity model, and Jonny's follower, Nell McAndrew. She won BAFTA for Best Edition and Best New Director (Factual) awards, and was nominated for Best Sound (Factual) and Flaherty Documentary. That was the number 10 in The 100 Greatest TV Treats 2004. Documentary!
