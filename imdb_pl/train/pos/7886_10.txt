Okay, I'm a fan of the Nightmare series and everyone says it's the worst! But it is not !!! You did not see Freddy's revenge? WTF! It was the worst of all !!! Now this movie is quite decent and keeps up Freddy's story. It's nice that he had a daughter, etc. <br /> <br /> And then I found out he's in 3-D !!! I was so excited that I remember when I saw it on a set of DVD boxes, I immediately jumped to three-dimensional sequences. Quite a lot was in 3-D, like Lisa Zanes's hand, Dream Demons, Freddy's claw (more than once), Lezlie Dean holding the knife, Lisa Zane with a baseball bat, Doc's hand, Freddy's exploding head. <br /> <br /> I really loved this movie because it was in 3-D, but I would like the whole movie to be in 3-D not just for the last 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> By the way, it's 15 minutes NO TEN !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
