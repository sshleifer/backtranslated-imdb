This movie was very good. If you enjoy watching horror movies, I recommend them. Acting was very good, although I thought that the actress who played Julie could have more emotions behind her lines. Allan was very good and I thought the photos were amazing. I was sitting all the time on the edge of my seat while my friends were going crazy and screaming. In my opinion it was a total success and should have hit the big screen. He gives me two thumbs! I would definitely say that if you have not seen it yet, rent it. If you saw it and did not like it, look again, because there are parts that were completely unreal. I also liked how many movies were shot on the campus of my school.
