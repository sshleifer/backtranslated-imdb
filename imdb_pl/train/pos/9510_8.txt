In the winter of 1931, apparently 12-year-old Tyler Hoechlin (as Michael Sullivan Jr.) wonders what his father's gangster Tom Hanks (Michael "Mike" Sullivan) earns a living. Young Hoechlin follows Mr. Hanks to one evening "work" and witness how he shoots rival gangsters. This leads - in a VERY roundabout way - to the "Godfather" type, Paul Newman (as John Rooney), who employs an independent hit Jude Law (as Harlen Maguire) to track down Hoechlin and Hanks who descend to Chicago. Hanks thinks they'll be safe with a relative, which is puzzling when you consider the heroes' line of work. <br /> <br /> He looks amazing like Paul Peterson ("The Donna Reed Show"), Hoechlin does a great job for director Sam Mendes; and working with this cast makes him the happiest young actor in 2002. However, the most striking thing about "Road to Perdition" is the stunning cinematography of Conrad L. Hall, who deserves the "Oscar" career for a dead photographer. Mr. Hall's work is really great. This helps to make up for the overall impression of measured, imagined astonishing, both narrative and visual. The departing end is suddenly uplifting (an unrelated dog is an example of the aforementioned bewilderment). <br /> <br /> ******** The road to perdition (7/12/02) Sam Mendes ~ Tom Hanks, Tyler Hoechlin, Paul Newman, Jude Law
