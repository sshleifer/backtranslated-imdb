It's a strange feeling to sit alone in a theater occupied by parents and their kids. I felt that instead of a movie ticket, I should get a membership in NAMBLA. <br /> <br /> Based on the respectable book by Thomas Rockwell "How to eat fried worms" starts like any children's story: moving to a new city. The new kid, the fifth-grader Billy Forrester, was once popular, but he must start again. Making friendship is never easy, especially when the only perspective is Poindexter Adam. Or Erica, who is 4 1/2 feet, is a giant. <br /> <br /> Another complicating thing is Joe the bully. His freckled face and sleeveless shirts are discouraging. He opposes the children of the Death Ring: the Crackerjack puck, which supposedly kills you if you hit him. But not immediately. No, the ring of death releases the poison that kills you in the eighth grade. <br /> <br /> Joe and his axis of evil greet Billy, smuggling a handful of slimy worms into his thermos. After the discovery of Billy, it's fun to play, cursing that it's eating worms all the time. Then he throws them in Joe's face. Ewww! To get them, Billy reluctantly assumes that he can eat 10 worms. Fried, boiled, marinated in a hot sauce, mashed and spread on a sandwich with peanut butter. Each meal is called an exotic name, such as "Radioactive delight of mucus", in which children eventually realize their dream of microwaving a living organism. <br /> <br /> If you ever met me, you will know that I have uncontrolled hearty laughter. I felt like a creeping explosion in a toddler whimpering that his "damn dick" hurt him. But Fried Worms is wonderfully disgusting. Like the Farrelly brothers' movie with the G grade, it is both emetic and delightful. <br /> <br /> Writer / director Bob Dolman is also an experienced storyteller. To raise bids, worms must be used up to 19:00. In addition, Billy has a dark secret: he has a very sensitive stomach. <br /> <br /> Dolman also has a keen sense of perspective. With such accuracy, he draws from the uncertainty of children and the tendency to exaggerate mundane dilemmas. <br /> <br /> If you hyperbolized this movie as children do their dilemmas, you'll see that it's basically about war. A fighter for freedom and haters of freedom uses mature boys as pawns in substitute wars, only to learn a valuable lesson on unity. International leaders can learn about global peace keeping from Fried Worms. <br /> <br /> Towards the end of the movie I was comforted when two mothers taking care of me looked at each other with bewilderment and agreed, "It was a great movie. "Fine, now I will not have to register in any legal databases.
