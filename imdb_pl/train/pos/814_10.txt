Thanks to Kevin Smith, a group of geeks are running, saying that Return of the Jedi is not good, because watching is really fun. And no! Muppets are at stake! That `s bad! Everyone liked the Return of the Jedi until someone in Kevin Smith's film commented negatively. Now, people are suddenly looking at you for some kind of illness, if you mention how much you like it. This movie is much better than anything Kevin Smith ever considered, creating what wakes my mind in the belief that he even thinks of condemning him. This movie is fun! It's as amazing as I remember when I was six! Enjoy this movie and stop stealing Kevin Smith's opinions! Its not correct! <br /> <br /> And this song Ewoka ruled at the end! I bet people do not even like "Ewoks: Battle for Endor" !!!! I will light you all!
