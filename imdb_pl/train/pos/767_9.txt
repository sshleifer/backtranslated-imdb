Because I am a true product of the generation of hip-hop and electronic music, it is without a doubt one of my favorite films of all time. Beat Street, although not as "authentic" in some respects as Wild Style, is a film that guarantees a jerk for everyone who is proud of the urban culture of sample / music based on DJ and electro-club culture. br /> <br /> Although I admit that sometimes the dialogue is a bit tacky, you can not not feel the characters and finally "wish you were there" for the beginnings of hip-hop culture in New York City in the early eighties. The b-boy battle scene at Roxy Nightclub (real-time real-time competition between legendary Rock Steady Crew and NYC Breakers) is just as important to hip hop music archives as any classic album. Watch some breaker movements in slow motion, if possible, to really appreciate the athletic and stylistic knowledge of an experienced B-boy / B-girl. All praise because of Zulu Nation !!!
