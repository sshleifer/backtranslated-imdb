A classic movie in two directions. Wes Craven is in charge. On the other hand, the TV budget shows what can be much more with a larger budget. He moves when Susan Lucci pulls Robert Urichfamily into her claws and tries to convince him to the secret of his health club. His latest invention, a spacesuit that can analyze people or things, becomes unexpectedly useful in his new neighborhood. Anyone who sees this should pay attention to Susan Lucci. Her appearance and performance had unexpected repercussions several years later. Actor, scientist and parapsychologist Stephen Armourae is a fan of this film and wrote a review of the film. Lucci became the subject of his portrait, being the basis for the work of a carer named Catherine. The portrait of Luccia and Barbara Steele in "Black Sunday" was used as a reference to Catherine's portraits, which Armourae immediately withdrew. Probably due to the personal nature of the artist and Katarzyna. Seeing both films, we can get an insight into another story and the appearance of an unknown woman who will make an interesting movie.
