Disney's film, which dares to do something else, should at least be rewarded for its effort. "Holes" does not make the same mistakes that one would expect from the Disney movie about the problems of teenagers in the camp. For the first time, events have not been explained in detail. Flashback scenes really serve the purpose and present several mature topics that can surprise the viewer. I must admit that at first I was a bit discouraged by the seriousness of the film. But I soon realized that we must endure these moments to see the beauty of this story. Beyond history, this film is well suited to questioning certain methods used in prisons. (One example, in which Caveman is not allowed to teach Zero to read, because they have to dig holes to build a character, as learning to read does not matter). "Holes" is an intelligent and beautiful film. You have to watch!
