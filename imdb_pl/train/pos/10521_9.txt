Well, I think I'm emotionally connected to this movie because it's the first one I've seen over 10 times in the cinema ... helping me in my master's thesis, or rather stopping me from working on this film! > <br /> But watching it a few years later (and many movies) later - what a well-done little gem! I have never seen Gwyneth Paltrow in a more convincing performance, and Jeremy Northam is the perfect Mr. Knightley - where can you meet such a man ??? << <sigh> >> Phrase Sophie Thompson as Mrs. Bates is a virtuosic game of the best (oh, napkins, sorry!), and the rest of the cast is also not a disappointment - Toni Colette brings a lot of Muriel to Harriet, and Ewan McGregor is convincingly charming - a Alan Cumming and Juliet Stevenson are the perfect "impossible" pair! <br /> <br /> Of course, sets and costumes and a beautiful soundtrack contribute to a good mood, almost like Hobbiton. The atmosphere of the film - although in terms of cinematography and artistic decoration, it is almost a case of visual overload. Very, very pretty, but a little more savings can convey a better sense of the period. But the good thing is that the film is not taken too seriously and there is a lot of fun - and quite a nice edition - that does not allow him to fall into the mode of sardine Merry Old England. <br /> <br /> My favorite is the ball stage - beautiful acting and directing here, and the final dance summarizes the relationship between Emma and Mr. Knightley just beautifully. It is a pity that the final scene of the proposal takes a bit too long - cut two shots (I can think of exactly that!) And it would be much more in line with the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Wow, I realize (reading the imdb list) that I've seen Jeremy Northam in at least three movies, without even realizing that it was him - it looks like he has a lot more for him, as an actor, than just being an English gentleman! Hmm, I'm guessing that I have to pay my video stores for the visit ... <br /> <br /> Beautiful movie. My favorite adaptation of Jane Austen so far - though perhaps Sensible and sensitive Ang Lee is, more accurately, a better movie, this one is the closest to my heart - and I have seen him many times! Watch if you can - and do not be too hard in your imperfections. <br /> <br />
