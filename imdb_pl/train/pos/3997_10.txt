What a moving movie. I have a dear friend who is sixty years old and has told me for 15 years that people can not see her anymore and miss their company. Being at the age of 40, I start to notice what she complains about. You are no longer juvenile, beautiful or tangible. When May says "... this body block ..." wow. How our bodies change and how we are told that it is no longer beautiful. I love it when it starts to change what it wears ... a colorful scarf ... it's no longer a jocular wife. <br /> <br /> It's also a sad and wonderful picture. Sad that he can betray his daughter's trust ... beautiful in the fact that he is in a difficult situation and decides to go further and finally have his own life. I love the character's boldness to even initiate romance. <br /> <br /> Mainly I love this film, because in the end it is a picture that shows the complex nature of relationships, whether family or not. We see Paulia's vulnerability, and she will have what she wants at all costs (when she tells her that she will have a child for Darren, if she wants it or not after her mother asks if Darren even wants a child) . The film strikes at how relationships can change, but reveals what has always been there, dormant. May stifled her own creativity to raise her family. A family that she did not really want, but she was "something you just did when she was young." I love the scene where Darren calls her old grated, and she smiles and says, "I've never been called that before." It was a real jewel of the film. <br /> <br /> And Daniel Craig. I just love him. I was pleasantly surprised. It is not only pleasing to the eyes, it is a real talent. What a fun role. It is much more than any 007, which is for sure, and I am looking forward to seeing it in more roles of this kind. The scene in which she enjoys and the look she gives her is like a surprised look that she has such control over this woman and the pleasure that she can give her. In fact, he gives him pleasure. A great scene. The contrast is the love scene with Bruce. Bruce is completely absorbed in his own pleasure ... two completely different men. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately ... I wonder where my Darren is?
