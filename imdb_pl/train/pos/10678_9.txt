The comedy is based on a mix of people sharing. A man and two women. Richard O 'Sullivan is charmed by Paula Wilcox. It is played in a gentle, not brave way, which is why this performance was such a success. <br /> <br /> Scenarios and celebrities always gave the best results, and Richard's frustrated love life was shown with a nice charm. The final titles contained visual jokes that remained unnoticed at the beginning of the 70s, but were related to the flat.
