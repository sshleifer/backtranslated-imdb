** possible spoilery ** <br /> <br /> I like this movie and I do not have a problem with it. It reminds me of me at the age of 20, but it is even better. According to Weronika, two chicks at once. It brings out horniness, free conversation, these two real chicks, not whores, teasing us every step of the way. I also enter into conversations. Even if they are completely b.s. sometimes, so what? Every chick that I've almost never talked about and I'm not found on is usually full of the same unreasonable, senseless, selfless selfish b.s. philosophy. It's just bullshit and just as sensible as other b.s. the philosophy chicks are often in: astrological charts. The only thing about this movie is that the guy is almost as feminine as a woman, he's the same b.s. and moodiness. Brunette is in fact the most masculine person. <br /> <br /> I think it's funny that Veronica turns on the brunette so obviously. She would like to pull a little blonde away from Aleksander, but Veronica plays her all the way. She is brilliant. It makes the brunette think something is between them and then steals a boy / man, which is appropriate only because they seem to be from the same age group. Brunette knows she's left to the end when she throws her face in her hands, while Marlene Deitrich sings in the background that, paraphrasing, today is a million couples in Paris, but I only have this chorus. /> <br /> But did they finally get married, Alex and Veronica? Mmmm? I can only imagine a super stormy relationship ending in a pre-marital breakup. They are too selfish to be something other than a springboard. <br /> <br /> However, I like the movie. It gave me entertainment, it has a nice look and is sexy.
