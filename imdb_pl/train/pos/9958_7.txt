I watch them all. <br /> <br /> This is no better than these amazing (_Strictly Ballroom_, _Shall we dance? _ (Japanese version), but it is completely respected and pleasantly different in parts. <br /> <br /> I am a language teacher English and some of these ignorance are incomprehensible to me, for example: "the name should scream, do not look." How it moves. "Since when can movie titles ignore grammar?" <br /> <br /> There is nothing inconvenient in English grammar in English, it is simply not English grammar, I do not think about the dialogue, I put the subtitles because I am a Canadian speaker, so I just assumed AUTOMATIC that I would have problems with understanding of it all.This was not so difficult and it gave a distinctly different taste than other films that I saw were so American. <br /> <br /> I loved that this movie was made in Toronto and, in fact, I would like to make it even clearer, I loved that the heroine was so unusually filled. I liked the stepping procedure. I liked the nature of my mother. I felt that many of the problems in the film were touched more subtly than in dance films. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, if you like dance movies, it's decent. If you have problems with the superiority in the English grammar you grew up on, your narrow mind may have difficulty viewing this movie.
