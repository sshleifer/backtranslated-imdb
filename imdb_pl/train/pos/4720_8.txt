A beautiful movie, especially if you like horses, movies from World War II and a raw Hungarian plateau. A tale of courage, compassion and loyalty that transcends generations. Equestrian sport is spectacular, as is the horse of the main characters during their own training. <br /> <br /> I will buy this movie and watch it again. This is a family film and I highly recommend it. Good movie "Family Nite". Although there are some violent scenes, it was the occupation of Hungary by the Nazis. Residents were very interesting in the way they stood on the spot, even in the face of a certain death on the part of a Nazi officer who had his personal reasons to hunt for Brady. A haunting beautiful movie.
