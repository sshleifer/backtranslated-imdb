If the screenwriter and director wanted to open the heart with a movie, just like the musician wanted to do with his music, I succeeded. Common human situations have become original, personal and immediate, so I personally felt affected by every situation. I believe that I will recognize the power of music in combination with the viewer's point of view. Without corruption, I can say that I was very moved by the movie's approach to life. Did not I really cry for joy? empathy? just deep emotions? for a very long time. I would like to find a way to show it to others. I saw it at the Seattle International Film Festival.
