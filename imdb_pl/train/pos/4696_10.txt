even if this movie is quite old, no matter how many times I watch it, it still makes me laugh. <br /> <br /> one particular quote in the movie stands out. <br /> <br /> when Danny (Joe Piscopo) comes to the office and parks in a place for the disabled, Danny's partner says <br /> <br /> "can not park here, it's for the handicapped." /> <br /> Danny responds: "I'm disabled, I'm psychotic." <br /> <br /> is one of many lines in the film, no matter how many times you watch, it's "You'll giggle." > <br /> Johnny Dangerously stands in my top 5 comedy movies / parody of all time. <br /> <br /> As an added bonus he also includes the legendary actor Peter Boyle cast. So watch this movie and how me and many others who have seen it, you will be addicted.
