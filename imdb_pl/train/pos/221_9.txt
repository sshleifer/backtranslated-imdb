I remember that for the first time I saw this movie at Radio City Music Hall. I did not really understand humor at the time, but this movie can make me laugh. <br /> <br /> With all due respect to George Burns (RIP), Walter Matthau really deserves an Oscar for this film. His performance is amazing - given the fact that he was 20 years younger than his character, Willi Clark. His mannerisms are paramount. ("Do you know what songs he wrote? Sh * t!" And talking to a guy who spoke Spanish at reception: "No! No! No Enchilada !!") Absolutely fun! <br /> <br /> Kudos for Richard Benjamin who played straight with Matthau. <br /> <br /> I would like it to be on DVD, because my VHS recording becomes a bit old. <br /> <br /> I had no interest in remake with Woody Allen, because it does not match the original in any way.
