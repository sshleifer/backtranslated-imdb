As far as I know, this program has never been repeated on British television after its original launch in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and most episodes are now unfortunately "lost, presumably erased". <br /> <br /> Series 6 from 1971 still exists in its entirety, and recently I had the opportunity to see it all, the best part 4 decades later. <br /> <br /> After a rush home from school, Freewheelers was for me and for many people to see my contemporaries in these wonderful days of flared pants, Slade and Chicory Tip. And watching it again brought a nostalgic lump to the throat. <br /> <br /> It does not matter that acting is bad / hammy, unintentionally funny fighting scenes, holes in the story are wide enough to pilot a large ocean yacht and terrifying, terrifying "accents of the main players' advice. <br /> <br /> No - forget about all this. Because Freewheelers refers to the past (bold, I say, "golden") age of children's television drama, when the shows were simply a fun game and did not take themselves so seriously. Before the obsession was overwhelmed by the insane "ishoos" for which modern screenwriters have problems with young protagonists, such as relationships, pregnancy, drugs, sexually transmitted diseases, etc. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly it was "transformed into a contemporary audience "in times of ubiquitous political correctness, the boss figure would be a black woman, one of the young male heroes would be a Muslim, the other would be a white boy confused about his sexuality, and the girl would be a versatile get-get with IQ out of scale that will bring boys out of scratches forever and it will make them look foolish - in other words, millions of miles have been removed from the respectable Wendy Padbury, twisting the upper-washing machine. <br /> <br /> This is a program that is very "your time". But is this a bad thing? I do not think so, for example.
