Nagra comes from a conservative Indian family that does not match girls playing competitive football. But our attractive young star CAN play serious football. Rhys-Meyers trains Nagra and encourages her to perform, and Knightley supports a friend from a team and friend. When the wedding is scheduled for the same day as the final football match, what is the girl supposed to do? Similar in its unique way to BFGW, because Nagra tries to push the envelope in the traditional family ways. Here's my father (played well by Kher) who can see both sides of the release. He docked the whole point for hokey late sexual preference without a crisis, if they needed a filler, they could go somewhere else. A nice final for the whole offer.
