I bought this game on the impulse from Walmart. I'm glad I did it. It was very fun listening to Sean Connery and playing this game. I thought the graphics were the best I've ever seen in the remake of movies / games. The bonus levels were very difficult! Sniper, who I thought was too difficult, made me so frustrated that I did not play for a week and a half. Too many people were shooting at you, having nothing to hide or life to deal with. <br /> <br /> The only thing I can change was the update system. I did not notice any difference between the unmodernized equipment and the improved one, i.e. The purchase of the armor upgrade did not make the armor stronger or more filled in my measure of life. I really liked the copter Q. I think the programmers did a good job.
