The fans of "Capital City" rejoice! This first season of this series is now available on the Network DVD, and recently I got my copy! Although it is a very key team of "independent" trading floors, "CAPITAL CITY" presents us with different moments both in the first and second season, when each member of the band plays a significant role in a specific central or peripheral plot. The cultural mix (English, Irish, American, German, Polish) of the Head Trader group Wendy Foley (played by Joanna Phillips-Lane) is balanced by her own characteristic mannerisms, interests and personalities that help make the unknown and most people seemingly sterile the object of financial trade rationally engages in engaging cast performances. In fact, this seemingly dynamic young team of employees is in direct contrast to the rather calm and old-fashioned leadership of Shane Longman, represented by Lee Wolf (Richard Le Parmentier) and James Farrell (Denys Hawthorne). I suspect that such an unconventional way of working in Wendy's team would not become a reality, if not for a youthful, lonely "free spirit" Peter Longman inherited from his father thirty percent of stocks in the company and allowed a more fashionable, relaxed modern way of doing business is becoming a reality. To some extent, Wendy's (I am convinced he is), the direct superior Leonard Ansen (John Bowe) follows the establishment of the traditional way of running the company, but his love for Wendy rather perceives him as a "center" in most cases. The most important interest in the series, I think, stems from the boiling romantic attraction between Declan Douglas Hodge and the cool, confident blonde of German trader Michelle Hauptmann (played by Trevyn McDowell), who constantly wondered if the situation between these two colleagues would develop beyond the close friendship / sentiment that they undoubtedly had. <br /> <br /> I am looking forward to viewing this title and I hope that the second season of thirteen will not be too far!
