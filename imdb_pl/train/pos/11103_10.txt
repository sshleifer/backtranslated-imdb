The "godfather" of television, but apart from the recognition and heroes of the gangster, they are not similar to each other. Tony Soprano is forced to go to a psychiatrist after a series of panic attacks. His psychiatrist learns that Tony is actually part of two families - in one family he is a loving father, but not as perfect as a husband, and in the other family he is a ruthless sage. After analysis, Dr. Melfi states that Tony's problems actually come from his mother Livia, who suspects that she has a borderline personality disorder. Gandolfini is rightly praised as the main character; however, Bracco and Marchand are not equally recognized as their equally talented performances, as well as the psychiatrist and mother, respectively. Falco, Imperioli and DeMatteo are recognized for their excellent supporting roles. Van Zandt (with E-Street Band) plays his first and only role as Tony's best friend and is quite convincing and slammed. Chianese, the only recurring actor who actually appeared in the movie The Godfather, plays Uncle Tony and the incessant nemesis. Many fans also enjoyed Pastore, Ventimiglia, Curatoli, Proval, Pantoliano, Lip, Sciorra and Buscemi. Tony's children are "okay", but they are not remarkable (except for Iler's stunning performance in the third episode of "The Second Coming"); Sirico and Schirripa are unconvincing and unrivaled, but the program is too strong to stop him. Even if the show lasts for over six seasons, it stops having a boring or predictable moment. <br /> <br /> **** (out of four)
