I saw this movie after watching Blue Crush and other Michelle movies, I thought it had a gloomy future in this business. I was very bad after seeing her performance in "Girlfight" I was amazed at the way she captures the emotions of one fighter, but also a warrior. In this movie, the way in which he confronts his father with the treatment of her and her brother, the way she communicates anger when she is hit. and I hide from love, or just because I have power, I will not win. I think that this role fit perfectly to Michelle, although she did not have previous experience, the director noticed talent, I criticize myself for not seeing talent in it.
