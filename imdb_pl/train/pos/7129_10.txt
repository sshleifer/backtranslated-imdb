This movie has been on my wish list for ten years and only recently I found it on DVD when my partner's grandson got it. He watched him and was delighted when he learned that it was my generation - born in 1930 and evacuated in 1939. And wanted to know more about it - and me. Fortunately, I borrowed it from him and watched it myself, and I cried through it. Not only did he capture emotions, class distinctions, difficulties and warmth of interpersonal relations of those years (as well as cruelty (spoken and unspeakable), but were accurate! I am also anorak when it comes to ARP uniforms, ambulances (LCC) in the appropriate color (white) The refuge of Anderson's canteen and the WVS canteen restored all of this, and the difference between the relatively unspoiled life in the village and the war-torn London was also sharply depicted, I revived 1939/40 and my own evacuation from London with this production! Gold's work and you can not expect more from him than this meticulous detail, but it went beyond the accurate presentation of facts and touched deep chords about human reactions and the only half-worded judgments of the value of these years. Certainly, in fact, one of the best places in the career of John Thaw and towards Gold, and deserve to be better known. It's a great movie and I've already ordered some copies to send to friends.
