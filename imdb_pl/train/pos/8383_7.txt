Jox's robot is very old, but it's basically a series of battle scenes connected with each other - robot against the robot, man against man, man against the woman. The premise had potential, but it seems that the scenario was not actually included in several subsequent versions. Still, it was pretty good for a science fiction movie. Partly because the script was written by Joe Haldeman. For those who do not know the name, Haldeman wrote the award-winning science fiction novel 'The Forever War'. It is considered one of the best novels about energy-armored combat armor, with Robert Heinle's "Starship Troopers" and John Steakley's "Armor". And this movie is more like a giant war armor film than giant robots. It's closer to what the fans wanted than to the travesty, which was Paul Verhoeven's "Starship Troopers", which was just like the novel on which it was based. <br /> <br /> Despite some assumptions, it really is not based on Homer's "Iliad". Several names have in common. Achilles, who had a robot's blown foot, had no analogy in the Iliad, which did not include the death of Achilles. Ancient Achilles was not a noble warrior. He was the most powerful, but also vengeful and petty. Even a robot killer killed in the first scene does not fit. He was named Hercules, while the Greek Iliad had Heracles. <br /> <br /> The effects were quite good for time and budget. True, a year later it could not be compared to "Terminator 2", but it cost ten times more. The stop movement was almost as good as the robot in "The Empire Strikes Back" and "Return of the Jedi". In fact, better than much of Harry Harryhausen's animation, which is highly prized, but quite outdated. <br /> <br /> Do not get high expectations and probably you will not be disappointed. This is better than many other low-budget movies, and even a few big budget hobbyists who have better results, but much worse scenarios.
