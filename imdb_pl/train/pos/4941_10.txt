I believe that many people rated this film, NOT due to lack of quality. But it was not compatible with the standard Hollywood formula. Some conflicts have not been resolved. The ending is just a bit too real for others, but the journey of rich characters and a long list of supporters is both inspiring to think and very funny. Even the cinematography is excellent considering the urban surroundings, the direction is also excellent and innovative. <br /> <br /> This is 10 in my book, this movie will take you to places where the normal and expected Hollywood script will not be. They took some risks and did a few things differently. I think it worked well, I purposefully try to avoid any direct references to the film, because seeing it for myself is the best answer, not accepting someone else's interpretation.
