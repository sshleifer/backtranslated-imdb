Ok, first I have to emphasize the fact that when I saw this movie for the first time, I was 9 years old. If I saw it two weeks ago for the first time, I'd probably notice it's just another cheap cable horror movie with some well-made scenes. But when you're nine, you just do not care about these facts. It frightened me then, especially the Zelda scenes mentioned earlier (and it still happens). I am currently a bit connected with this film. I have to see it once a month, and every New Year's Eve I watch it with a 12-pack beer and a group of friends. It's like an appetizer for a good party! I agree with those people who said that acting here is quite unintentional. Midkiff and Crosby look the way I wanted them to look like Louis and Rachel, but the faces of the two do not show much devotion or feelings. Hughes and Gwynne write almost scenes that "The Creed" are in progress. What I want to say about this is that there really is no other movie that has any similarity to Pet Sematara, and I do not mean that zombie. THE ATMOSPHERE OF THIS FILM IS CURRENTLY A NOVELTY AND ONE OF A KIND. Honestly, how many times have you seen a movie that looks like a cable TV on an apparent level, but it leaves you with a shudder compared to the best horror devices? Okay, a few minutes ago I knocked down a few cast balls, but I must say that all the elements on this level also improve the whole, working perfectly. But tell me, do you really know a movie similar to Pet Sematary! I really would like to know ... And I do not mean the night of the living dead ... this intelligence is incomparable compared to these things.
