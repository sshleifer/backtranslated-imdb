If this movie was made only a few years later, I would lose the result by a point or two, because the sound quality was rather poor. Sometimes the movie seemed to be a silent movie during intermediate scenes (there are no normal ambient sounds). But given that it was 1931 and the French film, it is quite forgivable. Especially that this is also the case in later French films - until then, the sound difficulties should be worked out completely (eg in L'Atalante from 1934). <br /> <br /> Okay, except for a few minor issues, this is a lovely little movie about the missing lottery ticket and a long list of people trying to get it. And when you search, there are a lot of cheerful, small songs that you can not miss. A nice charming movie entirely.
