I just finished watching this movie for the seventh or eighth time, I chose it one night before in Blockbuster and absolutely loved it, I showed it to 4 people so far and they liked it. This independent film by Paul F. Ryan, deprived of the whole Hollywood Hollywood style, special effects and pressure on the "shock factor", gets to the heart in dealing with the consequences of traumatic situations. Two characters, Alicia (Busy Philipps) and Deanna (Erika Christensen), are set after the shooting in high school. Alicia, a girl with a stone heart, Got, who has a pessimistic approach to life, helps Deanna overcome the problems of life and death and live in the aftermath. In the meantime, Deanna tries to help Alicia again to see some of the softness and light in the world. Not putting pressure on a shocking event, but on the interpersonal relationships between those who survived, makes this film stand out. Despite the low budget and the short filming time, this film is not tacky. Ryan respects the situation he has never endured and tries to delve into the human psyche. Thanks to the amazing actress, Philipps, he adds drama to the dialogue and overall sense of the film, and Christensen helps to balance the feeling of "doom and darkness" that this film can have. Overall, I recommend this movie, and if you like the topic of school aggression and violence and learn more about it, I also suggest the document "It's a Girls World" published by the CBC in 2004, which deals with the topic of social harassment, comparison and comparison of two groups girls: in Montreal, Quebec and the other in Victoria, British Columbia, a group of friends and acquaintances Dawn Marie Wellesley, a 14-year-old girl who killed herself after brutal intimidation.
