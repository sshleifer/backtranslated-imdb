There are certainly emotions between the two main characters who are studying their relationship - one based mainly on physical attractiveness from the very beginning. The internal activities of the Mathieu family also include emotions related to his mother's problems - and how it affects their relationship. But the problem is that it leaves many things unanswered (unless I'm just too stupid to pick them up). Why is Mathieu in a psychiatric hospital? What led to the boys breaking up? And the flashing between the present and the past is initially difficult to follow. It seems that the main reason for renting this movie is to enjoy homoerotic, substitute emotions or some male nudity. But as a love story or studying a character, she is missing and unsatisfactory.
