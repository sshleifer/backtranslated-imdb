This is the first Michael Vartan movie I've seen - I have not seen Alias ​​- and I was curious if this guy could work. He can certainly be nice in this film. usually in more physical and action roles, so I found her very good and nice in this other "sweet" role of the teacher. Some of the negative comments I've read are true, the movie is full of stereotypes, and history does not really sound true at all. Even if every character in the movie notices how good they look together, I do not think screen chemistry. However, I liked the movie. The locations are nice, the characters are nice and good looking, and the supporting actors are pretty good. If you're expecting a great romance, this is not it. But if you want to see a nice innocent good movie with nice characters, it's very good.
