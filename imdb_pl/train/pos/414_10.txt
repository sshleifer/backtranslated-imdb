Cecil B. deMille really knew how to create a classic, and after 7 decades his western becomes a real McCoy, entertaining, funny, spectacular; in no way outdated. <br /> <br /> As a true DEADWOOD fan on TV, I'll tell you that Gary Cooper's performances as Wild Bill Billick and Jean Arthor as Calamity Jane are far more intentional. /> <br /> We do not have any giants in Hollywood anymore. PLAINSMAN is just one of dozens of classics from the decade 1936-1945, in which for decades lasted a decade of life: released, re-released, re-released again. Filmmakers like today's Spielberg, Jackson, and Bruckheimer are like children playing in the sandbox. None of today's films will be sought after in seven months, let alone 70 years.
