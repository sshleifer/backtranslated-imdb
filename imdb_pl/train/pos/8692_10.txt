I loved watching it. I had no idea that it was part of a larger series. I had to have about 6 years on television. I just thought it was funny and for some reason I had a deep fascination with something that was clear that it was in the pile of toys for the president. My parents recorded it from the TV when it was first aired on NBC. The tape even had an old Sanka coffee advertisement along with several others. I intend to return home soon and I will try to record the tape on my computer so that those who want a copy can do it. If any of you would like to contact me, I think you can do this through the IMDb website. I will keep you informed on a regular basis and inform you when I have a show in digital format.
