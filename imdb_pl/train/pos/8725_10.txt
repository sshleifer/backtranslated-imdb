I liked Antz, but I loved "A Bug's Life". The animation that was inserted into it paid off. I will definitely get it on DVD. By the way, Disney should create a widescreen version of this movie on tape. (I heard a conversation about crushing all characters on the screen in a standard video format). Most will have to agree that the final credits were the funniest! I only saw one of the two sets, but I can not see the other!
