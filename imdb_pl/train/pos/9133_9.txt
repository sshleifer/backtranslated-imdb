I was young to know a lot about the prince, but in the last few years I've seen a lot of Purple Rain Novelty Tee and I thought they were great, but I did not want to buy a shirt I did not know about. So one Saturday a fuse came and I decided to watch it. I did not know what the movie would be about before I watched it, but when I found out, it was great. In the film, the prince was not known as a prince, but as a "kid." All the performances were great for me, but my favorite was Purple Rain, Darling Nicki, and I would die for you. All the songs were related to what was happening throughout the movie, when his mother and father always fought the song, when the pigeons were crying they described what he felt. I also like how smart the prince was with the way he flirted with Apallonia. I liked it when Prince and Appallonia met for the first time in the club, and he stood behind her, and then when she turned away he disappeared! great movie, and now I can not even find one of these shirts :(
