This film, despite being over 70 years old, is still a very moving, powerful movie. Bette Davis, as a slut, malicious waitress Cockney Mildred, is absolutely credible. Watching her performances is still captivating. It makes the viewer despise her and at the same time feel sorry for her. Lesli Howard's performance as a weak, obsessive Phillip Carey is not so strong, but I do not see how any actor could oppose Mrs. Davis's performance. He experiences the scenery in every scene in which he is located, completely stealing the show. It's the movie that sealed her stardom and she deserved the Academy Award, but lost. It was shocking for what was happening to the subjects related to the dead pregnancy, many sexual partners, and Mildred's misspelled language, so it's a bit outdated, but it's still a great movie. To see the scene where Mildred tells Phillip what he REALLY thinks about him ("You, you filthy pig ..."), is still one of the greatest actors I've ever seen in a movie.
