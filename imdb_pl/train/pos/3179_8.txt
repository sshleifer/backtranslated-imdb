Who made this movie? I love this movie? Someone has a weird sense of humor ... This Zany, surrealist style of making movies is attractive, but it is difficult to create - or easily forget - that substance and characters that really have souls, which gives such a depth of film . Without this comedy are just a few ideas. Who cares. It may laugh, but it passes through you like a semi-good hamburger ... next ... <br /> <br /> Crosseyed may not intend to change anyone, but I appreciate the depth and content. They sneak up to you. I started this movie thinking, "Oh, I understand - an independent comedy - from the wall - gonzo ... yup". And that's it - but if you pay attention to the fact that it's filled with subteksty and moments of the characters. In this sense, the movie breathes. It creates proposals that give you a pause - if you're available to see them - and then, of course, it happens in a very cheerful way. <br /> <br /> You will not hit a point if you do not sign a contract to suspend your faith at the moment of the movie. The transition between reality and surrealism is one of the points of this film. <br /> <br /> Crosseyed is not perfect, but intelligent people did it. I want more. <br /> <br /> The scenes in the dining room are an absolute HOOT. <br /> <br /> Put on the seat belt.
