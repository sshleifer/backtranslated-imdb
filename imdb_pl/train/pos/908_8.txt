I can not believe that this movie has a score of 6.9. Anyway, this movie was probably one of the most moving real Indian movies I've ever seen. It was really refreshing to see a movie that showed traditional family cinema. Regarding the story, I thought it was great that a marriage of amrita rao was made for shahid kapur. She is the type of a happy guest, while Amrita Rao is a traditional Indian girl who is very helpful to her uncle, but the only problem is that her cousin does not seem to pay attention to what her aunt does not like Amrita with passion. It annoys Amrita because she wants her aunt to love her. It was also very touching that although the Amrita family was not so rich, maybe only the middle class to a lower class, while the Shahid family was quite tall, they still treated their family with respect and did not even ask them what really struck me nervously. This is because I have seen people who are very rude to people who do not think as well as below their standards, which I consider very shallow. This movie showed that the Shahid family was ready to look at the great values ​​that Amrita grew up with and turned a blind eye to the fact that she was not a rich daughter of business tycoons or anything like that. All in all, this movie deserved 8/10. I would like more and more of these kinds of films to be made.
