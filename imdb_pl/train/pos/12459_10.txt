This movie is definitely one of my favorite films of its kind. The interaction between respected and morally indestructible characters is oda to chivalry and a code of honor among thieves and policemen. It treats subjects such as duty, guilt, word, manipulation and trust, as several films did, and unfortunately there is no one that I remember from the death of "policial" in the late seventies. The sequence is delicious, to the essence of things, there is nothing beyond what leads the viewer to the masterful story, right and wrong, without additional eye-catching and spectacular scenes, which are often needed in smaller specimens of the genre to keep the audience awake. No such scenes are present or needed. This argument is causeless and fair to the viewer, who is an important asset in a genre in which tension is often achieved through betrail of the audience. No, it does not miss Marble ... A note congratulating music is fine. A movie to watch and enjoy every minute, not just to see.
