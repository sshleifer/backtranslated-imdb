Since I remember and I'm only 18 years old, my mother and I watched older films because I find them more rewarding in the long run (but hey, do not get me wrong, I love movies that today not only as much as I love movies from the 40s. and 50. Anyway, now I have to say that when I started watching the movie, my eyes were stuck to the television, of course, my favorite character was Granny played by Lucile Watson, but I loved the way Betty Davis and her family were portrayed. ... they did not behave like children, but there is a good reason for this, because I had to hide and lead most of my life seeing terrible things that children saw that these days destroyed their innocence, so people saying "oooo I hated how they worked children ... blah blah blah "read between the lines and know that they have seen things that children should not see. <br /> <br /> Paul Lukas ... dear Paul did an amazing job !!! Now I know that a lot of people are angry that he goes to Oscar and not God, but hey they did amazing work, so I think it could go both ways. But the performance of Lukas was so amazing that at the end of the movie I was reduced to tears. I really enjoyed this movie and recommend it to everyone !! :-RE
