This is a charming and sad story about cultural differences. Kyoko is a beautiful Japanese woman who fled to California to escape the failed relationship in Japan. Ken is a Japanese Japanese worker with rock star and rock star aspirations, but not very specific to offer a potential partner. Kyoko "marries" Ken to be able to stay in the United States permanently, with the understanding that although they will live together until they get a "green card", the marriage will have only a name. Soon it begins to show that the pages are not on the same wavelength - or maybe in the same "time zone", hence the title of the film. As an Immigration attorney I saw that such "arrangements" take on their own life, so I was pleased to see how well the filmmaker developed the dramatic possibilities of this situation.
