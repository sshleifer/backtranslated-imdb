The charming Danish actress Sonja Richter steals the film from everyone's nose, regardless of the wonderful performances around her. <br /> <br /> Richter plays Anna, a non-working, independent, somewhat neurotic (and possibly suicidal) actress who desperately deals with the care of a wheelchair, a hushed, aging father Valentin (the great Danish actor Frits Helmuth, who he died at the age of 77 shortly after filming. br /> SPOILER ALERT <br /> <br /> Valentin refuses to answer anyone - until he confronts the talented Anna, whose whimsical and mischievous way brings back the poor, battered devil of the imposed judgment death. /> <br /> Writer / director / actor Eric Clausen made a strong film about the difficulties that a tough businessman-son (Jorgen, played by Clausena) loved a father who never accepted him. The film collapses late, but Clausen has some important things to say about euthanasia, the nature and value of love and care, and how one person, unrestrained Anna, can change the course of human life. Highly recommended. The Sonja Richter performance is worth its price in itself.
