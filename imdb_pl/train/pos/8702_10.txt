A woman lives in this world and she was alone. They were both alone because the boy had a present and a curse in one package - he was able to pull the sword out of his arm. On his wrist there was always a wound that caused this "gift" - a wound of deadly weapon inside his body. First, he kills his drunken stepfather, who hurts his mother every time. Then he grows up and decides to find his real father. It's just that the superhero is so easy - he gets justice ... but society decides that this justice is not necessary and dangerous, which is really right, because it's not like in Hollywood movies that the character does not try to kill anyone - Sasha the hero whose actor is Artem Tkachenko) kills if a person who in his opinion deserves to die, but blames him for authority and runs away. In such an escape from the authorities and mafia he meets a girl (in the role of Chulpana Hamatova) and falls in love with her. Everything else is to be watched ... not said. Be aware that this movie is more about feelings and emotions, but not about activities. This film is filled with the pain of the main character and his vision of life.
