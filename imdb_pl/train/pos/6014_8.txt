All the reviews about how much ZP does not have a story, the acting is wooden, the scene of the orgy does not make sense, etc. Everything goes past the main point. <br /> <br /> Let's be honest. It is a movie filmed in the wild days of the late 1960s and early 1970s in Los Angeles. It is a movie to be watched while you are H-I-G-H from your mind on some psychedelic substance. <br /> <br /> Find some donut and burn out, or get a gentle acid boost. Seriously, these simple and sober ZP reviews lose their meaning. You can not get anything out of this movie in a simple way. <br /> <br /> Until you watch this movie on the big screen (which I'm lucky to do three times in the 90s, when ZP was quite rare) stumbling, you have no idea what's going on in this movie. <br /> <br /> If you insist on not falling into the intoxication, you can at least appreciate the ending when the crappy soundtrack of the magnificent pink Floyd remake "Careful With That Ax, Eugene", "Come in Number 51, Your Time Is up. "
