When I sat down to watch "Largo Winch", I did not expect anything but action scenes and fascinating cars. When I got up, I saw both; and more. <br /> <br /> Karl Roden was not an antagonist in the movie after all. Kristin Scott Thomas played her role well, but in my opinion the two real stars are Tomer Sisley and Miki Manojlovic, both of them playing great. In Radivoje Bukvic, he played the character of Goran. <br /> <br /> Mixed linguistics has brought a nice color to the film, but I understand why people will get bored. <br /> <br /> Scenery of Hong Kong and above all I was amazed by the stunning Croatian seaside and I did not want to take my eyes off the screen when Largo entered an incredibly beautiful island. <br /> <br /> Rolls Royce Phantom; Mercedes S500 and BMW 7; if someone loves expensive limousine cars; this is their movie. It is also a film for people who love action sequences, good acting, extreme beauty scenes, and above all a fast, well-written action movie, with a dazzling battle and completely intertwined inner drama. <br /> <br /> My voice, as dawned on a grim day, is: 10/10
