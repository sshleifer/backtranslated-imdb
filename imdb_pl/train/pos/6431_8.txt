Graphics and effects are on par with the original movie and provide a lot of entertainment, even if the plot is essentially the same as the first two films. It also seems to be much more erotic than I remember other movies. If you're a big fan of flying hair and tongues that can reach up to your stomach, you'll love this movie.
