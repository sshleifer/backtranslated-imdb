Well, if you're one of these Katana film nuts (like me), you'll certainly appreciate this metaphysical swing of samurai action with katana. <br /> <br /> Starring Tadanobu Asano (Vital, Barren Illusion) and Ryu Daisuke (Kagemusha). This samurai war between the Heiki clan and Genji's clan hit the zenith in the final game on the Gojo bridge. The number of bodies is innumerable. <br /> <br /> Demons, magical swords, Shinto priests versus Buddhist monks and beautiful visions provided by master Sogo Ishii will do the rest. <br /> <br /> A good Japanese guy waving on a rainy summer night.
