I just saw the press release of this movie and was pleasantly surprised. It's not uncommon for me to see all of my favorite actors in one movie at a time. <br /> <br /> I really liked the pockets scene and it was good to see Rachael Bilson and Hayden back together. I think that their chemistry in the camera is a direct result of their spending time together outside the camera. My favorite scene was definitely (surprisingly) the song of Bret Ratner ... Without giving too much, I will just say that there is a surprise that leaves you hanging ... <br /> <br /> The old couple were really good and you really did the impression that they spent their whole life together. <br /> <br /> Both Chris Cooper and Ethan Hawke's segments were full of surprises that seem realistic and similar to the experiences I had in a big apple. The whole movie is a great place for a date ... especially if you like the city itself. <br /> <br /> I can not wait for the next in the City of Love.
