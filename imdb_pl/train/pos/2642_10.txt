It is really a "warming heart" movie. He won the George Peobody award, winning from "Roots", so you can say something about the essence of this film. I'm looking on the Internet for how to order this movie since my father-in-law, Eugene Logan, co-author of this film, has already died for several years, so I do not have the opportunity to receive information from him. I would like to have his only grand daughter, my daughters, see this film, and pass this wonderful story to his great-grandsons. My oldest daughter was seven years old when she was on TV, and I could not wait to see her again. One of my friends said it was her favorite movie. I will not spoil this film.
