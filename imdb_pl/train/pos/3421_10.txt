This shorter film is the embodiment of the expected results when the imbecile is in the process of asylum. It is sad how the future of these young people has been pushed to the table, when neither Saddam Hussein nor the people of Iraq, God is resting the 350,000 plus souls who were killed had nothing to do with terrorism or al-Quida. <br /> <br /> After this video, a penetrating viewer will have to download or download a copy of "Loose Change". This movie is available for free on the Internet until Bush Bush closes it, searching for the title itself, as indicated in brackets. <br /> <br /> God save our country. This will not be done by following the fascists who have controlled the congress halls for over 10 years before November 2006!
