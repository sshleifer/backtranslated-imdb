I admit that I only saw three plays of Shakespeare (Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth and of course Hamlet), which I liked, the second I found so (Macbeth), and Hamlet just found a masterpiece. It's nice to say that this adaptation is just as good as an intense and dramatic game. Acting is extremely strong (with cast that includes Kenneth Branagh, Robin Williams and Billy Crystal, how can you lose?), And the change of time (it looks like somewhere between 17 and 1800) plays beautifully when heroes move and tell your infamous lines straight from the script that every Shakespeare fan will feel shivers. If you like this popular drama, I strongly encourage you to look at this massive adaptation from 1996 of Shakespeare devotee Kenneth Branagh.
