The latest film by Spanish director Agusti Villaronga is a study of how children who experience violence and isolation in their distant community are transformed into restless young adults who need some psychic tools to cope with the hidden weakness of the mind. Regardless of whether these tools are a religion or not, or whether they simply impose a macho image while engaging in a male prostitute, Villaronga effectively checks how these defects affect three teenagers living in Spain under Franco . These three are witnesses of an alarming double death or their friends before they become teenagers, and then buried the emotions they feel with their peers, weak corpses until they meet again in the hospital for people suffering from tuberculosis. <br /> <br /> the cinematic style of the text is usually visually rich, as one might expect from a Spanish author, and is very similar to the work of a Spanish colleague Pedro Almodovar with topics about sexual desire, both heterosexual and homosexual. An element that differs from both directors is the fact that Villaronga favors a supernatural halftone combined with a claustrophobic, rough realism opposed to Almodovar's surrealism, although both styles are similar. <br /> <br /> The song gives an insight into the problematic young psyche and contains disturbing violence and scenes of a sexual nature. I highly recommend watching this movie because it contains elements that will stay with the audience for a long time after watching.
