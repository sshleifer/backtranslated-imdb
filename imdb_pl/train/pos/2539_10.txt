For real filmmakers, this film is a must, because it works as a perfect little allegory to the movies themselves. The science of Janos Rukh / Boris Karloff concerns the interception and projection of light from cosmic phenomena. This light can be harmful, or it can be used to do good. On the one hand, it blinds the mother, and on the other hand it is used to cure blindness ("I see!", A young girl screams, eyes throwing a light). When Rukh / Karloff is poisoned by the incredible power of this light, we see him emitting a spooky glow on his hands and face like a badly developed negative, pointing out that the person we are watching is a projection, the individual watched on the film (visible, like in the cinema, when the lights are off). <br /> <br /> There is a wonderful piece near the beginning where Karloff / Rukh explains his research as information about the fact that everything that happens is captured in the light that goes on in space for millions of years when light of Andromeda was broadcasted from this galaxy at a time when the earth was still a melted rock. <br /> <br /> There are fragments in the film when this new science is combined with older culture vehicles: the writer, in the form of Beulah Bondi / Arabella Stevens; and religion, symbolized on sculptural figures in the local cathedral. A blasting rifle with its radiant projector / gun. <br /> <br /> You need to think about whether this movie was to take a look at what was happening in Germany at that time, and especially to Riefenstall's use of the movie a year earlier in order to promote a regime that will surely last do a lot of damage: Triumph of the Will. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, my mother (Violet Kemble Cooper) intervenes, reminding Janos Rukh of the first rule of learning. <br /> <br /> If more movies made you want to get up in the theater and shout, "I see!".
