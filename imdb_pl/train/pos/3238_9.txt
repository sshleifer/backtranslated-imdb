Finnish version of Robert Altman's Short Cuts, set in a small rural village of Ęänekoski. Episodes present a kaleidoscope of eternal events, problems and emotions of human life: joy and love, deception and disappointment, hopelessness and death. I was impressed by the two episodes. The first is the story of a young waitress who tries to arouse an affair for her colleagues: it radiates the overwhelming joy of love and life. The second episode shows an old man dying in the hospital and his wife trying to help him die with dignity. Particularly striking is the way in which the old couple has to fight the humiliating practices of the hospital and their loneliness, contrasting with the "routine" of the hospital staff (despite the signs of sporadic empathy). Compared to the Altman classic, this movie may be less professional, but it is certainly a great art.
