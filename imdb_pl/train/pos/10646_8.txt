This great movie consists mainly of documentary material that is currently on DVD along with Prelude to War. The great American filmmaker and story-teller Frank Capra made these films that simply and clearly draw attention to the main points that caused the Second World War and the rise of Hitler. <br /> <br /> Every child in school, no, every American should watch these movies today because they are so apropos. History is still repeating! Lord Chamberlains are still alive and kicking; tactics used by the Nazis to infiltrate countries by supporters, and then by communists, and now by Muslim terrorist groups, continue to work in favor of these bad groups. <br /> <br /> Sitting and allowing Hitler in 1935, aggressive - France, America and England killed over 50 million people. The Americans, the French and the British will happily allow Hitler to do exactly the same, even though we should learn from history what happens when dictators are allowed to break treaties. <br /> <br /> These great videos can be too simple for those who love the history of World War II. They do not talk about the horrors that the Soviet Union caused, because at that time America merged with them, fighting Hitler. This film tells simple facts and motives that led to a terrible war.
