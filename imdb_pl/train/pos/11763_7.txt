My guess is that at some point everyone must come back. And this is exactly what an embarrassed resident of Taft, Jack Dundee (Robin Williams) intends to do in "The Best of Times". Yes, a man who went crazy on "Good Morning, Vietnam" is playing football. In this case, he tries to recreate the game that cost his high school the prestigious title. But former teammate Reno Hightower (Kurt Russell) will not be so easy to agree with. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is not the best movie for any of them. But Williams and Russell are actually quite a good comedy band. Some of the names in this movie will probably give you chuckles. Check it out.
