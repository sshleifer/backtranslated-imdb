and everyone who watches this movie will agree. This film was directed at a time when the plot, the credibility of the character and the theme really did matter. <br /> <br /> Jean Peters, Widmark and Thelma Ritter are stealing the spotlight. Ritter is in top form as an informer of "Moe" who survived in the Bowery department in New York, acting as a pigeon on a police stool in New York. and she definitely proves her acting ability here, along with her Brooklyn accent. Widmark is as dangerous as an antihero who needs to see what is right despite his cash needs. <br /> <br /> Photography is brilliant. Neon, subway station (although it looks clean than in reality!) Harbor harbor, where Widmark lives as a temporary. Excellent use of the city, from "Lightning Louie" in Chinatown; many of the city's flavors and appetites are addressed here; the political climate at this time is a haunting background. 10/10
