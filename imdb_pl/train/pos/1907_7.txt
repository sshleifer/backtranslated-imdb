8 Simple Rules is a fun program, but it also has life lessons, especially one mature lesson about losing after losing, which was the episode in which Paul died, which was the first episode I have ever seen in the ABC series. Clan Hennessy - mother Cate (Katey Sagal), daughters Bridget (Kaley Cuoco) and Kerry (Amy Davidson) and son Rory (Martin Spanjers) - turn to each other for guidance and support after the death of Paul (John Ritter), patriarch of the family. Cate's parents (James Garner and Suzanne Pleshette) help. I'm happy later, in the second season of this program, they decided to put David Spade on the show, since he finished with the NBC series, Just Shoot Me! But everything and the whole program is quite good. This series reminds me of many classic family comedies from the 80's and 90's that were once in ABC.
