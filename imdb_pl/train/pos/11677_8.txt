I loved the Long Way Round and I was not even aware of the Dakar race until I saw it on the shelves of my local supermarket. I bought it and after a bit "hmm it will be so good" the first episode I decided it was. Charlie Boorman was great, as were other crew members. It's great to see him with Ewan again. There was a bit of a curse in it, but it did not bother me. As for the fact that there is no mention of them on the packaging. That's more about the stupid Excempt from Classification certificate that BBFC has. They should give him 15 only for the language itself. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend the series, I want more !!
