It was a charming movie. A real good movie when you need it. The story is light (this is not Gone with the wind), but sometimes you need this kind of plot. Funny and warm characters, fantastic acting and beautiful costumes / wardrobe. <br /> <br /> Parminder K. Nagra (also from the ER television series) is WONDERFUL in this role. He is definitely a new Hollywood star. Everyone should keep an eye on her, in the future he will be LARGE. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack for this movie was also impressive. A nice blend of modern and Indian melodies. I danced most of the movie. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it if you need a fun movie.
