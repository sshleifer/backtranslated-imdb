This movie is much better than the original The Jerk. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes bizarre humor. We've included almost as many lines from this movie into our daily discourse as with Monty Python. <br /> <br /> Card game with hobosami, and then with suicide. The scene at the table and his reluctance to eat the turtle soup. The original The Jerk was too directed and staged. While I like Steve Martin, he looked like he was trying hard. The Jerk Too is a trick and will be enjoyed by everyone. The Jerk Too is family friendly, in contrast to the original The Jerk.
