First of all, no adaptation is as good as a book, especially when you're dealing with a master writer like Tolkien. This ADAPTION greatly synthesizes the Tolkien universe with psychedelia, aesthetics and liberal culture from the 70s. Yes - animation and background painting are sometimes a bit "rough" in technical performance, but nevertheless they are beautiful and very suggestive when it comes to giving a unique "sense of place" to each of the scenes. Apart from the absolute exceptionality in the imaging, there is an absolutely unique acting voice - action that is MUCH better than acting in new live action movies. And although cellular animation may not be the most "technically efficient" animation, it perfectly reflects the expressive gestures of the body and face of the actress, at the same time not forgetting about subtlety and subtlety. Background images differ from the traditional "fantasy" theme to abstraction, but the transition to abstraction is always motivated by narrative and contributes to a large extent to the themes of the film. If you are a person who must have extensive computer rendering in a movie so that everything is visualized for you, then I can see how you do not like this movie, but if you like top-class acting, transcendental paintings and JRR Tolkien, then this movie is a must see.
