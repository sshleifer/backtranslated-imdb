This movie speaks in a universal language; you can refer to yourself, the community, society or the wider world. It has a way of opening not only a few questions, but also putting one in the quest to discover and ask the right questions to reach this point of belief / property. The presentation of stereotypes in the film concerns the archetypes around us, which should be considered a repetitive cycle of destruction, the opposite force of innovation, creativity and growth. Factors that disrupt the natural flow of things must be seen and solved. The idea is definitely a film that must be experienced and which is not seen only when it falls into the inner voice / conscience by looking, it makes the person feel, not just watching.
