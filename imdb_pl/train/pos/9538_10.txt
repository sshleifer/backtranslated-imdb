Why are there no more (especially American) films more like Meatball Machine? <br /> <br /> This is my first official online review and I am accused of "electric ecstasy" after choosing "Meatball Machine" as my first venture. This is a review, so I will try to keep only reflection and emotions. <br /> <br /> I mean, this is one creative song, even though it's clearly inspired by the classic TETSUO! And what if it is not all original? I'm the owner of both of these movies, and although Tetsuo is a weird son of a bitch, Meatball Machine is much better and you can sit down without a strong desire to donate a mind-altering drug to explain the meaning of the movie. Meatball Machine is as extensive in its history as in its high blood and blood supply. Thank you Jesus for Japanese Cinema! <br /> <br /> Simply put, the last time my dreams were mastered by the horror stories that happened after watching Nightmare on Elm Street when I was 7 years old. I could imagine in my dreams the language coming out of the phone for many weeks. This time (at the age of 31) my dreams were pleasantly inspiring. <br /> <br /> In this movie, human bodies are the hosts of aliens whose only goal is to try to fulfill their endless extinguishing of the human body and blood. People become cyborgs eating the body !!! There's more!!! Fight scenes!! Great music!! Great shots from the point of view! A decent working woman Cyborg (at least better than her male equivalent). The fight seen at the end is worth watching ten or twenty times. <br /> <br /> Oh, did I forget to mention that it's a love story! Wow, I hate love stories, but it takes away the cake! <br /> <br /> I can not wait to have friends to watch this movie again to see the reaction on their faces. Unfortunately, I have spent some time writing this review because I am afraid that most friends and family do not understand Meatball Machine. The truth is that America as a whole is not prepared for the Meatball Machine. <br /> <br /> At the end, my wife came in when I saw the climax scene of the fight, and she was speechless. Normally, he says something like "why are you watching this garbage?" This time she had nothing to say. I was happy! <br /> <br /> This is not junk. This is not just SPLATTER (splatter is also great because of splatter). This is art, my friends. Art. <br /> <br /> CHACHO
