I first discovered Fantasy, THE THIEF BAGDADA by Aleksander Korda (1940) in the early 1950s in the re-edition of "The Wonder Show of the Century!". Both Kord Technicolor, THE THIEF BAGDAD and JUNGLE BOOK films have been shown on one of the never-forgotten programs. Miklos Rozsa's music strengthened both films. Technicolor in everyone was amazingly beautiful! THE THIEF BAGDAD remained on my list as the best fantasy film ever made. As the years went by, it became increasingly difficult to enjoy the color of the film in the way it was originally presented. True Technicolor gave way to the Eastman Color process in the mid-1950s. Both Kino and Samuel Goldwyn re-released the film both theatrical and video. But Eastman Color prints were more pastel and softened the life of the original Technicolor. The Laser Disc edition of this title also has a pastel appearance - nice but not as it should be. NOW there is a problem with M-G-M DVD (December 3, 2002). THE THIEF OF BAGDAD again has the wonderful look of Technicolor on DVD, which is nothing but STUNNING !!! It was so exciting to see it once again that once watching the DVD, I watched it a second time. The only "additions" are the Spanish dubbing version, subtitles in English and Spanish, and a beautifully made original theater trailer. Thank you M-G-M for this unique DVD. Now you can only hope that the FOUR SONGS Cords and the restored version of KUNGY JUNGLE BOOK (to replace the weak public prints in circulation) will soon appear on DVD.
