This - and not some overtly overrated Opera of Southern Soap - was the biggest epic that came out of the biggest Hollywood year in 1939. Jr. gives you great comic performances. However, I would like to draw attention to two other, less understandable elements of this masterpiece. A wonderful final battle sequence, like the miraculous Sam Jaffe climbs laboriously to the top of the temple to blow up the bugle-call and warn the regiment, it's just great. It never disappoints me. Another underestimated element of the film is the performance of Eduardo Ciannelli as Guru. This is not a caricature of Fu Manchu, but well drawn, articulated, historically informed ("Have you ever heard of Changruputra Mauryi?" Indeed, you can see the similarities between this mystical, evil nationalist and a well-known figure from the thirties (German, not Indian) Gunga Din, an anti-Nazi treaty, not really, but it's still an amazing, funny, moving epic.
