<br /> <br /> It is definitely "a must see" for those who occasionally smoke a cold store in their hidden hideout, trying to avoid being caught by parents, teachers, police, etc. ... The protagonist is a woman in her forties, living in a residence, growing orchids and absolutely oblivious to the fact that her so-called rich and truthful husband is in fact broke and betrayed. When he suddenly dies, he faces the truth. The bailiffs come to tell her that he has a huge debt. She does not know what to do until her gardener tells her about the recent success of marijuana in the UK. After a long reflection, he decides to get rid of flowers and start breeding instead ... The story is quite original, the performances are outstanding! I can come up with just a few movies that made me laugh more than this one. However, the melodramatic touch is present. The film is typical of the British: jokes are not vulgar, no violence. It should not be mentioned that several projects are recommended before watching "Savings". It will be much more fun! Especially the scene with two older ladies in their teahouse is fun. I thought my jaws would break. 9/10
