This movie is one of those "WOW!" Cinema. Not because it's the best movie of all time, but because it surprised me. Not only was this a T.V. movie, but he was on Elvis. I can honestly say that as many counterfeiters as there are, there was only one Elvis, but I can also say that Kurt Russel was very close to being real. It was one of the greatest incarnations I've ever seen. He believed that it really was him. I've learned a lot about Elvis' life from watching this movie. And do not let the television part let you go wrong - it's a really fantastic movie! And Kurt Russel could have been Elvis's twin :)
