Hidden Frontier is a show created by fans in the world of Star Trek. The story takes place after Voyager returns from the quadrant Delta. He has several characters from official appearances in Star Trek, but most of them are original for the series. The show takes place on the basis of the Deep Space 12 star and on several spacecraft, which gives opportunities that official performances do not have. The heroes have the opportunity to climb in the hierarchy, whose characters on shows with only one ship do not have. The show has a good computer animation of spacecraft, but the game takes place in front of the green screen and gives the green light around the actors. Not all actors are equally good, but most of them are doing well. Episodes are driven by characters, and characters evolve in many episodes. It's a bit more like Babylon 5 than most official Star Trek shows. Hidden Frontier accepts taboos, which even the official series has shrunk from use. All in all, I liked watching.
