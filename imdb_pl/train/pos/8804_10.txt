Ten of the 11 short films in this film are masterpieces (only Egyptian disappointment). Almost everyone, apart from the Mexican director, decided to present the problems of individuals or groups in connection with 9-11: Afghan refugees, deaf people, Palestinians, widows of Srebrenica, AIDS and poverty and corruption in Africa, the Pinochets coup and resulting bloodshed, attacks suicide in Israel, striking paranoia and persecuted Muslims in the US, old people living alone and the consequences of World War II in the hearts of Asian soldiers. This may say something sad about the limitations of empathy in both directions: directors may feel that Americans ignore the pains of the rest of the world and care only for their own tragedies, while they effectively do the same with their short films. br /> <br /> Surprisingly, I found Sean Penn's song as one of the best in the collection and *** SPOILER AHEAD *** I'm also guessing his image of Ernest Borgnine as a half-crazy old man living in New York living the happiest moment of life widow, when the sun shines through his window after the WTC "collapsed", I think it may also be one of the most offensive, as the general American audience will see.
