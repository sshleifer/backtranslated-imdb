ONCE THE TIME there were different types of films. These different films coexisted, although everyone had something else to offer .... <br /> <br /> At first glance, it seems obvious, but I thought that I would like to mark it during this review, because it seems that a few people may have forgotten. This is just a funny movie for Pavarotti fans. That's all. He does not claim that he is something else or something grander. People who ridicule him as something that did not fulfill their promise do not see the whole picture - literally. Hollywood makes films all the time, which are shameless vehicles for people (Bodyguard or The Preacher's Wife in Whitney Houston are two examples that come to mind.) At the beginning I would like to take care of the film as a vehicle for Pavarotti. There are worse things in this world - and worse films. Singing is fantastic, and the choice of arias is fun. The film begins with Ave Maria Schubert and then Matinatta Leoncavallo. Pav sings arias from La Gioconda, Manon Lescaut and Turandot, but also sings popular music such as "I left my heart in San Francisco" and a song that was nominated for an Oscar and a Golden Globe, "If we were in love" music by John Williams and lyrics Alana and Marilyn Bergman - all three previous Oscar winners. <br /> <br /> The story is not so bad. It was built for Pavarotti, so of course it will not be something deep or universal for the average movie viewer. This is the story of a famous opera singer who survived many years ago at the opera on a bad night. When asked to re-sing in the same place, "MET" in New York, he loses his voice in fear. Doctor Pamela (or Pah-MAY-lah in Italian :)) played by Kathryn Harrold - gives him a chance to cure his psychosomatic reaction. He gives her a chance to throw herself with him and she reluctantly accepts. <br /> <br /> They start an affair, knowing that he is married and promises that he will not fall in love with him and his thoughts that he will be just another woman. Despite everything, they fall in love (so the song "IF we were in love") and with her help overcomes fear and returns to MET, where he triumphs. I will not say how it ends, but it is quite predictable. Which is not always bad. <br /> <br /> Apprentices are not that bad. Pavarotti (who plays Giorgio Fini) is not an actor, so if you're expecting Spencer Tracy or Tom Hanks to perform, you're cheated, not Pavarotti. He knows that he is not thespian. What is is charming, charming and charismatic. Sam is having fun, and if you can just have fun, it's not so bad. One funny thing is that when he tells Pamela (Harrold) that he is "a thirsty plant, Fini can water you!" And of course he says, "I do not want to be watered by Fini!" Kathryn Harrold is very sweet and does a good job as a half-tense woman who is learning from this extravagant man to live a little. One of my favorite lines in the film is: "Life must never be the size of life." And there is Eddie Albert, who does his usual good job as manager of Fini. There are several "videographers" with real conductors, singers, etc. And it's shot on the spot at the Metropolitan Opera at the Lincoln Center. <br /> <br /> If you like opera, you like Pavarotti, or if you can just afford a "small fling", as proposed in the movie - you can enjoy this movie. I know I do - EVERY time. :) <br /> <br />
