It was unbelievable, which meant it was hard to believe that the "forgotten tribe" would make this amazing migration twice a year, and the filmmakers, Cooper and Schoedsack, did not put up some scenes and shots. But what are their shots! Pictures, mostly in extreme conditions, are brilliant, and the score of Iranian music added to the video release gives this memorable document extra wealth. <br /> <br /> I had the pleasure to see this and "Kon Tiki" on the same weekend, which was a thrill and certainly made me see how difficult and resistant people can be courageous, or for primitive survival, or for adventure or in the name of science.
