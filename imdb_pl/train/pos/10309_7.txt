Now you either like Mr. Carrey's humor or not. Me, Irena and I had an audience going out both crowds and on the other hand, cheering and collapsing in puddles of merriment. Bruce Almighty is a little more mainstream, but you've been warned. <br /> <br /> If you're unsure, check out the trailer. Three times I saw a trailer and I was still laughing about the same gag when I saw the movie. If you do not see a dog putting a seat on a funny toilet, do not worry about the movie. <br /> <br /> Carrey, the reporter got stuck in the ruts, hiding the "lighter messages" he chases God when his whole life seems to collapse. God takes the challenge and asks Carrey, or better. Carrey is swinging, having all the powers of God, increasing her girl's breasts (Jennifer Aniston), promoting and responding to the prayers of all by means of computer commands with a single stroke. <br /> <br /> This is not a highbrow film or even an unforgettable one, but it is very well made to a very limited extent, it provides almost constant laughter to Carrey's fans, and even any religious cheesy can be harmless to everyone except for the narrow minds and opponents -god-squadders. <br /> <br /> On a more thoughtful level, the film tempts us to speculate about his own career Carrey - he got stuck in his "comedy" typing, he did not even make a serious impression. after winning two Golden Globes. His most successful "simple" role, "Man on the Moon", is less known than his comedy game - or The Truman Show (on which the Academy has won three nominations, omitting Carrey).
