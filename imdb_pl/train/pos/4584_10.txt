I did not see any of Chan's films, but this is definitely the best movie I've seen so far. <br /> <br /> This story is nothing special in itself, so I won go deeper into it. What makes him special is acrobatics, fighting, good acting, a warm sense of humor. The movie has a raging pace all the time and you are just stunned to see it. All the cool acrobatics (of course made by Jackie himself) make you want to jump on the couch and scream. It's just amazing! Even my mother was impressed by this amazing movie when she saw him. <br /> <br /> I know that this police history can be a bit hard to come by, at least in Sweden. But I can assure you that it is worth a try.
