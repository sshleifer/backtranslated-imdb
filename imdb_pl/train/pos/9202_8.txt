I must admit that Dev has an eye on beauty and talent. He gave a break to Zeenat Aman, a successful model, and a former winner of a beauty contest, throwing her in a role that was created especially for her debut. Her flowered look in sunglasses and swaying on mesmerizing music made her an instant favorite of viewers. This film is a feast for the eyes, with its picturesque locations, ethnic people, temples of Buddha and chirpy, naughty Mumtaz who looks quite attractive, in his ethnic dress and dancing skills. Dev is obviously charming, and this is one of his commercial successes. Hare Rama manages to maintain interest through carefully written script, editing and captivating music. Like Des Pardes, his next film, Anand coped with a topic in which young people get into the habit of drug addiction, and the theory that they come from distorted families and difficult childhood is quite likely. Good artist, this movie stays fresh for the day!
