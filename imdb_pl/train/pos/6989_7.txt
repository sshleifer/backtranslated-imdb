This movie appeared on the very early episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000, but when I watch this movie, I do not think about this wonderful TV series. I think it was a surprisingly good horror of the early 1940s, with a surprisingly good sound and image for a 67-year-old horror movie from the public domain. I really enjoyed watching Bela Lugosi and his weird staff, including a wife who needs fluid from the glands of young would-be brides, an old witch and her two weird sons, one big idiot, another comic dwarf (Angelo Rossitto from 1932's Freaks). I also liked a young reporter reporter who is a stereotype, but it's still cool to watch him. My only problem with this decent movie is the plot, even funny and unbelievable in the film. I do not want to mess up any of these movies, so go ahead and borrow it, or better still, buy it for a few bucks.
