I've seen this movie three times and every time I see it, watching becomes more personal and more emotional. <br /> <br /> Acting is amazing, which is not hard to believe, because it is Daniela Lewis Day, who is an amazing actor. Brenda Fricker is, however, a miracle of surprise. He grasps your heart as the mother of a physically disabled boy who can not walk or speak until he's finished teenagers. <br /> <br /> I can not say enough good things about the movie, but I will stay here. I recommend it to anyone who likes movies based on real events or simply enjoy good movies in general.
