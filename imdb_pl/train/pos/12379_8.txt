I was an oracle in an old theater in northern California when the movie came out. Just like on DVD, it's even more amazing and scary on the big screen. Although it's been about 9 years since I've seen it, it's still one of my favorites. At the risk of sounding banal: "They just do not like them anymore!" If Sixth Sense scares you at all, this movie is definitely for you! A great story, an amazing cast of characters, an ominous setting; even the soundtrack has a disturbing quality. I highly recommend that you do not watch it yourself. What he rented a brown stone apartment in 1977, It will make you gasp (it would be at least 10 times more than today).
