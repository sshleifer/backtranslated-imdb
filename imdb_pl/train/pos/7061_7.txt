Of course, the original is better, but it is not as bad as everyone says! Yes, it's made up of 3 stories, but hey, so what ?! I thought that to be honest, it was pretty good. I really liked how Anastasia changed a bit when she fell in love, shows what love can do. These stories were not that bad either. <br /> <br /> I also liked Cinderella's voice. I do not mind her voice in the original, but I think it sounds better, nicer here. I also liked her personality, she had more spine, and yet she was still nice. <br /> <br /> So I will give Cinderella II: Dreams Come True 7/10.
