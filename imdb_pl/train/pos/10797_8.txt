Composed, elegant Carol (wonderfully played by beautiful Rebecca Brooke), her nice husband Eddie (nice David Houseman), crazy Carol, constantly eating the best buddy Anna (charmingly contemplated with the contagious eagerness of charming Chris Jordan), and hilarious Anna, amorous husband Pete (typical fine Eric Edwards) is a quartet of liberated swingers who often enjoy group sex. Their usual routine is disturbed when the lonely, repressed, but still voluptuous widow of Carol, Jennifer (the brilliantly moving performance of the charming Jennifer Welles) comes to visit. Soon, Jennifer relaxes and becomes a willing participant in the carefree, carnal lifestyle of swingers, except for those who want to seduce her. Screenwriter / director Joe Sarno develops a sharp, engaging and insightful study of suburban anxiety and limitations of the entire wild 70s sexual revolution; Sarno reverses the traditional customs of the middle class and continues to give something bold and provocative incestuous to mother / daughter. What's more, Sarno evokes a first-class acting role in the cast: Welles and Brooke are exceptional, with excellent support from Edwards, Jordan, Houseman, Arlana Blue as the flaky sexual therapist New Age Shandary, and Erica Eaton as the neighbor's babysitter. Flap. What's more, all women are extremely hot and tempting; Welles, in particular, seriously turns the screen up with his extremely sensual figure and smoldering erotic presence. The sex scenes are really sizzling and quite clear, but they are never pathetic or boring. Bright, polished photos of Stephen Colwell and the bouncy, melodious acoustic folk of Jacek Justis are both solid and effective. We recommend watching for Sarno fans.
