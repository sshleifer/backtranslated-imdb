Narratives? or written, visual or poetic epics? generally try to avoid signs too often; readers and viewers can be overwhelmed too easily, trying to track who exactly who is. This is especially true in the film because I think we can not easily go back to refreshing the memory in the cinema. However, viewers like me do not have this problem because we see all our films on DVD or VHS. <br /> <br /> A year ago I got acquainted with Audrey Tautou, a French actress I saw for the first time in The Fabulous Destiny by Amelie Poulain (2001) and later in A Very Long Engagement (2004), both of which were great crafted and complex stories with a large number of characters. This earlier offer exceeds the others in both directions: more character and greater complexity. <br /> <br /> Now other directors have used these techniques before: Robert Altman from The Player (1992), Short Cuts (1993), Gosford Park (2001) and others; Paul Thomas Anderson did the same with Magnolia (1999). Stanley Kramer did it in A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World in 1963, a comedy of almost epic proportions. The difference with this film is that the director first allows us to "see" the head of some characters, and secondly, some scenes are repeated to refresh the viewer's memory, like history slides between different periods of time. /> <br /> Basic ?? core, so to speak? the story concerns a young woman, Irene (Tautou), whose commuter colleague on the train says that she will meet her true love that day. This happens in the first few minutes of the movie. The clever irony at this point is that Irene does not realize that a young man (Gilbert Robin) can be "one true love". I he te≈º nie ... <br /> <br /> They do not go their own ways, not realizing the potential importance of their close encounter. However, chaos appears for the rest of the day, not only for two young people, but for the rest of the characters who appear in a series of cleverly constructed and intertwined vignettes that seem out of the blue, but still ... <br /> <br /> the story was just so, it could be boring and even quite predictable. Not at all. The script and director get into our expectations thanks to many innovative scenes that are too common, but which become credible, extraordinary events that allow two possible lovers to meet again. For example, the next time a heap of birds from heaven falls on your book or paper, consider your alternatives; two characters make the obvious choice that must come before Irene and her man of destiny meet again. And what about the stone chip flying on your windshield? Think again, what would happen ... <br /> <br /> Everything is interesting enough. It was more interesting for me to estimate each new man who came and try to decide if this guy was ONE for Irene, or was it really a young man on the train. I guessed for a while. <br /> <br /> Let me think about it if you see this delightful romp. <br /> <br /> Recommended for everyone.
