Tragically wonderful film ... brings us to Japan, which no longer exists. Despite the technical knowledge of Hollywood, I have not seen a (Hollywood) movie that would match the atmosphere in this small town near the sea ... The last samurai Tom Cruise looked like the last part of the Lord of The Rings in an attempt to capture rural Old Japan. <br /> <br /> If you like a quiet but intense plot, it's a movie you have to see. It will be a respite from empty, flashy movies, similar to the last 1000 hits you have seen. I think it is one of the better stories of Kurosawa. <br /> <br /> Even if it is a film about geishas and brothels and complicated rules that govern life in such conditions, it has not turned into skin movements. Characters are full of depth and work with a lot of intensity.
