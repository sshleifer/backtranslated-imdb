"The Golden Child" was Eddie Murphy's first film since his megahit "Beverly Hills Cop." And although it is not as good as "Cop", it's a funny comic adventure. Murphy plays the role of a missing children seeker who has been assigned the most unusual case. His task: to find the title character, a child with mystical powers. This movie could be titled "Beverly Hills policeman and the temple of doom" because parts of the movie play like Spielberg's adventure, a bit like Indiana Jones's comedy. He has a comedy with laughter and an adventure with special effects. Lots of fun. <br /> <br /> *** (out of four)
