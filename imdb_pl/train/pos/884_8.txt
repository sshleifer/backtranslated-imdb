If you're a movie noir fan and you feel that they are not doing them like they used to be, here's your answer - they just do not make them in Hollywood anymore. We must ask the French to remember how satisfying, subtle and wonderful a well-made movie of this genre can be. Read My Lips is a wonderfully nasty present for the faithful director Jacques Audiard, containing sharp stories and excellent performances by Emmanuelle Devos and Vincent Cassel. <br /> <br /> The basic story could have been written in the 1940s: stupid but appealing ex-con and clever but clever femme fatale (which turns out to be ruthlessly ambitious) discovering each other, living a life of grim despair and longing, they manipulate each other to meet their own goals, develop complex love / hatred, cook a criminal system including assault, double crosses, close conversations and a lot of money. All activities take place in depressing, dingy and / or poorly lit areas. <br /> <br /> Of course, Audiard has some modern phrases. Femme fatale is an underestimated office worker who happens to be almost deaf and uses the ability to read lips to take revenge on those who marginalize her. And where you can expect exciting love scenes, you discover that both characters are sexually and immature. Add some modern technology and music and it seems to be a contemporary movie, but do not make a mistake - this is an oldschool movie noir. It's as good as any movie in the genre and it's one of the best movies I've seen all year.
