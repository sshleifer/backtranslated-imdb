SPOILERS INCLUDED FOR OBSERVATION. <br /> <br /> Twenty years from 1984, this movie talks about Prince's future in the music industry. <br /> <br /> There is a scene that summarizes Prince's musical production from the last 10 years, ideally, if you took the two best songs from the last 10 albums, you would have one fantastic album! <br /> <br /> The scene is playing this way. Prince escapes to his wardrobe after playing one song, and the club's owner enters the wardrobe to give Prince a preview of his fall in grace in the 90s and release albums that only the most ardent fans would be able to tolerate and support his craft. <br /> <br /> Club owner - "You do not pack them like they used to be. The only person who copies your music is you! "<br /> <br /> Terrible huh! And what about the musical underlining that makes Prince even more evil when he strikes the earth with Apollonia in two separate scenes! It gave me the chills that it was not the only scene where women were mistreated in this film. <br /> <br /> I'm for comedy spree between Morris Day and Jerome Benton, because these two stole every scene they were in. But what was funny about throwing a woman into a trash can? It was nasty! The second nasty piece was the chalk outline of the prince's father on the floor thoughtfully provided by the police in Minnieapolis, which makes Prince go even furious !! FANTASTIC !! <br /> <br /> Purple Rain is an entertainment film, because it is the soundtrack of Prince's songs, which increases its value by 110%. But again, the movie gives us a different theory about Prince and his music, because the movie tells us that the biggest song of Prince in the film is Wendy, Lisa and wife Princes beating the musical father! <br /> <br /> Are the prince and the filmmakers are trying to tell us that Prince stole all his best songs from his father after finding the music sheets of his father's songs? Maybe that is why in the 90s the prince began to lose steam because he lacked ideas of his fathers ... ........... Hmmmm .....
