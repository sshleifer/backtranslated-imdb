"Bruce Almighty" looks and sounds incredibly stupid, especially from trailers. Nevertheless, I found in it a deeper message that made me like this movie more. Bruce (Jim Carrey) is angry with God and receives divine powers to be God for a week to see if he can do a better job. Morgan Freeman plays a man symbolized here as God, and although he is not his typical film or one of his best roles, he is great at dealing with what he's dealing with. Although sometimes it is primitive, the movie has a lot of laughter, from Bruce distributing soup in half like the Red Sea and customer reactions to it, as well as the seemingly free and clever image of God Freeman. Sometimes it's exaggerated too much, and there's some primitive humor in it, but overall it's a bit funny. There's a decent cast like Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Ann Walter and Steve Carrell, who always helps. The end of the film turns out to be very romantic and tears, and the message is clear that we should do what God has called us to "be a miracle". The film is far from perfect, but it is still pleasant and much better than me and many people would probably expect it, especially if we see a deeper message of the film. <br /> <br /> *** with ** **
