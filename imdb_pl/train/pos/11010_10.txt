When the Matrix appeared in 1999 and questioned existence and identity, it was expected that many films would use it as an inspiration. This did not really happen, surprisingly, and a film about similar subjects appeared only in 2002. But to say that Cypher is a clone would be his discredit. <br /> <br /> A story about Morgan Sullivan, who is applying for a job at the highly advanced techno company Digicorp. His job is to be a spy and get information about a competitive company while being under a false identity. His life at home is perfectly normal, but he has to lie to his wife about what he is actually doing. But things are starting to take on conspiratorial phrases, and before he knows what's going on, he begins to question who he really is. It does not help a strange woman who appears ... <br /> <br /> Twists and turns in every direction make you absolutely fascinated, and in no time seems to be invented or unbelievable. <br /> <br /> It's a fascinating journey through a not too distant future, which thanks to good acting will give you an edge. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it.
