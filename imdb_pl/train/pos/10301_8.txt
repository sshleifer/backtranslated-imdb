Bruce Almighty, one of Carrey's best photos since ... well ... for a long time. It contains one of the funniest scenes I have seen for a long time ... Morgan Freeman plays God well, and even chips in a few jokes that are surprisingly funny. It contains one or two romantic moments that are a bit boring, but all in all a great movie with fun scenes. The best scene in which Jim destroys the voice of the anchor. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10
