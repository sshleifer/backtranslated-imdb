The debut of Claire Denis is bold and confident. In this picture of life towards the end of French colonialism, Cameroon explores the relationship between men and women, black and white. <br /> <br /> With the black servant "Prot√©e" as the main object of desire and oppression of the film, the film enters the taboo territory from the very beginning. Denis builds a picture of life through a series of character relationships that keep an informed viewer on screen. The mood of the film is perfectly captured by the camera and (lack of) lighting. <br /> <br /> Great discourse.
