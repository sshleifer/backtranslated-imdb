The original uncensored print of this amazing film was discovered in 2004 in the Library of Congress and was shown in several specialized theaters around the world in 2005. worst dialogue and innuendos intact; they were later removed or completely re-recorded by the studio before the first edition, in order to convey the censors of the state of New York. I also read that the DVD is "expected in 2006" and you can only hope! If we really succeed, it will include a comparison of the two versions. Note that the released censored version was originally available on the Laserdisc I saw. Stanwyck rules!
