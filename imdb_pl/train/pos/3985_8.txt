I watched it as a late-night TV movie only by accident. Blurb told the film that something from the effect of the mother stays with her daughter and goes on a romantic journey, when I tuned in to the carpenter hard working on the new orangery - played by Daniel Craig no less - so the action was immediately visible. <br /> <br /> It turns out that the love interest of the mother's carpenter is also a daughter's boyfriend, so there are problems and not too many surprises. But I was caught on the irresistible performance of Anne Reid and I was drawn in. The direction allows her to have a lot of space to stare at the mirrors and adjust the scarves when it emanates with sadness. <br /> <br /> The sex scenes were fascinating and broke taboos. Should the bodies of older women not be covered up? Not here and we are treated to the delicious awakening of Mother's sexuality. Even more surprising are the drawings she created that (SPOILER!) Once discovered, they confirm the daughter's suspicions that something is happening here. <br /> <br /> Cathryn Bradshaw as a daughter did not convince me as much as the rest of the cast, but it can be me. With my waves of castles in front of Rafa I expected to see Julia Sawahla, whose more intense face would better suit the confrontation. Bradshaw has a happier face that does not bear the anger that appears as the movie progresses. <br /> <br /> The ending is weak. If we say goodbye to a mother who goes away in disgrace, they are so indifferent, perhaps we will see the close-ups of those who wave goodbye and see something for their individual reasons. Whatever she did, she is a pathetic widow who goes to a single home that she and her husband shared for 30 years. In the case of a film so full of emotions (and think it's like opening champagne, you'll never be back on it), the ending is a cold contradiction.
