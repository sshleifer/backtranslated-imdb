Of course, the plot, script, and especially the casting are strong in the film. So many beautiful things to see. One aspect that I particularly liked is the idea of ​​the antagonist - Luzhini (Turturro) - a former mentor working on his evil sideways. His chess opponent - Italian dandy in three pieces and reed - turns out to be a real gentleman and a really great chess player. In his favor, the "opponent" goes hand in hand with the plan at the end to posthumously finish the final championship game (Luzhin took the leaflet out of the window - sad, but so releases it) thanks to the unstable genius "widow (Emily Watson). After death, due to the gallantry of the honorary chess master, Luzhin's defense (which he developed in the late moment of clarity) can be played. The Italian gent commends art and calls it a genius. Talk about a dramatic "final game!"
