"Love in Time of Money" by Petter Mattei is a visually stunning movie to watch. Mr. Mattei offers us a vivid portrait on interpersonal relations. It is a film that tells us what money, power and success do to people in the various situations we face. <br /> <br /> As a variation on the art of Arthur Schnitzler with the same theme, the director moves the action to today's New York, where all these different characters meet and connect. Each of them is connected in one way or another to the next person, but no one seems to know the previous contact point. The stylish film has a sophisticated luxury look. We are convinced that these people live and the world lives in its own environment. <br /> <br /> The only thing that can be extracted from all these souls are the different stages of loneliness in which everyone lives. A big city is not the best place where interpersonal relationships are honestly fulfilled, as you can see for most people we meet. <br /> <br /> Acting is good under the direction of Mr. Mattei. Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson, Carol Kane, Michael Imperioli, Adrian Grenier and the rest of the talented cast make the characters come alive. <br /> <br /> We wish good luck to Mr. Mattei and we look forward to his next job.
