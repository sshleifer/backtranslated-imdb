The film was below normal, but this TV remote is a great springboard to what has become Sci-Fi fans. The perfect program. The actors deliver, and the special effects (for the TV series) are spectacular. Having an intelligent, interesting script does not hurt either. <br /> <br /> Stargate SG1 is currently one of my favorite programs.
