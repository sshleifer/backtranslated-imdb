I liked watching Cliffhanger, at the beginning when this woman (Sarah) was full of terror, when she slipped, I thought it was a terrifying scene because I thought when you see it, your nerves in your body reach you, it makes you you are full of fear and your heart beats faster. I like watching Cliffhanger, I think that Silvestar Stallone is a great actor and I think he will be known as playing Rambo and Rocky.
