I have never watched this program before, although my family members have highly recommended it. The funny thing is that my girlfriend lives in Hadfield (filming location) and pointed out a few landmarks when I visited for the first time. <br /> <br /> I was interested, so I bought the first series on video and sat down the watch. Apart from recognizing some places, I was not surprised at all. Once again, the BBC was responsible for creating another example of the best comedy in the world. TLOG easily ranks there with Red Dwarf, Fawlty Towers and Monty Python as probably the best. <br /> <br /> Just say that I'm addicted to the program now. The characters are great and exhibit remarkable depth, while maintaining a frighteningly realistic edge. The appearance and style of the program are excellent and sometimes reflect the gloomy feeling of the North (disrespect for Hadfield, which I found a very friendly and warm place). <br /> <br /> I just hope that it will be a continuation of the originality during the entire race (which was based on the second series, which ended with a repeat in Great Britain last night, it certainly is). <br /> <br /> Bravo BBC !!
