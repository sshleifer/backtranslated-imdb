I loved the movie, but as everyone said, there were some bits that were not sufficiently developed. Personally, I thought the girls were very poor before they were in prison; Surely they were supposed to be innocent American girls, but still ... I felt that they lacked the connection that best friends should have. For example, in the assembly in which they see the way they were holding for the picture, it was very uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> Then there are some parts that were very ambiguous. I think it's quite understandable that the Danes did not do it, but I can see how confusing it can be. Besides, why did the camera stop at Manat with a very grim look on his face after he put the bags in the trunk? I thought I was suggesting something, but it turned out to be nothing. <br /> <br /> Besides, the movie was great. I cried when Claire Danes took the blame; she is a GREAT actress. <br /> <br /> Besides, I wanted to see how this bizarre Thai prisoner is kicking her ass. Talk about not closing ...
