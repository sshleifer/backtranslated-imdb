I just never get tired of watching FREEBIRD. My husband was an addition, so I was involved from the very beginning. You kept in touch with Jon and helped promote the movie both in theaters and in the DVD. Even in the distribution of promotional postcards on cross channel ferries and various locations in France. FREEBIRD has been professionally written and directed thanks to the perfect combination of fun and serious moments and choice options. Only Phil Daniels would fit Grouch's role. A great privilege to meet Jon and the cast at the party after the release in January. Whatever else you want to do Jon, just ask, e-mail or phone, you know how to get me. Sue xx
