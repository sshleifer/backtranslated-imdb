I bought a video quite late in my collection and I probably would have saved a lot of money if I bought it earlier. Invariably, it replaces everything else during the "Cosmo Moon" night. Cher and Olympia certainly deserve their awards, but it's a really impeccable performance of a great screenplay. What? You do not know what the "Cosmo moon" is?
