I do not understand. Without being a critic, I do not judge the quality of acting, which I consider credible, okay. My confusion lies in the content. Is nobody else sensitive to the fact that these two unfaithful women justified their infidelity to men who fought and bled to guarantee the continued freedom of their families and the country. Should not there be a prologue that would inform us if men would come home, and if so, what effect did the infidelity of the "wife" fraud have on them? While these women were lazing about their loneliness from their loved one, did they think that their husbands enjoy shooting them in the face of death or dismemberment every day? They did not think about their husbands at all! Only they themselves. Please forgive me, unless they wanted the deaths of their husbands.
