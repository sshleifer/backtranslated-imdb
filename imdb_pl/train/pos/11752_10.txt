The game is on, Bakesfield is full of all technologically advanced gadgets, gaming strategies and advanced training routines. Taft draws art in the mud, with sticks, stones and caps, what a rebellion! Does Taft overcome the odds of whether Robin Willians cleanses the demons from his guts, or Kurt Russell grows out of lethargy by watching "The Best of Times" in one of THE BEST EXPERIENCE while watching! <br /> <br /> One of Robin Williams's best UNDERSTATED performances, chemistry between Robin and Russell is magic. And who is Kid Lester ??? <br /> <br /> Holly Palance and Pamela Reed give unforgettable performances as wives of Williams and Russell. He manages on many levels. 10!
