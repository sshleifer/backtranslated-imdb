I went to the cinema with two of my friends and chose this movie from the hat, not knowing what to expect. And it turns out that it is a very pleasant experience! This is an excellent movie with a very unexpected history, very good dialogues and crazy humor. All characters are of course made in the style of "Alan Ford" (Italian satirical comic book), but it did not bother me for a moment. In fact, this kind of lost bumba meant that the film was unique and interesting. Rockwell himself gave a very good and persuasive role, Willian Macy too, Clooney is less recognizable and brilliant. But the real star is actually Guzman. He made the role of his life in this film! The scene in which his character Cosimo dies in the film is so funny that she forced me to choke and almost died with him! I highly recommend it to all fans of "Alan Ford"!
