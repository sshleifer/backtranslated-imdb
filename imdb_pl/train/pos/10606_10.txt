I just finished watching this movie and found it very pleasant. It's a quiet, small movie that does not overwhelm you with special effects or "big" performances. It will simply take you to the lives of people living in a small village in the backwoods of North Carolina. <br /> <br /> Henry Thomas gives a good performance as Raymond Toker, a young loner who finds a child abandoned in the woods. The search for Toker's parents takes him on a journey that will have a huge impact on his life. David Srathairn plays Truman Lester, a slimy horse with a hidden motif. And David plays bad to perfection. <br /> <br /> In this movie there is much more than at first glance. Filmed in place in North Carolina and with a great soundtrack of traditional music, it's worth watching.
