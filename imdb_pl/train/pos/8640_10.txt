This movie is great! Brad Pitt will never be able to play the show he gave in this movie. Duchovny was at the highest level, like Forbes and Lewis. The four main heroes embark on a scenic tour of historic murders, one of the coolest cars ever made - the Lincoln Continental model from the 1960s. Early Grace is a simpleton with the taste of dry toothbrushes and carnage. He likes that his women do not curse, do not smoke, wear PWT dresses. Duchovny and Forbes are a couple of artists from the city, while Early and Lewis are Trailer parkers from the rural periphery. Although the majority of the film is dark, there are many funny scenes to do. Writing, directing and acting are brilliant. If you like road movies, murders, humor and narration, watch this movie. Everyone provides, and you will want more when the number of loans will change. One of my favorite times. "Hey ... the dog's general, teach him to hunt!"
