This film is a harmless escapist play. Something that was missing in the last movie of Tomb Raider. I can not wait to get a DVD. How can people give it a low score and continue to go and see the Titanic without remorse I do not know. Everything from Karen Kopins in her underwear has to assess an extra point or two!
