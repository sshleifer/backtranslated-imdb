This is not the best romantic comedy ever produced, but it is certainly pretty and visible. It is directed in an old-fashioned way and works well. Cybill Shepherd as Corinne is not angry as a woman who can not cope with her husband's death. He has sexy maturity. But I can not say much to Ryan O'Neal as Philip, because he is indefinite at best. It may be appropriate in this role, but it is not good enough. <br /> <br /> However, I have the impression that some characters, especially Alex and Miranda, are not written with enough in-depth thought. We do not know anything more about them because a few minutes after they appear, the story becomes dense, and the authors do not tell us much about what is going on. But this problem was saved because Mary Stuart Masterson has a sweet sweetness to make him shine, and Robert Downey Jr. it is so charming that it melts the screen. Even his smile is contagious. It happens that his big, sleepy eyes are perfect for deja vu and flashback scenes. <br /> <br /> In any case, this movie is light and easy, and if you like it so much, why not try it. <br /> <br />
