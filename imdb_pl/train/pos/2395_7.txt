Although he had the misfortune to hit the festival festival in Austin (SXSW Film), just as we were bored with things like Lovers' Shakespeare, and Elizabeth, this movie deserves to be an audience. An internal look at the staging of "The Scottish Play", as the actors call "Macbeth" during its production, to avoid cursing, is a sharp, efficient and stylish treatment of betrayal that touches the troupe. Thanks to a wonderfully suggestive result and a better look and sound than its small budget, it is a peaceful jewel, not world-class but completely satisfying.
