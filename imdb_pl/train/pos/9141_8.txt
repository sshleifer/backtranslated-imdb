You can discuss the prince's acting talent and even the choice of a parody of your own life in this film. There is no debate about his musical talent neither then nor now. It looks dark twenty years later, but the music remains current and fantastic. <br /> <br /> Surviving the noise of this movie (graduated high school in 85) I can say that at that time there was nothing bigger. From Tipper Gore (Al's wife) trying to censor "Little Nikki" and everything else under the sun via PMRC (Parents Music Resource Center) to every "Air Band" at the time impersonating Prince, it was absolutely the hottest thing. For a few weeks, Prince was bigger than Madonna and Michael Jackson. <br /> <br /> We all waited for the movie and we were very excited about its premiere. It did not disappoint. EVERYONE was caught. I was then an MTV junkie (they played music ... all the time) Prince played at least once or twice an hour. I must qualify this comment saying that at the time my favorites were Billy Idol, Oingo Boingo, The Fixx, Flock of Seagulls and others in the genre of Punk / New Wave. "Prince music at that time exceeded all types and styles. One of the reasons why some of them now seem so shoddy and crumbled is that it was then SOOOOOOOO big. All the things that remind you of the 1980s were cult at the time. It was the mainstream and now it seems a clich√©. It became so popular that it became funny. It's like Rappin 'Granny's advertisement for Wendy's Hamburgers. <br /> <br /> Now it looks stupid, because EVERYONE was involved in it (unfortunately, a bit like a weird purple macarena or something like that.) In any case, I hope it gave you some insight.
