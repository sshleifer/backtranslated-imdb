This is one of my favorite movies of all time and although for some it can move too slowly, it's worth seeing. A corporate lawyer (Richard Chamberlain) is involved in the case involving "urban" aborigines, and this is not just an accident. OK, the man died, but it was not a normal murder. There has been much more rain lately than usual, and the atmosphere of most films is somewhat claustrophobic and burdensome. The Aborigines hide the secret and refuse to spill the beans. It has a lot to do with white men who accept assumptions about Aborigines "City" and "Tribal Wars", and of course no Abo in the big city would practice tribal ways. UH Huh. Chamberlain has strange dreams and is somehow the key to what is happening, though no matter how many times I have seen it, I can not comprehend that relationship. This is a very amazing and frightening movie that is a perfect example of Peter Weir's ability to create tension from nothing. The ending is a bit ambiguous, but I take it literally, it's the simplest way out and the most terrible. 10 out of 10 and highly recommended.
