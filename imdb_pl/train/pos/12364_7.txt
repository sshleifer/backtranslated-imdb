Earning mainstream "demons-meets the clergy" from the late 60s and early 70s, which included the triptych "Baby Rosemary", "Exorcist" and "Omen", "Sentry", the addition is equally good (although most skipped in the party). In a sense, it combines the best elements of these films and projections in the minds of Polanski's "Tenant" (which appeared in the same year) for good. A New York model who is not able to commit to his lawyer, lives in a house covered with moss, which initially seems to be an ideal place; he meets a cunning old neighbor's buck (brilliant Burgess Meredith), as well as other tenants from outside the center. Awoken by the loud noises above her apartment, she soon discovers that the dumb priest and she are the only inhabitants of the abandoned building. From that moment, director Michael Winner ("Death Wish") copies this supernatural thriller to run, and devilish joy causes the hallucinogenic torture that it inflicts on its heroine. Assisted by a great cast of the band, a subtle plot and the perfect FX make-up by Dick Smith ("The Exorcist"), "The Sentinel" is a really frightening film terrifying.
