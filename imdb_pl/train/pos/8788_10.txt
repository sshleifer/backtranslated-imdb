Well, I'm glad to hear rumors that it can be released on DVD. When that happens, I do not know, but I'll catch him when he's released. <br /> <br /> In my humble opinion, this is the most entertaining film by Errol Flynn, especially when the ring career of "Gentleman Jim" Corbett begins in the film. Then it's a good movie. Great. <br /> <br /> Few people could play arrogant men and still be a nice guy like Flynn, and this movie is a perfect example. Apparently it was Flynn's favorite role and I believe in it. You can just feel how much fun he has here. It seems that Ward Bond really enjoyed his role playing the famous John L. Sullivan. Bond has also never been better. <br /> <br /> There are only so many boxing action scenes that are quite good. The Corbett family is also nice to watch because they are holding matches in the stands during Jim's matches. From the arena, the continuous arguments of the Corbett family and screams may become a bit too loud and irritating, but they have prepared the ground for the appropriate application. <br /> <br /> And speaking of the conclusion, Sullivan's speech to Corbett for a great fight is very moving and the most important in the film. Some of the cunning critics (for example Variety) did not like the ending, nor the fact that the majority of the film is fictionalized, but - duh - most films are fictionalized, they like it or not. And in this case it's a good story and a nice ending. (In real life, Corbett was a very gentle real gentleman, not like Flynn's portrait, but Flynn still makes him a good guy.) <br /> <br /> It's one of the more entertaining classic movies I've ever watched and I'm looking forward to on DVD.
