It's a movie that I can watch over and over again and never get tired, has lots of laughter, guns, action, crime, good liners and a decent story, with Donald Sutherland in the rather comedic role of Asasain. Tia Carerra looks as hot as ever and can work, Thomas Ian Griffin is great at this because the main character "Max" agent DEA Diane is an FBI agent played by Carerra, and John Lithgow from Frazier on television, plays a bad guy, Livingston. " The plot revolves around Max and Diane, who try to capture Livingston during the fight and argue with each other about who will get the money for the right agencies, throw Assassain Sutherland, who almost has all the good liners, this is an excellent criminal whim, is a simple love story but it was different than you think about Carerra and Griffith. You also have Russian mafia, Italian mafia and Chineese Mafia here thrown into the mix, the movie is shot in Boston, where you have some great photos, and the locals, great photography and music in this film, this film is the epitome of a crime comedy, it has everything you can want. Check out the Sutherland toilet in a specific scene, very unusual. this movie is a revolt and will make you laugh really hard for 10 plus for me.
