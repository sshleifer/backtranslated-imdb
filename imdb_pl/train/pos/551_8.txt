The fourth of the five westerns that Anthony Mann did with James Stewart is about a heavy-bitten cattleman named Jeff Webster who takes cattle from Wyoming to Alaska through Seattle. In Seattle, he works with partners Ben Tatum (Walter Brennan) and Rube Morris (Jay C. Flippen), whom he sent earlier to prepare for the cruise north. <br /> <br /> But first he has to endure the unruly hands of the trails, cheating the captains of river boats and the charms of the coy, manipulating the castle of Ronda (Ruth Roman), who believes that Jeff can be a valuable ally in the future. That's why he hides it on the boat while the captain is looking for him for earlier (and justified) killing his hand. <br /> <br /> Jeff also has the misfortune to run into the dingy judge Gannon (John McIntire) who runs the city of Skagway in Alaska. Gannon closes Jeff for disturbing his public hanging, running his cattle through the city. Jeff's fine for his cattle, and Jeff has to eat a crow for now. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Jeff agrees to go to Ronda to Dawson to deliver supplies. But this is just a trick, so Jeff, Ben and Rube can go back to Skagway and steal his cattle. Of course, Judge Gannon finds out about it and is right behind him, but he is delayed by Jeff with his rifle, while Ben is chasing cattle over the Canadian border beyond Gannon's reach. <br /> <br /> After avoiding an avalanche and another shooting from several other people from Skagway, they finally reach Dawson, where Jeff sells his cattle to the highest bidder, and it happens to be a roundabout that immediately establishes a new gambling house in Dawson. Jeff takes his money and buys a claim and starts rinsing gold. <br /> <br /> But then Judge Gannon approaches Dawson to take part in the gold campaign and tells Jeff he's bored with Skagway and wants to try his luck at Klondike alone. This involves taking some rented gunslinger and the power of stealing some of the other miner's claims. Jeff and Ben now feel that it's time to get rid of, while the actions are good, leaving Rube, who deals with himself as the most ineffective sheriff against Gannon and his gang. <br /> <br /> They are only looking for a way back in the trap of Gannon's people, because Ben made a mistake by opening his big mouth. Ben is killed and Jeff is seriously wounded, but that does not save Judge Gannon before his short term. The final shoot-out at night on the muddy Dawson Street is almost as busy. The first Jeff kills the two top Gannon shooters (Jack Elam and Robert Wilkie). Then, as Ronda goes out to warn Jeff that Gannon is trying to slip behind him, Gannon shoots her at the back and dies in Jeff's arms. Then Jeff kills Gannon, who is hiding under the wooden sidewalk. Revenge spoke. <br /> <br /> This is another delightful western who is there with NAKED SPUR and MAN WITH LARAMA. Why Universal DVD uses widescreen printing instead of the widescreen that TCM uses, is beyond me. You will disappear in the middle of Alberta's great cinematography by William Daniels. So if you like well-written westerns from the 1950s, then this is the list holder. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
