It's really unfortunate that most people outside of Canada think that the only thing Canada produces is snow, mounts and ice hockey players. This movie is the second superlative Canadian film I've seen in the last few weeks (the first was "The Red Violin"), much better than all but the best Hollywood efforts. <br /> <br /> Gustad Noble is not everything; is an employee of a middle-aged Parsi bank in Mumbai in the '70s. This film thoroughly analyzes the various things that happen to him, about his family, friends and work and how they affect him. At the same time it is fascinating and, I assume, accurate presentation of the average urban life in India at that time. <br /> <br /> However, I was prepared for it. read Rohinton Mistry's book a few years ago. The film, as you might expect, can not capture all the intricacies of the book, but if you want to read a really good book and see a really good movie, read and see "So long trip".
