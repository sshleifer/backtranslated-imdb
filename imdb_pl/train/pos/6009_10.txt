Mark Frechette plays in Mark, a radical leftist college. Mark is accused of killing a cop during a riot on campus and running into the desert. He does this by stealing a small plane at a local airport and flying it himself. <br /> <br /> After the flight over the desert, Mark sees the car from the air. A young woman named Daria comes out and sees Mark circulating on the plane. Several times Mark dips the plane very low, which causes Daria or duck to hit. When he lands, he meets Daria, who is strangely charmed by Mark's aerial ups. <br /> <br /> After long conversations, Mark and Daria become naked and make love in the sand. But when Mark avoids the law, he realizes that he must continue to act. So the short attempt of Mark and Daria is quite poignant, because it does not transform into a full-fledged affair. <br /> <br /> Zabriski Point was Eraserhead from the early 70's. Both films have a chaotic, unclear quality, as well as complicated meanings and characters. Frechette was as reckless as his character in this movie. A few years after Zabriski Point was taken, Frechette robbed the bank in real life. While serving prison, Marek died an unworthy death. He was killed by a weight of 150 pounds, which fell on him while lifting weights. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie was great cinematography and special visual effects. The amazing slow-motion scenes floating in the air after the explosion were a genius. Although not as breakthrough as Easy Rider, Zabriski Point still played counterculture in the early 70's. I recommend it for those who like avant-garde films that show shock, youth rebellion in the early 70's.
