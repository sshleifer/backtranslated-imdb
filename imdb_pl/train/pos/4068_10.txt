Breathtakingly, it's without a doubt the best anime cartoon ever created. For the first time I saw a castle in the sky in the late 1980s as a child and it left a lasting impression. It's been years and I forgot the title of the movie, and only by accidentally browsing the internet I found this masterpiece again. after reading the reviews and analyzes of other people, I am not surprised that he has such appreciation and touched so many because he leaves an impression. a real fantastic adventure, obligatory for all children and adults. It's best not to give a story, so I would say watching this movie will be a clear and open mind. if you have children, treat them like that, I promise you that they will love it. there is not much to say about this work, but if you have not seen it, watch it and enjoy it.
