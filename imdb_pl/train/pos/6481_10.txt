I saw this series when I was a kid and I loved the details he entered and I never forgot about it. In the end, I bought a DVD collection and that's what I remembered. That's how it should be doco, impartial and factual. The film material is unbelievable and the interviews are fantastic. The only series that I considered equal to this is "Die Deutschen Panzer". <br /> <br /> I just want Hollywood to sit down and watch this series, and then they could make great war movies. > <br /> Note. Band of Brothers, Saving Private Ryan, Letters from Iwo Jima, Flags of Our Fathers and When Trumpets Fade are a few that I recommend
