I've seen it recently, but when it started, I had no idea what the idea was about, what was the topic ... in a nutshell - I had no idea what it was. Was it a documentary or a comedy routine ... Well, it was BOTH. <br /> <br /> It started a little bit slowly, but I think it's because I had absolutely no idea what type of program I was watching. But it drew me quickly. The episode I watched was to discuss facts and fiction in the history of Robert Wuhl. Mainly like us (American) we are learning a story that is not real - and as we learned what we did. He did it in such a way as to provide the viewer with full entertainment and interest. I've learned a few things, which is a real indicator of the effectiveness of this type of program. <br /> <br /> I would like to see this as a series for HBO. I believe that it can be equally fun and effective with different themes - especially if they are "taught" in the same way as this episode.
