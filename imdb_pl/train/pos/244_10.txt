I did not know what to expect from "Ned Kelly", but I loved it. It was dark, dramatic and captivating. I also felt very authentic, I felt that I was transferred back to the 19th century. I've never been a fan of Heath Ledger, I've only seen him in teenage movies, but he's pretty convincing in that role. Ledger plays Ned Kelly with dignity and intensity, showing us how alive the boy became the most famous killer in Australia. Naomi Watts has a great supporting role as an enthusiast for Kelly society. I highly recommend - and this is from Aussie!
