Before George Clooney directed Sam Rockwell in his debut in "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind," they performed together in this film. George Clooney was also involved in this film as a producer, along with Steven Soderbergh, which shows that they really believed in the project. Potentially, it also seems like a great and entertaining project that is similar to movie remakes such as "Ocean's Eleven" and "The Italian Job", but somehow this movie was only half the success, or at least it's not as good as it could be. <br /> <br /> A movie in which the characters are played by well-known actors, but it's a pity that the characters do not have enough room for development. Although in their potential they could turn into fun and enjoyable characters, they are now only characters who play gently mainly with some of the more bizarre sequences in the movie. The fact that they are played does not change too much, even if they prevent their characters from getting boring or even annoying, or something like that. <br /> <br /> Of course, due to the characters writing are not fully used. I can only assume that the original Italian film "I Soliti ignoti" works much better than this film. The film is based to a large extent on a simple story and a predictable way of telling stories. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the movie is just very nice to watch, maybe because of the same simplicity. It's a harmless movie about a little whim, where you simply should not worry about history. In this respect, "Welcome to Collinwood" is still a movie that works and just serves its purpose well. <br /> <br /> It's a movie that you will not regret when you finish it, but it's also a movie that really can be done without looking at it. <br /> <br /> 7/10
