Ruth Gordon is one of the more lovable assassins Columbo has ever dealt with. And the plot is brilliant all around. This is one of the best episodes of Columbo in history. Mariette Hartley and G. D. Spradlin have excellent supporting roles. And Peter Falk delivers some more in his scenes with Gordon.
