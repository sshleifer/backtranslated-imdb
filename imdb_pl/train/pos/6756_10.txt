Otto Preminger, ending the noir cycle at Twentieth Century Fox, re-united his "Laura", leading to this harsh, rough detective drama. Dana Andrews again introduces the policeman, but this time is hardened, cynical and was accused by the police of police brutality - "You do not hate hoods, you liked to beat them!". Mark Dixon (Andrews) despises criminals because his own father was a crook. I do not want to be "Sandy Dixon's child", so he became a policeman, but his methods are harsh and hateful. <br /> <br /> One night, investigating the murder, he unconsciously strikes the suspect, Ken Paine (Craig Stevens), so much that he kills him. Shocked, Dixon does everything in his power to hide the hated ruffian, Scalise (Gary Merrill) for the crime. However, the blame falls on Paine's father-in-law, Jigg Taylor (Tom Tully), whose daughter, a department store model Morgan Taylor (Tierney), has no contact with her husband, but gets into his gambling programs. Paine slapped his wife, enraging his father who appeared in his son's apartment, but not until Dixon left with her body. With no better suspects, Jiggs is arrested and accused. <br /> <br /> Mark is embarrassed by guilt and falls into the hands of Morgan and offers money to a lawyer. He decides to accept Scalise, but leaves a letter to the department in the event of his death, admitting to everything. In the end, he can not live with knowledge of what he has done, and allows the superior and Morgan to read the letter. Despite all the tragic circumstances, Morgan confesses his love for Mark and will wait for him. <br /> <br /> It was great to find this movie on DVD, after all these years of television oblivion. Eddie Mueller, film historian, provides commentary and does a good job, but I think that his audience would not understand the meaning of the cast of two leads, because "Laura" was created six years earlier. In this respect, he is mistaken because they appeared in "The Iron Curtain" two years before WTSE, and the film was a box office success. <br /> <br /> Andrews and Tierney were fantastic together, and Ruth Donnelly is an amazing comic relief as the owner of the Martha restaurant, igniting the flames between the detective and the lady. <br /> <br /> Night scenes give the film horror. Gary Merrill is great as a Scalise with a low standard of living who had a criminal past with Dixon's father ("Your father liked me" - mocks Mark). Karl Malden and the young Neville brand are also great. And Tom Tully is simply poignant and funny as Morgan unjustly accused. <br /> <br /> Film noir with a fantastic cast.
