okay, but just stupid. Not bad for a horror movie / comedy. I've read how people change it to Michael's version and it's a good trick in my opinion, because some adults hate horror movies, and when they see this movie, they will be interested in such horrors, or maybe (they have never seen it) horror (probably comedy) Uncle Sam, I will have to see about renting or buying this movie, but the second one is much better than this one, but I bought it on VHS Amazon and got it on November 21, the day before thanksgiving. worth four dollars, L.o.l. in this movie. <br /> <br /> 9/10
