Surprisingly good early effort of Alfred Hitchcock. One of the first original scenarios written by Hitchcock himself, this film shows the extraordinary structure of history. It starts with a thrilling boxing match, in which the carnival champion "One round" Jack loses to the challenger from the audience, who is a professional player. Then the movie slows down to expand the characters and enter a love triangle between Jack, his girlfriend and professional boxer. The rest of the movie is a dramatic expansion for a rematch between two men, this time for a heavy crown. Even in this early film, Hitchcock shows his talent for meaningful cinematography and prop placement. The bracelet purchased for a girl by a boxer still appears in the film as a symbol of her infidelity. The only great opponent of this film is that the art of making a boxing match has not yet been perfected in 1927. As a result, the final match is somewhat anti-climatic. However, this story carries this movie.
