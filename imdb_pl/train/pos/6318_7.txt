I tried to rent it on many occasions, but I've always been with a girl who usually usually rejects robberies and comedies with the commentary "Uhm ... looks good, but I'm not in the mood for this movie. "This is how the Night of Almighty Solo appears! <br /> <br /> Anyway, I found Welcome To Collinwood as a pretty nice movie. Although in the end it is quite forgotten, it has moments of fun and a few laughs out loud. I did not know the fact that it was a remake, and in general, watch movies that try to ignore this fact and watch them independently. George Clooney presents a humorous and short episode as a safe disc on wheels, which most of the time wondered about two things ... 1. Would not any comedy be better if Mr. Clooney made a strange 5-minute scene? and 2. How do they create fake tattoos that look old and faded and how easy they wash away? The cast, all great actors, did a great job and you get the impression that they were having a good time working together, which is quite important in such a movie. Needless to say, everything does not go as planned in this movie, both in terms of plot and humor, but it made me check the special functions and consider looking at the original, so I think it's a success! Rent this for a good time, maybe take a few friends and a pizza. you will have fun. <br /> <br /> *** 7/10 *** <br /> <br /> By the way, the soundtrack is spectacular. It's great to hear how much Paolo Conte is appreciated, and it left me humming parts of the result long after I borrowed.
