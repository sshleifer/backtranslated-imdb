At first this movie seems so bad that I almost fell into a trance the first time I saw him. It was like a bad dream. Space bore. But I gave him a second chance, then second and second, etc ... Finally I became addicted to this film, because of its dream, slow tempo, wonderful natural sets, bathed in mild autumn light, especially the musical score, which consists of from progressive rock from the 70s and absolutely exquisite folk songs by actor / singer / author Derek Lamb (The Troubadour). You should notice a song about hazel wood, silver trout and a woman disappearing in the air ... heard in the middle and at the end of the movie. At the beginning there are certain bodily scenes that let us appreciate the natural charms of Elizabeth Suzuki. If this film was made by some "repertoire" directors, such as Bergman, Lars Von Triers or Jean-Luc Goddard, the critics would throw on the floor, delighted with the film. they were a cosmic masterpiece. Personally, I think that this movie is a million times better than others from cinematic sh # Â¤ @ t Fellini! Definitely not for the pretentious.
