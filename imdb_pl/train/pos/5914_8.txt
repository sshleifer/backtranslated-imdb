MPAA: Rated R for violence, language, nudity and short drug use. Quebec Rating: 13+ Canadian video rating at home: 18A <br /> <br /> I saw Coonskin today. This film is also known as Bustin Out and Street Fight. After watching Fritz Kota I wanted to see more Bashki movies. I saw Cool World and thought that he was mediocre and saw it. When it was released for the first time, the film was very controversial. He was considered racist, and Al Sharpton wanted to ban the film, even led protests outside the theater, where the movie was The film was released only on the VHS under the title "Street Fight." Today it is considered a cult classic movie, and African-American stars such as comedian Richard Pryor, director Spike Lee and rap group The Wu-Tang Clan are reportedly liked this movie. Personally, I thought that Fritz The Cat was a much better movie, but it is also very pleasant. It's worth watching for fans of Bashki or Blaxploitation. Rabbit. I would prefer it in full animation, but the movie starts with a priest and another man racing to save two friends from prison. While the prisoners are waiting, the elder tells the story of three men he knew. The film then changes into an animation format, we see three black men who sold their home to this man. They decide to call themselves in Harlem. So a leader, a black rabbit, kills a big player in Harlem and basically becomes a big shot. The film turns into an Italian mafia. Mafia includes the godfather, his three sons who are homosexuals, and the Italian clown. Coonskin is a fun animated film that is worth checking out if you find it.
