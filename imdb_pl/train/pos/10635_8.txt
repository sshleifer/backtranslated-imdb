I appreciate photography, textures, colors and often, unlike one comment, lighting. What I missed was a coherent plot. I found it often chaotic, poorly edited and sometimes difficult to follow. My version was 110 minutes, IMDb shows one in 125m. Probably cuts and inscriptions did not help. I praise films that are escaping from the Hollywood form, but it disappointed me. Miss Gillain was bright and the performances were fine, I just wanted a little more dialogue. If someone would like to see another movie that has some relationship with this movie, try "Hideous Kinky" with Kate Winslet.
