My son was 7 years old when he saw this movie, he is now on a Russian fishing vessel and said that the film that was the most impressed and which remained in his mind, all these 39 years is the movie The Legend of the Boy and the Eagle. He asked if I could get it for him. I am sure that many things go through his head because he has only 3 hours of daylight and he stays on this ship for 3 months and will have 3 months before his contract expires. Because we have Indian blood, it connects to this film. On January 27 he will be 47 years old and I would like to get this film for him. He lives in Thailand and for 17 years is a commercial fisherman and as we all know, this is one of the most dangerous jobs. Can you help me get this movie? Thank you in advance, Dolly Crout-Soto, Deerfield Beach, FL
