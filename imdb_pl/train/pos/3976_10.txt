I just saw The Drugs Years on VH1 and I love it. I think that it reflects very well the history of drugs, and most importantly THIS IS A STRONG COMMUNICATION FOR ALL GENERATIONS. There are woodstock, there are deaths of Joplin, Hendrix and Jim Morrison, there are many examples of drug use and drug addiction. Completely covers the timeline and evolution of drug use in America, both good and bad ways. In my opinion, this document is well done and I would like to congratulate its creators because it is exactly what is needed to play on television these days. I am waiting for the DVD edition. You should definitely see it !!! This movie is stunning - BIG TIME!
