It is true. I have a great start to this movie. Johnny Weismuller returns as the titular vine swing, fighting game, a wild hero, and Maureen O'Sullivan again takes on his fantastic lady, who loves Jane (who for the first and last time grows a two-piece outfit). In my review for "Ape Man", I asked Jane quite a good result for her obsession with clothes and her constant screams, but she bought me here. Make no mistake: O'Sullivan is the star of the movie, and Jane is the most capable character in the entire cast. He acts as an ambassador between Holt and Tarzan, he can function perfectly in the jungle and get along with the animals, and she knows how to stop the angry pride of lions when there are no bullets. Now he even has his own cry in the jungle. The chemistry between Johnny and Maureen is irresistible. She is completely trained. Cheeta is adorable too, he pulls out Martin's cigarette. The plot is mainly an excuse for Tarzan to fight the most vicious animals of the jungle, especially lions, crocodiles and rhinoceroses. The effects, although always visible, are much more dynamic and cool and nicely complement the action. Oh, you can not talk about this movie without talking about naked swimming. I can only say: yes, she is naked. Very exciting things. <br /> <br /> KEVIN: Wow. Only wow. As for the depressing action / adventure with the introductory code, nothing announces "Tarzan and his husband". The inevitable continuation of Tarzan the Ape Man is an amazing, brutal and risky jungle epic. I doubt that another Tarzan movie will appear in the future, which would not take prisoners the way it does. It would be difficult for you to find the full scene in this film that would be approved by the Code or approved for this purpose. This macabre violence does not even await the appearance of a happy couple in the jungle before it pushes even the limits of today's adventure films. And after entering T & J on the photo, there are plenty of early morning hugs and naked afternoon swimming. See for yourself if you do not believe me. I love Maureen O'Sullivan above all in this film. In the first film, Jane seemed conflicted with walking, just as the writers simply did not know how to portray the character. But here is a great precursor to women from later cinema. Although he still needs Tarzan's help in extracting it from most jams, he does far more than just waiting to save. Her personality is completely reliable for a woman who has lived relatively (relatively) in the jungle for a year. I watched it with my mother and I liked how much Jane "trained" Tarzan, as Jeff Foxworthy put it. He has a monkey man at her every call and cry. Although there are a lot of obsolete optical effects throughout the film, there are still a lot of touching Tarzan fights with predators that are performed (mainly) for real. This and men-dressed-like-monkeys are more convincing this time. ** SPOILER ** The movie reaches a climax as the jungle explodes with a shocking orgy of violence in the animal kingdom that leaves Tarzan and Jane the only two people still breathing. Although the pair travels west, reunited and victorious, I can not help imagining how this story will appear next safari, which will hear about the previous group of people who went to find Tarzan and Jane and were never heard. ** FINAL SPOILER ** One of the things that still bothers me is the smooth, hairless bod and Johnny Weissmuller. In addition, it is an adventure action in front of the code, which absolutely can not be missed. <br /> <br /> Last movie: It Happened One Night (1934). Next movie: The Twentieth Century (1934).
