A graceful "race against time" condition - murdered John Doe has pulmonary plague, so while health authorities and NOPD fight with everyone and with each other, trying to find contacts with the wharf, the murderers think that the heat is caused by the cousin of the victim holding on to them . <br /> <br /> This video is available free of charge from the Internet Archive and it is worth downloading. Many (all?) Of this film were filmed in original places in New Orleans, which makes it interesting to look at what is now a detail from the era, although for me it looks underexposed, even for noir - maybe then mobile lighting devices were not what they are. There is also a lot of background noise, which is a bit distracting - whoever has horns on the love stage? There are many unprofessional supporting artists in the crowd, which may explain why the pace of the film is a bit sagging at first - few chances of repetition or transformation, although the final pursuit is worth hanging. There is nothing wrong with the main actors: Jack Palance is really frightening as a charismatic, intelligent psychopath - the later scene, in which he alternates comfort and threatens his sick cousin, is wonderful, while Widmark, as he often did, raises the right anger on the mission at a reliable level - most of the time. <br /> <br /> Someone should do it - without supernaturals, without mysticism, without special effects, simply with a good yarn full of conflict of characters and thematic topic. Another reviewer mentioned the writer John Kennedy O'Toole, and this is spot on the number of bizarre types of New Orleans that make for a dark, dingy, opposite drama clock. There's even a newspaper salesman. <br /> <br /> "Community? What kind of community? Do you think that you live in the Middle Ages? "
