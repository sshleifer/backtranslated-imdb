The Mat Spirogolou family (Toby Malone) knows that he is a talented footballer and is happy when he gives an audition to a big club. They hope that when he arrives in the city, his cousin will look after him. <br /> <br /> But cousins ​​are like chalk and cheese: one naive peasant from the farm, and another street manurer who has been successfully mixed with drug dealers and gangsters. Mat would rather not have a quiet evening before his big day. <br /> <br /> Passing his cousin George (Damien Robertson) on arrival in the city, Mat encounters further trouble when a young cyclist takes him on a ride in more than one way. <br /> <br /> Toby Malone, probably better known for his work in the theater, puts on praise as a teenager. There are clear signs of a low budget, but as with many other low-budget movies, there is more fun, seemingly more spontaneity and more charm than you see in the average Hollywood blockbuster.
