TRAVEL CAROL is a pleasure to watch for so many reasons. Acting Clara Lago is simply amazing for someone so young and she is one of those exceptional actors who can say a lot with a face expression. Director Imanol Urbibe presents a tight and controlled film without interruption in continuity, which drives the story at a steady pace with enough tension to reflect on what the stage scene will bring. Screenplay Angel Garcia Roldan is the story at its best, which seems to be the main goal of the movies. The plot is unpredictable, but events that are divorcing are completely logical. Perhaps the best feature of this movie if you tell the story of the Spanish Civil War that affected people. It was a great event of the 20th century, but hardly anyone knows about it. In fact, for 40 years of university education, I realized on average one student per semester who even heard about it, let alone those who could say something about it - and the overwhelming number of students were learned merit, all of whom to the vast censorship in American education. So, in this way, this movie is a good way to start the study of this event, remembering that when one story is drawn, many stories are unraveled. Appreciation of this film is therefore directly related to the amount of knowledge. To watch this movie as another film about the coming century, the movie is completely omitted. The Left Elbow Index covers seven aspects of the film - acting, set design, character development, storyline, dialogue, film continuity and artistry - on a scale of 10 for very good, 5 for medium, and 1 for the help needed. The CAROL TRANSPARENT is above average in every respect, except for the dialogue assessed as average. The average LEI for this movie is 9.3, raised to 10 when compared to the IMDb scale. I highly recommend this movie for all ages.
