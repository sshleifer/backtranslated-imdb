Writer / Director John Hughes embraced all the rules (as usual) with this bittersweet family movie "Sunday Afternoon". "Curly Sue" is a sweet, premature orphaned orphan, who is looked after from childhood "Bill". A couple lives by their senses when they travel around the great US A. Fate matches them to the "very nice" yuppie lawyer, and the rest are predictable. <br /> <br /> Children will love this film as they can refer to the heroine in which 9-year-old Alisan Poter (who was Pepsi's commercial for "you're a girl!") plays. The character is supposed to be around 6 or 7 years old, because she is forced to think about going to school. Some of her words suggest that she is 9 years old or more every day. <br /> <br /> Just like in "Lonely House", there are a lot of punches and small fists hitting large chunks. Again, this is a "film" formula, addressed to a young audience. Fun and cordial. Do not look for any surprises, but be ready to shed tears or two.
