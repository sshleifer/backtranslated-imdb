so in the middle of the season I was so absorbed by the school and my activities that I did not realize that the concert was canceled in half, which is nonsense. <br /> <br /> I think supporters of this program should write a fox and ask him to at least finish filming so that the season can be released on DVD later. maybe then they'll see how many people were disappointed that the program did not survive the first season. <br /> <br /> I loved this concert and I waited for him every Thursday after OC. can you imagine my disappointment when I came back to watch and watch the program to discover that it disappeared? Needless to say, I'm not very happy with the fox right now. even more after discovering that NO COMPLETION WAS NOT FILMED. I mean, if you're going to work on a project, at least finish it to see what happens. a semi-film show is like an intermediate, it is almost useless. lisa, make this damn ending and give some show fans some peace.
