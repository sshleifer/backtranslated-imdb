I think the reason for this stubborn diarrhea in this movie is that most people have it for Sharon Stone, who is about 50 years old and becomes naked while having sex. Nobody cared that the Golden Girls are sitting eating cheesecake and talking about their first orgasm, but to see how someone after the menopause is happy with the ride while driving, it seems to me that there is too much to deal with . Let's face it, it looks good, it's much hotter than my mother of the same age! This is not an Oscar or cult classic like the first, but since the turn of the century, all movie viewers seem to expect: a cinematic experience that will affect your soul. As such, he never claims to be. It's an erotic thriller that is both erotic and thrilling, and is a continuation of a brilliant character that we all hate. This is the character of Catherine Trammell, who helped give way to this sequel. Fans of the first movie want to see more of this frosty ice queen. <br /> <br /> The pictures and direction were lush and extravagant and made me surely want to move to Britian. The result is also amazing. <br /> <br /> Sure there is some exaggeration with some of the characters, but there is also a great work by David Morrissey, who is virtually unknown. <br /> <br /> This is a failure, because the script is practically the same as the first movie only connected to a psychiatrist instead of a policeman. In addition to the MPAA criminal decision, to force the film to be even more limited, which deviates from the sense of guilt of pleasure that this story is known for. <br /> <br /> At least it is fun and good to look at it, and this is the only intentions of the movie. So if you have beef with Mizz Stone, maybe you should see the movie and draw your own conclusions before you spit vomit from the bullet?
