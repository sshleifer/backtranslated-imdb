Ravishing adventure director George Stevens (before going to a more serious tariff, such as I REMEMBER MAMA 1948, I GIANT, 1956), which sets the standard for all future yarns. Loosely based on the poem by Rudyard Kipling, GUNGA DIN follows the journey of three military officers in nineteenth-century India. The noble trio must face a series of battles and other dangers, including the worship of thugs and a temple full of gold. Their adventures on the screen remain fascinating even after more than six decades and have inspired almost everything from the STAR WARS-inspired cosmic opera (1977) to similarly outlined RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARC (1981). <br /> <br /> The biggest reason for the success of the picture, however, are the perfect performances of the film trio of extremely charismatic actors. Victor McLaglen was rarely better as a tough guy, Cary Grant is the best comic foil, and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. is just as kind a hero as he can imagine - maybe even more than his rival Errol Flynn. Chemistry between the three actors simply could not be improved, and such warm and credible compassion is exactly what is missing in most of today's action shots - and they get tremendous support from the miraculous Sam Jaffe, who overcomes the obvious physical misleading and character-making ray of human sweetness and quiet strength. A huge hit in those days (the film was reportedly the second largest producer of money in 1939, Behind this amazingly successful GONE WITH THE WIND), and remains probably the best film of its kind.
