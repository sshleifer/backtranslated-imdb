I remember watching it for the first time when I was 9 years old. I wanted to be one of the "barbarian brothers". This movie is still great. One of the original aspects was that the battle scenes were very short. By implicating that the "barbarian brothers" are so good that they quickly finished their enemies! Plus, you have chases, fighting in a cage, a dragon, and even a bar fight! <br /> <br /> Yes, acting is bad, that's why it's not ten, the plot has also been criticized. I think it is quite original. Not many films in this genre have the same original fictional lines or colorful dialogues. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie.
