The "parade of lights" is fascinating on many levels. There is no way that supposedly staged "theatrical prologues" could be produced in any theater on earth. Think about, for example, the great pools and three-story fountains "By A Waterfall". (Berkeley directed John Garfield in "They Made Me a Criminal" six years later, and Dead End Kids sang "By a Waterfall" when they took a shower). <br /> <br /> "Shanghai Lil" is the best production number in the picture. This is the sensitivity catalog of Warner Bros. Please note that African guys are involved in the scene with white and Asian prostitutes. You will never see blacks in the social scene in other movies of that period, unless they were porters on the train or maids in a large house. Black guys are sitting at the bar and singing with others. I am also happy when military dancers present the "card" section of Roosevelt. There is also the NRA eagle - the logo of the controversial National Recovery Administration of New Deal. FDR was the new president and hopes were so high that it would take the nation out of the crisis. Of course, you would never see something so oriented to the working class leaving the MGM. Warner Bros. he wholeheartedly supported the increase dictated by the F.D.R. administration. <br /> <br /> Dear little Miss Ruby Keeler has never been better than the Chinese whore "Lil". He barely even watches his feet when he dances, which was one of her disadvantages. <br /> <br /> Things in front of the code are great fun. The number of "By a Waterfall" is wonderful in this respect. The girls turn into swimsuits on a crowded bus rushing through Times Square with all the lights on. Girls with an eagle floating on the camera provide a type of crotch that you can not see for 35 years. Within a few months, the Production Code will eliminate such naughty pleasures.
