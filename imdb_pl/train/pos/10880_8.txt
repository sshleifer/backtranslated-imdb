Somewhere fun. Pleasant, well-constructed somewhere. <br /> <br /> You do not have to say "do not take it seriously" or "as bad as well" or "it was not terrible". None of these comments are relevant. <br /> <br /> The cut has an atmosphere. It's this atmosphere that is really unique and the only truly original aspect of the movie that personally makes the movie for me.
