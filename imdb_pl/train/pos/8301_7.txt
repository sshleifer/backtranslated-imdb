Gary Busey is the title character, Frank "Bulletproof" McBain, your standard reckless policeman who earned his nickname because no matter how many times he chooses (38 and counts), he never stops chasing the bad guys. > <br /> When an American tank named "Thunderblast" is transported across the border to Mexico, it is caught by revolutionaries / terrorists led by General Brogado (Rene Enriquez) and Libyan colonel Kartiff (Henry Silva), who adapted himself with the Russian villains . Army personnel involved are detained as prisoners, the most important being Devon Shepard (Darlanne Fluegel), who is McBain's ex-girlfriend. McBain is then recruited by the army for a rescue mission. <br /> <br /> Busey may not have a physical presence, someone like Schwarzenegger, who would be another suitable guide for this type of movie, but he is an explosion as a self-confident guy who is quick to drive. Fluegel is a great feminine pencil; not only does it look incredibly sexy, but it makes it fun. Enriquez, Silva, Juan Fernandez and always welcome William Smith (as a major Russian) are repulsive scumbags in the tradition of the classic action movie. The supporting cast is quite full of known and credible actors: L.Q. Jones, R.G. Armstrong, Thalmus Rasulala, Lincoln Kilpatrick, Mills Watson, Luke Askew, Danny Trejo and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa. <br /> <br /> T.L. Lankford and B.J. Goldman provides a script based on the story of Lankford and veteran director B Fred Olen Ray. This is a kind of scenario in which you simply know that writers have their tongues on the cheeks: they know that their material is absurd and tacky, and just have fun by throwing credibility through the window. Steve Carver, veteran action director, keeps him moving and provides the right amount of shots, explosions and general chaos. <br /> <br /> "Bulletproof" is a good fun for action fans who do not mind turning off their brain from time to time and just enjoying a generous range of violence and humor. <br /> <br /> 7/10
