I have to agree with MR. Caruso Jr. Lanza, was the best voice God had to offer, if only he could find the courage to go all the way, leave Hollywood and go to the opera, which could be an American Caruso, which everyone could say that in any case a fantastic introduction to boneless art on this subject and if it is so, let it be. see a video in which you'll see why Mr. Lanza still appears in the discussion even in my home. Somebody says that Pavarotti, I'm talking MARIO LANZA. As for the movie itself, when it's on DVD, it has to restore it, and VHS is not good enough, but it should also be the only Lisa movie on DVD. boring.
