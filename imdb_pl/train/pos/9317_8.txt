I saw this film criticized by the statement: "If you manage to avoid moralizing ..." It does not hit the nail on the head. Moralizing is in the conscience of the beholder, as it was. This is a decent movie with the standard murder mystery, but with a distinct twist that emerges in the middle. The resolution leaves the viewer the question: "What would I do in this position?" And I have to believe that exactly what the director intended. To this end, and to the end of the entertainment of the audience, the film succeeds. I also like the way violence is never on stage, but outside the camera. We know what just happened; it is simply not served before us, and then rubbed into our faces, as it would today with the contemporary dressing of blood and blood. Besides, violence is not a goal. It's about the moral dilemma of the main character who has been cleverly, though disturbingly solved.
