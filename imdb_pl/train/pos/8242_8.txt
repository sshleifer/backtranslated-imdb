I watched FIDO on a movie channel and I have to say that I became an instant fan. The movie is like a comic that perfectly reflects the look of the surreal 1950s, you know a healthy decade when they danced to Elvis, throwing nuclear bombs into the desert just for that. People were so naive at the time that it was scary and the idea that healthy people think it's normal to have zombies as pets. <br /> <br /> Kudos of this Canadian production, colorful sharp photos and a great cast, including Carrie Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Henry Czerny and the kid. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that this movie was not a bigger hit. He deserved more recognition. It's much better than Tim Burton or SHAUN OF THE DEAD. Well. Nevertheless, it is a classic classic.
