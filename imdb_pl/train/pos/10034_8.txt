I had very few problems with this movie and heard a lot of critics saying it is too long and overrated. It is true that it lasts over three hours, but I was amazed that it passes so quickly. I do not think it's overrated, I think the IMDb rating is completely decent. The film looks sizable, with great costumes and excellent effects, and the director James Cameron rarely escapes attention. Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of his best performances as Jack, and Kate Winslet is pretty as Rose. David Warner, a great actor, steals every scene he's in. The story is very rich in detail and is hot in character development, obvious in the love story, which is very moving when it has to be, although in the first part the movie is a bit slow. The last hour is extremely eye-catching and I will admit that I was on the edge of my seat when the Titanic sank. I will also say that the last five minutes were very moving. The music of James Horner was adorable, although I've never been a big fan of the song My Heart will Go. Miniserial from 1996. He was good, but he suffered from undeveloped scenarios and some historical inaccuracies. Generally, I give Titanic 8.5 / 10. Bethany Cox.
