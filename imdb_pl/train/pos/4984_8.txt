"Secret of the Lens" is probably my favorite, versatile favorite. The best and the funniest of Kajawari Yoshiaki, who is known for splattering anime and dashing anime hentai-ecchi. I regret that he did not do it anymore. <br /> <br /> My favorite scenes are the psychedelic sequence of CG, the parts in which Lord Helumis blows up his falling supporters, the party rebels, which causes Bill (one of the funniest scenes) and whenever my favorite character appears, Worsle. <br /> <br /> Check it out. <br /> <br /> WARNING: This is not for serious advanced Anime fans!
