I just saw the movie, and the terrifying thing was that the people talking during the movie sounded like actors. The film had its moments, but it also lagged behind and was quite sick. All this was supposed to be a farce, but when you see the pathetic life of people in the movie, you think, "People like us are all around us." All attempts to win the audience's sympathy are interrupted when the actors do one stupid thing after another. On the plus side, there are some great (and fun) insults. I think I would wait for the video, but it was a good laugh. NOTE - Jerry takes off his shirt during the movie !! (this is not a nice view!)
