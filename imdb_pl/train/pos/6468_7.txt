It's quite a good movie ... yes, some parts are bad and extremely comfortable, and the film does not really justify the cast of a big star (AB, SD, Tanuja). However, the actor who really impressed me was Kay Kay Menon (not to be confused with the KK singer). In the scene where Amitabha first encounters, I thought that a man who can only look at AB, stare at it and not say a word, and still look strong, is definitely a good actor. In fact, he proved worthy again in Sarkar, next to AB for the second time. This guy should get more roles, he's brilliant. <br /> <br /> If you have read any other review here on IMDb, you already know the plot and agree that Akshaye Khanna's entry into Pakistan was a bit too easy. And the small angle of love that he shared with "what is her" was completely unnecessary. But he is quite a good actor (as seen in DCH), Sunjay Dutt is cool to watch, always. and AB ... what can I say. I do not know if I'm his biggest fan in the world, but I know I can definitely fight for a place. <br /> <br /> An interesting watch, considering Bollywood, though a little inspired by Hollywood oldies like "The Great Escape" and "Bridge on the River Kwai".
