Felix Unger (Jack Lemmon) has just been abandoned by his wife because he is one of the most annoying neurotic people in the world. Suicide is his way out, but it just does not seem to work, so he goes to his friends' house. Oscar Madison (Walther Matthau) also recently divorced and lives in bachelor heaven. Smoking, gambling, beating chick, eating out and cleaning are paradise for him. Well, after suicide attempts, Oscar decides to introduce Felix. Initially, it is a match in heaven, Felix cooks and cleans and helps Oscar to pay alimony on time, but soon Oscar Jones for women and Felix (who in today's world would probably be gay) is not ready to move on. They invite a few British birds, and Felix is ​​so affectionate that soon they and Felix cry and talk about his family life, leaving the Oscar. That's it, he explodes and throws it out, but Felix is ​​not as helpless as he seems, and soon he has an advantage. My favorite quotation "You left me little notes on the pillow. I told you 158 times that I can not take small notes on my pillow. F.U. "It took me three hours to understand F.U. was Felix Ungar! "Based on the art of Neil Simon (who also wrote the script), it has a certain theatrical character. Set and repartee and look like a game (for better or worse). Lemmon and Mathau have great comedy chemistry and appeared in the films Grumpier Old Men and Out to Sea, restoring the same fastidious roles, but with different names (to avoid problems with royalties, I'm sure). <br /> <br /> This film is like strawberries dipped in chocolate. The chocolate is smooth, sweet and rich, the strawberry is tart, juicy and bright red (unless you have these nasty greenish ones). They are almost polar opposites, but contrasts emphasize each other and create a wonderful dessert. 7/10 <br /> <br /> http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
