I believe The Sopranos is an amazing program because of all the accompanying characters. I've bought every movie so far and I'm waiting for the rest to be released. The episode 3, Denial, Anger, Acceptance is definitely the best in all 42 previous episodes. This episode is about my favorite character of all time in The Sopranos. His name was Brendan Filone. He was killed for hijacking the wrong truck and accidentally killing the truck driver. Brendan was amazing because he was actually one of the few characters who actually stood against Tony and his gang. In the end, he was shot by the eye while bathing, and this is my favorite scene in the history of The Sopranos. Brendan Filone is number one for me. And my most favorite character was Matthew Bevilaqua, who died after attempting to murder Christopher Moltisanti. Tony and Pussy shoot him at Hucklebarney Park after they catch him and torture him. My third favorite character is Sean Gismonte, who died right after shooting Christopher. And finally, my favorite character # 4 is Chucky Signore, one of Uncle Junior's supporters. He was killed on a boat by Tony. All amazing characters are dead. This is the only bad thing about Sopranos. All cool guys are always dying. Do you know what would be great to change in Sopran? They should have a whole episode in which they'll show all the dead helper figures and everyone tries to torture Chris, Tony, Uncle Junior, Silvio and Pauli because they have to get revenge. Brendan Filone will hit you back !!!!!!!!! 1
