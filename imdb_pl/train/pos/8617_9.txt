"GI Samurai" sees Sonny Chiba and a few other guys who, for no particular reason, are returned to feudal Japan affected by civil war, which causes a lot of slaughter. It is rather the upper essay of a machine gun sword that eventually gives some interesting results. <br /> <br /> The plot essentially runs along the rails that you can expect from the title; Initial fish antics ("What is this flying metal box?" etc.), "Are we not here better", discussions and, finally, a great battle. The latter is proof that the film is not taken seriously at all, and the massacre takes up much of the other half when the Samurai forces are fighting against Chiba's platoon; face that could be fully expected from the title, but still manages to overwhelm ingenuity and extravagance. This is certainly one of the most unique battle sequences of its time and does not stall despite its long length. <br /> <br /> Chiba gives a rough performance as an Iba, initially a good leader, but someone who finally discovers that he challenges his own customs because the situation is slowly affecting him. This is certainly one of his better vehicles with his great CV. In the last act, the two worlds have had such an influence on each other, that it is necessary to consider whether this was not a bit of nihilism on the part of writers, because it seems that they ask "Were we not better then?". But it can be a bit of reading in general you can describe as a very fun two hours (almost) non-stop action.
