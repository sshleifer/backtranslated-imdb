If you have trouble sleeping, you can give the film a low rating. But you have to realize that this movie was not created to please everyone, <br /> <br /> only people with a sense of humor. <br /> <br /> For those people, the movie is great! He plays old science fiction movies and long-gone radio programs, most witches in which B-rated themselves. Along the Spaceballs and Airplane 2 lines, you may need to stretch your imagination a bit to get jokes, but it's worth it.
