The 40-year-old Virgin tells about Andy Stiter, a forty-year-old man who works in an electronics store and does not have much social life and is very uncomfortable with women. Some of his colleagues in the store invite him for one night and discover that Andy is still a virgin, so they plan to help him lose his virginity. One day in the store Andy meets a woman named Trish, who gives him his phone number, and finally Andy, works bold enough to make a date with her and they start to like each other, but Andy is still very awkward when it comes to sex and he will have to say it to Trish, to his embarrassment, if he can actually gather the courage to tell her before things get awkward. The 40 Year Old Virgin has a good direction, a good script, good comedic performances in the entire cast, good photos and a good film edition. The film plays and is co-author of Steve Carell, who performs a very good comedy show, and his writing for the film is also very good. I was very pleasantly surprised by this film. It is sweet, funny, funny, funny, pleasant, clever, good and good time. This movie is just as good as this year's "Wedding Crashers", and both films are the two best comedies I've seen for some time. The 40 Year Old Virgin, really presents a lot of talents and is well used, works like comedy and romance, is sweet and gives a lot of joy. One of the biggest surprises and one of the best comedies of the year.
