As a theater actor in a community that works hard on this, but does not take acting too seriously, I am always amused by those who treat it as Great Art. This movie mercilessly pierces "The actor's body" and at the same time laughs a lot of good. <br /> <br /> The track actor on the film's location is similar to a dictator. When a dictator dies of a heart attack because of too much drink and food, the actor is kidnapped and forced to play "part of life" by a neo-Nazi secret service chief. It stretches it at your fingertips, makes the dictator girl fall in love with him and vice versa, and beautifully turns tables at his pursuers. <br /> <br /> A lot of great claws from the leaders, a lot of good work by unknown supporting actors, especially the house staff and two members of the palace guard, and a lot of small cameramen. Sammy Davis Jr. enlightens, Jonathan Winters plays a half-retired American businessman with something else, and Raul Julia, Sonia Braga, and above all Richard Dreyfuss are exceptional. <br /> <br /> This is a stupid movie, but it has many beautiful places (in Brazil), a humorous scenario, and good actors do their thing and look as if they really had a good time and did not go through the usual existential anxiety about what it's just playing!
