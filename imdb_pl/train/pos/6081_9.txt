You do not get darker or more tragic than "Othello" and this movie captures the game quite well, with outstanding performances by Lawrence Fishburne and Irene Jacob. Fishburne's expressions about the suffering of the viewer Othello, who falls victim to lies Iago, very convincing, even providing a realistic epileptic epilepsy. Jacob is a loving and loyal wife who becomes an instrument of Iago's revenge against Othello or the object of his anger (it is not clear where the motive of Iago is not). Although Kenneth Brannagh (sp?) Shows his usual talent for Shakespeare in this film, he's marginalized. The heroes of Cassio and Emilia also wander and leave the stage, although, like Iago, they seem more important to the plot. I did not check the film against the play to see how many lines were cut, but I know that Shakespeare has a tendency to develop his characters, even those seemingly irrelevant, very good. <br /> <br /> If I had any criticism of the film it would be that the story develops too fast and that the relationships between some heroes are not more arranged. The director had a great cast and no one offered a bad performance. The relationship between Cassio and Othello and the relationship between Emilia and Desdemona requires further development in the film. I have the impression that they were closer to each other than the film suggests, although in the film it feels very late. In addition, Othello and Desdemona need more time together. Although their anguish is convincing, the amount of interaction they have with each other makes it seem that they have just met. On the other hand, maybe he just met - like Romeo and Juliet. <br /> <br /> In short: good performances, too short. <br /> <br />
