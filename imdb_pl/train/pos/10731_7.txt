I notice that the DVD version seems to contain missing scenes or lines between the publication of the FRF and the launch. <br /> <br /> They have to prove that they can win the right to sit in the FRF other than a green team. <br /> <br /> The next scene is like during their defeat during the simulation, Kevin gets Joaquin to shut up. <br /> <br /> I think that a VHS release other than ABC can have all the missing things. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, I like to know which DVD edition has missing items. <br /> <br /> The DVD I watched is edited for television.
