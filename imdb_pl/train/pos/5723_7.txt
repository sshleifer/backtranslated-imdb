so being a fairly deep fan of horror movies, it's been some time since I've seen one that really made me jump (or get nervous) <br /> <br /> I will definitely get it on DVD outside ... hell much better than a ring. the thing I do not get is that so many people we talked to after the movie thought it was awful, well, if you think so, let it be ... I know what I like, and it requires a large amount to really scare me, so I must say that this is worth watching. <br /> <br /> now you can be disappointed if you need everything in a neat and orderly way, because the story has receded a little to help build history (I think that if it was shown in chronological order, it would ruin the whole thing.) < br /> <br /> I'm really happy that this movie had very few bloody messs ... maybe the rest of the studio writers and admirers will realize that you do not have to spill red things around the set so that people are afraid.
