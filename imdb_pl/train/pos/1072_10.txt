I would like to comment on this series as a great effort. The plot, although it required some improvements, was quite good, especially in season 1. Season 2, however, became a more bizarre show and lost the original charm of DA. The story of the first season was more interesting, the light side of life in Jam Pony, while the focused serious story from the manticore chased the X series. I could not wait for the new seasons, in fact I'm still there. I hope the FOX guys and the DA production team will realize that many ppl are still waiting for the DA to come back. Even after 2 years of canceling, DA can increase its performance if it works properly, and I think a name like James Cameron should take on this challenge.
