Abhay Deol meets attractive Soha Ali Khan and greets her with "Hello Sister" !!!. This sets the tone for Shivam Nair's extraordinary debut. Soha, a middle-class girl, escaped from her home in Nainital and comes to Delhi to marry her lover, Shayana Munshi. But Shyan does not show up, leaving Soh shaken and lonely in the big bad world. . Abhay, a guy from a lower class, turning into a protective towards sensitive Soh, helps her find a job and shelter in the old people's home. Slowly, romance flourishes, and Soha agrees to marry Abhay. Then Shyan re-enters Soh's life. <br /> <br /> A sensual movie with a very unusual story, beautifully filmed in Delhi, revolves around a delicate Soh. This well-made film has moments that will remain etched in memory forever? the awkward first kiss and Abhay's quick apology; Abhay describes Soha as "class of buttocks" and hastily adds "that he does not love her"; He gave Churidar Soha and asked her for a date. <br /> <br /> Music is good and background music is great. In the scene in which Soha rushes and embraces Abhay, the soundtrack disappears. Tranquility communicates both the awkwardness and the sensitivity of the relationship. <br /> <br /> The moving ending makes the film bitter and sweet, the memories of which will last for a long time. <br /> <br /> I have to see I will evaluate 8.5 / 10
