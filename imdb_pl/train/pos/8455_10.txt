Being a sensitive youth, when he first experienced the Gundam Wing series, after re-viewing the series, I confirmed my belief that this series is not only beautifully animated, but the plot, the gundam project, the character's design and depth of the characters are masterfully made. The stylish attractiveness of the characters, although initially looked like a kind of boy band, can only be attributed to magnificent art, with individual personalities that create clear and endearing distinctions between characters. Therefore, it is extremely easy to attract to any particular character. Personally, I liked Heero because of his stoic personality. Although I may be biased with a sentimental attachment to this childhood in my childhood, I can objectively say that the Gundam Wing refers to the deeper issues of war and life in general (how can we get peace?) While providing battling action in large robotic suits, which to put it mildly, it's perfect.
