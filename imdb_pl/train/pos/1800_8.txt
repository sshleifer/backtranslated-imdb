All Dogs Go To Heaven is on par with Watership Down for scary movies for children. Both were dark and rather ominous, but at the same time the most mesmerizing experience a child can have. It was one of my favorite movies as a child. I was in love with Charlie and at the age of about five or six, I'll admit ... I had a liking in a cartoon dog. All Dogs tells the dark story of a nice boyfriend Charlie and his partner in the itch crime. The story begins with the escape of Charlie from the death cell and jumping into the nearest club to gamble. Of course, as a child, I did not understand the concept of this film. I loved songs and animation, but as I get older I start to wonder why this film did not bother me as a youngster. He deals with nice adult themes - gambling, murder, hell and prison, but in the world of good-natured Disney movies is something that every child should watch once. <br /> <br /> Yes, there is some crazy scene of a transvestite crocodile, and the hellish scenes are more frightening now when I was little, but it delivers such a moving message that should not be ignored by parents!
