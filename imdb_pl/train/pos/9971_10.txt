This movie was perfect, I thought the original was quiet average. This one, however, has all the ingredients, the 1970's Hemi Challenger factory with a 4-speed gearbox that really shows that Mopar's mother knew how to build the best muscle cars! I was in Chrysler's sky every time Kowalski sat down on that big block of Hemi, and he definitely did a lot of it :)
