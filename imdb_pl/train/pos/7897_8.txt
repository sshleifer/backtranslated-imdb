At first glance, this movie does not look special. After all, Bette Davis movies with only 166 IMDb voices and a 6.5 mark must be quite bad. But the film turned out to be a delightful and original surprise. <br /> <br /> At the beginning you would expect it to be a normal 30's movie with a love formula, but the movie is surprisingly well-structured and has an extraordinary and original story that also helps make this movie very enjoyable look. <br /> <br /> The story is run by two main characters played by Bette Davis and George Brent. They were helped by the cast of mostly funny characters, but the movie mainly includes two of them. Their character is involved in the most unusual and clever love story, which also works humorously. This makes this movie a delightful little comedy to watch, which is perfectly entertaining. <br /> <br /> The film is quite short (just over an hour), which means that history does not waste time on unnecessary plot lines, development and characters. This makes the video also quite fast, which helps to make this movie perfect for viewing by today's standards. Maybe it sometimes makes the movie a bit simple, but it never happens at the expense of its entertainment or fun. <br /> <br /> A wonderful, pleasant, simple romantic comedy that deserves more! <br /> <br /> 8/10
