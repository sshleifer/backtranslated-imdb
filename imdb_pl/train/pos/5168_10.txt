I'm a sucker of such movies. Movies that take you back and let you survive your childhood. I am now an adult and I have many duties such as mortgage, children, dogs, wife and many others. I like my life, but it's not as innocent and carefree as it was when I was twelve. Indian Summer Mike Binder knows this and examines it as if he was twelve. He returns to the times when life was simpler and much more fun. It brings you back to the time when you were worried about your first kiss and wondered if you could finish the marathon in the camp. Indian Summer is a fantastic movie that should be watched at least once a year, so that you can sit and laugh ... and remember. <br /> <br /> Film stars Kevin Pollak, Bill Paxton, Diane Lane and Matt Craven (to name a few) as childhood friends who were called back to Camp Tamakwa by their former Main Camp Advisor Uncle Lou. Uncle Lou plays perfectly Alan Arkin. He is the type of guy who is the Patriarch of the group. He also knows everything and embraces the true spirit of a father figure and someone who understands simple things in life. It is difficult for him to deal with today's children who need a walkman in their ears when they are in a place of immense beauty, such as Tamakwa. It is a camp where the moose wanders through the camp, leaves the changing colors that God has given them and water, as far as it can be seen. Uncle Lou longs for the old days and asks his former campers back to the camp to see that one of them will take over the camp. When everyone is together again, we see their trials and torments, and perhaps a new love can come out between them. <br /> <br /> When adults return to the camp, they do not last long before they behave like children again, when typical camp pranks are played from scratch. They pull toilet paper out of stalls, put toothpaste on sleeping bags and so on. It's all fun, and with actors like Pollak and Paxton, it's all very funny. <br /> <br /> But in addition to cheerfulness, we discover very real emotions of adults that everyone can relate to. In one of my favorite scenes, Kevin Pollak and Elizabeth Perkins go out to the bay where they went as children. Pollak can not help how small it all looks, and Perkins finally tells him that the bay has not diminished, but has grown. It does not make sense at home, but it does it subtly. We all grow up, we all go further and unfortunately we can not live like we did 20 years ago. The more things change, the more they stay the same. <br /> <br /> Indian Summer is a character-driven movie and is beautifully written by Mike Binder, who actually participated in the Camp Camp Tamakwa (just like Sam Raimi, who played Stick in the movie) and it's his nice and vivid memories of his experiences that drive the film. There are many touching scenes and lots of funny ones. Both are excellent. <br /> <br /> I love this movie. I love everything and it is a real hidden gem. <br /> <br /> 10/10
