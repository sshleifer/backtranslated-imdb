The lawyer gets involved in a deadly game of cats and mice when he engages in femme fatale in the adaptation of Grisham's novel. Altman creates a full of tension, gothic atmosphere, but the scenario is weak. Branagh, being an athlete from the South, is persuasive as a lawyer, and Davidtz is appealing as the object of his desire. Downey is sympathetic as a private detective. Duvall has a small role that does not allow him much of his strange character. Hannah and Berenger complete the impressive cast. After an interesting setting, the movie rolls down and does not fulfill its original promise, but Altman is always worth seeing.
