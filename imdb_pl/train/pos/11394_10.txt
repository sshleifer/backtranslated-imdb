Although the story is sweet, and the dance and singing in the main part of the film are joy, the film's uniqueness (and that makes it a masterpiece) is a sequence of dreams. It contains a combination of the highest form of truly American music (Gershwin), the captivating beauty of French Impressionist art, fascinating choreography by Kelly (including his delightful "pas de deux d'amour", a truly distinct genre), with the finest color palette ever developed for the set. The adaptation of the rising music and visual explosion to these dances was a real work of creative genius and a great artist.
