The rich psychiatrist Lindsay Crouse has just published her first novel and feels concerned about her profession, feeling hopeless to help her patients. A young addicted gambler asks her to help him pay off his debts if he really wants to help him. Here he is involved in Joe Mantegna. Revealing the major part of the plot would ruin the hell of a funny movie, and the House of Games may be the best movie I've seen. David Mamet wrote and directed this gem, which is full of lively dialogue, great one-line and sufficient twists, so you can guess until the end. Crouse is perfect as a tense psychiatrist who needs a change, and Mantegna crowns her as a devilish cunning cheater. And except for the coincidence in the last quarter of the movie, the film is in total control of the audience; and we love con. <br /> <br /> *** with ****
