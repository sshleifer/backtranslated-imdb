In the last days, everything was better. Even TV for children. And Fraggle Rock easily proves my point. At the time of writing this comment, I'm fourteen, but even in my teenage years I can not resist the charm of Fraggle Rock. For those of you who really lived under rock (haha!), Fraggle Rock is a horde of funny and silly creatures called Fraggles who live amazingly in the rock. But they are not the only creatures. The rock is inhabited by many other species, such as hard-working doozery and countless live plants. Beyond the rock, on the one hand, the living inventor-scientist Doc and his dog Sprocket (who later befriends Gobo Fraggle), on the other hand, the Gorg family - the alleged rulers of the Universe. The five main Fraggles Gobos (fearless leader), Mokey (artistically and calmly), Wembley (hesitant and friend Gobo), Boober (pessimistic home god) and Red (loves everything that is related to sport and general shyness) are caught in some strange situations, each episode simultaneously sings and dances their worries. <br /> <br /> Fraggle Rock is definitely a family show - stories can have complex details that babies can not keep up well, but the routine song and dances will attract their attention. The heroes are strong and friendly, their conflicts credible, and exciting adventures. Gorgs are terrifying, Doc and Sprocket enlighten, Uncle Matt is hilarious (segments of postcards are already 80 years old!) And the last episode, Change of address, genuinely touching. Let's go back to Fraggle Rock again!
