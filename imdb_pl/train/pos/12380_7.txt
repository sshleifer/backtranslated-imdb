A model from New York Alison Parker (Cristina Raines) rents a room on old sandstone, where she meets several bizarre neighbors and experiences terrifying hallucinations. As a lawyer boy Michael Lerman (Chris Sarandon) is looking for information on her behalf, trying to maintain mental health (not to mention her will to live), because her experiences have a negative impact on her physical, mental and emotional health. /> <br /> I do not want to spoil better moments in this psychological horror movie for people who do not know him. This story is interesting and fun, but the movie does not really offer real horror. Or, for that matter, any atmosphere. It is quite gloomy, but it does not resemble a traditional horror movie. It is rather a story about a difficult woman trying to deal with the growing unreality of her life. At this level it works, but it is not powerful enough. <br /> <br /> What the Sentinel offers * are a few eye-catching elements (in particular a fascinating, fabulously frightening climax, and there is a scene with Beverly D'Angelo that must be seen to be believed). There is also some blood, but not much. The sinister music of Gil Melle adds threats. <br /> <br /> No review of this movie would be complete without an assessment for the filmmakers in collecting such great actors for the cast of the band. Some of them do not do much, but seeing them all is impressive. Eli Wallach and Burgess Meredith make the greatest impression, respectively, as a sharp detective and caring neighbor. Other legendary names are Jose Ferrer, Arthur Kennedy and Ava Gardner. Future stars such as D'Angelo, Christopher Walken, Tom Berenger, Jeff Goldblum, appear briefly, and other known faces are Jerry Orbach, Sylvia Miles, William Hickey and Martin Balsam. Whoever was the director of the casting for this movie, deserves a reward. <br /> <br /> Written on the screen by director Michael Winner, probably the most famous of the series "Death Wish", which he made with Charles Bronson, from a novel by Jeffrey Konvitz. <br /> <br /> I do not think this is a really great horror thriller, but it has its moments and is quite entertaining. <br /> <br /> 7/10
