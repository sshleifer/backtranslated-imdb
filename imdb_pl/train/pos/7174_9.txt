I traveled from Sacramento to San Francisco (and back) to see the movie premiere - and I'm very happy that I did. As a big movie fan and a lifelong Northern Californian, I was surprised at how many Oscar-winning films were made in the Bay area. As a fashion designer who really wants to stay in the Bay Area and not go to LA, George Lucas' comments on perseverance, community and vision have really met me. <br /> <br /> Hey, if he and all other filmmakers can do it in SF, other artists can do it. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie
