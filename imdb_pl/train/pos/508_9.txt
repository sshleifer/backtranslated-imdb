In 2151, in Broken Bow, Oklahoma, the farmer shoots Klingon Klaang with a plasma rifle after the methane magazine explodes on his farm and sends Klingon to the Starfleet hospital. Vulcan Ambassador Soval proposes to disconnect the life support system and bring Klaang's corpse to his warrior empire on the planet Kronos with honor. Captain Jonathan Archer, however, proposes to go with the Enterprise for the first journey and bring Klaanga alive to his home planet. Jonathan invites the ensign, Hoshi Sato and Phlox, who heals Klaang to complete his crew, and Vulcan Sub-Commander T'Pol was assigned to participate in the dangerous first mission of the Enterprise. When the ship's equipment is shut, Klaang is kidnapped by Suliban after a hospital shoot-out. After the Suliban corpse killed in the shooting, Captain Archer was informed by Dr. Phlox that the alien was actually a mutant, altered in the advanced genetic engineering process. T'Pol modifies the Enterprise sensors to track the Suliban ship until it reaches the planet Riger X. They investigate and reveal that Klaang was a courier, bringing important information about the temporary cold war from Suliban Sarin to the Klingon leaders in Kronos. <br /> <br /> Although I am a big fan of Star Trek, I did not follow episodes of "Enterprise" on cable TV. I decided to buy a DVD box for the first season and this first episode surprised me. The adventure of the first Enterprise, Captain Jonathan Archer, the wonderful T'Pol, Reed, Mayweather, Dr. Phlox, Hoshi and Trip is perfect, at least in this remote. In IMDb I noticed that this episode is actually divided into two parts, but on DVD they are only one, that's why my review is important for both. I did not like the music theme which I thought was very annoying, but it was an exception in this wonderful program. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Broken Bow"
