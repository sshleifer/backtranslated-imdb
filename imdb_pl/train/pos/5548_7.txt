Star Pickford and director Tourneur - along with their two favorite operators and assistant Clarence Brown, who perform the assembly - bring great beauty and intelligence to this story of poor, isolated Scottish islanders - the same territory that Michael Powell would set twenty years later his first great success . Visions of wind and waves, tanned silhouettes of lovers not only complement the story, they are a story about struggling with hardships. <br /> <br /> Actors bring proud people to their roles, and Pickford is brilliant as her heroine struggles with his duties as the head of the clan, hesitating between comedy and thoughtfulness, here with his father's whip shuffling recalcitrant islanders into the church, there he sits with a guest stick in his hand like a scepter, discussing the lover played by Matt Moore. <br /> <br /> See if you can choose the future star Leatrice Joy in the team. I tried but it failed.
