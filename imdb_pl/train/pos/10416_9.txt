Just like Arabian Nights, this movie plays with the story-telling convention so that we can feel that there is a plot, story, and more plot: what appears to be a frame-blind device telling the story of your life and then immerses in the retrospection that leads we are blind to the present, where we discover that about half of history is still ahead of us. (It must be admitted that the other half does not fully fulfill the promise of the first one.) Like Arabian Nights, he tries to stick as many motifs of folklore from the Middle East as one song. A liberated genie, a beautiful princess, a flying carpet, fantastic mechanical toys, sea travels, a crowded market, a wicked vizier, jewels ... I do not know why it works, but it is. Everything is so beautiful. The sets are beautiful. June Duprez is beautiful. The Rozsa score is especially beautiful. As usual, it sounds Hungarian; but somehow he manages to convince us that he is Hungarian in a Persian way.
