Fever Pitch is a fun enough movie. It has many funny moments (including a funny disturbing scene with a shower). Like most romantic comedies, it has a "dead zone" in the middle, where everything heavy happens, "she breaks up with me," but otherwise it's still funny. > Although the plot revolves around fanaticism towards Red Sox, it is not overloaded with sport. You do not have to be a fan to enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> Of course it's easy for me to say: I've been a Red Sox fan since my childhood. <Br /> <br /> 7 from 10. <br /> <br /> Barky
