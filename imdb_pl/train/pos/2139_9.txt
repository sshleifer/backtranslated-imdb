I approached this movie with low expectations, but I was very pleasantly surprised. It is very well done and beats dance films from recent years, especially "Strictly Ballroom". While the music is nice and the dance is colorful, for me the film is not about dancing. It is a very Japanese institution that gives male office workers long commute hours and free time after work for entertainment that does not involve their families. We have a man here with the whole family and a large mortgage and a diminishing joy of life. He is attracted by an attractive image of a young woman in a dance studio who goes through a commute, and this leads him to ballroom dancing. Also Japanese is the fact that the excitable motives that initiated his new passion become clear, but somehow accepted, at least ultimately, by the family and the audience. Attitudes towards ballroom dancing, as shown in the film, are definitely non-Western, although discipline and music are clearly a cultural import to Japan. Cultural contrasts are therefore intriguing. Even without the cultural insights, colors, dance and enthusiasm of all players, it makes it a fun movie to watch.
