Street Fight is a brilliant piece of brutal satire. This is not a movie that you just watch for fun. This is not a comfortable experience, although it has a few laughs. It's a movie you watch when you need food to think about. <br /> <br /> Rejection of this film as racist is a total omission of this topic. This is not only the song of the Southern Songs, but also a scathing comment on the prejudices that Americans still have as a society. Each ethnic group depicted in the film is shown as a grotesque caricature of their stereotypes, which in turn are grotesque caricatures of real people. Thanks to this wild exaggeration, the filmmaker shows how absurd these strongly rooted beliefs are. <br /> <br /> If you are a person who is ready to recognize the ugliness of the prevailing prejudices that American culture still holds and if you are not afraid to look for your own prejudices in the eye, this movie may be for you.
