I really liked this movie. All three stars (Connery, Fishburne and Underwood) give credible performances, and Harris enjoys unflagging popularity. Lighting and shots in some of Harris's scenes make his face look really diabolical. The surprising turnaround at the end makes it interesting. Not a great movie, but pleasant. I gave him 7 out of 10.
