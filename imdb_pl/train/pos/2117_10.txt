Every time I watch this movie, I'm impressed by the whole production. I came to the conclusion that it is the best romantic comedy ever created. Everyone involved is perfect; script, acting, direction, sets and editing. While James Stewart can always rely on a good performance, and the supporting cast is great, Margaret Sullavan reveals what an underrated actress was. Her tragic personal life adds to her qualities as a performer in which comedic acting skills are not easy to achieve. Lubitsch managed to get the best, and apparently gave it his all. Watch out for the number of scenes taken on one shot - breathtaking.
