Addictive (though repetitive and rather didactic) analysis of exploitation and despair in a situation where there is no way forward or up, where attempts to make you feel better by breaking and postponing who is below you seems to be the only option . But even here, in this wasteland of lost dreams and no future that does not work, and reaching out to something or someone to comfort and share, a simple act of mercy, gives a reward even if it only makes the present bearable by reviving memories of the past. <br /> <br /> Although there are few actual acts of violence on the screen, it is a sharp and brutal movie about a low oppression (politically and personally) that does not facilitate easy entertainment. Clearly based on art, with a small cast, a wider, more expansive relationship with the general social and political environment would probably help the film reach a wider audience.
