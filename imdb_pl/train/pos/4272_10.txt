this is a great movie. lives thanks to fantastic acting skills and simple but human history. there are real characters that can be fun and dramatic. but the main subject is very cruel, like live. The bus driver and his son gather people through the country (Yugoslavia) on the way to the capital of Belgrade. funny and cruel situations that happen along the way, connect people and pigs that travel together. <br /> <br /> look at it and remember it for life ... full of Slavic humor and lifestyle. <br /> <br /> and another reason for his magic: it is difficult to get !!
