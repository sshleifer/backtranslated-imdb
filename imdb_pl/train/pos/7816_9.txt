Richard Attenborough is a director whose name is synonymous with "Gandhi", Oscar winner, even in 1983. I did not know about his other work until I came across the "Cry Freedom", published in 1987. Although it may not have been as popular as his Gandhi, it is equally addictive, if not more, and was released when South Africa still has not disposed of apartheid shackles. While most of the films on social topics appear after this event, I think this released at that time. <br /> <br /> The story is based on real characters and events. The book on which the film was based was written by Donald Woods (Kevin Kline), a journalist who worked until the end of the 1970s in South Africa. He follows the beginnings of Woods' friendship with the charismatic black leader Steve Biko, who is wonderfully portrayed by Denzel Washington. I can not imagine a better choice for this role. Washington emanates the natural charm and presence of the screen, which Biko's character demanded. <br /> <br /> Although initially Woods was against what he felt that black racism was spread by Biko, after meeting with a man he could not help in his struggles and ideas. The bond between them becomes stronger, and Woods and his family realize and become more sensitive to the fate of people whom Biko represents. <br /> <br /> In the end, however, the tragedy strikes and Woods must now concentrate on escaping from the south of Africa with his book so that he can publish it and let the outside world know what is happening. The second part of the movie is a thrilling story of his escape from South Africa, along with his family, and will keep you in hollows. <br /> <br /> There are also delicious humorous dialogues. The example between Biko and the lawyer in the courtroom is an example. <br /> <br /> Lawyer: Do you support violence? Biko: I support the confrontation. Lawyer: Is not it violence, Mr. Biko? Biko: Not necessarily. You and I have a confrontation now, but I do not see any violence. <br /> <br /> But there are moments that bring you back to the horrors that infiltrated the country before a better sense prevailed. The scene in which the army opens fire on the protest of school-aged children is desperate and painful. <br /> <br /> It definitely has to be watched. I would suggest people unfamiliar with Attenborough's work, do not hesitate. There are films that earn a lot of money. And there are films that create life. I would prefer the other one every day.
