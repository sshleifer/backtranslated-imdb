I'm not a big fan of camp kitsch and watching "so bad that it's good". However, I really like this movie because of its fun and - believe it or not - it's an innovation. <br /> <br /> The whole has a John Waters ring and is extremely enthusiastic, but with a few great actors and thoughtful direction, fully using slapstick and stylized movements. Billy Zane moves with incredible expression (see the scene on the bus for a lesson in the textbook, how to use the movement) and is surrounded by unexpected stars. <br /> <br /> You may not like this movie, do not enjoy it, but if you have the chance to watch it, save time because chances are that you will end up with a confused smile on your face and a new perspective on the sense of humor of some of the great stars . I would highly recommend.
