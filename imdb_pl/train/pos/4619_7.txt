First of all, I'm a big fan of movies from the 80s and Jennifer Conelly. So yesterday I went to a local store with used books / movies and found a copy of VHS. I read in the back and it sounded good, and for 3.99 dollars it was a good deal. So I took him home and put him in the VCR. What a sweet movie! At my age I refer more to films like About Last Night or St. Elmo's Fire, but I still remember what it was like to be 15/16 and fall in love with an older guy, etc. We all have these little crushing, we're younger. And if it does not work, we have a broken heart and we think we will never overcome it. But of course we do it. Many times. It's the kind of sweet quality that I really drew from this movie. The feeling of "Oooh! I remember when something like this happened to me ... ". The characters are interesting and well-developed. I recommend it to anyone who likes movies from the 80s, especially for teenagers, or anyone who wants to come back and recall a simpler time in their lives.
