It is a beautiful, rich and very well made film with a rich and significant history. Basically, he tells how the old master of story telling must find a (male) heir who will continue his craft, but eventually he will not get what he expected in his very male-dominated world. Characters must then take care of their situation, and the old master must struggle with the conflict between his desire for companion and heir and the traditional concepts of his and society. <br /> <br /> The story is fun, emotional and complex. Exploration of characters, their lives and emotions is rich and convincing that the character's development is strong, while the characters are complex and are not one-dimensional at all. The film professionally captures the emotions of an old man and his desire to find an heir, and convincingly shows how he and the child cope with the situation. There is also humor in the right points, sometimes quite subtle. The film also analyzes the good and the evil of traditional Chinese culture, creating further interest in the film. <br /> <br /> Direction, acting and scenery are unique. Adding to other assets, it creates rich and convincing visual images and attractive, real characters. As a result, the film evokes strong empathy and feelings of the characters. <br /> <br /> Some say the ending weakens the movie, but I do not necessarily agree with it. It might be stronger with a different ending, but any improvement in the whole movie would be rather small.
