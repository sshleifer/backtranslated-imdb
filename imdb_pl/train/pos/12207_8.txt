After all, do not you go to Orson Welles' movie to see a nice, simple story and polish the image of a happy eternal star? <br /> <br /> You are going to see the theatrical heightened figures locked in conflict with colorful and unusual settings, illuminated and imaginary, photographed bravely, and the whole thing filled with unexpected details of surprise, which wiser and boring director will either avoid or not think in the first place? <br /> <br /> As usual, apart from directing, Welles wrote the script and also played the hero? a young Irish sailor who knocked on the world and saw his evil, but still maintained a strong confidence in the goodness of others? Unfortunately, he rejected that trust in Rita Hayworth, whose cool, good looks hid the dark past and murderous tendencies for the future? She was a married woman without love, an impotent, crippled lawyer, she acted like a sinister lizard through the brilliant Everett Sloane? <br /> <br /> There is a youthful romanticism, and this quality has entered into a spontaneous game in "The Lady from Shanghai". Before it became inevitable, Welles escaped? for the final triangular game in the room of mirrors, which became one of the classic scenes of post-war cinema? <br /> <br /> Welles did not miss the chance in the whole film to defy the words and actions of the visual details that enriched the texture and raised the atmosphere? His camera seemed to almost caress Rita Hayworth when the sun was playing with her hair and long limbs while jokingly teasing the young sailor with her net?
