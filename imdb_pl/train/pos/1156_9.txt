Years ago, I was watching soap on TV. I was curious about the movie and was awarded for finding it. It is a wonderful parody of soaps, jealousies, uncertainties of ordinary actors and all kinds of wonderful excesses. But above all - an amazing cast and an amazing scenario. How did someone force all those actors from the top shelf to play in such a stupid movie? And how did this small movie force writers to write perfect lines? I never hear anyone talking about this movie, or even admitted it, but it's wonderful and I recommend that you see it. Sometimes I throw it while cleaning and end up sitting on the couch, watching, laughing and enjoying the whole wonderful work. A lot of congratulations to everyone who did it.
