When I first started watching this anime, I never thought that something in making bread could be really interesting, but fortunately I was wrong. From the moment I started watching it, the anime just got involved in the world of bread production, I was addicted. <br /> <br /> The biggest advantage of this anime is humor, which is very intelligent and very funny, with some repetitive gags. But animation, soundtrack and character development are below average, while these inconveniences are not so noticeable in the first episodes, because of the great work on this anime, they really begin to appear in the last 20 episodes, when reactions and repetitive gags just get they are aging and are not as fun as before. <br /> <br /> As for me, if this anime ended with episode 52, I would give it 9, but the last episodes leave a bitter aftertaste, which unfortunately can not be washed away by an amazing 50 episodes. <br /> <br /> 7/10
