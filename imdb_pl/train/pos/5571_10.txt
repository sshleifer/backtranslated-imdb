After watching "Whipped" during the distributor's AFM show, I must say that I was very impressed. The audience laughed the whole way. Unfortunately, every territory has already been sold, so I did not have the opportunity to buy a movie, but I really believe that it will be a big hit both in the country and at sea. I agree with the comment that "Whipped" should not be broken as a male "Sex and the City", mainly because, unlike "Sex and the City", "Whipped" is a satire about dates that never goes too far seriously. "Bita" makes fun of the relationship in a way that most sexual comedies would not dare. Also, the movie I showed on AFM had more story and history than "Swingers", "Clerks" and "Sex and the City" combined. "Bita" never slowed down and gave the audience an uninterrupted comedy. The performances of Amanda Peet and the rest of the cast were solid, which made the film more impressive considering the budget.
