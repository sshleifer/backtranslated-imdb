The material in this document is so powerful that it led me to tears. Yes, I'm telling you tears. This popular struggle of the traditionally exploited people should inspire us all, that we fight for our rights, spread the good of the community and stop making cowardly excuses not to question the establishment. Chavez represents the weak and unfortunate in the same way that Bush is the face of dirty corporations, and capitalism led amok. Indeed, Latin America is being transformed, and the marginalized majority eventually has a voice for more than five centuries. Although in the case of Mexico, the election was clearly stolen by Calderon. Chavez is not perfect, far from it. He is trying to change the constitution to let him rule indefinitely. This can not be tolerated. Just with politics and back to the movie; The tempo is breathtaking and deeply philosophical in others. He presents Chavez as a popular hero who is not afraid to question American hegemony and the dominance of world resources. If you think the author is biased in favor of Chavez, nothing will stop you from doing your homework. One of the key premises of the film is questioning the sources of information, which was clearly shown by the sniper victims who embarrass guilty Chavez supporters. Venezuela embarrasses the American alleged democracy. Hasta la revolucion siempre!
