A brutally depressing screenplay and some great performances by Peter Strauss and Pamela Reed and some good photos from locations in the state of Ohio in this wonderful television movie about hard times in the rusty belt. As mills close and jobs disappear, physical workers are threatened by everyone: management, owners, their wives and children. Strauss is completely credible in his role, and Pamela Reed is always wonderful. See if you can recognize John Goodman before he gets on weight. <br /> <br /> The result of heavy metal - did anyone make a pun? - it is sometimes annoyingly annoying, but Frank Stanley's pictures are knockouts, especially mill scenes.
