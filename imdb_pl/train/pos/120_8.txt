Stimulating you superficially is not the task of every movie. I will undertake an ambitious defeat in connection with the mass market hit every day. Although this can not be described as a failure, the sum of its parts remains ambiguous. This unreadable quality tempts me to watch it again. It is an ambitious, provocative film that does not go well. The problem with the film lies in its structure. It seems that his impenetrable plot ends, like the other ending. Although everything is technically dazzling, the film is too long in this unit. The long delayed climax of Leo's awakening takes about 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> Great pictures often come at the expense of a decent scenario, but here the innovative camera technique offers a wealth of visual ideas. The artificial composition is provocative and addictive; The character is a projection in the back, but does not have her own hand in the foreground. The presented world is deliberate, treacherous and absurd. Keep your eyes wide open for an unforgettable, technically amazing murder that will make your jaw drop. <br /> <br /> The compositions are stunning. Whoever decided to release a video cassette (in print) in the pan and scan format, never saw it. Where is the DVD? <br /> <br /> It is incomprehensible how anyone could give this originality a bad opinion. You should see it at least once. You get the impression that von Trier bit off more than he could chew, but this movie ends up being richer. I suspect he is familiar with Hitchcock's foreign correspondent, where clever Europeans manipulate the American asshole and several Welles films that derive the delirious joy of technology just like him. All von Trier's films explore the difficult situation of naif amidst ruthless societies. After Zentropie von Trier, he moved away from this bold technical experiment towards a gloomy, overdone, undifferentiated juice such as Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark.
