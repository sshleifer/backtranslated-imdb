It was a very good movie and it is absolutely unjust to judge it, not taking into account the time in which it was released. There are several films that do not age, but this is clearly out of date. However, I saw this movie when I was a boy and for over twenty years both paintings as a story were unforgettable for me and most of my friends, until we could appreciate it again on DVD. Actually, I remember this film as the topic of a few conversations and meetings during which old boys talked about things that we have in common. Therefore, there was a bit of disappointment and even sadness when we finally had a DVD. First, there was a theory about how naive our generation was. Secondly, I think there is something more. I would like to emphasize that this film has something that should be interesting for all contemporary film makers, especially those who focus on the rotting horror genre. This is a mutilation, an idea that gives cohesion to the film; the fact that man has been crippled produces a deeper horror than death and torture. I remember how sick it was when the monster pulled Kurt's arm away. And finally; when the creature bites the doctor's neck to take a piece of his veins. Another unusual thing is the morbid atmosphere that dominates without the disappearance of intensity by all scenes, regardless of whether the action takes place in a secret lab or on a lonely street, where a man in the car is looking for a woman's body, a striper's wardrobe, and so on. Perhaps the reason why he is no longer a good movie is only technical things. For example, in the scene of an accident and a man saving the bride's head, more accurate work done for another and modern director of the other unit may be interesting. The same with all action scenes, including Kurt's stage. What's more, you can do something with a monster makeup. Some alterations were good; I think it's worth trying in this case. Nevertheless, shades of black and white should be preserved.
