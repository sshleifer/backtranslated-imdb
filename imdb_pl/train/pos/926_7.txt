I do not know why some people criticize this show so much. <br /> <br /> It's a great, fun program - it's probably not the right material for the mainstream of the main time, but still ... <br /> <br /> The dynamics of the family are fun, all in most programs comedy. Supporting characters are absolutely fun. The plot of the episodes and frequent jibes of Siegfried and Roy are only slightly above average, but you often have sub-threads or one-liners that make you laugh on the floor. <br /> <br /> This show was worth 8 pounds, for which I paid. <br /> <br /> note: 8/10
