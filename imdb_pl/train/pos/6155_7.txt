"Bedknobs and Broomsticks" is a magical adventure movie with some charm, although it is not one of the best Disney songs. It has a generally good story, nice songs, great characters, good actors, magical and stunning special effects, good surroundings and beautiful scenery of England. <br /> <br /> It also combines a very good live action and animation. The animation itself is quite good, of course. Animation is very reminiscent of the animated film "Robin Hood" from 1973 and the same can be said about animated characters: there are a lot of wild animals such as bears, elephants, hippos, lions, crocodiles and other similar to "Robin Hood" In addition, the king (lion ) seems to be a mix of Prince John and King Richard, not to mention that the bear looks like Little John. <br /> <br /> This movie is often compared to "Mary Poppins" for some reason. Both combine live action and animation with similar graphics. Both have similar settings in London. Both have their own magic and magical woman. Children (Carrie, Charlie and sweet little Paul) are a bit like Bank children. Both films were directed by Robert Stevenson and both were cast by David Tomlinson. Instead of a very serious man like George Banks, however, David Tomlinson plays a happy and magical man - Professor Emelius Browne. Thanks to its magic, this film also has some small but significant similarities to the Harry Potter stories. <br /> <br /> Most of the songs are good. "The Age of Not Believing" and "The Beautiful Briny Sea" are the best. "Portobello Road" is also cool. <br /> <br /> David Tomlinson is great again in this film. Angela Lansbury is great because Miss Price and three kids are okay: Cindy O'Callaghan as Carrie, Ian Weighill as Charlie (boy in "no-believing age") and Roy Snart as the youngest brother Paul. br /> <br /> I like a black cat. It's pretty cool. He looks a bit like Salem, the black cat from the TV series Sabrina, the teenage witch. I am cute when one of the characters in the film is transformed into a white rabbit. Rabbits are really cute, fluffy and cute animals. I just love them! It's even more fun when Professor Emelius Browne turns into a white rabbit because when he changes again into a human, he shakes his nose like a rabbit. It's really funny, combined with its comic character and mustache. <br /> <br /> In general, it's a good movie, but its ending is quite bad. The first minutes of the film are nothing special, but then they improve a lot. The ending, however, is weak. This is my main criticism, largely because the animated knight's thing is too much for me, and also because of the sense of war.
