This movie was beautiful. He was full of unforgettable paintings, good acting and a moving subject. It would be very easy to write it as too sentimental, but it is this feeling that this type of film tries to achieve. I was totally committed to developing history and presentation. There were a few bad shots, but this can be expected in a religious propaganda film. The only complaint I can imagine is that there were not many details. However, this film was not created to explain every element of Joseph Smith's life, his service, triumphs, controversy, failures, etc.; It was designed to quickly get acquainted with several attractions of one of the most amazing American and historical religious figures of all time.
