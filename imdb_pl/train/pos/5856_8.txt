Rated E (contains violence). <br /> <br /> I had an original spiderman game on PC for several years. I still have not beat it, because there is a bug in one level in Windows XP that I can not overcome because of it. So be warned if you have XP. But for those who do not have XP, try this game. This is a pure family game with action and great for any spiderman fan. In the game in which you play spiderman and you take on each other criminals who commit crimes. Spiderman is a fun game and I recommend it to any Spiderman fan or parent who wants a fun, clean game for their children. <br /> <br /> 8/10
