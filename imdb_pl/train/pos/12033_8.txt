When I browsed the TV guide and came across the "Twisted Desire" section of the movie, I read its description. Three words caught my attention "Melissa Joan Hart" ... I think that her role in "Sabrina: The Teenage Witch" is absolutely wicked, I hate this kind of programs, so I thought it would be boring, a love story with her ... . I did not know. <br /> <br /> In the end it started on TV, I had a ready bucket in case I vomited over his affection or sappiness, you know what I mean. At first, you think she is just a nice, ordinary girl who is in love but has vile parents. Then when you find out that she's manipulated her boyfriend to kill her parents so she can be with REAL love, you're like "Whoa." You just do not expect such a role for such an actress. She played her role very well, I never expected that she would be able to act like a bitch, and voil√† did it perfectly! I congratulate her, the film was very good, I will definitely watch it again and recommend it to others.
