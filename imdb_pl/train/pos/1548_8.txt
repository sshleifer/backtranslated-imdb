Fortunately, without knowing anything about this film, I was curious enough to record it from television. And then the tape ended up five minutes before the end! <br /> <br /> But I'm happy that I managed to get it because it is a really great spy movie. There are ordinary toy submarines and slightly misty threads, but also very chilling in their veins, and even bold moments. Taking into account the year 1969, some minor lesbian undertones had to trigger several eyebrows. Of course, now no one is surprised and these scenes seem to be really beautifully made. And not just because of George's two actresses. <br /> <br /> It seems that the gas attack hits every viewer very strongly, no wonder, and it definitely struck me. Very effective. Also points of view from both sides of the opponents give the whole story a deeper sense of the usual uncertainty and action. This is not just a heroic war story about one winning side, but shows what is behind the victory in good and evil. Well, being a war accident, mainly bad. <br /> <br /> It is also a must for fans of composer Ennio Morricone. His work is always perfect, moving, but never exaggerated. And I think I have to try and catch more movies from Suzy Kendall. Talk about Fr√§ulein! Let's hope that they will soon receive it on DVD, so I can have the whole movie in my collection, and more people will get to know this little-known gem.
