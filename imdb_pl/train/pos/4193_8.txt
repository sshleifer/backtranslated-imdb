Director Sam Fuller has something of a cult, especially in Europe. However, most of his films are more than forgotten. However, he made one really great movie in "Pickup on South Street". Movies that were created quite early were much worse. <br /> <br /> From the first to the last frame, "Pickup" works on all levels. It is filmed with impeccable fluidity, offering excellent performances all the time. Richard Widmark and Thelma Ritter, both players with a great record of the best achievements are at the top. Widmark, who was no stranger to playing villains, although he was really mean, still manages to reveal the smallest humanity that makes his character fascinating, and also makes the character of Jean Peters more credible to him. br /> Fuller does not have any blows in this really difficult movie. There is a scene where Jean Peters is cheated by Widmark. It's really shocking in its reality. This is not the case of a carefully directed photograph. <br /> <br /> Less conscious than many filmmakers from this period remains a great example of the genre.
