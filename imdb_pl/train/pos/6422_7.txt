Military training videos are becoming so common that they become a genre for themselves. Among the more well-known we have "Officer and gentleman", "Top Gun", "GI Jane" and now "Men of Honor". The fact that this case was real does not change the fact that the formula is the same. This movie is probably the most similar to "GI Jane" because it focuses on the desegregation angle. <br /> <br /> The story is actually quite inspiring and is probably the best story of the interests of the people mentioned above. Carl Brashear (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) is undoubtedly a man of great courage and principle, and his strength of character shines brightly in this film. Unfortunately, the director George Tillman has a tunnel vision in presenting the characters and avoiding the development of characters from different characters than Brashear to show Brashear in a constant state of adversity. Billy Sunday (Robert De Niro) is a central figure and apart from the initial stage, fist fight and a few scenes with his wife, we do not know much about him. For example, Brashear sees scars on his Sunday hands and we have to assume that he worked on the plow, but at this point there is no further observation. Mr. Pappy (Hal Holbrook) gets only one short scene through which we can judge him. The rest of the screen shows him walking around the room and screaming. If the director intends to tell human history, he must humanize the characters. <br /> <br /> Kuba Gooding Jr. gives excellent results as Brashear. It's probably the best I've seen. It is a role and a character that is much more complete than any part he has played before, and he is up to the task. In "Jerry Maguire" Rod Tidwell was a fascinating, but one-dimensional figure with a depth of rain puddle. Brashear is much more complex and well-established, and the problems it faces are life crises, which makes the part much harder. This is a great way out of Gooding's last role in the film "Chill Factor", a film so horrible that participation in it was almost an act of professional suicide. <br /> <br /> After the break, trying his hand as a comedian ("Analyze it", "Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle", "Meet the parents"), Robert DeNiro returns to his dramatic roots with a great performance. DeNiro is not a bad comedian, he is just such a great dramatic actor that he does not think he should waste time doing comedy. DeNiro gives Billy Sunday a hard, rock personality, leaning towards a tortured soul. It's a pleasure to watch how he works. <br /> <br /> It looks like every movie I watch lately has Charlize Theron in it. I saw "The Legend of Bagger Vance", "Men of Honor" and "The Yards" in a row and I began to wonder if she had participated in every movie in 2000 (actually, she only had five). It was a small role for Theron, but she did well and managed to stay with DeNiro. David Keith, who starred with Richard Gere in the movie "Officer and Gentleman," has a cameo here <br /> <br /> The DVD has some interesting special features, including the reflections of the real Carl Brashear and some deleted scenes. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie despite a crafted story and a one-dimensional presentation. I evaluated it on 7/10. I'm a sucker of stories about weaker people and I like stories in which strength of character is the main topic. This film is particularly strong in both fields and brings us two unforgettable performances, which compensate for some of the director's shortcomings.
