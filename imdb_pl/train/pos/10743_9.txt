I have read most of the comments here. I came to the conclusion that almost everyone agrees that September 11 is a shocking story. There are a few who think that the added narration is weak and I agree that the narrative is weak and unnecessary. Two brothers who found themselves after a crash and a cliff hanger about Tony. But I do not think the narrative is unnecessary. Like many theoreticians, I think that our own lives are narratives. We live and create our own autobiography. So if we talk about our life, it always happens in the form of a narrative. We do not summarize facts such as: Birth, childhood, high school, etc. We create a story about our life. <br /> <br /> Because we are familiar with the stories, we also want to put history in history. Because we can identify ourselves in the form of a story. We can better understand what happened in history when it was told in the form of a story. This is the purpose of adding history in a document. History is weak, let it be so, but we understand what is happening. If I was there, I would be worried about my brother. <br /> <br /> And the second point, doing a hit about this movie. It's true that a great movie about September 11 appeared recently. Nevertheless, there were several topics on the subject, but none of them liked this document. But what if there is a movie in about 5 years? I agree that this is wrong, trying to earn a lot of money from September 11. But I also agree that movies are one of the best ways to tell a story. How many films about World War II did we see? If I had not seen these films, my view on WW would be completely different. I remember seeing the Schindler List and I cried for an hour during class. Movies give a good picture of things that have happened in history, and although it is fiction, it contributes to the memory of disasters and victims. <br /> <br /> So I'm right: storytelling is not always bad, it makes us identify with history and makes us never forget what happened.
