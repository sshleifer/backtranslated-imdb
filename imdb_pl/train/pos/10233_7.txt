I always wanted to watch Hong Kong movies, but all of them did not live up to my expectations ... until now! BURNING PARADISE does not contain the flat humor that most HK movies have or the second storyline that has been drawn into the movie. The story is not complicated, but there are never scenes that could fill an "intelligent" space (the only really smart martial arts movie I've seen is CROUCHING TIGER, but because Hollywood is involved, this is not a real movie for me HK)). In this movie there are some amazing fight scenes, from the first (which is one of the coolest I've ever seen, but so short) to the last major scenes! But remember, there is also a lot of blood that flows (people cut in half, cut their head, etc.). The production is quite good and the special effects show that the writer's fantasy can be fulfilled, even if some shots have to be quite technical (note: a sheet of paper that he throws and has been pinned to the wall!). Yes, it's not Tsui Hark or John Woo that made my favorite movie in Hong Kong, it's Ringo Lam! And I'm sure I will see more from this director! As.
