I know that movie snobs are snorting. But if you're looking for a surprisingly nice ride through the jungle with the movie B, try "Jake Speed". <br /> <br /> Sometimes a little thin, but its one-layered and the place more complementary for this. John Hurt (God loves him) seems to have a good time performing his role as an ultra evil white slave. Nemezis Crawfords, Jake Speed. It adds a dimension to the film that only a professional such as Hurt can provide. Crawford and Dennis Christopher (midfielder Jakes) are a good team, though you're wondering why they both got along with each other. However, together Crawford and Christopher present a team that is so funny, if you can beat yourself for a moment you may find yourself acting like a child again in situations and the inherent uncertainty they provide. Pyszna Karen Kopins does a great job as a poor lady who is more concerned about the motives of her rescuer than her torturer. <br /> <br /> I have not found a movie that would be so funny if it had not been preached, nor did I delve into the movie, trying too hard. Not every movie must be the latest Citizen Kane. And trust me, Wells was the original. So let's remember that sometimes movies are for fun. No social commentary or an attempt at political swaying the audience. But only for pure fun of life and life at a time when our hero lives in a celluloid dimension.
