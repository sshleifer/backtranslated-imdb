The Peter Jacksons versions are better films from an objective point of view. With that in mind, these are not my favorite screen versions of the Lord of the Rings and let me explain why. <br /> <br /> First of all, character acting on the screen is just too ordinary and uninspiring at LOTR LOTR. The whole cast is a pierced mill. "Are you saying that these stupid cartoon characters in the Ralph Bakshi version are better actors than real people?" You can ask. Well, they are not really stupid (except for the hobbits, later about them) and certainly pack more personality than the Jackson party - even with a much more limited time of dialogue. And this is due to better action at LOTR Bakshi. Take, for example, Aragorn. In this version, his voice is deep and charismatic with full authority (Aragorn Lord) and a dry screech (Aragorn the ranger). This is due to the brilliant acting of John Hurt. Compare this with the quite high sound of Viggo Mortensen without a soul and the duel becomes quickly uneven: Hurt beats Mortensen. <br /> <br /> And then there is Gandalf. Probably the most dominant (and most popular) character in the whole saga. In this version of Bakshi Gandalf (William Squire) is a real wizard. And by that I do not mean that he shoots with his fingertips (he does not), but his presence is captivating. He is mystical, powerful and can easily pass from a gentle old man to a terrifying one. Add to it his appearance: tall, old like an ancient oak, long beard like his body, sharp eyes, magic nose hook and of course the classic wizard's hat. Perfect Gandalf, just like in books. On the other hand, Gandalf Ian McKellen is simply too boring. It looks too human, it sounds too human, it works too humanly and does not wear a hat or wield a sword. Yes, a sword. In this version of Bakshi, Gandalf wins with his sword several bloody kills of the orcs (as in books). And it's stylish killings in slow motion. Gandalf is not a force to deal with. And it must be noted that although I am sorry to say, the great Christopher Lee did not bring Saruman alive. Fraser Kerr did this in this movie, even with very limited time and screen lines. <br /> <br /> Before I completely switch to the visual aspects of the movie, it's worth mentioning that the voice game and the overall presentation of the Orcs are also better than the fake bad guys Jackson. Bakshs' orcs scoff at enemies (or each other) incessantly snarling, shouting and nasty language. They are more credible as monsters and in my opinion they are more faithful to the book. And finally Black Riders - or Nazgul. The best evil are in this one terrifying spirit - not just some riders in black. And they say with a haunting voice that mesmerizes their victim. My favorite scene in the movie is that Nazgul chase Frodo near the river. While Peter Jackson could do nothing but show the riders chasing the party, Bakshi throws a nightmare with some cool scenes in slow motion and thundering sky. <br /> <br /> But I like this movie so much than Jackson, the latter are, if only technically, even better. And that's because of some of the key visual elements. As you know, Bakshi LOTR contains a mix of animated characters (all hobbits and main cast) and real actors covered with paint. I do not really have a problem using real people in animation, but they just do not match traditional cartoon characters. This is especially true for people (Riders of Rohan, people from taverns, etc.). Orcs have different meanings because they are supposed to look very different from other characters. Orcs, when people play with a mix of animations, look much better than the Jackson version. They have brown-green skin, shiny red eyes, a flat face and pointed teeth. <br /> <br /> The biggest confusion in these movies is hobbits. Although I prefer almost every character in the Bakshi version compared to Jackson, the latter has clearly better hobbits, in fact they are excellent. With Bakshi, you get some of the irritating and rather poorly drawn Disney humanoid butterflies. And you're forced to spend a lot of time with them, so be careful. Again, the voice game is also fine for them, but the lips of the actors can not save the "immersion damage" of these little weasels. Well, I never really liked those halflings. <br /> <br /> General errors in the Bakshi script are well known. Limited playback time (with limited budget) and many missing scenes. So while this movie covers almost half of history, it does not do it in detail when compared to the Jackson version. <br /> <br /> In summary, the LOTR version of Ralph Bakshi has an advantage: <br /> <br /> - general atmosphere (reminiscent of Middle-earth) - acting for voice - music (really play a fantasy score by Konto and Rosenman ) -Gandalf -Aragorn (one of the best roles of John Hurt) -King Theoden -Orcs -Black Riders -Elrond (is not some hippie hippie in this!) <br /> <br /> Although the Jackson version is better: <br / > <br /> - because it covers the whole story - general visualizations and special effects -Gollum / Smeagol -Balrog -Hobbits <br/> <br /> The Lord of the Rings by Ralph Bakshi, even with well-known shortcomings, is one of the best animated films, ever created, and very well reflects the atmosphere of Tolkien's fantasy, if not perfectly. I'll give him 8.5 points out of 10.
