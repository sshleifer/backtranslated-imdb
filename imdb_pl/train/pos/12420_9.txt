Hit at this time, but now better classified as an Australian cult movie. Humor is wide, non-subtle, and in the last scene in which the BBC's fire goes out by urinating, it's raw. It contains almost every cliche about the traditional Australian pilgrimage to the "old country" and every cliche about those predatory, trapped, whining, Tory Brits. It would be acceptable to the British because of the strong cast of well-known actors and Australians of this generation who can "feel" humor. Americans - forget about it. Language and jokes are in the Australian English dialect and as such will be incomprehensible.
