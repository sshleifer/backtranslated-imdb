I felt that it was very balanced, showing what Jehovah's Witnesses did to protect American freedoms. She also showed the strong faith of two families who witnessed the first generation. I also appreciate how it shows how becoming a Jehovah's Witness affects non-witnesses' family members and how difficult it is for them to accept the fact that they do not celebrate holidays, a sad part is that families who are not witnesses do not think about having a family of witnesses for family dinners / visits or giving them presents at any other time, but for holidays or birthdays. When it comes to medical care, which witnesses expect and expect a high level of medical care, people forget that blood transfusions allow for sloppy medical care and operations, while bloodless treatments make the medical team highly qualified and trained, which you prefer to treat your loved ones ? I highly recommend this movie!
