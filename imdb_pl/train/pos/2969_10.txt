This movie is about two guys who invented sports on the spot, trying to get 2 chickens. BASEketball becomes a nationwide sport. Joe Cooper (Trey Parker) is the beloved captain, but he is hated when he loses to the NBA with some other rival. He meets the girl of his dreams, Yasmine Bleeth, and at the end they kiss. I saw this movie for the first time, I wet my pants, it was so funny. definitive must be for all comedy fans. If you like the southern park, you'll love it! Maybe you do not watch with children it's a little inappropriate for small guys. some duds give him 6 1/2 by 10, I give it 11 by ten. I like coop on rocks I have to say goodbye thanks for reading this
