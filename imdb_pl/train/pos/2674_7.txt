If the excess of getting off the boat, boat, bus, bus ... is a way to waste time, you should go back to Hollywood movies that wrap this part in one assembly to get shots of money. and by doing this, stay unrelated to the film's abyss, which results from the fact that it does not really show reality. Long drawn sequences of the journey allow the viewer to feel the same frustration and feeling of "waiting in the queue" that characters have to endure. Irritating? Yes. Important? Indeed. The abyss of this journey is the key to the "bloodlessness" of this Turkish family. A beautiful movie with great acting. Sad, but it's worth it.
