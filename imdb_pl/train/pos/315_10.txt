I absolutely loved this soap. It was one of my favorites. I highly recommend :) ... I just love Brazilian soaps, they deal with real events. I'm really sad that the soap is over, but I'm sure I can find it somewhere. For those of you who have not seen him, see this. I loved characters, the story and how things ended for criminals. The only thing I would change is the end of Xiki and her long love. I can not wait to see him again and I highly recommend him. Xica is by far the best soap I have ever seen. Forget everything else :) GO XICA .. Hope you like it too.
