"One of Hung's better early efforts. Humor is dead in part when Hung tries to imitate Lee's facial expressions and facial expressions, as well as in a slightly different place where Hung mocks with Drunken Master Jackie Chana. when Hung takes up a trio about martial arts experts at the end, it's not the best movie, but it's pretty good for the 70's kung fu, especially if you're a fan of Hung and / or Lee. movie versions have quite tacky quality, there is also a black face that some people may find offensive. <br /> <br /> Sammo Hung is a rural shepherd of pigs who moves to Hong Kong to fight some bad people. Sammo turns on his dead personification of Bruce Lee during the fight! <br /> <br /> This movie is often announced as a parody of Bruce Lee's "Enter The Dragon", but this is not exactly ... Sammo is a country shepherd of pigs - obsessed with Bruce Lee - who moves to Hong Kong to help your loved ones run a small outdoor restaurant. In his new job, he is forced to defend the pub against local gangsters seeking money for protection. When Sammo goes into battle mode, he turns on the Bruce Lee impersonation, which is to be believed! This movie is quite scruffy, in many scenes of struggle Sammo fights with people who are obviously actors, not martial artists, and there is one character who is supposed to be black, played by an Asian man with heavy (and ridiculous) make-up. But this movie is lacking in budget and accuracy, it's more than it makes up for in the atmosphere and energy. I highly recommend for a good mood. "
