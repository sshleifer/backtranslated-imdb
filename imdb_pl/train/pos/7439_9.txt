An ancient sailor is really a classic work, just like the original poem was / is. Context / setting with an old sailor is good, bright and without pretense. The artistic work accompanying the reading of the poem perfectly matches the time / period of the stage design and the work itself, transferring the audience to the still moving accompaniment, using excellent movement strategies, well mastered by MTV producers and much less visible in more recent works. (MTV has introduced a static motion to television and video that runs through often insignificant parts, from the topic to the topic without moving forward and without any clear links to the topic or plot). with all fear, struggle and pain. In addition, the smooth video movement emphasizes the cadence and sporadic monotonous (in this case a positive mood under the theme of the story itself) the author's interpretation of the sad and terrible story of an ancient sailor. It is a necessity for every love of classical poetry, the sea, a high story that almost sounds like true, and a history that has left a lasting impact on our world and culture. Who does not understand the meaning of "albatros"? or the concept of "water, water everywhere, not a drop to drink?" A really great experience. Thank you, Mr. DaSilva, for reviving us for us never to be forgotten.
