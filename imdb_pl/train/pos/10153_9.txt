I caught this movie at a test show. I was very surprised when I found a really sweet and funny story. Well played. Natasha Henstridge is next Julia Roberts. The male lead was amazing. A very funny movie. Takes place in the best locations in New York. He made me want to go there. I just saw "You have a mail". I thought "It Had To Be You" is a much better story. The audience I saw loved it.
