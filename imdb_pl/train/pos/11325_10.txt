When I first heard about this series on AnimeTV, I have to say that of all the shows I've seen, it's all complementary. I had to see this program and that's what I did. When I got the first volume of this program, it was the best. I really enjoyed the animation, and all the battle scenes were amazing. I have to say that my favorite characters in the show were Saber, Archer and of course I like Illya. And of course, all the episodes on the volumes were interesting and very cool. The next thing I have to say about the series is Michael McConnohie (known from Transformers and others) who plays Berserker. He has a nice character. All the time I watched the whole series before watching the last volume. So if you want to see something good and then see this program, it's the best.
