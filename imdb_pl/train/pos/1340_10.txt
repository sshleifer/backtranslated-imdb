This document was interesting, but it was also long (for a total length of 225 minutes), like the long Ben-Hur. But if you join it, it's for you. But only if you have a passion for movies, just like me. As Martin Scorsese is my favorite director (live, maybe even ever), it's quite fascinating, especially if you know the Scorsese style. Because then you can understand where he drew inspiration from many of his films. Not the best documentary ever made, but it is a leap for Scorsese, which is always worth watching. BEHIND
