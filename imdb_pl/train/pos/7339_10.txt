Ever since I heard about Ralph Bakshi's "Lord of the Rings", I wondered: what the hell is the "rotoscopic" animation? !!! Well ... I finally found out ... I saw this movie about three years ago, not knowing who Ralph Bakshi is ... And I liked it ... a lot ... Very good plot ... it even has a small character development that is great for a cartoon ... Look, if you get bored with modern animation ... Do not get me wrong ... I'm not saying it's just a pretty cartoon ... It's also a pretty good movie ... .
