Note: these comments are intended for people who have seen the video. <br /> <br /> Vanilla Sky is a brilliant, complex and thrilling movie that is existentially exploring exactly what the tag says: LoveHateDreamsLifeWorkPlayFriends. Maybe the plot of the movie can focus on confused movie viewers, if you look at it from a different perspective. <br /> <br /> Given the following: <br /> <br /> Now I did not go scrupulously through the movie scene on the stage, so I will have to investigate my claims more thoroughly (and I'm happy with your thoughts), but try and see if the film will fall into place: where exactly does the debut "splice" come from? <br /> <br /> Now I am not talking about a weave, as LE "explains", because the sequence itself can in fact be interpreted as rationalization inside David Aames's mind / sleep / coma, but the real connection between reality and dream. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that the reality of a car accident, the way of filming it (for example, no explosion) is a probable "weave", and each specific sequence containing an existential / sleep / coma / non-reality - independently Whether or not it is shown on the screen before or after a disaster - it is actually part of Aames' personal journey to self-realization in his own mind. <br /> <br /> Therefore, we are left with two questions at the very end of the end (if you know more, let me know): is Aames really distorted and where he wakes up? <br /> <br /> If you are not completely absorbed in the exact sequence of details in the plot, or at what point your dreams are scattered all over, this movie becomes a fascinating exploration of a man on the go to find himself and That means in today's society pop culture. <br /> <br />
