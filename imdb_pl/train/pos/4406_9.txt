Amazingly, this movie never hit a big screen in Denmark, so I had to wait for the movie to be released. My expectations were high, but they were not disappointed in any way. As always in Ang Lee is a fantastic acting game, a smart and exciting story, in which you guess to the very end and excellent filming. Together with Unforgiven, it is certainly one of the two best westerns of the 90s. <br /> <br /> People who expect something like Mel Gibson in The Patriot (corny) or Braveheart (acceptable) will be sourly disappointed, everyone else who values ​​the above mentioned features will have a fantastic time to watch. 9 out of 10.
