One of the last classics of the French New Wave. Cineaste Jean Eustache drew on the simplicity of cinema from the beginning of the century; for history, Eustache drew from the anguish of his own complicated love life. So many things can be said about this film - brilliantly observational; I forgive myself; sometimes funny; emotionally exhausting ... etc., etc. In my opinion, any complaints that can be abolished on this film are easily obscured by its numerous advantages. Any film student, writer, or just someone who wants to deal with a 3-hour movie without any sudden cuts, no over-the-top music videos, no twists and turns of the soap opera, and no trivial dialogue should point to this movie. Everything is to be admired: writing (concise, clever, surprisingly fun), acting (everyone, just, is perfect in their roles), and a simple direction (the viewer feels like an ordinary observer in the film) make the film unforgettable. This is undoubtedly the movie that stays with you.
