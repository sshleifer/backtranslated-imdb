Why did not it bring a bag full of Oscars? It's an amazing interpretation of a movie that is often filmed / made. Visualizations are breathtaking (especially on the wide screen ... panning and scanning really kills great photos and sets of this movie). Each frame is an image. Amazing. The performance is almost completely intact, and Branagh's passion for it stems from the initial titles. There is no Zefferelli here, just a great story in a way only movie can, but rare. Jacobi is particularly perfect as Hamlet's murderous uncle: he does not play him as a mustache, sinister villian, but a charming politician, allowing us to see why only Hamlet suspects an impure game. Branagh also nails the subtlety of the line between Hamlet's false madness and the burning revenge in him. And a lot of episodes are going pretty well, everyone from Billy Crystal and Robin Williams to Gerard Deparde and Charlton Heston is unobtrusive if you're involved in Branagh's vision just like me. A hypnotic piece.
