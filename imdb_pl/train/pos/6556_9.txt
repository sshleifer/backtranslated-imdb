I really liked this movie. I am a single dad with a 17-year-old daughter who is smart, athletic and talented. I regret that my girlfriend did not apply so much to solving crimes and helping others! So for me maybe this is Fantasyland on the PG level. I have read many of Nancy Drew's books in my teenage years, a long time ago. Sure this character was played by Emma Roberts, but it did NOT resemble Nancy Drew, which I remember from books. It's thanks to the script, not acting. <br /> <br /> Emma is a charming teenager, playing a confident, hardworking and proud character with good manners and good taste. She is not drawn into fashionable competition around her. There are a few weaknesses in the story, except that they do not resemble Nancy Drew from books, and trying to figure out which decade we are in. I read the IMDb review before watching the movie because I researched Rachael Leigh Cook from other movies. This is not one of her best roles, but I will continue to search for her next films. Rachael was too old to play this role, but she does a great job as an adult orphan, central to the mystery. <br /> <br /> I am very disappointed with the other reviews written here. Some expect a perfect connection with books, others expect a more reliable situation or adult action film. I have what I expected! Good entertainment addressed to young teenagers and their fathers who want good children with high standards of conduct and achievements. This is PG teen movie, not James Bond! Which one would you like to have a role model for your teenage daughter?
