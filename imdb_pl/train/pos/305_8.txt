A screw comedy about romantic discrepancies in New York. Of course, Peter Bogdanovich is in love with all the women in his picture - he tells them respectfully - and Audrey Hepburn is (of course) superior to others, because in the end she is the princess Bogdanovich, in which he probably fell in love 30 years earlier. He shoots her in love close-ups, hits the sheets between her and the wonderfully hard / soft Ben Gazza, and allows her peace to sparkle throughout. The love connections created during the movie are quick and funny, although I got tired of the television style of John Ritter. Colleen Camp, Dorothy Stratten and grounded, earthy-sensual Patti Hansen are exciting. But it's really Valentine Hepburn and she absolutely shines. *** with ****
