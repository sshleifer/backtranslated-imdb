I just have to say it's one of my favorite movies of all time. I can not even count how many times I saw him. I was already in love with John Travolta, but for the first time the camera moves over his body after he is shaved and looks beautiful on his first trip to Gilley, I was impressed. Debra Winger, as always, ensures the perfect performance of Bud's young, naive wife, but he has the necessary attitude to marry a stubborn and hard-working cowboy. If you're not a country music player I have not been to, then there is one soundtrack that will make you sing along with every word. If you have a chance, see this movie - it will not let you down.
