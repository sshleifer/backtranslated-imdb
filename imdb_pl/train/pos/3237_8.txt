After my experience in Finland for just over a week, I would say that this film accurately depicts the nature of Finnish society. Particularly the phenomenon of "a young couple with serious problems with the child" is very familiar to me because I personally witnessed the same when I was in Finland. Relationships and problems of people, the fragility of the marital institution, drinking culture, unemployment and the growing monetary problem, everything is very well placed, without any subjectivity and exaggeration. <br /> <br /> There are several points in a movie that is not necessarily easy to understand and attach to each other, but the common large picture is satisfying. Not every story is exciting or deep, but as said above, the big picture does not disappoint, providing a sense of "real life" and captivating the viewer. I happen to think at a calm moment: what is happening in the life of all these people on the street? This is what is happening. Such films are good to power the imagination. It would be safe to assume that this film can refer to life in many countries, but especially reflects Finland as it is and damn well. <br /> <br /> One commentary on acting: being a fan of Finnish cinema I am, I have never seen any of these actors in any other film, but I think that acting in this function is right next to general perfection. Maybe not a masterpiece, but a very good test of the entire crew. I will look after the future releases of the director and cast .. <br /> <br /> 7,5 / 10
