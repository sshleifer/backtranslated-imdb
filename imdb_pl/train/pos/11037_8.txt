I know that the French prisoners probably did not read Lovecraft (which proves my thesis that his writings should be taught at school, maybe as a separate subject), but how did they think that something that sounds like "ftagn yog sototh" can lead to any good ? <br /> <br /> The movie takes place in a prison in which four very unlikely cellmates encounter a magical book that can, if well-read, get them out. When the prisons go, the cell was completely unreal, so it was difficult to get into the atmosphere of things. He also moves quite slowly, which can bore people. But besides, this is the highest level of horror, mixing Sartre's "hell of other people" with the story of the Lovecraft / Barker type and doing it successfully. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: take some time to watch it. This means that you do not do this when you are going to work, sleep or do something else. This is the movie that works best if you're immersed in it. Applications to be drawn: Yog is bad, almost as bad as French women.
