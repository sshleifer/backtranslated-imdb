"Mr. Harvey lights a candle" and the result is Timothy Spall's brilliant performance. <br /> <br /> Although we can predict that his titular sadness, a stubborn teacher will have some kind of breakdown or catharsis based on some deep mystery of his past, how his emotions are revealed, is surprising. The range of feelings conveyed by Spall is quite moving and more than usual is presented as part of Mike Leigh's repertoire. <br /> <br /> The expected boring school bus trip was used only for comic purposes, eg "The Simpsons", this central situation of a visit to the Salisbury cathedral in the Rhidian Brook scenario is well closed and organized for dramatic purposes, and is almost formally divided into acts. <br /> <br /> Introducing the urban British range of racially and religiously diverse children (with their uniforms I could not say if it is a "private" or "public" school), how do they gather? rapping black children, serious South Asians and Muslims, white rogues and mischievous girls? but transmitted naturally and individually. Young actors, some of whom I recognized on British television, such as "Shameless", were elemental in representing the usual range of social pressures at a high level. Celia Imrie puts more heat into a supervisor than a martinet she usually has to play. <br /> <br /> A break on the journey leads to a transformation crisis for some, while others remain fun unaware. We think, like the teacher presented by Ben Miles of "Coupling", that we will feed a didactic lesson on religious tolerance, but much more about faith in people and in God, that's why the BBC showed it in England during Easter and BBC America it showed in the United States on Christmas. <br /> <br /> Nathalie Press, who was also so good at "Summer of Love", plays a key role in buying Mr. Harvey, who could have been a part of the week's film sermons, but he's moved when they reach for each other in an unexpected way (unfortunately I saw their intense scene interrupted by advertisements). <br /> <br /> Although it is a bit This heavy film has called this trip several times "a pilgrimage", this silent movie was the best example of "goodwill towards men" than in most holiday-related television films.
