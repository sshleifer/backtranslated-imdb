This criminal thriller is like a movie noir, although it changes the context from the post-war period to the Cold War and has something relatively decent to say about humanity. In "Pickup on South Street", police officers are good guys, criminals are real men, and the only enemies are "The Commies" who ultimately distinguish themselves from good guys in that they are emotionally friendly, driven by real concern for their own worth, as shown in fixed tracked close-ups that make a movie. <br /> <br /> This movie revolves around the character. The personalities in this movie are rather unique and detailed: omit a pocket that is able to look at every danger and sometimes while going through their personal things; Maybe an informant who only tries to save for a spectacular funeral, but who manages to capture the hearts and respect of almost all other characters (and the audience); Candy, a badly-named innocent girl who only thinks she's doing government work and does not understand the full conspiracy she's associated with; and Joey, ex-boyfriend of bad Commie baddie who tries to hide everything from everyone and, ironically, is the worst person to do it. Put in a handful of very colorful support characters (such as a guy with chopsticks and policemen), and "Pickup on South Street" treats you like a great personality when hunting for mysterious and accidentally stolen microfilm cages. > <br /> --PolarisDiB
