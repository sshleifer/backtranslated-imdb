I never saw this movie until I bought the tape last year. I was enchanted and entertained. It has all the elements of what I love to watch in science-fiction history, in a book or on the screen. There is social commentary, speculation and a good story. <br /> <br /> There is something amazing and fun watching the "distant future" view of the 1960s and 1970s. <br /> <br /> I think it's a must see, not just for Sci-Fiers.
