I thought that the film was quite well made for the purpose of a television film, and contained both a lot of action and humor. I found an entertainment value that is worth watching and I watch it again or a similar program. I'm disappointed that Sean has not been registered here on IMDb. <br /> <br /> I see the possibility of an action series based on this concept or the continuation of Sean once again playing for even higher "cash" rates, since his life will be on the line again. <br /> <br /> I felt that Sean played this role very well and reminds me of an actor named Matthew Ashford who plays Jack Deveraux on Days of Our Lives - the soap opera.
