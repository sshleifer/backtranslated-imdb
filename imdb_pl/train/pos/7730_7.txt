If in the 90s you adapt a book written in the 1950s, set up a goddamn thing in the '50s, not in the' 90s. You see, 40-year-old customs and values ​​do not sound so good, or they call so real, far down the road. This is a simple rule that Hollywood habitually violates. And that's the problem with this movie. It should be set in the era in which it was written. One would think that it would be unintentional, but not. I will expand, but Bmacv's comment is quite good. I will limit my comment to Rachel Ward. It seems that for this role she dietitatively nourished her ass. As a result, she looks like she has chemotherapy and is as sexy as a gay leather sofa in resistance. I discovered that "I could die anytime" looks quite disturbing, and it significantly weakened her alleged "fever" and "sexual tension" that the film was supposed to create. Besides, the movie was pretty good; 7+ out of 10.
