I watched the two parts twice. He enjoyed this story and enjoyed seeing the older Patrick Swayze as a hero. He was very credible as a hunter for Alan Quartermaine and certainly defeated the performance of Richard Chamberlain. I admit that I would rather see someone else as "Lady in Distress". Alison Doody should stick to contemporary elements, not the era. She did not have the appearance of a woman from the nineteenth century. The rest of the cast was great and followed the threads very well. I am glad that the actors of this generation are not afraid to try different characters and are not afraid to be perceived as aging. Age is inevitable, but let us not hide from it. A man aged 50+ can be much more sexy (and Patrick is really sexy), and then green youth, no matter how pretty. Hoorah for the character line to go along with a big smile.
