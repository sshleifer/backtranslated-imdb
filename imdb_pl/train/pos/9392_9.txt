I came home late at night and turned on the television to see Siskel and Ebert summarizing their weekly election. I heard nothing about "Red Rock West" except for two thumbs and saw him before he disappeared. He will not stay in cinemas for a very long time because of the distributor's financial problems and lack of promotion, but they said he deserved better. <br /> <br /> Next afternoon, I followed their advice. They were right, it was the best fun I've ever had in movies. As some readers point out, there are a few holes in the storyline, and the last 10 minutes never end. But it's worth it, because it's a beautiful craft that lasted the first hour. This is the best role I've seen for Nicholas Cage, but almost everyone seems to be perfectly staffed. Dennis Hopper almost comes out, what's stupid, but it strengthens how well everything else works. Kits and music contribute a lot to almost every scene. <br /> <br /> When I rented it later for my family, it did not work either. The long scenes that built up the tension in the theater were hard to appreciate, with distractions at home. It deserves your full attention; turn off the phone, make sure you do not disturb, watch and listen to each scene, especially at the beginning.
