I think this movie will only work on people who have been turned off by the gigantic noise of the Lord of the Rings. So I was. And I really love this movie. I especially like the fact that all the unmistakable superheroes from WP are so perfectly and disrespectfully parodied. Apparently, he is the equivalent of Gandalf (a bold and wise and completely humorless wizard who knows everything): Almghandi, cowardice and a dead transvestite brain. The equivalent of Sauron ("Sauraus" from East Germany, of course) is wearing a simple bucket with eye holes as a helmet. Aragorns alter ego is another idiotic case that tries to repair your broken sword (legend "Ulrike") with adhesive tape. And "Strunzdumm" (equivalent to Wormtong) actually has some strong resemblance to Brad Dourif! And do not forget Grmpfli and Heidi ... huh-huh
