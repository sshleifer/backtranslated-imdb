Overall, the plot was much better than I expected. The path of laughter was sometimes annoying and often disturbed; but in this episode there were enough real chuckles to compensate. My biggest surprise was finding the best lines and situations that were not shown in the trailers. Especially Spade was not presented in the best light in previous promotions, but his character quite well gets into the pilot. There is enough sweetness to satisfy almost everyone, and all the usual characters seem to face the task ahead of them. Now, if writers can simply live up to what they started.
