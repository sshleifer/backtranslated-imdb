CAT SOUP is a short anime based on the legendary manga Nekojiru. He won the "Best Short Film" award at the 6th Fantasia Film Festival and also won the "Award of Excellence" at the Japanese Festival of Media Art. <br /> <br /> When the soul of the little Nyaako cat was stolen by Death, she and she, Nyatta's brother, embark on a bizarre journey to get him back. In the surrealistic scenery of Dream Side, they meet many fantastic characters and unusual, often disturbing adventures. <br /> <br /> CAT SOUP is an anime you've never seen before. It's Hello Kitty on acid! It is very original, stunningly beautiful and has an unusual sense of alienation and lyricism. CAT SOUP is very surreal (there is no dialogue) and sometimes cruel and bloody. So it is more anime for adults than children (they may not understand it at all!). A great trip for those who have the chance to see this absolute masterpiece. Must see!
