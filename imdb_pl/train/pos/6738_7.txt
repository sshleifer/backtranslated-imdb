Where The Sidewalk Ends is a pretty good crime movie and is well filmed in black and white and on the spot. <br /> <br /> Copper accidentally kills a guy suspected of murder and protecting himself, hides it and blames it for another person he does not like, who has committed many crimes in the past. But in the end he is the owner, but not before falling in love with a woman he meets, who is the lover of the person he killed ... <br /> <br /> The cast is Dana Andrews (While the City Sleeps, Curse of the Demon), Gene Tierney (Laura, The Ghost and Mrs Muir), Gary Merrill (Mysterious Island), Karl Malden (The Streets of San Francisco, Beyond the Posidon Adventure) and Craig Stevens (The Deadly Mantis). Good parts of all. <br /> <br /> Where the pavement ends, it's worth checking if you have a chance. Excellent. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
