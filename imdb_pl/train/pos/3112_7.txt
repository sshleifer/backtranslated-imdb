I looked at both Bourne Identity and Bourne Supremacy on DVD before watching it in the theater. I waited for it before they started filming. I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> Small spoilers below <br /> <br /> In general it was good, but also lacked the continuity of the first two. Identity and supremacy flowed with grace between the action of adrenaline and introspective drama. This movie was sometimes uncertain. The break time in creating the story was a bit too long. This caused the following action to feel too crazy. <br /> <br /> Camera: Speaking of madness, the trademark Greengrass trembling camera was present and very annoying to me. I know that I was talked about nausea on the bulletin board, but that does not mean it does not matter. All martial arts trainings, which the actors went through, were completely wasted. Funny camera cuts and a moving camera ruined most of the fights in the film. It is a cheap trick for the student director who makes the film restless. I would expect these techniques to be used in some horror movie for high school students, but not in this classic adult action series. Too many extreme close ups. Do a little framing. Get some interesting photos. Constant lazing seems to me a lazy drive to me. <br /> <br /> History: Initially, the story was VERY deceiving. They reject new names and faces on you. He gave me the feeling that you're getting into the movie late and you know that you missed some important information. I felt hasty or compressed for time reasons. After catching up, the story is quite good. It's a nice tracking trail along with Bourne. HOWEVER, I did NOT care for the entire last scene of Supremacy (Landy / Bourne on the phone) being in the middle of the Ultimatum thing. This makes the movie half-prequel. I thought it was awkward. <br /> <br /> Starring / characters: The star of the movie is action. Of course, only two originals remained. Bourne and Nicky Parsons. Their cooperation was strange to me. I think they just wanted to give Bourne someone to defend and confide. If I miss something completely, they will never even tell you why they joined forces. The other killers in the film were very calm. It was like Gilroy / Greengrass / whoever did not want to leave the open ends. Understandable but disappointing. Seriously, Damon with Clive Owen in Identity and Marton Csokas in Supremacy. These scenes were phenomenal. These killers are as uninteresting as Castel (the first Bourne fights in Identity). The staff was degraded in general as the series continued. Clive Owen was practically a reflection. This is the measure of strength for the first throw. Second, they basically exchange Chris Cooper for Joan Allen .... Not exactly equal. He mentions Brian Cox and Franka Potente for three actors, who were later named. Nothing against David Strathairn, Scott Glenn or Albert Finney, but these are not the names that come to mind in this series. In addition to a few pauses that seemed long, acting was in place. <br /> <br /> As a whole, it worked. I felt like they wanted to do a series. If they cut or moved the slower parts, they completely eliminated part of Scott Glenn, they minimized and took the camera from the victim of the attack, it would be perfect. <br /> <br /> FINAL SPOILER <br /> <br /> I do not understand why they leave Bourne alive at the end. I understood that it was an application. They referred clearly to the very beginning of the series with his immobile figure. I thought it would be like that. End of a full circle type. I liked Nicky by responding to the news report. <br /> <br /> WARNING OF SPOILER SPECIFICATIONS - FILE BELOW BELOW - <br /> <br /> Bourne's last line at the end of "Look at this. what makes you give. quoting the first killer he killed, I loved it. The last scene was great. (Except that Vosen {Strathairn} shot Bourne, why would he do it? Just revenge? If he was bad enough to murder, why not shoot Pamela Landy after faxing his secret file? .)
