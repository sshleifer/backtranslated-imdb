I saw it today with my 8-year-old. I thought it was sweet. I agree with the second poster that it is not something like a book that I remember, but we still liked it. All children are quite good and quite funny. Billy is a new kid who dares to eat 10 worms a day in a school bully. If he loses, he must go down the corridor in the school with worms in his trousers. The beginning of the movie is set to show that Billy has a VERY weak stomach and vomits almost everything. The fun results from several different ways of cooking worms. Good news about facing the persecutors and of course having a happy ending.
