Do you know how Star Trek fans gathered in all Star Trek movies, even the really bad ones? Why? See the heroes in action again. That's what I think about Doc Savage. I am a big fanatic of this character, and the prospect of seeing Doc and his crew in the adventure was overwhelming. And the first 20 minutes of the movie only heightened this feeling of expectation. Then they decided to collect elements from the Doctor's many adventures and throw them into this one film, resulting in a somewhat chaotic movie. There are many promises here, diluted by a series of unfortunate choices (music, "camp" elements, etc.). But the Doctor's spirit is there, and those of us who know Doc and his crew are responsible. So, on my long way, I try to say that this is not a bad movie: it's just not as good as it should be. And anyone who is a fan of Superman, James Bond, Indiana Jones, Buckaroo Banzai and many other characters should check this movie to get to know the hero who inspired them all.
