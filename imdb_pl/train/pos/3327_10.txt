I love and admire the Farrelly brothers! Why could I see this wonderful movie only 3 years after its release? It made me laugh, it made me cry and it warmed my heart. Big time. It's hard to describe in my rotten English - but I have to try it after all: <br /> <br /> The cast is great - from the main role to the supporting ones, the acting is great, the dialogues are great and the movie is perfectly directed and edited. <br /> <br /> I think Farrelly brothers films are often underestimated - they are not light comedies - they are deeeeeep! They talk about what's going on in life (I will not tell you!). <br /> <br /> In my case, this movie confirmed to me what kind of relationship it is: <br /> <br /> If you love someone: free them, let them be - try to share the passion and pain and always be to I'm faithful. <br /> <br /> I am not an athlete, but definitely an unconscious sport. But in this movie - vibrations attract you. I felt the smell of baseball. Finally, this movie explained to me what it could mean to be a sports fan and what nice fan families must be there. <br /> <br /> Thank you very much, Pete and Bob! <br /> <br /> PS: If you have not seen it yet - check out KINGPIN!
