I usually miss TV movies because of the many ways you know it's a five-second TV movie. This attention attracted my attention because of the unusual title and its grim, well-crafted mood from the very beginning. While the current rain has confirmed my suspicions about the wrong story (even if the claim that it is set in California, the film was largely filmed in a stormy Vancouver, California), dark and oppressive outside beautifully complement Olmos' perfect game.
