It is a comedy of morality, so sometimes there is a delicate touch of bitterness, but lightness soothes all sarcasm, and irony flows, until suddenly one moment will stop your heart and change everything. , wonderfully written and directed, it is a jewel that perfectly shines, with a beautiful action of everyone. Jean-Louis Trintignant is, as usual, excellent, and Romy Schneider is a pearl, perfect and shining, which can not be missed. A really great movie !!
