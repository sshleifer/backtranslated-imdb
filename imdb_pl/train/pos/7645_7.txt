Belushi in his most nosy and Courtney Cox, before Friends play a small role. I often think that Belushi is underestimated in Hollywood and this film role is one of his best. For those of you who watch his TV program, it is a very different and nice character. The film itself is not shaking the earth, nor is the message new, but rather sweet and endearing. Supporting the cast of familiar faces and unknown names is an ideal balance, though Lovitz's whine can be tiring, and Michael Caine's charming spiritual guide has a somewhat ominous, if not good, edge. Hamilton, because Belushi's wife is unfortunately two-dimensional and you wonder why he married her. In addition, Renee Russo is wasted and unconvincing in the "prom queen" who escaped. Nevertheless, a nice way to spend two hours.
