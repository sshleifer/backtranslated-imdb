Lion King 1 1/2 is a very fun and addictive continuation. Do not expect production values ​​of the cinema version, but expect the highest quality direct video version. <br /> <br /> It's set up because Timon and Pumba are starting to see the original Lion King in a darkened theater and suddenly change paths and start telling their story. This is done with frequent comedies. For example, at one particularly tense moment, a home shopping advertisement appears and worried Pumba realizes that he was sitting on the remote. These small moments make you sick and regardless of whether you consider them to be entertaining or not, it depends largely on the sense of humor. If you are particularly disturbed by movies that intentionally remind the viewer of a movie, it may not be your cup of tea. <br /> <br /> Animation is the best they have invested in the Disney DTV line, and is almost seamlessly integrated with the original material. Newer, independent material uses a lot of artistic style of the original. All voice talents are well done, although I could not resist the thoughts of Marge Simpson every time I heard Julie Kavner. <br /> <br /> Many jokes from the movie will be well recognized by viewers as processed for generations, but they are presented more with the knowledge of comfortable quirks of old friends than annoyingly repetitive. <br /> <br /> Music has made me realize how much I liked a good musical integrated with the Disney feature. The "Dig A Tunnel" finger opening function is well laid out and fun. The approach of Timon and Pumba to the opening sequence of the Lion King and their introduction to paradise are also amusing. The only problem was to repeat "Dig A Tunnel" at the end of the movie, change its lyrics and change from defeatism to uplifting. <br /> <br /> The plot line is quite well done, and the integration of new elements of the story is done almost perfectly, although the last piece during the pursued hyena gave the plot a bit of credibility. The new story seems to be failing well with saccharine or emotionally charged moments, and it does better when it resorts to full comedy. <br /> <br /> In general, it's worth buying. If you like all the bonus features that come with a typical 2-disc set, select them. For a penny pincher who is still willing to invest in a good movie, wait until he drops four or more dollars and borrow it at once. <br /> <br /> Damion Crowley.
