"The Shooter" was another kind of film for Michael Dudikoff. Although usually associated with action movies that include martial arts, this movie, because it was a western, allowed him to show that he is a much more capable actor than some lines of the story's formula allowed. <br /> <br /> The main problem is, of course, that the film does not allow for any solid character development. Fleshing is really left to the viewer. We can only guess at the sadness that Sagittarius, whose real name is Michael Atherton, the murderer who is - the killer, remember that a small town, terrorized by a local tyrant, welcomes you as a hero who can free it from his misery.
