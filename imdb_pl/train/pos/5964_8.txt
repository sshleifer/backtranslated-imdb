Being a fan of the movie genre, a child of the 80s and a fan of hard rock ... this film has a special place in my heart. It has everything you could want in a supernatural movie: action, great special effects (for 1986) and a rock-waving glam-rock soundtrack. Certainly it was a movie for all fans of heavy metal. I did not see it in the cinema, because it was never released theatrically here ... but its popularity on video in the mid-eighties gave it the status of worship and eventually led to (unfortunately, the average) DVD release in 2002. If you're not a fan of scary movies or rock music, it's probably not your cup of tea ... but, believe me, there are worse films of this kind ... and despite medium acting and some scandalously absurd situations, Trick or Treat is definitely wailing riff above ordinary horror. You will never look at your stereo again in the same way. Or maybe I should say an MP3 player? <br /> <br /> TRICK OR TREAT TRIVIA- Marc Price (Eddie) played Geeky Skippy Handelman on the popular comedy series "Family Ties". After a series of direct video clips, including "Little Devils" "Killer Tomatoes eat France" and "The Rescue", he resigned from the game to pursue a career in the stand-up comedy. Recently, he is considering the return of TV. <br /> <br /> Glen Morgan (Roger) is currently the main Hollywood producer / scriptwriter. He has written and produced several important films and TV series, including: "Outer space: above and beyond" "X files", "Ultimate goal", "Only" "Li Li", "Last goal 3". br /> <br /> Tony Fields (Sammi) began his career as a dancer in the television series "Solid Gold." He starred in several low-budget movies and TV shows, then landed in the role of devilish Sammi Curra in "Trick or Treat." Unfortunately, Tony died on February 27, 1995, of AIDS-related cancer. <br /> <br /> Doug Savant (Tim) is probably best remembered for his pioneering role of homosexual twenty-something Matt Fielding in the popular sitcom Melrose Place. Since then, he has a long and varied acting career, appearing in such films and television series as: "The One" "Godzilla" "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" and the short science fiction series of Joss Whedon "Firefly". Currently, he can be seen as Tom Scavo in the popular series "Desperate Housewives."
