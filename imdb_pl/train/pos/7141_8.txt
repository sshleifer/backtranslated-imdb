Since the death of Siskel and Ebert's absence, the show was left in the uncomfortable hands of Richard Roeper. Roeper is not a film critic, he just criticizes everything he does not like in person, i.e. Movies with country music are mastered, because "I do not like country music" and the films for children receive the standard "Do not look now, wait until it appears on DVD and borrow it for your children! "Roeper can be an idiot, but in another field. The weekly "sitting" of guests for Ebert is better, but who wants to choose a daisy among the cows? All this said that it is the only concert in the city and that only makes it worth watching. As for Roger Ebert, if Stephen Hawking can speak, then you too can! It's your mind and thoughts that we miss. Do everything necessary to make this usurper take his self-proclaimed throne.
