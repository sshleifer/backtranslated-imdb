FULL SPOILER. <br /> <br /> This is a fairly quick and pleasant crime thriller based on the art of Ira Levin with two homosexual playwrights (Caine and Reeve) who plot the murder of a wealthy wife (Cannon) to get real estate and insurance. The story goes well, but Christopher Reeve, as a younger and less talented of two writers, decides to play a real murder - with minor changes in detail. Reeve allows Eastampton, Long Island, for example, to become Southampton, Long Island. The rest of the story is a dead end and, to tell the truth, Reeve does not mind a little gossip or even investigation into the accidental death of Cannon. It will increase revenues and its own quotient of Warhol. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine is Sidney Bruhl, the creator of megabucks, whose last four productions have bombed and who would not like anything more than to calmly get back to work on a new game, perhaps with Reeve's contribution that would buy his reputation . He can not let Reeve's scandalous game be produced. So what else? - he's trying to murder him. In the end, they end up killing each other, the manuscript is appropriated by their neighbor, the psychic Helga Tensdoorp, and she earns a million dollars by selling it to Broadway. <br /> <br /> It's a lot of fun for many reasons. One of them is the production project. This multi-storey, multi-storey house with a huge windmill on top, located on the nine, which must be the most valuable acres on earth (Easthampton!), Would be a great set of excavations everywhere. You will not be able to afford a tent at Easthamptom. The house is not too big or baroque. It is simply wonderfully modest, although it is a bit clean for my tastes, a house that is so clean that you are afraid to enter the thick carpet for fear of leaving a footprint. <br /> <br /> Next, the action could not be improved. Caine, Cannon and Fred Jones are wonderful. Dyan Cannon gives a perfect performance as an anxious wife whose pants are so tight that they look as if they have been sprayed, which is okay considering her strengths. Even Reeve, whose talent was limited, seems to find a comfortable niche in the role of a polite but psychopathic murderer. Irene Worth, as the psychological neighbor of Helga, was somehow difficult to define, a mistake. I admit that she - or someone like her - was necessary for the plot, but, my God, what an insulting spy of her character, walking and saying: "I feel pain in zis woom!" I suppose that to make her a little more interesting, she got up in fluffs and a foolish hat with reflections on the bike. Nevertheless, it is cumbersome from the beginning to the end. <br /> <br /> You must love Ira Levin's weird dialogue. Despondent, Caine begs Reeve to tell him why he wrote the play "everything's okay". "Because it's YES, Sidney!" Says Reeve, and Caine yells: "It's TOP, not GAME! There is no play until a hole appears! "Caine's call to the police is also great after his wife died of horror as planned. He works in a stream of sobs, barely able to speak when he reports an incident and asks to immediately send an ambulance. When he hangs up the phone, his face takes on a mild expression, he drops his nose into a handkerchief and walks away, all business again. <br /> <br /> The climax, though ironic, is confusing and loud about artificiality, which lacked the bad charm that Levin and Lumet brought to earlier scenes. The score consists mainly of light riffs on the harpsichord, carefully matched to the film. <br /> <br /> You'll probably like it.
