The only other film except Soylent Green, which has such an atmosphere of hopelessness, is On the Beach. Both films deal with the consequences for the species and the planet against human cataclysms. On the beach with nuclear war and Soylent Green with environmental pollution of the planet. <br /> <br /> Maybe there is reason to be optimistic, because since 2007 we have not reached any of the worlds described in these films, and we already had them. New York still has around 8 million people, not 22 million by the end of the millennium, as described in Soylent Green. Environmentalists always welcome this film, showing the consequences of global warming. For me it also shows the course of the ethics of the right to life. Of course, there is no family planning in this world. <br /> <br /> Charlton Heston is a NYPD detective who lives with a room colleague, Edward G. Robinson, who is old enough to remember Earth before the catastrophe broke out. There was a murder, Joseph Cotten, executive director of Soylent Corporation, a multinational group that developed a food product, a wafer in many colors to feed the global population. His latest product is Soylent Green. <br /> <br /> The investigation shows that Charlton Heston gets his man, but also leads to frightening truths about the Soylent Corporation and the future of humanity. When Heston finally screams that Soylent Green is human, we've become a cannibal race, it's scary that there is no alternative. We have exhausted the planet and we must eat our dead to survive. <br /> <br /> It was a farewell performance of Edward G. Robinson, and in his memoirs Heston talked fiercely about Robinson, although they had different political views. A few weeks after Robinson wrapped the last scene of his screen, he agreed to euthanasia, he died in real life. Few of them did it, but Heston knew that Robinson was irrevocably and there were no actors involved in this last death scene between them. <br /> <br /> Although the schedule was off, this does not mean imagined by Soylent Green, it may not have taken place. We hope that we will have not only intelligence, but also a sense of common responsibility to avoid it.
