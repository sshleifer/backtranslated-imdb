For those who were interested in knowing how exactly humanity was locked in the big red pods that make me want a pomegranate, there is a duo of "Second Renaissance" shorts. I'm not quite sure why they are divided into two parts, especially since they are saved as one on DVD (and are these shorts viewed in any other format but DVD?), But they are informative, even if they have several arc. <br /> <br /> What really distinguishes the first part from the second and the other animations are the similarities between the creation of the robot and civil rights. Graphic worship of slavery, fascism, concentration camps and mass graves is mixed with verbal references to Marc Million Man and God's complex of mankind. In fact, these "shorts" never refer to "God", instead they are replaced by "Your own image of a man". <br /> <br /> When it comes to shorts, in "The second renaissance: part I" definitely the most effective in extracting emotions. It is a sad and disturbing look at the potential of humanity to become an "architect of his own destruction." Some of them may be excluded by some concepts, which are a short break directly from pre-established science fiction literature, but on the other hand, it's basically what most of the Matrix series did, and that was the driving force behind success. > <br /> --PolarisDiB
