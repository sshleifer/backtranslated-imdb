When I first saw Romeo's troops last spring, my first reaction was VERY GOOD! However, in future reviews I got a lot more than mastering film making. This photo has a unique voice that echoes in the history of the film. <br /> <br /> The initial installation is a great palette, which JP Sarro uses to establish his art on this canvas of entertainment. <br /> <br /> Sarro really uses the camera as his brush while he takes us on a ride that overwhelms the audience in an amazing action movie that goes beyond the traditional format we're used to and immerses deep into the dark subjects of betrayal, revenge and the importance of the company. This film is the dream of every director in its core. <br /> <br /> However, Sarro was not alone in this epic undertaking. The letter, provided by writer Tim Sheridan, was equally breathtaking. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was so precise and direct that it gave the actors such presence and charisma on the screen. Specifically, the last scene (WARNING: SPOILERS !!! SPOILERS !!!), in which Vanessa reveals himself as one of the coalition and the villain all the time, is written in such a dark tone that it is one of the most blood-curdling endings, that I've ever seen. Sheridan is another Robert Towne. <br /> <br /> In the last note, it is obvious that this production was not a small feat. <br /> <br /> That's also why producer Scott Shipley, who seems to have the creativity and genius to go alongside Jerry Bruckheimer. I have never before witnessed such a great production with such attention to every smallest detail. The producer's work is one of the hardest in any movie, and Shipley makes it look easy. <br /> <br /> In total, the film combines creative writing, stunning production and masterful direction. This is the art of the film at its best. When the end of the movie comes, the only thing we want is more. <br /> <br /> The Romeo Division is a breakthrough, a masterpiece and, most importantly, the Romeo Division is indeed an art.
