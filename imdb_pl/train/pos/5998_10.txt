The Cure is an amazing movie ... so tight and so TRUE! I was lucky that I managed to catch the show "The Cure" during the premiere in New York and it completely destroyed me! I also heard that he won the prize from this particular festival and he definitely deserved it. The first thing that struck me was cinematography. Eric Giovon has done an amazing job. The style of shooting a love scene in the middle of the movie was amazing. A love scene was necessary in this film, and Jafri was right, but he also kept a tasteful scene. Giovon and Jafri form an excellent creative team and should definitely cooperate on future projects. Judy Maier's narrative was so surreal, but at the same time striking my heart made me feel what the main character felt. I am a very hard critic, but I must say that The Cure is one of my favorite films. If you have not seen it yet, check it out!
