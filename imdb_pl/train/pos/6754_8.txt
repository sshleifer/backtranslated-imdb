Director Otto Preminger meets with his stars Laura Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney in this gruff and rumored film noir: Where The Sidewalk Ends. The film contains a well-written crime story with interesting characters, unexpected twists and clever dialogue and a pleasant look, great camera moves and dark and sharp film noir lighting. Dana Andrews acts as the detective of Mark Dixon, a partial gangster and a police officer who has a reputation for being too physically strong in relation to criminals. After one case sees Dixon in search of suspects and answers, he becomes much more involved than he would like. <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews is great in her role - hard and nervous, Andrews' Dixon is ready to knock anyone, even if he falls into the wrong side. He is a great anti-hero of the noir movie - he is not very nice all the time, but we still keep him. Gene Tierney does a solid job in his role, just as Dixon is. The role of Tierney may not be too great, but it certainly goes beyond what others could do with the role, throwing each member of the audience with his nice smile, gentleness and a twinkle in the eye. The supporting cast is not so bad either - Karl Malden is the most memorable, enters and gives a good supporting performance as Lieutenant Thomas. Where The Sidewalk Ends is not Laura, but it's a great movie noir full of great characters, stories and images.
