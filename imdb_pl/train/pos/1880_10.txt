Dudley Moore is fantastic in this great unknown class. This film is a very witty movie that relies heavily on the talent of the actors. Without Dudley Moore, John Gielgud, Liza Minnelli and several others, this movie could have been a disaster. It is not always well-made and sometimes has a very simple music that tries to force the mood ("psycho-like" music in a wedding battle), but the acting overcomes it. Arthur's character is funny with his drunken comments. But it develops well into a more mature, well-rounded figure because it learns to live by its own will. The end, however, is quite trivial. I will not give it back, but it can be improved. It's worth seeing many times.
