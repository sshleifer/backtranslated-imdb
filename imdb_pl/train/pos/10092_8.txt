The brilliant Elizabeth Taylor performs in this lesser-known classic as a young girl from London who falls in love with the owner of a tea plantation in British Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). Upon arrival, he immediately feels out of place and is forced to adapt to the new culture and be in constant awareness of a furious herd of elephants. William Dieterle, who also directed "Life with Emil Zola" and "Portrait Jennie", performs a masterful task in the form of a somewhat dark and almost amazing undertone of this romance, and the setting is one of the most beautiful I've seen with a black and white thematic residence and great scenery the island.
