This movie contains personalities that play their parts so great, I love the finale when no one knows what they're going to do with their lives, but it's great when you see and you realize that the priest is right, there's two of what other people do persons? The film covers you with new life, experiences, the ability to sleep with another person and achieve these dreams. It also shows you life itself, how difficult it is. But it gives you the opportunity to choose what you want and what you really need. I hope this comment works for you. The movie he did did well for me. By the way I bought a movie;) Watch out.
