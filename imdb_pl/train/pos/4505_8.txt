Eskimo is a serious film about the cultural gap between the indigenous population and the white man entering. Eskimo is a film made in a documentary style, seemingly unprofessional, but it is a talented production that contains a credible story that the audience will want to see until the last photo. behaviors about women and life than about whalers that obscure his landscape. When an Eskimo man loses a partner, it is natural that other men share their women with their friend. Usually, their women want to take the place of their missing spouse. All this seems natural in the context of deserted arctic predictions. Trusted Eskimos fall prey to unscrupulous white whalers (with heavy European accents) who do not consider these natives to be equal. Fraud, drunken orgies, rape and death happen after the Eskimos go to work on the icy seas. Ultimately, the leader Eskimo (Mala) realizes that he has been cheated and will take revenge. The audience would cheer in the theaters of the 1930s. <br /> <br /> Enter the Royal Canadian Horse Police and moral dilemma, or bring Malia to the trial. Mounties play as feeling policemen who know that this is not an ordinary matter. Will Mounties get a man? Is it fair to keep Mali in a code of conduct outside of his traditional society? Is there a way that does not punish Maly? Is it inevitable that the right of a white man must win? Is there hope for innocence? <br /> <br /> This is not a great movie, but one that you'll like in the depth of a problem raised in a completely different environment. I suspect that filming sequences with animals was done before today's relinquishment that none of them were injured while creating the movie - so watch out for the sequences of austere nature. Highly recommended.
