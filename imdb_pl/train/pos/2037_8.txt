Christopher Smith is an obvious fan of horror movies, which is clearly stated in his debut horror film "Creep". "Creep", though a bit loose in information, turns out to be worth a bloody classic. A little less shiny than the last American horror movies (remake of Amityville Horror, House of Wax remake) this dark and macabre story follows Kate (Frank Potente) through a maze of underground tunnels and unused railway lines, like her and many others along the way, try to escape the murderous attacker. Although some of the bad reviews have made this film, I really believe that with tight budget and British production from the first director of Smith, "Creep" really fulfills its name. It provides a fast pace of action more or less from the beginning, sometimes too fast, because in some areas the story is inconsistent, but with the perfect location and the best response to the character I have seen for some time, "Creep" provides a few scenes that are definitely nightmare.
