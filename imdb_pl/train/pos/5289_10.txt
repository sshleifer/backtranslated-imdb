John Waters created the most exciting, honest, dark, personal movie I've ever seen (well, maybe Fast Food Fast Women is in second place). they are personal and strange reflections of the family and their inner life ... in a tone that is never forced or stylistically superior. <br /> <br /> There is no pretentious design, ennui or magazine evaluation .... Martha Plimpton is amazing as a sister .. Eddie furlong is inspired by casting. Granny with Mary's conversation, tea packing, recycled clothing, yesterday's trash become today's art - and the lesson of the film is that the most important thing we can value is family ... and modest life.
