A very nice movie with a great background provided by the city of Boston and Fenway Park. As a baseball fan and addicted to light films, homerun hit me. Lots of laughter and lots of real baseball scenes with real footballers and real references to Bosox's past defeats. And how nice was it to watch a movie with a baseball motif, not to endure the exaggerated, exaggerated, selfish Kevin Costner who tried to rip the believers from the critical audience? Jimmy and Drew did a great job as a young couple in love with the jones of Jimmy Bosox. It was a bit crazy and out of the playing field, but there really are Sox fans who are fanatics and experience the fate of their beloved team. The film developed at a rapid pace, and the ending, though predictable, had the charm and sentimentality of many other popular movies, without being too pretentious. <br /> <br /> It was also pleasant to see Willie Garson return to the screen. I miss forever the popular "Stanford Blatch" from Sex & the City. It is always fun, even when doing or talking very little. <br /> <br /> Buy yourself two armchairs, popcorn and get ready for fun. "Fever Pitch" is the winner.
