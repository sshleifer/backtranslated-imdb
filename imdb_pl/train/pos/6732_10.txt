It was the best document I have ever seen !! I just saw Lords of Dogtown and wanted to learn more about Stacy Peralta, and I was surprised and happy that I learned that it was also one of his films. Stacy's great job! I went back to work last week, got bored with O * and ^% and this movie appeared. Growing up in Orange County in the 1980s, I surfed up and down the local beaches, just like my dad when he was a teenager. I grew up on the beach, my parents took me every weekend, I surfed, boogeyboarded, and then I moved out of there. This movie charmed me. It was before my time, but it was amazing to see what these guys had gone through. TRUE PIONEERS! This film is a collector's item.
