If you have any appreciation for character and dialogue and any sense of the history of American culture, in this movie you will find a lot of very absorbing materials. Probably it was originally a game and that is why it is difficult to dialogue, but I can not stress enough how these icons, which we only shallowly understand, are really complex and wonderful. the movie is better than any college course that tells you how to create a story based on characters. <br /> <br />
