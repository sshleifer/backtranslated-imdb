I really liked the detail that came up in the script. <br /> <br /> Jonathan Rhys Myers (mistakenly written) and Jewel were outstanding in their roles. Like Jeffery Wright. Toby McGuire did as good a performance as he ever did when he had to amputate the best friend's arm knowing he would die without a procedure. <br /> <br /> Attention to detail, with good dialing coaching to capture the southern accent very well. <br /> <br /> Why this movie was swept under the rug by Hollywood promoters that I can only imagine. I have strong suspicions. Which makes it more attractive to me. I have released over a dozen copies of DVD for gifts. <br /> <br /> Completely overlooked movie. Rent or buy and give him full attention for a few hours, then the judge.
