I've never seen the original Dirty Harry, I rated this movie on a clean tablet. And I must say that I liked it a lot. Sure, some of Sondre Locke's actors made me a little squeaky - but hey, it was the 80's. But even if you can not miss it (and I could hardly) or revenge (which seemed a bit ... exaggerated; P), it's only worth it for Dirty Harry. Or, at least, bull dog caressingly called "MeatHead": P <br /> <br /> 7/10.
