Hitchcock displays its already well-understood visualization in this early silent movie. The plot of the film, with the participation of two boxers fighting for a girl, is a simple drama with little to say. However, Hitchcock's talent can be found in his amazing use of images. Almost every shot is filled with visual symbols. Particularly memorable is jewelry, which one boxer gives the girl just before the wedding with the second boxer. He slides her on the shoulder in a clearly sexual manner and in one simple motion Hitch showed us everything we need to know. Boxing scenes are treated well with several interesting points of view, which again prove how far before his time Hitchcock was. The film also gives an insight into his subsequent treatment of women. The object of the boxers' desires is fueled by money and lust, not by reason or love. The only other women in the film are beautiful party girls who offer open sex offers or old crons that help destroy happy relationships. In conclusion, the Ring is a must for anyone interested in Hitchcock's early work and its development as a visual storyteller.
