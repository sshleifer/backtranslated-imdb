I just saw this movie after thirty-seven years. I was eleven years old and I caught this movement on South Beach in the long-gone Cinema Theater on Washington Avenue. In 1969, I thought where it is! he was a very good movie. Now, however, after almost forty years, he is not as good as he was. Times have changed, and this movie is now a tired old war between generations. However, he caught a place in time which is only a memory. It's really interesting to see fashion fashion, old Vegas, slim Don Rickles, chain smoking and hip-hop song. Acting was decent, the script was a bit outdated, but the memories were still fresh. Where it is, it may not be where it is for you, but for me it was still a pleasant and fun journey down memory.
