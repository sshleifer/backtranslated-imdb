As one IMDB reviewer pointed out, this movie starts a bit slower, but it gets much better over time. Yes, it is issued by Roger Corman, and yes, it goes through some of the same thematic areas as predecessors with a higher budget, such as FATAL ATTRACTION and POISON IVY. However, the combination of a wife's career as a rising blues singer with her husband's loneliness and his almost Freudian need to fill the emotional and physical "emptiness" or "hole" during her absence along with wise use of minimal effects and settings is nicely done. Using a very small number of locations and characters, as well as using water in almost every scene, both as a purifying and sinking metaphorical symbol throughout the film, this film, although clearly suffering from a small budget, reminds me in many ways about a fuller implementation and a newer scenario , namely the French film "SWIMMING POOL", which, it seems to me, at least could freely borrow some useful ideas from "UP AGAINST AMANDAIN". With a smaller set of tools, UP AGAINST AMANDA maintains tension with a rudimentary, fatalistic view of surrendering to occasional lusty temptations, but it achieves it as well or better as other films in this genre. The return of Amanda's abuse by his stepfather (again very Freudian) is also very unique in this genre and interesting. I agree with other viewers about the unexpected and benevolent response to Amanda's difficult situation in this aspect of the story. The cast is great, I think. <br /> <br />
