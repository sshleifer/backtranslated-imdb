This movie is amazing on many levels ... and none of them is the level at which it was supposed to be amazing. <br /> <br /> Remember: when you watch Shaun of the Dead and other recent zombie movies ... are they good or bad ... This is the formula they use. This is what makes zombie movies so great. <br /> <br /> And what makes them better is the story of the movie. A simple internet search will provide you with everything you need to know. <br /> <br /> In total, it does not remain. There is never a point where you think "walk, move" ... it moves quickly and nicely. It's a sporty, small Italian number of zombies. <br /> <br /> So horrible, it's wonderful! If your language spends a lot of time on the cheek ... borrow it, buy it, love it. <br /> <br /> As a curiosity notice: If you watch it on DVD, notice that there are sound effects on the menu screen, below the score ... Well ... it's because the music was picked up straight from the trailer ... which is probably the only working print of this music that still exists long enough to loop.
