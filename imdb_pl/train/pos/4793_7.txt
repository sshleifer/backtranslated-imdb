After watching this movie, I feel that I know a little more about the USA. David Lynch is synonymous with shocking values ​​and bizarreness due to its bizarreness, and indeed these elements are not lacking in The Straight Story. However, it is in the light that I have not seen before from Lynch. We start with a simple family living in a quiet life, but we end up on a row of absurdly interesting characters with depth in life, which can not be noticed after their introduction. Particularly moving was the bar scene with two WWII veterans who discussed events from fifty years ago and how they influenced their current lives and emotions. If you're looking for Wild at Heart or Dune, do not look here. But if you're looking for real people with real stories, this is a movie for you.
