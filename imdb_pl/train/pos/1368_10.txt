Fine. It has been a favorite since I was 14 years old. I admit that I do not watch it many times a year, but ... This is not a movie for the older generation who want a deeper meaning or some great message. This movie is funny. It's quite outdated, almost passe, but Parker Posey is so brilliant that it's unbelievable. If you want to be charmed by Tiffany's breakfast from the 90's, attend events from the 90's, or love Parker, this movie is for you. Otherwise, do not worry.
