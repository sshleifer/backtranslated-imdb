This movie is great. His return probably took place in the 1940s, and the heroine Meg Ryan tries to be known as "intelligent". Plus Tim Robbins is so sweet in this movie. Everything in this has a magical feeling. Every time I watch it, I feel happy. It's definitely a movie for girls, and I'm a girl, so I like it. I also love music. The violin is amazing. but otherwise I think it's a lovely story and everyone should watch it.
