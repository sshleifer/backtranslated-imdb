I still have grainy, late at night, no cable, cheap VHS of this series from waaaaaayyyy back, late night ads, and everything when I want to withstand every weird hour they might hit this show - I could just record it. <br /> <br /> The show was not really ABOUT THE COMPANY Freddy Kreuger - only the first couple of episodes actually involved him as anything other than the announcer Rod Serling-esquire. Instead, each episode was a clear nightmare, using the traditional horrors of horrific childhood, dates, cannibalism, dates, money, death, dates and ... well ... dating. <br /> <br /> From the episode in which a teenage boy accidentally says "I will love you forever" to the wrong girl and get stuck with her (literally, at least for a moment, grow together ...), to the one where young the stewardess goes home with a strange man, just to be in his cabin, where he has a room with trophies, full of other stewardesses, and one I only remember who compared blind dates with hockey (and injuries and punishments that are with this tie) - Dating was definitely the scariest item in the series. <br /> <br /> One episode had Jeffrey Combs (Re-Animator, etc.) as a motivated pizza seller with a tasty new secret ingredient. Not original but still scary and fun .... <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, some episodes were great. My personal favorite was "This unhappy life", in which a young man is imprisoned, working in a burgerian group of parents when he wants to go to college. You got stuck in a conversation with you and made small doll shows with old cheeseburgers - until late at night, when a strange guy goes through the passage and suddenly his life is not the same. No, not Freddy, just a bandit with a gun - it turns out that the whole staggering episode is just - the last thoughts that go through the child's head ... with the bullet. <br /> <br /> The second half of the same episode (many episodes of Freddie Nightmares are basically two inaccurately connected short stories) accompanied his girlfriend, who was also injured but did not die in the driveway and who was taken to the "heck hospital" "- they hammer into the most terrifying hospital cliches, and then some - from the accidental stitching of the mouth - or awakening during surgery - so that your dead boyfriend tries to lure you to the morgue for a small hug. /> <br /> Again it was my favorite. <br /> <br /> Some of the episodes were a lot dumber, as ALMOST EVERYTHING THAT WAS AVAILABLE ON VIDEO. They kicked out the bad ones as representative for the series, and then nobody likes them, thinks that the show stinks, and then they do not put more on the video. It's a Miserable Life is only available on PAL DVD in England - but I will still buy it.
