Artur is a rich middle-aged kid who drinks like a fish. Arthur does what he feels and says whatever comes to his mind. He likes to boast about his wealth and knows that he is a spoiled brat. He spends money on people he does not know and thinks everything is ridiculous. Arthur must marry a high-class girl to inherit a great fortune, but falls in love with poor waitress Lizie Minnelli (looks really strange). <br /> <br /> This is a damn funny movie. I watched this movie because the famous Indian film "Sharabee" is based on the character of Arthur. Although "Sharabee" is definitely inspired by "Arthur", I think it's two different films. "Arthur" is simply fun. Sometimes it is very trivial. There are so many fantastic liners in the film. This is not a laugh, but it has some fantastic moments. My favorite scene is meeting the artist with his fiance's father, who is still talking about the "elk". Duddley Moore certainly has some comic timing. He is very good at words and body language. I loved the scene where she talks to a couple sitting in a hotel with a "small" country, and he talks to her husband and wife in two different directions. John Gielgud received the Oscar for this film. I do not know this actor. I do not think he will do a great job, but maybe if I looked at his work more, I could agree in the future. The film has a few flat patches, but not too long. we're waiting for the sequel to continue.
