In the era of world depression in Prague, this is the story of an ambitious seller who falls in love with a mysterious woman with whom he exchanged romantic letters to discover that a mysterious woman is none other than a girl from his store who seems to be arguing with his colleague. Add some surprises (the owner is convinced that his favorite employee - Stewart - has an affair with the wife of the owner), leaving Stewart briefly "released", with the admission that the sales girl "liked" Stewart all the time, a happy ending is inevitable . <br /> <br /> Although VERY outdated (references to poverty and - I have a wife and two children to consider - they are overly used, along with an indication that many small objects of pleasure, such as a music box with cigars, unobtainable for ordinary people ), this movie is much more effective (and more credible) than the reissue "You Got Got Mail" from the 90s. In re-make with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, the real chances of a chain of events are so unbelievable that the viewer's intelligence is grossly offended. <br /> <br /> "Shop Around The Corner" is an innocent walk through the path of memory to the less complicated, less hectic and more romantic time and place known as the utopia of the novelist. Lovers of classic romantic comedies will like this picture!
