Very clever, very pre-training code and still very tricky. I highly recommend watching this movie, even if you're not a Stynwyck fan. She is funny, sexy, she works hard - and she loves what she does! <br /> <br /> Barbara Stynwyck is fantastic as a swimmer's doo that is being created in the world, perfectly portrayed by the bank's building. John Wayne (in a suit!) Plays one of her first conquests. <br /> <br /> The last three minutes are disappointed, but sets, lines, clothes all add up to one piece of the film about rising vertically in a horizontal position.
