This is the work of Neil Simon who has a lot of praise! "The Odd Couple" is a one of a kind jewel. You have Felix Ungar (Jack Lemmon); hypochondriac, a picky neat freak and a big spike in the side of his flatmate, Oscar Madison (Walter Matthau); total slob. These men, however, have a great job. Felix is ​​a news writer, and Oscar is a sports writer. Both men are divorced, Felix's wife is nearby, and Oscar is on the other side of the USA (West Coast). What can you say? Two men living together in one roof, without going crazy, are impossible and unbelievable. It's a lot of laughter and a lot of fun. I liked the part where the two British neighbors who talk to both men, and after Oscar dug Felix, are lucky and live with them when he refused to eat dinner with them the night before. It's time for Felix to brighten up. I guess all shrewd weirdies are brightening up. They can be picky, but they should also be patient. Very funny movie and classic nuevo. "Odd Couple" by Neil Simon is a classic movie. 5 STARS!
