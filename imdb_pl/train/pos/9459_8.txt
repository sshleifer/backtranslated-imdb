With some hesitation, I watch romantic comedies, because romantic comedies have old, clich√©s that make the film uninteresting. Usually in a romantic comedy there is a girl and there is a guy who falls in love, then gets in trouble, and then wins with troubles to get married. But this movie is a different story, very different from the romantic comedies I've seen lately. <br /> <br /> There is a widowed guy (Dan), there's a girl (Marie). Dan meets Marie in the bookstore and talks for some time, after some time Marie has to leave. Dan develops something for her, and when it starts to gain significance, we get a turn of action. Marie is his brother's girlfriend. Regardless of the circumstances, Dan flirts with Marie and realizes that he loves her, and even Marie loves him, but their love would not be possible. As much as possible, it creates the rest of the story. <br /> <br /> Steve Carell is doing well, Juliette Binoche is as good as Marie. And everything else is well made. It's a good movie, watch it.
