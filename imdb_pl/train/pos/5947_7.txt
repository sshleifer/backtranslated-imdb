50-year-old, this musical comedy fantasy may look her own age, but she wears it with dignity. <br /> <br /> This movie is still great fun. Crosby has never been a really romantic guide material, but he delivers the material with the hint of humor he needs. Bendix plays widely and is great fun in the part that appeals to its strengths. Hardwicke - how joyous for a knight of the realm - to throw himself into such whims with such abandonment. And Rhonda Fleming is enjoying the least impressive main roles. Only Murvyn Vye disappoints as unconvincing Merlin. <br /> <br /> Although it is not a musical, the songs are very good, and the "dance" routine that accompanies Busy Doing Nothing is perfect - fun, appropriate, clever, without challenges and making the virtue of Crosby's musical movement let's be honest, he was funny by nature, because he was never his greatest strength. <br /> <br /> The color is fine, the sound is a bit muddy in places. br /> <br /> And the story - well, there are some freedoms with the original, but I suspect Mr Clemens could have been happy with the result.
