I really like this program. I can easily see how he achieved the status of worship. It is original and provokes thinking. For some reason, however, I have never felt the resonance I could have. It is not a kind of open door, winter chill that could be obtained from such an amazing assumption. Every time I watch an episode, I think I'm poking and pushing him to answer some nameless, shapeless question. <br /> <br /> Before continuing, let me say this, saying that what follows is my opinion, and my only opinion. Different hits for different people. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see more scenes in American Gothic that were filmed at night. There is too much daylight in this program and I think it has a tendency to counteract the tension. In the end, we are not afraid of daylight. We are worried about what is in the shadow. The devil is not always in the details. What we do not see is often the most terrifying. <br /> <br /> Second - and this will probably lead to pitch and feathers: Gary Cole is an extremely talented actor ... character actor. I followed his career in The Brady Bunch, so it's hard for me to say that he was probably mistaken for Lucas Buck. It is almost too petroichan, too nice to be the embodiment of evil, even according to biblical standards. Lucas Buck is a drug. He is Heroin. He is free in the kitchen laboratory next to the Drain-O gallon. You are coming back, although you know that the end will be madness and death. He should be the highest loan shark. He is the creator of the book, but also of unspoken condemnation. Sure. You have money, and soon you will have broken fingers; the severed hand, the beheaded head, and finally the cursed soul. Turning to Buck is an act of desperation, and when it is nearby, there should be some immediate, ambient finality - with interest increasing daily - in the air. <br /> <br /> It's all generous, all the strings, and before you realize it, you'll know it's too late. <br /> <br /> Which leads me to three: they showed Buck too often. In fact, it is in most scenes, which could have caused it to lose its advantage. The sheriff would be like the mythology of the neighboring door. He is an apocryphal acquaintance. Many would know about him, but only a few really know him. It would be flashback and mysterious conversations, and the ideal person to deliver this story would be the deputy hero Nick Searcy presented. <br /> <br /> Four, the performance can be very independent venerable - to blame, some might say - and this is typical for whistling on "Meet me on the bow" in the pilot series. I think we've already determined that what Cassidy and Raimi were shooting at was anti-Andy Taylor. We probably did not need the concept provided to us by Fed Ex. I collected this in the first five minutes, so for me the piano on the head was unnecessary. <br /> <br /> These comments are about what, for me, would make a great concert a great one. I also understand that the producers had their own unique style and that there were many hands in the soup. In their eternal pursuit of programming LCD, the network played a role in the fall of the series. <br /> <br /> The least of the suits that they could do was to clean up the episodes. <Br> <br /> Stay real. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's a serious loss for fans of the genre as well as ordinary viewers.
