this movie was rather horrible The last Vipula Shaha movie was good, it was just bad, but it's a good story and it's great treated Aatish Kapadia, who adapted this movie from another Gujarati art "Avjo Wahala Fari Malishu", he did a good but slow pianist Two and a half hours of watching is a lot of disadvantages of this movie, but it is still an artistic song that is rather indistinct and does not work well, but it is still good, and not the movie you are watching with enthusiasm, it's still a story to get attention and good if you're a type of relationship a pretty good movie with lots of flaws and humor that you do not even need, even a little bit
