An old saying says, "If you think you have problems, visit the hospital." It has been updated in recent years to "If you think you're having problems, watch a TV show ... especially Jerry Springer!" This movie is one of those that is so bad that it's good! That's why I gave him seven - everything is fine, but not great. It's a great way to waste 95 minutes, just like a daily talk show is advertised as the "hour of your life you will never come back to!" All known topics are here ... unfaithful husbands / guys, the wildest audience on TV, women flashing Jerry ego etc. Shockingly watched Molly Hagan, who normally plays sweet characters ("Seinfeld" and "Herman's Head") trailer-trash mom and Jaime Pressly ("My Name Is Earl") as her equally tacky daughter, doing sexual favors for almost everyone the man they came across. Men (including the staff maker) were portrayed as the quintessential lunkheads who deserved what they got. I do not want to mess up or reveal everything, but the movie plays like a daily program. Here in Phoenix, every morning is shown for two hours, and then everything else seems wrong. I give it seven again ... it's good, but not great. Jerry Springer is best taken in small one-hour doses.
