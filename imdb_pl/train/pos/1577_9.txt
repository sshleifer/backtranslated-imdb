INTERIOR SPOILERS. <br /> <br /> It looks like von Trotta was much more relaxed about the balance of personal history and events than in the previous Versprechen movie, Das (1995). <Br /> <br /> The direction seemed to be carefully controlled, and visually I felt that it was very appealing - especially where it was about visual narrative (the title sequence is combined with the lighting of a new candle in modern times commemorating the death of various characters in the past ). <br /> <br /> To explain two issues, many people were confused by: <br /> <br /> First, Lena did not sleep with Goebbels. Although it may have seemed presumed, it was not the intention. Von Trotta told me that! (By the way, she's a very nice lady!) <br /> <br /> Secondly, the time frames of events were in fact historically accurate (real dates are shown at the close-up of the monument) and the prisoners were released as suddenly as in the movie . There is evidence that Goebbels was irritated by the fact that he did, and planned to finally recover those he had released. <br /> <br /> In general, the biggest impression on me was that it was an original story from many ages "exaggerated". It is a pity that for so long (for various reasons) the film hit our screens. <br /> <br /> More of the same, Margarethe!
