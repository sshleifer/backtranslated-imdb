Young Mr.Lincoln is a poetic, beautiful film that captures the myth of one of the most respected figures in American history. Henry Fonda had a difficult task of presenting a mythical figure, and at the same time made him human enough for people to care for him. Perhaps the best game of actors. See how he stops the rope rabble. Alice Brady is fantastic as a simple farmer. the negative thing I can say about this movie. Most characters from the judge to the viewer receive so many funny, humorous lines that distract attention from the serious test that is at hand. . Additional parts of Ward Bond and Donald Meek are very good.
