I recently acquired this one of my favorite DVD movies and as usual, while watching everything, it dispelled me. <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of Hazel O'Connor and the soundtrack for this movie has me in tears, especially the song "Will You". It is a pure nostalgic journey to my youth. This gives the second place in the Quadrophenii ranking (in which Phil Daniels also played). <br /> <br /> A great soundtrack and a great view of the UK in the thatcherickish years of the grim 80s in which I grew up. The ending is so sad, for many hours after the end of the movie I am like a crazy child. <br /> <br /> I expect to use this DVD after repeated viewing, I can watch it over and over again and never get bored, just for the soundtrack itself. <br /> <br /> Hazel, I'm sorry I heard about your dad, honey. God bless you. xx
