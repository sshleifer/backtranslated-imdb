It would be a classic fire if they chose ALMOST EVERY BODY for John Abraham. This guy is a terrible actor. Is it comedy, drama, tears, etc. He stinks. It seemed that at some point Priyadarshan realized this and almost told him to jump like a monkey to make his solo scenes a bit funny. <br /> <br /> This is the only noticeable flaw (there are a few more annoying bits) ABSOLUTELY a funny movie. The best comedy in Bollywood from Hungama, IMO. Like Hungama, it is a situational comedy transferred to the arms of the genius script and of course Akshay Kumar. It's probably his best performance so far. It is better to be the shoe for the best comedian at every reward function. AK has always been good in comedy, but he moves it to another level. Body language, facial expressions and the way it supplies every line. It's a brilliant performance. The packed theater is raging for almost the entire length of the movie and I do not think I've ever seen such an atmosphere in the Bollywood movie in the US. <br /> <br /> Garam Masala does not have one "leading" heroine. He performs in 3 incredibly hot and beautiful girls, which I thought was a good job. Pretty sure everyone makes their debut. Paresh Rawal is as solid as usual, although his routine disappears after some time. Rajpal Yadav is his typical irritating "I" (ill for his top performance in each film). Rimi Sen has nothing to do. <br /> <br /> In general, definitely worth the dekho. I would say it's FUNNIER than No Entry, and that says a lot. It could have been even better if they chose someone more competent than John Abraham. <br /> <br /> 8/10
