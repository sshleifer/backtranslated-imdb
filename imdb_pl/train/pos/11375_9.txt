This film tells an amazing story with history and compassion. From the detailed descriptions of crime scenes to the mental health of the main investigator, you will be delighted. This is absolutely necessary for anyone who is interested in criminology. Interpol's relationships and the way the agencies work together are also great. I did not do it too much. I also recommend it to all those interested in the history of Russia. How the police work with a political party that is what it was ... It's really fascinating and frustrating. The settings are beautiful. It's been some time since I saw this movie for the first time. It does not diminish its impact. Not overly dramatic or graphic, it leaves enough imagination, well, you will see.
