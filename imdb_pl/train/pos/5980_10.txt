First of all, it's really my favorite movie. I do not have to give a description to anyone, because every hole does it. I am literally obsessed with this virtually bloodless, bad, bad effect with "boom-stick showing", a badly edited, metal masterpiece from the 80s. The director (I heard) hoped for a hit at the box office, so he could do sequels and have a FREDDY / JASON offer. Shit, I wish it could have been that way! Hitting the soundtrack. Good acting ... CHECK THIS MOFO OUT. and all die-hard fans, feel free to email and chat at times. Midgetorgy .... I can be in YAHOO.
