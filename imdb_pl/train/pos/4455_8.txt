Although I liked On the Town better, I really liked it. I am a new guest when it comes to Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly. Although I have heard about them, I have never seen anything in them before. The first one I saw was Singin in the Rain, which made me a Gene fan. I think it is also better. But I thought that this movie is good and like all movies there are some parts that are better than others, but in my book it's a great movie and I love it. Frank and Gene form a good team. I have to see them together in me. Take me to the ball game. But I stick to my guns, saying that I really liked it and that I love it!
