I was going to give him 8 points, but because you humans got 6.5 of the better votes, I had to increase my contribution. The Styx River was a pure genius. Sure, Woody was his eternal thing, but at least his role was right. The first half hour was really fun, and then the rest of the movie was easy to watch. The dialogue was clever enough and tricks with Woody's cards at parties, along with the reaction from the upper crust, were pleasant to watch. It was much better than what the press critics said. And a plus, a little Sorcerer's Apprentice to come to terms with. And of course you noticed that Johansen is getting a little grumpy? Charles Dance is always fun, like Hugh Jackman.
