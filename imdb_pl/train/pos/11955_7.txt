Let yourself be transferred to another, old type of story. Scoop is classic Woody Allen. <br /> <br /> The latest muse by Allen, Scarlett Johansson (who also appeared in Match Point last year, also Allen), is surprisingly able to tone up her sensual figure of a sexy kitten and transform into a normal looking student with the help of bizarre glasses and outfits, but still does not make the audience believe how the imperious figure of Hugh Jackman can be so delighted with her, given the royal origin (do not worry, there are no spoilers here). There are no big changes here for Johansson, because he consistently plays the same character despite the scenario speaking differently. You forgive even the seeming lack of logic of her heroine, continuing affair with a suspicious serial killer, simply because he is His Royal Fever Jackman who is refreshed to see the sans of the Wolverine duds. <br /> <br /> If anything, consistency is what 70-year-old Allen is all about. He continues to tell his stories about celluloid in the same way as always; as if he was never exposed to modern movie making, which probably makes his quiet, simple films attractive. They never aspire to a specific market; as if Allen made films for himself, regardless of whether the audience liked it or not.
