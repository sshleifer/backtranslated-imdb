I know, I know: it's childish. But I just love this type of film. A bird that suffered many "mishaps" and still did not lose faith in humanity and sense of humor. What's special about this movie is that the main character is Paulie - the parrot - and it is not used as an impulse for a hot actor man. In addition, I like the plot: Paulie tells his life story of a cleaner when he hit the bottom. (By the way: Jay Mohr's voice sounds almost like Joe Pesci's voice!). And Cheech Marin, of course, a man is humor to me. Ever since I saw "Up in Smoke", I appreciate his naive way of playing, making the simple situation funny ... I can not resist.
