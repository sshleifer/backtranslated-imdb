My favorite movie of all time. Oscar-caliberal piece for everyone involved, both before and after the camera. The screenplay is perfect and establishes a relationship between Lady Caroline and George Briggs in a completely satisfying way, unlike the novel. The care with which other major characters have been outlined is a tribute to screenwriter Peter Barnes, and the intense visual beauty should gain Oscars for the director Mike Newell and the operator Rex Maidment. This is definitely the best job of Josie Lawrence and changed my opinion about Joan Plowright. After watching the movie at least 50 times I do not find any fault in it. Music by the famous composer Richard Rodney Bennet is a miracle.
