It's a good job. A very sexy and engaging conspiracy to keep my interest in the whole text. His main drawback is that it appeared to have been made for television: Full screen and although there were several sex scenes, there was absolutely no nakedness (but boy did it close!). Strange, because Netflix shows that it was rated as R. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, very exciting, and I would like Alicia Silverstone to do more such films. <br /> <br /> One Netflix reviewer stated that he was part of the series, but I was unable to find out which series it was. I would like to know, however, because this movie was SO good. <br /> <br /> Walt D in LV. 8/23/2005
