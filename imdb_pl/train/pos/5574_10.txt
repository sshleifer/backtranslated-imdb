Peter M. Cohen has a winning satire in a mating game, wrapped around and turned to the left. The critical impact of the film in the main media publications as "offensive" and "lewd" serves only to emphasize its intensity as a refreshing and concentrated section of sex people and passions. This is the tradition of what I call the satire "based on reality", following in the footsteps of "In The Company of Men", "Chasing Amy", "Your Friends and Neighbors" and "Two Girls and a Guy". Cohen's dialogue is hilarious and it still intrigued me how well he captured the true pace of today's talks. Brian Van Holt, Zorie Barber and Jonathan Abrahams are three separate, inexorable predators with an obsession with sex, which together with the foil of their newly married friend (splendidly played by Judah Domke) are turned over on their own by a female predator (Amanda Peet). A romantic comedy is lurking beneath the surface of the satire, much more satisfying than most studio products covered with sugar.
