So often when adapting Stephen King you simply get a collection of characters reciting dialogue from books. It really captures the heart of the book. Maybe because they do NOT use large chunks of text straight from the book, but it's a bit more of an improvisation of events in history. Miko Hughes is a big part of his success as a small Gage. Dale Midkiff and Denise "Tasha Yar" Crosby really behave like his parents. There is a scene in which Louis hugs Gage and they are very natural together. Fred Gwynne is WONDERFUL. Perfectly nailing Maine, without falling into a parody, it is wise and warm, just like Jud. (8 out of 10)
