This is the best movie I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> Maybe it's because I live only a few miles from the village where history took place, and I know how it all works in this area in Sweden. The movie tells the truth, believe me! Both criticize and honor the Dalarna lifestyle, and the producer wants people who watch the movie to be more open and care for their closest friends and relatives. <br /> <br /> But if you live in another small village anywhere in Sweden (or other country), you'll probably recognize a lot of this movie. <br /> <br /> Thank you Maria Blom!
