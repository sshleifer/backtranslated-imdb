It's great how this movie drags you. I had sincere laughter. Do not worry about the low budget, because it works for me. Honestly, my wife did not really want to do it, but she prefers a different kind of film. She admitted, however, that she was very creative and well connected and probably on a string. Those characters whose lives are weird and worried give me something that I can come across in my own world. Just go and be who you are. Dreams are what you create with them. Watching this movie for the second and third time, I realized that there are some hidden moments that passed through me for the first time. What can I say, I like my fun with a certain complexity. In any case, I liked it. I hope to see more.
