To be honest, this movie has passed over most of its critics. <br /> <br /> The opposite of being lost (lost) is salvation (saving), and this film is one of the few that will cope with these two concepts. The film also examines the love and disappointments that accompany the father-son relationship. At the outset, it should be noted that none of them is currently a fashionable subject. <br /> <br /> The idea is that the moving fathers, the hit Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) and his crime boss John Rooney (Paul Newman), love their sons and do their best to protect them. But Rooney's son, Connor, is even more annoyed than the rest. He kills one of Rooney's loyal soldiers to hide his theft from his father. When Connor finds out that Sullivan's son, Michael, was a witness, he accidentally kills the other son of Sullivan (and Sullivan's wife), trying to silence the witnesses. <br /> <br /> Sullivan decides that he wants to get revenge at any price, even at a terribly high price of perdition. Rooney, who in one scene curses the day when Connor was born, refuses to give his son Connor Sullivan and hires a contract killer named Maguire (Jude Law) to kill Sullivan and his son. Rooney joins his son Connor on the road to perdition. <br /> <br /> For the rest of the movie, along with his son Michael, who survived, Sullivan chases Connor Rooney on the path to perdition, and Maguire chases Sullivan. When Sullivan confronts Rooney in the church basement and demands that he give up Connor, because Connor murdered his family, Rooney says: "Michael, there are only murderers in this room, ... and there is only one guarantee, none of us will see Heaven. "As the film ends, in a certain sense predictably, one character is saved and one character regrets. <br /> <br /> I'm not a big fan of Tom Hanks, but he takes a step back to play convincingly Sullivan, giving subtle and laconic performance, Newman copes well with the old Irish gangster Rooney, showing his hard face and manner, in the eyes of Connor's evil deeds, Jude Law plays in a terrifying way in Maguire, Tyler Hoechlin plays naturally and emotionally young Michaela. <br /> <br /> The pictures were still reflecting the light from the darkness, reflecting the themes of salvation and perdition.The camera drew from the palette of green and gray. to the fathers and urban landscapes of the Illinois depression era. The Greens belonged to the younger sons and rural plains of this state. The lush, voiced and haunted music of Thomas Newman had a weak Irish undertone and was played in arrangements similar to Copland. The sets were authentic, west-west factories, churches. The houses shone with shiny woodwork. <br /> <br /> The perfection of this film is about creating a unique feeling thanks to its deep themes, the characteristic acting game and surrounding music and cinematography. The only downside was that the y script came with a light message against the gun, the only tribute to political correctness. <br /> <br /> I give this film 10 out of 10; in time, it will be considered a great movie.
