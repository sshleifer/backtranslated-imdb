One of the joys of receiving the latest collection of Bela Lugosi is to see stunning movies such as The Invisible Ray. Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi combine in a film that delves into meteorites and radiation, while science is completely absurd (especially the Karloff camera technique, like Janos Rukh, uses a meteorite to determine the place) and even ridiculous did not care about the lease, because the film is very pleasant. The effects are well done on time, the game is great and the finish is particularly strong. It reminds me of comic sci-fi novels and novels from the 1940s and 1950s, with ray guns and funny science. You must watch this movie!
