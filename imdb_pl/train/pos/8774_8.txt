At the end of the nineteenth century, San Francisco, the poor well-dressed Errol Flynn (as James J. Corbett) works in a bank and likes to participate in local "fights" (boxing) with colleague and buddy Jack Carson (as Walter Lowrie). One day, the pretty Alexis Smith (as Victoria Ware) enters the "Comstock Bank" where Mr. Flynn works. Flynn is so busy with the elegant beauty of Mrs. Smith that she offers her a bag with a suction hood. Smith is secretly taken as a handsome Flynn, but is discouraged by his insolence. <br /> <br /> Flynn's good deed (actually an attempt to pick up) gives him a free membership in the snobbish "Olympic Club", which comfortably includes a gym (with boxing equipment). However, Flynn's arrogant manner and practical jokes (tickling men in the handrails) irritate members of the "Club". When the English boxing champion visits the club, the members try to force Flynn to fight the man. They hope that Flynn will give up, humiliated by defeat - but Flynn wins! <br /> <br /> The first producer, Robert Buckner, creates a cool package for Warner Brothers and director Raoul Walsh. Mr. Buckner certainly basked in the success of his contribution (script) to the brilliant Yankee Doodle Dandy studio. Unfortunately, this story is ridiculous. He was "Gentleman Jim" - this story is supposedly filming the true autobiography of James J. Corbett, "The Roar of the Crowd" - but this film must be significantly fictionalized. <br/> <br /> Flynn is a very attractive leading person; he maneuvered the script slightly and should have been recognized in the early forties as a great actor. Many of Flynn's features were (are?) Omitted as great performances, and this is one of them. Smith deals well with feminine interest, deftly communicating emotions to the viewer. Director Walsh makes stupidity look smooth and extravagant. The supporting cast is a treasure trove, from the noisy Alan Hale (like Pat Corbett) to the walking Lon McCallister ("Paging Mr. Corbett"). <br /> <br /> ******** Gentleman Jim (1942) Raoul Walsh ~ Errol Flynn, Alexis Smith, Alan Hale
