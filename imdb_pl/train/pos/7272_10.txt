Before I start, let me tell you how special this special music is GREAT when playing Sonic Adventure and DX: Director's Cut at the same time (especially at the Red Mountain level). So while watching this unique show, I suggest ... no, YOU WILL NEED you to do it. <br /> <br /> Carlos Mencia takes to the extreme in San Francisco, California. There he laughs at everyone, absolutely NOT apologizing. <br /> <br /> I am very grateful to God that Carlos did not do his thing in which he uses the same joke over and over and over again. He does a great job, laughing at everyone and at the same time being honest about it; I know a few times that I said, after Carlos said a joke: "Damn, this guy is a good point!" And then the Game Over screen appeared on the TV screen because I forgot I was playing Sonic Adventure I DX: Director's Cut. My bad :) So yes, there is nothing to complain about this unique performance. If you have TiVo or something like that, do yourself a favor and record this historic hour.
