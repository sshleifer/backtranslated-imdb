I sincerely hope that at least the first Cosby season will be released on DVD one day. The episode of Charlie's fantastic genius brother, George (played by the late Roscoe Lee Browne), is a classic merriment. It reflects the classic rivalry between siblings and love between brothers whose lives took different paths, but both ended up happy. <br /> <br /> Mr. Cosby and Mrs. Rashad have wonderfully recreated the chemistry that they shared in The Cosby Show for many years and to put them in the role of the middle class, they show the dimensions that they can take as artists. <br /> <br /> List of comedy dynamites ... Madeline Kahn, Phylicia Rashad and Mr. Cosby ... classic genius!
