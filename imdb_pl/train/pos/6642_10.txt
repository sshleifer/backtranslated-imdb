All films made before 1912. They really have to be watched with a sense of time and place. <br /> <br /> In 1894, men from the Lumiere family [father: Antoine (1840-1911), sons: Auguste and Louis] owned and managed a factory producing photographic plates and paper. Not a small enterprise; The factory employed over 200 employees who received pensions and social benefits - innovative at that time. He was on Montplaisir in the suburbs of Lyon in France. What made Louis Lumiere interested in the construction of Cinematography in 1894 remains open to speculation. My suggestion is that the appearance of the Edison Kinetoscope organization (Peep-Show machine) in Paris in the autumn of 1894 provided the catalyst. <br /> <br /> W.K.L. Dickson, from Edison's team, invented a film camera with the size of a vertical grand piano, which was patented in February 1893. It was electrically controlled (using energy from heavy batteries.) This massive machine pumped a celluloid film strip (newly developed by Eastman) ahead of the lens at about 40 frames per second (fps), which was placed as an almost motionless object in "Black Maria" (essentially the first film studio.) The Kinetescope machines showed stage presentations (less than a minute) that were shot in this studio. <br /> <br /> In 1894, Louis Lumiere followed the task of inventing a camera with a moving image: celluloid film, durability of seeing the human eye / brain would allow the perception of normal movement, its camera, called cinematograph, had the size of a large shoebox and was equipped with a detachable movie magazine that provided storage space To shoot a sufficient amount of film shoot for about a minute, when it was already set outside the lens at 16 frames per second. <br /> <br /> The size and light weight of the camera (it can be turned into a printer or projector by adding a light source) made it portable enough to be taken anywhere to record an event (provided that there was enough sunlight). In spring 1895, Louis shot a horse trick of some cavalry soldiers; a house in the fire with firemen arriving and pouring the absorbed building with water; and many other scenes in Lyon and the surrounding area. Using a Molteni bulb, he turned the camera into a projector and presented his films to the scientists gathered in the reception room of the Revue Generales des Science. The images were displayed on a screen five meters away from the lens. The screen stretched in the door between the two rooms. In the same year, at a meeting of professional photographers, Louis photographed arriving delegates and showed them the movies of their arrival the same evening. <br /> <br /> With appreciation from both academia and photography, Louis decided to have a public exhibition of his invention by the end of the year. Since each of his films would have been about a minute, he would need at least a dozen films to make a good presentation. For one of these films, he set up his camera at the entrance to the factory, photographing the output of employees during the cessation of smoking. <br /> <br /> The public place chosen by Antoine - who offered himself as "barker fairground" on Cinematograph - was Salon Indien from Grand Cafe on the Boulevard of Capucines in Paris. It was a winter Saturday night on December 28, 1895. When the first audience sat down, they were presented with a view from outside the Lumiere factory (with closed gates). Some were worried that they would see a routine slide show from Lumiere's photos. But then the rotation of the camera / projector was rotated and movement started. Louis had an innate sense of making movies. This movie has a beginning, middle and end. At the beginning, the doors are opened and people start leaving the workplace; inside, people come out - many try to ignore the camera and the cameraman because they seem to be happy, leaving behind a day's work. At the end, the gates to the factory are closed. <br /> <br /> And this was the first movie intended for general entertainment.
