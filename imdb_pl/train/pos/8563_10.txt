The film follows the events of the novel "Cel mai iubit dintre pamanteni" (they can be translated as "The most beloved among people"), written by Marina Preda (a very controversial book and movie), a novel that became something like a Bible or Hamlet's story, very popular and difficult to acquire, due to satirical content over the communist regime. He represents the drama of an intellectual, humanist, in the "red" world. A movie full of passion, fear, sexuality, all the wonderful ingredients of a great movie recipe. One of the greatest Romanian films, despite its psychological order (after all, it is a European film).
