First, I read the great Pearl S Buck novel in my ninth-grade history and enjoyed every one of its exciting pages. It was almost inevitable that Hollywood would take care of it, and given that it was created in 1937, the results are excellent. <br /> <br /> Some things have to be accepted: in 1937. There was no question of throwing Asia actors in a big Hollywood movie. In a sense, it makes the end product more interesting than if they were able to use a more genuinely-looking cast. <br /> <br /> With this obstacle to overcome, executive producer Irving Thalberg and director Sidney Franklin (among others) have taken the trouble to choose a great and stellar cast. Paul Muni plays Wang Lunga. Muni was at the peak of his strength as an actor during this period and could almost play everything he focused on. When you pass the make-up (it's good, but no one will confuse him with the Chinese), his performance has all the true loyalty of his best work. <br /> <br /> Then there's Luise Rainer. Leaving the Oscar, who won last year for his role in THE GREAT ZIEGFELD, the star of the Vienna actress grew and got the plum role of O-lan despite his lack of experience in Hollywood. Her performance was won by her second in a row Oscar, the first time in history that happened. <br /> <br /> Rainer's many achievements have been achieved and her Oscar win here. It was called a wooden one and one note. There is a small grain of truth in this. However, let's say, all you have to do is go back to the book. Rainer, though not a Chinese man, played O-LAN as Buck wrote it; it's really a great performance and one of the best screen transfers I've ever witnessed. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the cast, it was MGM. They had the biggest number of Hollywood stars and actors at the time, as well as a big budget to pay for the best, and finally got the best. <br /> <br /> The film soothes the marriage of Wang Lung with O-lan a bit. In the novel, wealth arises from the lusts of the body and takes on a concubine, a movement that destroys his wife, but her feelings as an ordinary woman do not concern him. In the film, the contrite Wang Lung returns to his wife on his deathbed two pearls, which he took from her years earlier, realizing that he is his true love. <br /> <br /> Old, yes. But this is Hollywood. Considering the obstacles they were struggling with, the movie could open up to shouts of laughter. But despite the notable lack of real Asians in the cast, this movie has been amazingly successful over the course of seventy-three years. In fact, the most amazing thing about this movie is how good it is when it can easily be a disaster.
