The whole does not even approach the sum of the parts. No problem. In this film, there will be a composition of some of the most diverse creators of our time and some really famous names in the cast. Segments are invented around the same theme "Love in Paris", but the similarity ends. Actually, considering that the approach to the subject of all these different directors has so many forms, it's amazing that we can even feel that we're still watching the same movie. No great effort has been made to transform it into a whole. This buffet has so many great ingredients, I'm glad that nobody tried them all in one dish.
