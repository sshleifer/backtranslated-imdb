I'll give it to you ... this movie is amazing. foreign gay movies are so fast that they surpass American gay movies with their acting quality and story. While many American indie gay movies are grainy, evil sounds, amateur acting, trivial plot lines and a surprising lack of nudity or erotica, top-quality foreign gay movies appear like those from France. cinematography is beautiful, thoughtful, meaningful. the story is adult and complex (but it is not difficult for everyone), the acting is intense and professional. both runs are fantastic, as is the entire cast. boys are more than just handsome and there is plenty of nakedness. you follow these boys all year long, from their meeting to the end. all the small nuances of the relationship, the details of going in and out of love are beautifully made there. it made me want more. Check it out!
