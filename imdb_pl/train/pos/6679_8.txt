Sorry for this movie: there are a lot, too many wide-angle close ups, and if you irritate you over endurance, that's enough. For the first ten minutes they rode the ME barmy. But then I made a kind of truce with terrible cinematography; and long before the end of the movie, I stopped worrying about it. It's too rich a comedy that can be easily destroyed. This funny, witty, comic delivery of ALL cast is flawless, and no matter how much weher gazes at his heroes through the cold lens from the fish-eye - HE can not care for them - he manages to present them with warmth. "Mysterious men" are in fact not only more fun, not only smarter, but also deeper than anyone seemed to consider to be. For example, jokes in Austin Powers movies, as well as less fun than jokes here, are also much more toothless. The satire "Mystery Men" bites when there is something worth biting and bites gently when it is gone. He does not mock old things. Therefore, contrary to what some (I must consider unworthy), critics have said, there will never be any ideas. <br /> <br /> The "super" characters are an attractive group. Of course, they are secondary, but they are not just second rates. Blue Rajah, for example, does nothing, just throws cutlery and is not good at it. On the other hand, he is not comically angry either. He is better in his limited field than most people and he trains diligently. He is not a buffoon, which makes him a much more fun hero than he would be. If Superman is the Christ in the cape, the Mystery People are all the lesser demigods from the foothills of Mount Olympus, in capes. Much more fun; also much more endearing.
