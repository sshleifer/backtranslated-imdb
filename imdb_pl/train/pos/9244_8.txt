If you just read the storyline, this movie would sound like a typical 1930s. This story seems quite imaginary, the subject of maudlin. The strength and beauty of this film lies in the direct, earthy performances of the cast. I rarely saw Jean Harlow show such a range of feelings, the rich and subtle nuance of her face. If you observe their faces during the wedding ceremony in the chapel, the depth of feeling is so obvious between the main characters. Strict emotions are so honestly presented, so true. The final sequence is almost unbearably moving: when Clark Gable looks down with such joy and surprise on his son, he picks him up and proudly says, "My child!", I could not resist remembering that his son was born posthumously. This is one of the best examples of the cinema of the era of depression.
