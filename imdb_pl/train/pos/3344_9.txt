I went to see my mother at Fever Pitch and I can say that we both loved it. It was not a typical romantic comedy in which someone is looking for others, and blah blah ... You did not wait for a climatic first kiss or a meeting. It was more real because you saw them in a relationship, not the whole movie about getting together. People could actually refer to a movie because it did not look like extraordinary circumstances or impossible situations. It was really fun and I think it was the best performance of Jimmy Fallon. All in all ... I definitely recommend it!
