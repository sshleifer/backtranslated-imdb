Man, I really like the new DVD released by Universal. I've never seen THE SENTINEL look so good because I had to put up with bad, grainy VHS tapes for years. Unfortunately, apart from the trailer, there are no additives that would look worse on wear. AND AVOID DVD Goodtimes at all costs. It sucks. <br /> <br /> In any case, the restless model Alison Parker (Cristina Raines) moves to the haunted NYC brownstone, only that it is more than just haunted. It is also a portal to hell, and the Vatican maintains an old blind priest (John Carradine) who will watch over him and make sure that devils and archangels do not escape. <br /> <br /> It has an all-star cast full of old actors such as Ava Gardner, Arthur Kennedy, Jose Ferrer, etc., as well as scenes from upcoming stars from the 80s, including Christopher Walken, Jeff Goldblum has been mysteriously exaggerated ) and Tom Berenger. And you will not even recognize Jerry Orbach from LAW & ORDER. I had to do twice when I was not exactly where I saw him. <br /> <br /> Nice scenes from Alison cut the eye and nose of the rotting corpse of the dead father who was possessed by the devil. And there is a neat ending in which distorted, deformed people try to persecute Alison to commit suicide, so there will be another who will guard the portal. It looks like Alison's restless past makes her the main candidate of the Vatican for another sentry. <br /> <br /> A great, terrifying classic from the 1970s by Michael Winner, which can not be missed. I also recommend it to those who want something more imaginative than the ordinary stupid teenager and comedy of horror. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 <br /> <br /> -
