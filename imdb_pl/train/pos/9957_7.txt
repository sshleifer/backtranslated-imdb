This video is shockingly unappreciated in IMDb. Like many movies, this is not Shawshank. But it's pretty good if you can predict a dance competition / personal growth film. If you want to spend an hour and a half looking at something like 8 Miles for a female stepper dancer, I think you will like it. <br /> <br /> Judging by the IMDb ratings, I suppose that this movie was approaching the top 250 and was "bombed" with many 1s, as it happens with so many films that do not concern the mob, do not have special effects or contain non-white or non-simple characters. br /> <br /> It's an American movie, but it's not an American movie. The signals presented mainly in Toronto are subtle, and some viewers may think that this is completely in the US, because the final competition takes place in the border city of Detroit. <br /> <br /> I liked music. I liked dancing (but not convinced it is worth $ 50,000 ... but what do I know). The characters were easy in the eyes. <br /> <br /> I agree that the title sucks. I do not remember anyone in the movie saying these words and should have "s". (No, this is not a foreign language). <br /> <br /> There is not too much hatred in this film (and let's be honest, vote for 1 means you hated it), so I can only assume that it's an expression of hatred for people who live in it, and it is sad.
