This is not a film about an artistic home, it is mainstream entertainment. <br /> <br /> Many beautiful people, t & a and action. I find it very funny. This is not meant to be intellectually stimulating, it's a nice movie to watch! Jesse and Chace are also funny, which is just sauce. It is definitely worth renting. <br /> <br /> In summary, I recommend checking it for a small Friday night entertainment with boys, and even with your girlfriend (if he likes other girls to get it!) <br /> <br /> Blacks are good too . Vinnie, Corey Large, hatter from Heroes. Very nasty villain.
