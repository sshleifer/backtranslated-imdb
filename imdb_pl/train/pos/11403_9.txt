Gene Kelly came up with some really great ideas for musicals from MGM. Here he is at the top of his creative abilities working with the music unit of Arthur Freed. It's hard to believe when you see an American in Paris that players never left the back of MGM. <br /> <br /> The magic of "An American In Paris" is the result of a creative edition under the leadership of Vincent Minnelli and sets that MGM designed in conjunction with certain undercoats. The idea for the film came from Kelly, who just wanted to make a movie with a long ballet sequence with George Gershwin's poem "American in Paris". It sounded good to Arthur Freed, who turned to Ira Gershwin, who spoke well with him, as long as they used other Gershwin material. <br /> <br /> Gershwin got a deal for Gershwin's music, which Irving Berlin usually got. There is not a single note of non-Gershwin music in An American in Paris. Listen to background music and you'll hear things like Embraceable You and But Not For Me that are not real music numbers. <br /> <br /> Another guy who wrote lyrics honestly, Alan Jay Lerner, wrote a story that is thin. Everything about the former GI played by Gene Kelly, who never left France after World War II, just settled in the apartment on the left bank and became a hungry artist. He lives with an eccentric composer Oscar Levant and whether it sounds like redundancy. <br /> <br /> Two women are interested in him. Another American emigrant, played by Nina Foch, who wants to sponsor him as a painter, if he reciprocates in other matters. But Kelly falls in love with a girl from the shop Leslie Caron plays in her film debut. Caron is also interested in the star of the musical comedy Georges Guetary. <br /> <br /> Of course, the plot is just an excuse to sing and dance to George Gershwin's music. The American in Paris is the first movie I have ever seen as a movie on the flight during the first journey by plane. I remember coming back from Phoenix Arizona to the Kennedy airport, seeing Gene Kelly do "Got Got Rhythm." My favorite number in the film is Tra-La-La, which Kelly sings and dances around the apartment, and Oscar Levant plays the piano. At some point, Kelly dances on the children's piano. <br /> <br /> In the book about Arthur Freed, I read a quote in which he said that in the American sequence of Parisian ballet is to be made against the background of French impressionists, who in their view would prefer the audience, not a realistic setting on the streets or behind. So it happened. Kelly made long ballet sequences in Words and Music, The Pirate and On the Town. But this was their crowning. I still think that this includes some of Gene Kelly's later films. <br /> <br /> In the unexpected nervousness at the Oscars, the American in Paris was chosen the best image for 1951, defeating a favored streetcar called Pragnienie. My guess is that fantasy this year prevailed realism. Big budgets also have an advantage in these matters. <br /> <br /> Still an American in Paris is one of the best film musicals ever made, and because studios no longer have all creative talents under one roof, something less likely to be repeated.
