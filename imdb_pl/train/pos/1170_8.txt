Night Of The Living Homeless is a funny parody of the movie "Dawn Of The Dead" from 1978 (and the remake of 2004). Only this time ... with the homeless. they can not understand why. They treat homeless people like zombies who want to change, and some parents go to the roof of a supermarket like in a movie. So now the boys have to find out where they come from and how it is a rather funny episode with some good moments, such as boys singing their own version of the song 2pac / Dr.Dre "California Love". Generally a good episode. <br /> <br /> 8/10
