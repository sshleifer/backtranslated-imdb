the only word that sums up this movie is bizarre. it is a carefree persecution through the existential concept. bouncy (more than one) and a little nutty. I would not call it a great and unforgettable cinema and it does not seem as memorable as the first director's movie "cube", but it's a good fluff to watch on a Sunday morning. acting is changing from a respectable to annoying, but I believe that this is how it was supposed to be written. made as a serious movie, maybe he would be great or very good in pretension. a little like a "matrix" meets with "head" and "human nature". <br /> <br /> 6.8 out of 10
