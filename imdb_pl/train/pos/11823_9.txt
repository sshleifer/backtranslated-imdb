I really liked the fact that I managed to get the personality of Dick Tracy. It is a well-made product that used modern technology to create a comic story from an era filled with images. If you're a fan or recently watched some of Dick Tracy B & W's old movies, you will definitely use this version. Pastel colors and larger-than-life figures rendered in a meticulously authentic view of a bygone era are entertainment as it was meant to be. Personally, I think that the musical element of Madonna is the main part of this film - the album with her music from this film is often listened to for years, it is simply so well made and performed musically and tuned to this era. In my opinion, Madonna's best moment both on the screen and especially musically. It will certainly bring you a "child".
