It could have been better if someone with more experience led it. Shumlin did not do a bad job, but it's not a great work of film art. <br /> <br /> However, this is a beautiful movie. I loved it because it was shown by local channels. Graham Greene is one of my favorite writers of the last century. Very bad films were made of his novels and stories. (Many love "The Fallen Idol", but I'm not among them, I think I saw "Brighton Rock" many years ago and I liked it, but maybe I just think with pleasure about this novel.) Charles Boyer is not like being seems Spanish. But it seems that he has the perfect temperament for this character - tired, distrustful, caring. Lauren Bacall is attractive as a British girl who falls in love with him. But the best are the best: Katina Paxinou is excellent. Her performance is a small Grand Guignol, but I attribute it to the director. Peter Lorre, whom we meet for the first time when he gives Boyer a lesson in Esperanto in a universal language, is perfect - as always. <br /> <br /> And Wanda Hendrix can break the most difficult heart. Appears as a prematurely early teenager. The character wants to be helpful. She does what she can. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie very much. Not without reservations. Booking is mainly about being a bit stiff. But history and acting can not be better.
