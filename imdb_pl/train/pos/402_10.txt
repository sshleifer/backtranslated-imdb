Earlier I saw Zu: Warriors from the Magic Mountain. In this video, the setting takes place in the Chinese mountains, and Legend of Zu looks like another dimension !! Thank you for the extensive use of CGI effects by Tsui Hark. It is able to present its vision of mountains hovering above the clouds, a land where beings fly freely, and powers from razor-sharp wings, split swords and a super cool Moon Moon. many characters in this one, mainly focused on King Sky and Enigma. There is the romance aspect, although the film seems much darker than its predecessor. Cecilia Cheung is beautiful, and her presence on the screen makes it worth watching this movie. At first, I like it, as the Countess recalls (with Zu Warriors) and plays Enigma well when it deals with his past life. By the way, I mentioned that Cecilia is very attractive to the eye? <br /> <br /> In fact, Zu Warriors had more comedic elements, and his special effects were limited due to time in 1983. it moves it to a whole new level and sets a new standard in the cinema.
