Ben Thomas (Smith) plays an IRS agent who practically gives the shop a surprise. What is this IRS agent? <br /> <br /> Most of us have heard a line from the IRS agent: "Hi, I'm from the IRS. I'm here to help. "Our smile goes into a giggle that says," Yes, good. "<br /> <br /> As you move on in this story, you can not come up with this guy. He goes easily to those who are controlled. What is its motive? Is he from another planet, an angel, a rich guy who wants to do well? It helps so much that we want him to be our auditor, if of course we are audited. Hey, IRS, are you listening? (joking, joking) <br /> <br /> The pace of the movie is excellent and so much that the tips were ignored, which would tell me what is really going on. Intense, intense, he was focused on Ben and stays there. The whole movie only works because of Ben, when we try to figure him out and I have not seen any clues (what are you talking about, Willis?). Not reading this box before watching a DVD movie was a better way to get here. At the end of the movie, I finally connected it all. Well, it was obvious. And yes, this is beyond, but still a great story, mainly because of Will Smith. <br /> <br /> Will Smith should have been nominated for the Best Actor award. The rest of the cast was also very good. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's over and despite the great game and when you finally get all the answers, you have to realize that the message of the movie is wrong. What is this message? Believe me, you will not need too many tips to understand this. I did not do it. <br /> <br /> Violence: No. Sex: Yes, but nothing excites. Bland. Nudity: No. Language: No.
