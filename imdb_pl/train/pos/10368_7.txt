Meryl Streep was amazing in this movie. He has an amazing talent for accents and generally shows incredible skills in this movie. I really felt at her when Lindy was persecuted. She also played realistically. It became broken, upset and unpleasant because the media and government continued their constant witch hunt. Initially, I did not expect much after the film, but I really got interested in it, and the film is based on a real person and real events. It turned out that it is better than I expected. Neill himself was also outstanding; this is the best job I've seen in him, and I really liked him in other movies (for example The Piano). I gave the film 7, but if I could only judge acting, I would give it a 9.5 and a perfect 10 for Streep.
