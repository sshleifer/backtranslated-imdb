I saw this "movie" for the first time. When I was 11 years old, I was more interested in music and dance. As I grew older, I became more interested in acting. While the first half is just a retrospective of Michael's career (from Jackson 5 to "Bad"), watching was still fun. The "Badder" sequence could have been omitted, although the children were quite good. "Speed ​​Demon" and "Leave Me Alone" were fun, especially when the policeman says to Michael, "I need your autograph here," after stopping him to dance in the zone without dancing. But this "Smooth Criminal" is the icing on the cake. Joe Pesci did a great job as a toughie (and the hair was wild). The dance is perfect, as are the special effects. The only thing I could do without spiders. Any Michael fan should see this if you have not already done so. I give him 10+!
