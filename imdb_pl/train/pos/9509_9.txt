Wow, this movie was absolutely brilliant. I really do not know why everyone is saying that he has slow pace. I thought the tempo was perfect. The film tells about Michael Sullivan played by Tom Hanks with perfection, which is a kind of hit killer working for John Rooney (Paul Newman). He does not like this job, but he does it because Rooney paid for his home and helps him financially. He had nothing, and Mr. Rooney gave him everything. But his children do not realize that it is his job, and when someone is witnessing a murder in cold blood, he is placed in an awkward situation. And when it comes to cruelty, he goes away with his son and wants to take revenge. They make abank and much more and build a bond. It's the perfect team. Hanks does a great job as always, as well as Jude Law, who plays his terrifying role to perfection. This drama is highly recommended because it shows a beautiful story and shows how the 1930s looked.
