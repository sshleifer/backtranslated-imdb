Something is happening with Sondra Pransky when he enters the magician's box on the London theater stage. Sondra does not know much that the spirit of the recently deceased journalist Joe Strombel materialized to ask her to investigate a man who was told to him during his journey to another dimension, is the infamous killer of the Tarot who plays in London. The only problem is that the accused is, just in case, a respectable man from a higher class. <br /> <br /> When Sondra tells his experience of the Great Splendini, who is aka Sid Waterman, the magician is stunned but decides to move on. Both would be P.I.s. they call the club, in which Peter Lyman goes swimming. Sondra, who pretends to be drowning, attracts the attention of the handsome who wants to see her more. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, they will both have fun in various funny situations, until the secret reveals themselves at the end of the movie. A real Tarot killer thinks he can not fool a reasonable Sondra who proves he's more resourceful than what he deserves. <br /> <br /> The result is the perfect summer movie with lots of laughter, which is just what you need to get out of the heat in a cool time in a cool theater. Woody Allen was doing better, and yet this sunny comedy will defend him for his previous failures. In "Scoop" Mr. Allen broke out of the romantic role of leading his wonderful leading lady. His gesturing trademark is something that this funny man will never get rid of because he seems to be his trademark. The film has some fun inserts that will not attract viewers. <br /> <br /> Scarlett Johansson, the beautiful star of "Scoop", seems to be the perfect foil for Woody Allen. She plays the simple part while Mr. Allen makes his combination, the perfect combination. Both are excellent in their bantering throughout the film. Mrs. Johansson is a knock-out beauty in her red bathing suit, although she dressed her in the costume most of the costumes she wears on the screen. Hugh Jackman is seen as Peter Lyman, a sophisticated man with a city of appropriate pedigree. He performs well in the movie as a man chasing Mrs. Johansson. Ian McShane plays the dead journalist Fleet Street on his way to eternity. <br /> <br /> "Scoop" is a light film for hot and humid summer thanks to Woody Allen.
