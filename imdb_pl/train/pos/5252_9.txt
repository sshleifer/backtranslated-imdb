When I heard about this movie, it was supposed to be the funniest thing I've ever seen. Yes, it was fun. I mean, I liked everything until the end, where ........... oh no, I can not tell you that. It's funny, except. Bad language. That's why I say that if you like movies that are sexually fun, watch them, but if you do not, do not waste money on renting or buying.
