You know, Robin Williams, God bless him, he's always on his feet with all the stupid comedies he made in this decade (perhaps with the exception of "Death To Smoochy" which bombed when she left, but now a cult classic). The dramas he recently performed were fantastic, especially "Insomnia" and "Picture of one hour". "The Night Listener", despite average reviews and the rapid release of the DVD, is one of his best works, period. <br /> <br /> It's a very chilling story, even though it does not include a serial killer or anyone physically dangerous. The concept of the film is based on the actual case of fraud, which has not yet been officially confirmed. In high school, I read the autobiography of a child named Anthony Godby Johnson, who suffered horrific abuse and eventually as a result of AIDS. This story moved me until I read the online reports that Johnson may not exist. When I saw this movie, the confused feelings that Robin Williams presented so well appeared in my head. <br /> <br /> Toni Collette probably also provided her with the best dramatic performance as ultimately the sociopathic "caretaker". Her role was far from those she had in films such as "Little Miss Sunshine". There were even moments when she looked at the camera, where I thought she was looking at me. To play such a role, a good actress is needed, and this modest (but well-rated) role makes Toni Collette probably one of the best actresses of this generation who has not even been nominated for an Oscar (since 2008). It is amazing that there is at least one woman in this world who is so and that is also terrifying. <br /> <br /> It's a good dark movie that I highly recommend. Be prepared, however, that you will be restless because this movie leaves you with a strange feeling at the end.
