It's always sad when movies "on the margins" like this one are overlooked by most filmmakers. Panic is a wonderfully fascinating and poignant study of a character who feels trapped in the futility of his own life. <br /> <br /> William H. Macy, like Alex, is as convincing as ever. This wonderful actor seems to have a special talent for pulling the heart, no matter how mistaken his characters may be; we do not always tolerate the characters' lives that we play, but the emotions that fear and disorientation bring to us are often too painfully familiar. The title "Panic" seems initially paradoxical, given the lack of overt emotions. At one point, Alex tells the doctor that he is rarely nervous. However, with the development of this story, it becomes more and more obvious that rage and desperation, not indifference, are the driving force of this man's existence. <br /> <br /> More than once I remembered his performance in "Fargo", another film based on a strong character. Both in "Fargo" and in "Panic" we are witnessing a middle-aged man who somehow seems to be out of synch with the rest of his life. He lost his way, and the only way back deceptively appears to be darkness. He knows that he makes bad choices, but desperation overpowers self-control and common sense. <br /> <br /> Alex joins Sarah, a 23-year-old woman (mesmerizingly played by Neve Campbell), who comes to the doctor's office. The subject of this relationship is a smaller coincidence, more a work of destiny. Alex finds some comfort with Sarah, perhaps sensing that she is a friend on a tramp, just like him, someone who has lost his way and travels aimlessly for the rest of his life, waiting helplessly for his inevitable conclusion. <br /> <br /> By choosing these videos, Neve Campbell is a clever and convincing way to respond to critics who question her acting abilities. Too often the heroes she played are weakness, not giving Campbell the depth that would allow her to stretch her muscles. This performance can, however, be an opportunity for many to open their eyes. <br /> <br /> In an ideal movie world, there would not only be more films like "Panic" but they would also reach them and be appreciated by a much wider audience. If you are watching movies because of the richness and depth of the make-up, not just the latest special effects, for you Panic is indisputable. A +.
