I saw it on TV so long ago that I do not remember when it was, but it still stands out as one of the scariest, most disturbing movies I've ever seen. There is simultaneously a subtle, but intense fear caused by a black woman lurking at the edge of the frame, not very clearly visible, so you feel (like a hero-attorney) uncertain whether it is just your imagination or not. It's also one of the few films that really made me scared to watch. "Production values" should be hung, good films tell about the director's ability to create atmosphere using film, actors, places / scenes, music, attention to detail and ... imagination. A real gem.
