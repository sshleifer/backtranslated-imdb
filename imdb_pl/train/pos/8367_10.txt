after watching this wonderful movie, over 100 times I still find new things that dispel me with this film, great special effects, amazing acting and a plot full of ingenious twists and turns makes this movie a perfect image of capitalism versus communism, and at the end everyone is happy and everything is in okay. the best movie ever !!!
