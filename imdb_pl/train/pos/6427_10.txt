If you are in the mood for fun ... and you just want to relax and enjoy ... Bade Miyan Chote Miyan is one of the movies to watch. Amitabh started quite well ... but Govinda is stealing the show from his hands ... amazing timing and good dialogue ... inspired by Bad Boys ... but he has Indian Masala. .. people think it can be confusing and stupid ... but the fact that David Dhavan is the director and Govinda works ... should not ask any questions .... other recommended movies in the same genre (David Dhavan / Govinda combo) ... are Shola Aur Shabnam, Aankhen, Raja Babu, Saajan Chale Sasural, Deewana Mastana, Collie no. 1, Jodi no. 1, Hero No. 1, Haseena Manjayegi, Ek Aur Ek Gyarah.
