I have never heard of this book, nor have I read it, but a movie that I will probably see many times. <br /> <br /> This movie is unforgettable with perhaps the richest picture I've ever seen in a movie. It was like watching images many times, which I thought was an idea. <br /> <br /> A great movie, history, actors and photos. Full of deep emotions from every angle. Although I do not like romantic films, I loved it and I was very moved by Winona Ryder's request to her father at the end. <br /> <br /> Mr. Irons deserved the award for his performance, and Close was never better. <br /> <br />
