Robert Taylor as a crazy buffalo hunter Charlie Gilson is the main character of this movie. At first, I thought Charlie would end up buying himself like John Wayne in The Searchers or James Stewart in The Naked Spur. But as the film goes on, Gilson is doing more and more atrocities until you realize he has no hope for him. Stewart Granger is Sandy McKenzie, who wants to stop hunting because he realizes that the buffalo will soon disappear and he is disgusted with the act of killing. Gilson is a natural killer who does not distinguish between animals or people. Debra Paget as an Indian girl is a surprising figure, taking into account the censorship imposed at that time. He completely gives up Gilson, though he hates him. The final scene of the frozen Gilson is unforgettable.
