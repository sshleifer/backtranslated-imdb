Could this more romantic comedies be as cleverly made as this? I never thought that something as mundane as selling a music box could get me excited. Margaret Sullavan creates a great saleswoman, and she and James Stewart always brought with them the best. This film is a sport which in my opinion is the most winning performance of Frank Morgan, and the "Wizard of the Oz" and "Tortilla Flat" says a lot under his passion. The way he finds a Christmas partner left me with pleasure. Director Ernst Lubitsch might have thought that "Trouble In Paradise" is his favorite, but this must certainly be considered a triumph. With one of the smartest dialogues of American films of the 1930s, he has to offer.
