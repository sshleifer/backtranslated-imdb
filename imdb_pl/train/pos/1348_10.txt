Thank you for Martin Scorsese and his love for movies. <br /> <br /> It's the perfect introduction to the mind of the most talented American artist working at the cinema today and I could not recommend him more. I was fascinated by this whole thing and you too will be. Just rest and let him take you on a journey through his world, you will love it.
