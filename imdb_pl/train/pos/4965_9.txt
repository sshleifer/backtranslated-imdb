Michael Caine's narrative is suitably impartial and calm. This story does not apply to individual World Cup games; it is rather about the emotions of players and the beauty of the event itself. <br /> <br /> Exciting games like France v Brazil (one of the biggest games of all time) have been covered in the same spirit.
