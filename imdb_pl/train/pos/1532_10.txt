This, like Murder She Wrote, is one of those shows that after a stressful day at school I sit in front of the TV and watch. Why? Because I really like it and it's a pity that it is not in the air anymore. Dick Van Dyke is amazing as Dr. Mark Sloan, a doctor-detective who solves murders with his son. He is joined by a largely unknown but very competent cast, namely his real son Barry Van Dyke. Victoria Rowell is also good, but I've noticed that every series changes her hairstyle. I also liked Scott Baio and Charlie Schlatter, but I especially loved Michael Tucci as Norman and I was surprised how he suddenly disappeared. This program is so funny, with great guest stars, sometimes it's obvious, like Colombo, but in every episode there is always something that can laugh. In conclusion, a great series, with two thumbs and 10/10. Bethany Cox
