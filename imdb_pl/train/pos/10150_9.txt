Sure, this movie is unhealthy, sweet and full of stereotypes, but it's fun and I watch movies. For entertainment. Natasha Henstridge is stunning, even with short hair. Her smile is radiant and her beauty can not be hidden. As for Michael Vartan, I'm sure women love him. They both seemed to really like eacb in this movie. I do not understand the comments that there was no chemistry between them. I think we see what we want to see. <br /> <br /> Olivia d'Abo and Michael Rigoli enjoyed themselves, even if the British accent D'Abo crept into her alleged speech at the Bronx. In fact, I did not really notice it until I read these comments, but I came back to DVD, and now her dialogue sounds more British than American to me, but it was perfect for my role with one exception. <br /> <br /> This is a story about two nice people who marry significant others, but who find their soul mates in each other. This may be an unbelievable story, but who says that movies are supposed to be like documentaries? It is no more unrealistic than any of the dramas shown every hour on the lamp. That is why we watch them to escape from everyday life for a short time and enter the world of characters on the screen. I thought these actors did a good job with it, but hey, I'm a sentimental guy who can tear easily. Do not get me wrong, it must be a sentimental scene, and this movie had many such. <br /> <br /> It gives me only 9/10, because I am saving on this 10/10 but invisible super great movie, which, as I know, will come one day. If you see that it's being advertised as coming on a movie channel or Lifetime Movies, or anything else, make a note to view it. I think you like it.
