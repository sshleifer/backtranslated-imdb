Fate / Stay Night is an animated series inspired by the game h-game. Somehow the producers turned away from this, making it a successful series without any h-thing. It could not have been otherwise because character development is great, as it is depicted in this series, and any change of this can only ruin perfection (you will understand when you see all the episodes). <Br /> <br /> Despite the relatively slow start (the producer devoted time to the presentation of heroes) things get pace fast and soon after the middle of the series the action becomes so intense that it sticks to your place. <br /> <br /> The theme of the series focuses on the Holy Grail war that has been taking place in the city of Fukuky for 50 years. The pilot actually starts from the end of the previous war and develops from that moment. Shiro is the only survivor of the fire that began during the last battle and seized a large part of the city. Reluctant to witness a fight between two servants who launches his Reiju (holy sign) to summon one of the most powerful battle minions, Saber. His first contact with Saber made him bewildered, "Such immeasurable beauty ... I got lost in words." <br /> <br /> You can not compare this series with any other to fully understand its plot. FSN offers much more than cool swordfights, good animation, spectacular lights, great soundtrack, perfect character development and relationships. It presents changes that occur in the characters' personalities when events emerge. The action reveals reliable dynamic emotional and behavioral patterns of individuals (not similar to the linear type of other applications of the series) that continually shape their personality to reveal faulty characters from the mask of perfection. <br /> <br /> Saber is associated with a medieval legend, which has been changed to fit this series and should be accepted as such. You should not look at how FSN thinks he does not present the viewer with a historical fact, just remember that it is an adventure / fantasy series, not a documentary and enjoy as long as you can. The ending is sudden and unexpected, and if there were twice as many episodes, I would watch them in one breath.
