The third and in my opinion the best from the Blackadder series. <br /> <br /> The only downside is that there is no Lord Percy, who was the funniest character in the previous series, but Prince Regent Hugh Laurie is a mad line laugh. <br /> <br /> As a package, its quality combined with convincing sets of regency, excellent sarcasm and small pieces of crazy, "macbeth" actors standing out and Prince Georges "happy with us" chicken impression, and missing words from the doctor's dictionary Johnson. <br /> <br /> Few comedies were quite clever, because they are funny, ok, weird lame observation or line, but mostly it's screaming.
