"Hundstage" is the first feature film by seidla (he has previously directed great documentaries as "animal love" or "models"). seidl worked on this project for over 3 years, but it cost only about $ 2 million. the actors are very good, especially unprofessional actors who almost played themselves. Pictures are also good. the whole movie is shocking and disturbing, and some scenes may be too much for ordinary viewers. Finally, I must say that this is one of the best and most satisfying Austrian films in recent years. Please forgive my bad English. <br /> <br />
