It's a very good TV movie. He presents problems in the suburbs around 1970 and neighbors whom they certainly do not want to have. The worst and most annoying part of the movie was that punk teenagers killed a family dog. Teenagers are doing everything to upset and harass this poor family. But boy! Will the main character take revenge on these punk teenagers? The father / homeowner certainly does not recklessly take all teenagers and quickly retaliates after the lack of help from the police. He defies and protects his home and family. A very good actor. I can add. <br /> <br /> I watched it on television when I was 8 or 9 years old. I never saw him on TV and I would like to. Definitely good! It is a kind of movie that you can catch on the night of the week very late at night and can not stop watching or an afternoon movie on the weekend. They just do not show it anymore. <br /> <br /> It's definitely worth seeing!
