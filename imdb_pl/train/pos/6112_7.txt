It's primarily a hatchling, it's a romantic comedy. There is a balance between them. This particular movie contains some pretty sweet fighting scenes, I do not think that any wires will be used, and if not, they were not blatant. It's not a terribly complicated movie, so it's easy on the brain, there's no need to analyze anything to get a deeper meaning, quite a simple, good chemical composition between the electrodes and a funny watch. I would like them to do it when they bring out the full potential of the girls, only once, because it can be incredibly sweet, but they keep a low key throughout the movie. I would watch it again ... with my girlfriend.
