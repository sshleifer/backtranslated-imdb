Although this movie was released one year before I was born, it is definitely one of my favorite comedies. He appears in Redd Foxx as a father who tries to understand his son's homosexuality. Like most parents, he does not know what it means to be gay and has all the stereotypical ideas about what gays are. His son, Norman, is an adult now and lives alone. When his father, Ben, finds out that his son is gay, he pays his son a visit in the hope of changing it. The title comes from one of the funniest lines in the movie - when Ben goes to Norman's apartment, he hits a prostitute and thinks his son is pulling ("Norman ... Is that you?"). The film made me laugh from start to finish. Redd Foxx is great. Although a lot of content is stereotypical, I have not found anything offensive in the way the material is handled and even has a good ending. Highly recommended.
