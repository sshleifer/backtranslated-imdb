How can you summarize exactly how good you feel and are you okay with this film? For several weeks, the DVD jumped off the shelf every time I entered the store - after watching Steve Carrell in several movies before, I did not want to blur my thought process about him - so I leaned back and rested until I finally caught up with it. hell! "attitude! And how I was surprised! I would just like to buy it earlier. Watching him three times in two days, I still smile as a portrait of a widower struggling with three daughters, longing for what is missing from the death of his beloved wife, who thus encounters an intriguing woman, enchanting her in such a deep and interesting (dare to say a book?) way, it throws a completely different light on life that makes him aware that he is what he was looking for. <br /> <br /> Too bad this woman who is his brother, complicates matters - which presents Dan comically shy and with deep disappointment, seeing that his "special someone" brings such joy and pleasure to a family home, as well as to life of his brothers. You just really start to feel it. <br /> <br /> When a blind date occurs with Ruthie Draper - this is a turning point in Dan's assessment !! The look she gives him when she repeats her comment, that she does not like Ruthie - the pure Green-Eyed Monster! Call an absolutely funny scene when two pairs are competing on the dance floor! This sequence is one of the best prepared when Dan begins to relax with regard to Marie. <br /> <br /> Other scenes in which the guts are pounding - Dan returns from the Book and Tackle store, which his brothers confront to describe what has just happened ... when Dan's face falls, brings a sharp blast !! <br /> <br /> His youngest daughter Lilly, who presents a present celebrating love for Suzanne, his dead wife, brings a small warmth and a small sip when Dan realizes what he has lost in life. <br /> <br /> When Dan plays the guitar and sings at the Talent Show ... his voice breaks slightly when he repeats the song. ... an absolute gem! <br /> <br /> Acceptance of what's happening late in the movie by his daughters ... all three love their father and want to see him happy, will not let him deny his love for Marie; Dan's desperation not to disappoint his daughters, because he is their rock, their claim ... and tell him a lot more with a few words. <br /> <br /> I could continue and continue, but I will leave it for now - maybe I will come back and I will add more comments here in the near future .... but I will end up saying ... <br /> <br />. ... if you want to watch a movie it's so damn good, with comedy turns to brighten a drama that never feels forced or snappy, which appears as a real portrait of a man discovering a new life - not only with a woman but also with his your extended family, then look no further. <br /> <br /> DAN IN TRUE LIFE - 9 out of 10 for such a well-directed movie experience with the Sondre Lerche score, which takes you there all the time, never being intrusive, okay band performances. I can not wait to re-watch it again !!
