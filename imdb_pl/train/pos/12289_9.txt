First of all, I would like to emphasize that I did not read the book, so there was no chance that I would be disappointed with this aspect. The main drawback that I noticed was the historical detail, with a few cars, trains, clothes, etc. I think that it does not belong at the time. <br /> <br /> *** Possible spoiler ***** <br /> <br /> The technical aspect of the film is ok, there's nothing to brag about. But I think acting was great. I do not have experience in acting, I still can not believe how people can find it horrible! Maybe they only saw two films (ever), and the other had to be really good! <br /> <br /> I especially liked Jeremy Irons and I really understood his character, someone who crawled on the social ladder with very hard work, and then he fought with those who would take a life job from him, only he he engages in this fight, he does not realize that reason is no longer at his side, and ends with a beaten, disappointed man. Irons made it so reliable that I sympathized with the character despite his brutality. <br /> <br /> After Jeremy Irons, Winona Ryder is also wonderful as a romantic young woman who is drawn into revolutionary ideals by her boyfriend, he probably had a poorly developed part), and Glenn Close was also very good. Meryl Streep had an average performance, it was not bad, it did not meet the standards of other actors. Watch out for Miguel Guilherme, a great Portuguese actor, among many stars. <br /> <br /> In contrast to today's films, here only interpretations, only people have meaning, but at the same time it is not a pretentious movie, too worried trying to be an intellectual. The best proof that I really liked it, I write a review 7 years later.
