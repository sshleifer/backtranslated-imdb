I have not seen this movie for a long time in 1958 and I really liked Kim Novak in the role of Gil Holroyd, who is a real witch and has an aunt named Queenie Holroyd who is also a witch, and Gillian also has a warlock brother named Nick played by Jack Lemmon. When Gillian looks at Shep Henderson (James Stewart), who is engaged to the girl he intends to marry; Gillian performs magic spells with the cat and changes her mind about the intended fianc√©e, and then becomes very desirable and falls in love with Gillian. The story says that a real witch can not fall in love, blush or cry, and that's a big problem between Shep and Gillian, so Nick and Aunt Queenie decided they had to do something about it. A great movie to watch over and over and a great classic movie from 1958.
