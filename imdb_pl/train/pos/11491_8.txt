The Unborn is a very, very different movie. James Karen and Brooke Adams are in the movie and did a good job. this film is built solidly and allows you to go further. Although I think you must be a horror fan to watch it because of the scenes and the story. There is one short nude scene that could be left out, and for some people this scene may disappoint someone like me who is in the movie and thinks that this material spoils a good movie, but that's it. There is a scene in which Adams' character goes crazy and kills a cat, but you can say that it is not real. The music is very different but very good. The Unborn in My opinion is a really scary movie that is extremely unpredictable and it's quite strange! I recommend this movie to all horror movie fans!
