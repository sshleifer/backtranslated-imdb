This movie was impressive. My first experience with foreign film was neither too long nor too complicated. Personally, I liked the subtitles; And the plot was surprisingly fresh. The story of an adult son who visited his elder father and a delayed brother after a long separation, initially seemed cliched, but it turned out to be very moving and realistic. There was also a subtle humor not to depress or bore the audience.
