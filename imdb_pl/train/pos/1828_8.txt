Based on the movie St. Ives by Robert Louis Stevenson tells the story of young French captain Hussar (Jean Marc Barr) during the Napoleonic wars. Captured in battle, he is sent to a prisoner-of-war camp in the Scottish Highlands run by Major Farquhar (Richard E Grant). In a short time she falls in love with a local girl (Anna Friel), makes friends with the major and discovers that his long-lost grandfather, who escaped from France during the revolution, lives simply on the road! The soulful performances of all actors and a few unforgettable lines make it an above-average offer.
