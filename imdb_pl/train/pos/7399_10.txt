My choice for the best movie was once Laughton's "Night of the Hunter", which remains excellent in my canon. But it may have been replaced by "Shower", which is the most artistic daoist movie I've ever seen. The way in which care for others is represented by the flow of water, and the way water can be inspired, as well as comfort, purification, etc., is the essence of Tao. It can be argued that the themes of NOFTH and Shower are similar, and Lillian Gish in the first represents the purest form of Christianity, because the bath operators represent the purest form of Taoism. I would not object to such an interpretation in any way. Both films are a visual joy in integrating ideas and images. However, Shower presents such an unmodified view of the sanctity of everyday life that I nod my head. I worship them both.
