Here is my first film directed by David Mamet. Fit because it was his first. <br /> <br /> The story here is uneven and moves like any movie, from minor flaws to big cons to all-encompassing con. It's like "The Grifters", but without the acting level of the movie. (In this movie, John Cusack was a little bland, but that was the nature of his character.) Acting here is very flat (sometimes I wondered if the flawless behavior of Crouse was to be some kind of attack on psychoanalysis). At least at the beginning. It never gets really well, but it evolves beyond the painfully stiff line reading after about ten minutes. At the beginning of the movie, some lines of Lindsay Crouse - the way they read them - sound like they are an internal monologue or narrative that they are not. With the appearance of Mantegna things, pick up. <br /> <br /> Dialogue here is not as much fun as it should be. I was expecting rope with rings that slip off the tongue, but not those. It all reads rather than reading. Maybe Mamet evolved after this movie and he relaxed, but if not, maybe he should let others manage his words. It is too valuable with them, which means they lose their rhythmic, jazz quality. Oddly enough, the movie does not look or look like a game. The camera is very cinematic. My only problem with "Glengarry Glen Ross" was that it looked too similar to the filmed theater, but in this movie the actors were not only accomplished, but relaxed and free. Everything was flowing. <br /> <br /> I would not care so much if it sounded like film heroes speaking with movie lines - or even playing characters talking about the lines of the game - but here it sounds like characters from the movie (and even books) talking the game line. It's a strange mix of theater and film that just does not work. This does not mean that the movie is bad - it is not, it is often very funny. The best piece is inside. <br /> <br /> This is a standard footage: a new guy (in this case a girl) Margaret Ford (Lindsay Crouse) engages in a seedy world of conspiracy. If she is involved: she is a psychiatrist and one of her patients, Billy is a compulsive gambler. He wants to help him pay his debts with gambling, so he enters The House of Games, a dingy game room where men work in the back. I admit that the configuration is quite unlikely. (Did they expect Crouse to come in? Did they expect to write a check? Was Billy on it? One of these questions is definitely the answer. <br /> <br /> And here the defects begin to develop. I found these beginners - those little learners - to be the most fun. We get a lesson about art as much as Crouse. <br /> <br /> We see that the end is coming, and then we have not seen the second end, and then the real ending I have not seen, but maybe it was. The ball just bounces back and forth, and through the last scene of the movie we realize that the second Crouse has entered The House of Games, found her true calling. <br /> <br /> I am going to forgive the annoying opening, unbelievable beats and strange line reading, because there are many good things here. If the first part of the movie seems dizzy, stick to it. After half an hour sign, it really takes on momentum. If you want a fun movie, here it is. If you want Mameta, look again at "Glengarry Glen Ross" - James Foley did it better. <br /> <br /> ***
