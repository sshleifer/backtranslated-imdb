First, let me say that I did not like the fact that The Rock won the title, which is so cheerful. Then I feel that Regal should regain his European title, Jeff Hardy is a poor champion. Rob Van Dam had too much Intercontinental title, because Brock should have won. I am glad that Storm and Christian are the masters of the tag, in my opinion the best match was Booker T and Big Show.
