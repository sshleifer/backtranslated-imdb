This is one of the best games I've ever played because: <br /> <br /> Missions are very funny because they have a lot of actions that can sometimes be really hard, which makes it even more the funny weapon you use is really good. The cars in this game are really good and the missions while driving are cool. This James Bond game has a good story. The voice over the actors in this game is really good and cool, that pierce brosnan is in this game, and the way the characters look are really good, because they look like they look in real life, which is really cool. Also, the graphics in this game are quite good. <br /> <br /> Overall score ********* from **********
