I love the series! Many stereotypes depicting Southerners as hicks are very visible, but such people exist too often. The representation of the southern government also sounds too true, but the nice characters also resemble many good things in the south. Some things never change and every day we see "good old boys"! In every southern city is Lucas Buck, who only needs to call for something to happen, and the fairy tale "for" the white basket is too familiar. In addition to the supernatural elements, everything else may well happen in the modern South! I think Trinity, SC must have been in Barnwell County!
