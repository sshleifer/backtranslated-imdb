The title drew my attention, and then I wondered what would happen in the story, because we saw so many "super-human" movies in those years ... and I really really liked it because there were many amazing funny scenes that I did not expect. Uma Thurman played on average as G-Girl. Surprisingly, I was able to see her fingers again on the wide screen (as Kill Bill at the beginning). Luke Wilson, however, played very well a guy with idiots who meets a great woman, I could really get into his situation. If you want to have fun, you should definitely watch the adventures of G-Girl and the average Matt, especially to cheer up your partner. 7/10 in my collection.
