First of all, I do not understand why some people consider this film anti-American. Sure, there are times when the US is being accused directly, as in the Youssef Chahine, Ken Loach and, to some extent, Mira Nair segments. But give it a rest, these are not na√Øve accusations; instead, they are based on facts and documents, and all documents issued by the CIA on Chile confirm this, for example. <br /> <br /> But returning to the film itself, I liked the variety of moods the most. We find children educated for respect for all people who died in this event; we find an unhappy couple who will be changed by the tragedy of that day; we find ordinary people whose feelings are lowered in the shadow of the events of September 11 and react differently with dignity or frustration; we'll even find someone in the movie for which the towers fall for a moment of real happiness. <br /> <br /> All these visions and others - as powerful as these or even more - form a coherent mix and help of the viewer to see how different people around the world have reacted to the September 11 events. So we see a panorama that is much more complex than white and black, which can make some people get angry; but this is the world in which we live, in which there is no place for Manicheistic ideologies, regardless of what the presidents or priests will tell us. <br /> <br /> Finally, I think it's a pity that there is not even the release date of this film in the United States of America. It is a pity, because most Americans ask why this disaster occurred, and this movie can give them clues. This film very clearly - unlike some people in this forum think - that everything we do today will determine our future and that the mistakes of the past will affect how we live today.
