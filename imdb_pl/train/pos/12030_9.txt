hi, im scott (A.K.A woody7739) I love the movie Twisted Desire, And I love to watch Melissa Joan Hart in t.v because I think it's okay. I am a real fan of sabrina, a teenage witch, so it helped me watch it (do not ask). I love the way Nicole plans a very murder of her parents because she makes sure someone else pulls the trigger and exercises on the bottles, so she does not reveal fingerprints (a very well-planned idea) everything turned against nicole when she was caught when she appears her old boyfriend and puts a hidden camera under his shirt. I give this film nine out of ten and put it on MY 10 best movies list. And finally, if someone sees this movie in stores, tell me how I saw it on TV and did not record it. PA
