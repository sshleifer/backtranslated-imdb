This film from 1939 tried to use a much better movie, Michael Curtiz "Angels with dirty faces". Directed by Ray Enright, the only interesting thing is how tame these children were compared to what is happening with young people in today's American cities. <br /> <br /> The movie is worth seeing only because of the presence of Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan, who showed that they are well paired together. Children with Dead End have bigger parts because the story focuses on them, not on older people. <br /> <br /> In a sense, it's interesting to see how arson was used in the same way that meticulous owners did in later years in New York. It was the quickest way to change ownership around never considering the social problems he created. In today's climate with such a large number of weapons there is a new reality. Young children seemed to be jokers rather than criminals. How times change!
