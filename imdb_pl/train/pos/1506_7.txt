Before films such as "Texas Chainsaw Massacre", "Suspiria" and "Halloween" changed forever the view of horror, in this genre appeared a more gothic and much less violent epoch. Movies like the Hammer Horror series and "Rosemary's Baby" were what scared and delighted the audience in the '60s and early' 70s. I can not tell you how many times I rented this movie as a child, but I did it because there was something in it. I did not want to limit myself to slager and zombie movies from the 70s and 80s, and movies like this production from the famous, but long-absent film company Amicus were a good start. <br /> <br /> Pros: A wonderful, amazing musical score. Strong performances from the stellar cast. Brilliant pictures. Lots of old-fashioned emotions and thrills, especially on the first and last vignette. Some haunting moments and images. He moves slowly but quickly. A house is one terrible, overwhelming apartment. A great design and decoration that gives the film a truly old, gothic horror. It depends more on the mood and bloodless chills than on top and unpaid nudity for its thrill. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: some stimulus problems in the first half. Apart from "The Cloak", the rest of the stories seem like it was earlier. Clich√©s galore. The second story, "Waxworks", has great action and moments, but it is the weakest of four in terms of terror and tension. A low budget really shows sometimes. <br /> <br /> Recent thoughts: After watching this movie for the first time in many years I can see why I borrowed it so often. In no way is this a masterpiece, but it is a good example of the time when horrors were created with style and class. Watch this one with the lights off. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3.5 / 5
