I just can not believe some of the comments for this concert! The show is simply brilliant! Sure, it does not follow the tried and true, but if we as consumers, we always want the same things to push us over and over again. Should we not be able to sit down and enjoy something new once in a while. The style is not as realistic as the previous "Scooby Doo", but it should not be like that. The show entitled "Shaggy and Scooby Doo will get a hint" indicates that part of this title means that all of your beloved cast of other interpretations would be constantly joining the action. And nowhere does he say that they solve mysteries and can not even stand monsters, so why should they do it? I'm really happy that they put a few long feature points that work in the Scooby-Doo program. They still have jokes, clumsy hi-jinks, fast-changing costumes in chase scenes, a standard gag in the hallway, and even Scooby snacks. In fact, I'm glad that this program is there because I just like it. I am even glad that for some time they got rid of the rest of the band and focused only on the two main heroes and villains. <br /> <br /> Sure it's funny! Sure, it's different, it should be. You have to laugh at the villain and cheer on an idiot robot-clerk who will triumph over all disturbing vermin, no matter what the size. You should get a working "Roobi-Roo" joke. The whole is so well connected that there is not a single thing that I could think about is BAD. Writing, acting, animation, everything at the highest level. The title music is amazing (my computer plays "GET A CLUE!" When it starts up), and the background music is simply captivating.
