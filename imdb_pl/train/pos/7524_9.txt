In the case of a film that allegedly concerns sex and skin, it has no right to be as strangely sweet as it is. The story of Bettie Page, a good Christian girl from the South, whose mom would not allow a date, until she married, who moved to New York and eventually became the most successful pin of her age, is driven by outstanding achievements from Gretchen Moll. Her site can not quite reconcile the pictures she makes (no one can touch, it's all fun and respectful) with the attempts of pornography and the supposed effects that her paintings have on the world around her. <br /> <br /> The site was an inspiration for every burlesque artist because not only because she had a character to die for, but because she invested every picture in an innocent way that was exceptionally sexy and simple at the same time. Rather like this movie. Filmde in black and white and great technique is a beautiful way to spend a few hours.
