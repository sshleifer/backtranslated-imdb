52-Pick Up has never gained the respect it should have. It works on many levels and has a complicated but consistent plot. The actors involved give their best performances. Ann-Margret, Roy Scheider and John Glover are perfectly manned and provide deep character portraits. Also noteworthy are Vanity, which should turn into a serious acting career, taking into account the unexpected skills that shows, and Kelly Preston, which will scare you for several days. Everyone who enjoys acting in combination with a difficult, complicated story enjoys it.
