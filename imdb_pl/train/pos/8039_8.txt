Sniper gives real meaning to war movies. I remember films about Vietnam or World War II, a lot of shooting, everybody dying, I'm bam. "Sniper" transfers war to a new level or sophistication. The film certainly conveys all the emotions it strives for - helplessness of people in the jungle, hatred and possible trust between Beckett and Miller and the momentum when they pull the trigger. Seemingly low-budget film makes up for any defect with action, tension and thrill, because when it comes down to it, it's just one shot, one killing.
