Can I be so simple and primitive in my assessments, how can I simply say "I liked it"? It's quite funny by pieces, it has great stars and it's great. The songs (there are about two, which are then repeated) are forgotten, but they get a healthy, ironic treatment (such as the terribly handsome Mr. Fairbanks exploding into the crazy Wagner version of the tender ballad that Miss Grable has just released); there are not too many dances with all the crinolines from 1861 wrapped around Miss Grable, and the comedy can be a bit heavy, but the result is still very uplifting. Photography (including real outdoor shots, which are the thrill of emotions) is amazing, playing with various shades of lush heavy gold. Miss Grable is somewhat outside of her great and plump side, but still fresh and comfortable in this continental comedy "olde worlde". It is quite similar to "Down to Earth" with Rita Hayworth and many of them rather dislike. I suppose, then, that a few people found "That Lady in Ermine" obsolete and stuffy. But it's a fairy tale, and they still have a tendency to move on a specific paste. My suggestion is: just enjoy the works of art, costumes, witty script and all that this movie has to offer, and stop complaining. The film was released on DVD in Germany, with German and English soundtrack.
