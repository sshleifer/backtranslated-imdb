I saw this movie when it was originally released in 1989. Then I liked it and I'm still doing it. But now I realize that this is an "adult" film with the G grade, especially the concept of dying and going to heaven. Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise work great together, and Reynolds' voice is suitable for a scrapie dog. There are a few good songs, from optimistic ("Let's Make Music Together") to almost emotional ("Home to My Heart"). I found the plot well, although one or two of them shoots tangentially. The last scene of the movie with Charlie and Anne-Marie is one of the saddest I've ever seen in animation. A film worth experiencing.
