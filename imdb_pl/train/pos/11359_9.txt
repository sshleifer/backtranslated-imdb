Citizen X talks about the real drama of looking for a serial killer named "Radziowski Ripper." This great movie shows a long journey that you had to take to catch the killer. The film shows how politics can help the killer in continuing his madness for over 12 years. (Probably over 50 victims, mainly women and children) The performances of Stephen Rei as the main detective and Donald Sutherland as a comprehensive investigation were wonderful. Jeffrey DeMunn as Ripper Andrei Romanovich Chikatilo. It is a kind of film that will hypnotize you and immediately make you examine the real case online. This is a film that can not be missed. I debuted, I believe in HBO and I never got a cinematic premiere to my understanding. A great movie
