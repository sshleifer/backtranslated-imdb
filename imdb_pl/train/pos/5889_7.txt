All right, I must admit I have never seen "Rhody" and only one or two episodes of "The Mary Tyler Moore Show". Although I do not know anything about this duet of comedy talent, I still liked this movie. <br /> <br /> Mary returns to work. Rose tries her luck in being a comedian. Rhoda is struggling with a photographic career. And Meredith ... what exactly does she do? The three stories we follow for two hours are fun and fun in their own way. When two long-time friends reunite, the movie is better. <br /> <br /> I was surprised how good the letter was. Small jokes thrown by Mary and Rhode were fun. The script itself was very well composed. <br /> <br /> In the last few years, I've seen Moore and Harper in other movies and thought they were very good. But I had no idea that they work as well as a team. While both actresses are doing their best to fill the title of this movie, they never seem to disappoint. (During this movie.) Joie Lenz and Marisa Ryan play their roles in order, but nothing great. The rest of the cast, like Jonah, Cecile and ... everyone else also works well together. <br /> <br /> Because this is a meeting, you can expect that a fan of both programs will enjoy it. From non-fans, I still liked this small meeting. Good plot lines for each character and two main characters make this movie very good. (The newer version of the theme song MTM does not hurt either.)
