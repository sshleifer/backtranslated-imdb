A drama drama, written by William Mastrosimone based on his stage play, in which Farrah Fawcett plays Marjorie, attacked in his car by rapist Joe (James Russo). She manages to escape, but the cops inform her that they can do nothing. He realizes, however, that Joe has obtained her wallet and knows where he lives. When her roommate Pat (Alfre Woodard) and Terry (Diana Scarwid) are at work, Joe pays her a visit to finish what he started. After Joe humiliates her and humiliates her in various ways, she has a chance to strike him and imprison him. Knowing perfectly well that he is in a different "your word against your" situation and that there has been no rape, he does not intend to care for him until he tells Pat and Terry what his intentions were. > The movie is ultimately the final game between two opponents. Over time, Marjorie shows such ruthlessness that you have to wonder if she has become as unbalanced as her nemesis. Fawcett does a good enough job while Russo is really perfect as a depraved crawler who does everything to manipulate the situation. With only two characters on the screen for most of the time, the movie has an intimate nature that suggests that it would work even better on the stage. Director Robert M. Young does not avoid the uglier and more exploitative elements of the situation; watching a movie sometimes becomes uncomfortable. And by the time Marjorie has an advantage, things change so much that it is not so easy to encourage her to get blood, and one hopes that Pat will make her see the reason. <br /> <br /> "I felt that the extremes are quite a good movie that at least maintains interest and a fairly high level of intensity. Woodard and Scarwid are alright in terms of support (Scarwidnia has a great moment when Terry reveals himself as a rape victim) and the pace is consistent. Of course, the dialogue is not always very sharp, but the material is fascinating at every turn. <br /> <br /> 8/10
