Let me start by saying that I have never reviewed a movie on IMDb before; I am in the video industry myself. And from this observant; I can say, without a shadow of a doubt, that this film should be short. It has a very good story and another thing that I love (even better ending). The opening was very well done, I loved the video chosen for it and the way it was edited. <br /> <br /> I'm not a B & W fan, but the way the movie uses the effect that works. And with every movie that matters. The film flow works perfectly, and the assembly was very well made. From the technical side (which is the site I usually work on) everything is very well done. There is no important technology. things to pay attention to. The only thing I have is that the end credits are a bit lively. This is probably due to a rendering problem. Let me also say that I would prefer to see more of a love scene, but I'm a guy (so you can call it a guy's factor). <br /> <br /> So generally I rate it on 9/10. It's worth watching if you're a fan of India and / or short films. <br /> <br /> ps. I apologize for bad grammar or spelling.
