Prince plays the 'The Kid' in this semi-autobiographical film of a talented but narcissistic young musician who has a less stellar household life. The truth is that acting leaves a bit to be desired (except for Morris Day, and especially Clarence Williams, who are also perfect), but the movie is still great and belongs to the best of the 80s. It has the best soundtrack of EVERY film from the last 50 years, at least, very cited lines, and the junk scene is HILARIOUS !! Plus Apollonia is simply amazing. Not being connected with this, when I saw Prince at the concert in 2004, he blew out the stadium. He is a showman expert and it was one of the best concerts I've ever had. <br /> <br /> My degree: A <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Disc 1) Comment with director Albert Magnoli, Producer Robert Cavallo and director of photography Donald Thorin; Theater trailer; Trailers "Under the Cherry Moon" and "Grafitti Bridge" Disc 2) 12 minute movie on First Avenue Club; "Purple Rain: Bachstage Pass (a half-hour description of the film, which I will describe later on his page);" Riffs, Raffs and Revolution: Impact and Influence of Purple Rain "a 10-minute feature film; 30 minutes of MTV premiere.
