First of all, the film is a brilliant work of art (film). The plot was full of surprises, a small child pretends to be an adult, inherits a million dollars and issues them. I mean, how it ended. Walt Disney really overtook this time. Comedy is expected in most cases, but sometimes unexpected. I mean, if this movie was OK, was this movie OK? He also teaches a lot about wise youngsters, and I'm a kid who is really clever and a bit clever. But it also sucks. How the hell a guy like this can get a hot police and let his father let him go. It's as if the killer has been released in 10 years. If I were to do this, I would be beaten by "jack suble" (a huge stick that stings when you're really stuck in your ass). This kid is really lucky. Return to history. The filmmakers really knew what they were doing when they made the movie, but it's still not perfect. Acting was good and bad. The kid and the woman had no chemistry or a father, but the bros were great. " On the other hand, the special effects were poor. Plus, this movie is not based on reality. I hated it and loved it at the same time.
