I was very interested that the film managed to fill the gap between my own American culture and the culture of the creators, i.e. Chinese. It becomes a story of values ​​and causes the observer to reevaluate his own life choices and loyalty to the institution. Surprisingly, it was done in a gentle, gentle way that only in hindsight threatens the status quo. I liked the movie and would look at it again if I could.
