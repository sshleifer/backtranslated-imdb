Yokai Monsters: Spook Warfare (Yokai daisenso, 2005) movie about "yokai" or traditional Japanese "monsters" of folklore. Alternatively, it is known as Big Monster War or Ghosts on Parade. <br /> <br /> Yokai in the first installment is a freak with a kettle, kappa water imp, live brella, a woman whose figs can become extremely gigantic, a woman with a second face on his head, a dwarven priest with a huge gourd-like wrist and so further. <br /> <br /> Such capricious monsters come not only from a fairy tale, but from a kind of summer entertainment in the Tokugawa Era, comparable to today's haunted houses in Halloween, or "bizarre shows" from the past, but with only fake quirks. Ghosts and monsters from goldfish and dancing one-headed umbrellas have been thought out to create "chills" during hot years. Fatty woman and such have been recreated by tricks or illusions, based on monsters depicted in medieval scrolls; and if their film design is a bit simple and hoky, it makes it all the more representative for what has historically been recreated for summer chills. <br /> <br /> These captivating monsters have to face and destroy the ancient Babylonian vampire demon who came to Japan and dressed as the ruler of samurai. Despite the fact that some of the Japanese phenomena are a bit stupid, and too many costumes are less than masks without moving your mouth, as it is said, all this is played very poker and is very charming. He has beautiful pictures, just like in the CGI movie from the same decade. Viewed in the right mood or with the right friends, it's exciting, moving and moving. <br /> <br /> Yoshiyuki Kuroda has also directed the famous Lone Wolf & Cub: White Heaven & Hell (1974) and was a special FX director of the great Daimajin trilogy. The Yokai series of monsters is not equal to Majin at its best, but Yokai are great fun. The first family cinema, which is the most oriented towards children in his family films, and GOZU and IZOO are increasingly serious, although they are not too strict for young viewers.
