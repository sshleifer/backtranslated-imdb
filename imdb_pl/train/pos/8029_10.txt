I wonder what rifle Beckett used in the film, and the caliber of the projectile he was about to shoot. If it's loosely based on Carlos Hathcock snipers, I guess it's 7 mm. round. I am also interested in the rifle itself. He also made a commentary in the last Sniper movie about a rifle, which a Vietnamese man let him use, belonging to his father. Beckett mentioned that he thought it was the best sniper rifle ever made. I'd like to know which rifle is also. I know that this particular rifle was made around World War II or earlier. I just could not look at it closely while watching the movie to identify it. <br /> <br /> Regarding the murders of Mr. Hathcock, his longest shot was 1.47 miles and he had 93 confirmed killings and 14 anecdotal killings. After his wounds healed a little after burning in Vietnam, he spent the rest of his career teaching the USMC snipers the skills they would need in the field. His sniper career is still remembered for our brothers and sisters who train at the USMC. I found his name from my friend who is a former marine. Any information would be great.
