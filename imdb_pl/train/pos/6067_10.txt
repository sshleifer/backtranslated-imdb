Although I am inclined to agree with other comments from people who have seen this film, I am ashamed to say I like it. Not so often you can find such a large pile of peppers from the 80s outside of Wham! video, so it's definitely worth watching (Â£ 0.79 per night at my local store!). Watch out for the crazily obvious stitching and zipper on the monster outfit, the fact that the "hero" looks very much like Keith Chegwin and the classic lines like this: Evil Wizard-Type Bloke: "Finally, we meet Kor ..." Kor: " Shocking, right? "<br /> <br /> Incredible! I also like the fact that although the video box looks quite exciting, with a castle surrounded by raging seas and a dangerous falcon - like a bird carrying a handsome hero to a safe place (among other such "interesting and engaging" suggestions regarding what is happening in real life No, I'm not kidding ... there's really no crazy sea or wild bird, I just try to interest you ... in my opinion, this classic movie gets 10 for purely entertaining value !!
