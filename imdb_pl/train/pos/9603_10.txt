I have one word for this movie, WOW! I saw "Darius Goes West" at the Tribeca Film Festival. The people in the theater were sobbing. This video shows the difficulties that Darius suffers from muscular dystrophy. The film was very well made and really made you part of the movie. I was so emotionally moved by the movie because it made us remember that we are very happy that we are completely healthy, some people in this world are less successful than us. And sometimes we should give them and help them to the very end. I would give them ten stars, give Darius, when they were not asked, did not do it for the money they did for a friend in need, Darius, the world should know, Darius went west.
