This Oscar-nominated in 2004 is a very short black and white film in Spanish. A young woman enters the cafe, takes coffee and notices several musicians standing in silence with their instruments. All customers are still, like mannequins. One guy is quite cheerful, however, and breaks into the song about what's going on at 7:35. There is one surprising moment after another, until the end, which is quite, well, surprising. People, place, everything looks quite ordinary. And just like the Bolero song, the thing develops until the culmination. With its structure, motive, movement and wit it is an 8-minute masterpiece.
