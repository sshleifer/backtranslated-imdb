When I saw this movie for the first time in the 1980s, I was middle-aged and was a little reluctant to see it because I thought I was an adult and out of date "Sesame Street / Muppets". Honestly, I do not remember if I liked it at the time or not. However, somewhere in college, I watched this movie again, which ended (and was) my personal collection of Best Films Ever. <br /> <br /> This movie is SATISFIED with humor that goes far beyond what I would expect from Muppetach. My point is that the Muppets have always appealed to adults and children because humor is aimed at both generations. But let me go ... Janice accidentally eavesdrops, telling someone: "I do not take off my clothes for anyone, even if it's artistic" ... is a joke from father to son, if a frog in love with Kermita, then father does not want to hear it ... Gonzo rescues the chicken with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation (sp?), And then says, "I think we're now engaged" ... and that's what many other moments in the movie made me do. Add to that a very wise dialogue, a very intelligent humor "wink wink" from New York / Broadway, usually a large amount of stellar scenes and some really nice songs that do not bord at all with "kiddie trash" ... this movie a masterpiece! I do not throw "10" regularly ... but this one deserves it. Over 20 years later, this film is completely holding, maybe even more. Muppets have never been and will never be, as fun and wise and simply brilliant as this movie was and is. --- P
