Surviving Christmas is a surprisingly fun movie, especially considering the bad publicity when it was released for the first time. Ben Affleck is funny as an unbearable millionaire who pays the family who takes his home in childhood to be his family for Christmas. Then he drives the family crazy due to excessive indulgence in the festive mood. In the past, I was not a fan of Ben Affleck (although I liked Daredevil and Paychet), but here he is well-manned in this role. I also like Christina Applegate as a daughter in a family who at the beginning can not stand the form of Affleck. Of course you can see where this movie is going, but you do not care. Ignore what the critics say and rent this movie because it's more fun than many Christmas movies.
