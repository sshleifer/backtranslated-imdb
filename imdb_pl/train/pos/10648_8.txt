What can I say that it was not said about "The Haunting"? It has everything that could make a great picture. Wonderful sets, romantic music and sound design, for which you could die, were in place. However, the script sometimes awakens the mind in a strange, surreal way. The whole team had to forget about reading it, perhaps because they were too busy creating cg effects and building gothic sets to see how weak the plot was. Each cast member gives a dignified performance, though with little conviction to the material he has at hand. Lili Taylor has the most to do, while others mostly react to her. But that's about it. All I can say is that the two hours were pleasant, but you will definitely want more. Much more.
