I loved this movie. Not only because I am a huge fan of Moritz Bleibtreu, although he is practically in all German films that matter. But also because it is NOT the main actor. The lead was taken over by Barnaby Metschurat, who was the only reason to watch Julietta in 2001 and who really wears this movie on his shoulders. <br /> <br /> The family moves from Italy to Germany, looking for a "German dream" (this is my own invention and irony ...) of cheap labor in the steel and coal industry. In the end, however, they open a restaurant, and the trip to this point is so poetic, yet funny and charming. From that moment, the story is mainly about two brothers of this family: Giancarlo (Bleibtreu) and Gigi (Metschurat). Gigi's dream of becoming a filmmaker threatens to compete with her brother and her mother's determination to return to Italy. Below is a wonderful - and completely neutral - look at what life can arise as a result of the choices made. <br /> <br /> After all, this movie does not say which life (Gigi's or Giancarlo) was more successful or fuller or more interesting. It gives us only a satisfying look at how it must be to look for identity when two countries and mentality are involved. and this look is not due to bitterness or contempt for any of these countries, which makes it such a great film for any country that has to do with the tensions resulting from immigration. The fact that director Fatih Akin relocated to Germany from Turkey in the 1970s also gives the film high credibility and emotional accuracy. The icing on the cake is the fantastic performances of the entire cast, especially Metschurat and - which I really must emphasize - a little boy who plays the young Gigi. The performance of this kid would be difficult for everyone to meet! Great movie, see it.
