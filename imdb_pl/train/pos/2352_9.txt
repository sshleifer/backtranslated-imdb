I must say that when "Pushing Daisies" appeared, I was immediately won by the fabulous scenery of such gloom. The narrator made a cake from the whole rehearsal, making death seem as routine as, well, baking Ned's (Lee Pace) cakes. And bringing them back to life was just as routine. <br /> <br /> Neda Trio, Emerson Cod (Chi McBride) and Charlotte "Chuck" Charles (Anna Friel), and sometimes also an assistant to Olive Snook (Kristin Chenoweth, who made the Wicked musical a delight, <br /> <br /> Ned and Chuck have created for a shy and not very ready for love couple who are still testing their feelings, even though they can not touch - an obstacle that does not seem to be an obstacle to help such as gloves, cellophane and bizarre schedules around the apartment, but despite the awkwardness they portray when working on strange mysteries that few know, they still manage to show their chemistry on the screen in moving scenes, like when Ned gives Chuck the beehives, but the presence of Olive makes the breaks in the song and the unpredictable ikacje dla pary. <br /> <br /> The second season fell sharply, putting the silencer at a concert that had real potential. In some episodes, the plot was quick and awkward, making you ask "what just happened?" Both in the overall story of the dead person in the week and in the overarching story line. Adding Chuck's father plus two half brothers for Ned did not help, and at least one of the feature lines was almost recycled (was the "Comfort Food" episode not like the episode "Bitter sweets" in that the dead person of the week died in the food?) . Several moving moments (beehives) helped to develop the relationship between Chuck and Ned, but each time they approached, the writers decided to cast another monkey key, instead of allowing the relationship to develop (Oliver returns from the monastery, Chuck's dead father comes back to life and does not return , you get a photo). <br /> <br /> It's a pity that it did not work out, but the concept was good and it seemed surreal in a good way, enough Pleasantvillesque color / happy-smiley going on and unlikely scenarios to remind that it's not "Dead Like Me" ". In turn, in "Pushing Daisies time", according to Creator Bryan Fuller, it makes it credible again. <br /> <br /> It should take longer, but at the moment it is just sad thinking. Recognition for every new series that tries to replace this short-lived gem.
