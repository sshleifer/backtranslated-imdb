If this movie was completed a little better, he would be there with the best Astaire and Rogers. In fact, it's a great movie, but it's too long with a boring thread, like Randolph Scott affair with sister Rogers, played by Harriet Hilliard (it's Ozzie Nelson's wife for you, baby boomer). <br /> <br /> Astaire and Scott are two navies. Scott meets Hilliard for the first time when he looks like a stereotypical librarian, and then after Ginger Rogers asked his friend (blond but infallible Lucille Ball) to make her fall in love. In the meantime, Astaire is trying to pick up where he and his old partner were dancing. The result is some great dance numbers with the Astaire and Rogers team and separately: "I put all my eggs in one basket", "Let me go" and "Rather Lead the Band". Hilliard is sweet, but a bit lethargic like ordinary Jane, who is a charming girl, although she sings well her two songs "But Where Are You?" And "Get Thee Behind Me, Satan" - one poster did not care about this song, but I love the title . Rogers is alive, and youthful Astaire is a dynamo. <br /> <br /> The highlight of the movie is the end of "Let's Face the Music and Dance", one of the most painful songs ever written and certainly one of the best performed by Rogers and Astaire. In him, they personify the glamor and fantasies of the 1930s. It really has to be appreciated and observed many times.
