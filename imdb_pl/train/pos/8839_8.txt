Thank God it was not based on a real story, because what a story. Populated by wicked figures whose corruption knows no boundaries, Before the Devil is a mesmerizing, stunning trip to perversion that would be ridiculous (and sometimes it is, even with - or perhaps because of - a disgustingly tragic current of human dysfunction all the time) if not carried out with such a wonderful, overwhelming conviction by the stars. Excellent script by Kelly Masterson and a great direction from anyone other than Sidney Lumet does not hurt either. <br /> <br /> The main dysfunction here is the family, with two seriously broken brothers (wonderful photos from Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke) decide to rob their parents' jewelry store, which is a pathetic attempt. <br /> <br /> The story is told with time shifts (which are recorded on the screen, such as: "Charlie: Two days before the theft", so no one should be confused, some people said they did not like it device, but I thought it worked perfectly, adding to the madness of the whole thing, given that the two brothers in question almost do not play on the full deck - between them you can not make a decent poker hand to save your life. those tawdry additional treats: one of the brothers is a drug addict, married to Gina (Marisa Tomei, also excellent), who has an affair with his second brother, throw some monumental rivalry with his siblings, along with the fact that he said his drug addict hates his father (a poignant performance by Albert Finney), who apparently caused him serious pain in the past, and you have tragedy szekspirowskÄ… / greck on your hands, proceed with caution.
