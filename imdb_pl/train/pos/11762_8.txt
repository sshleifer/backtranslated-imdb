Have you ever gone to sports in your life, tried your best, and then found yourself in an important segment, where for a short while you had the chance to become a hero and master and. . failed? I believe that many of us have had this moment in our lives. That is the premise of the movie "The Best of Times." In this story, the medieval banker named Jack Dundee (Robin Williams) suffers from the deep melancholy of the football mistake that occurred many years ago is inspired to re-play this game. . again. To achieve this, he must convince the once-great football player Reno Hightower (Kurt Russell) to return. For Reno, who is happy with his current life, there is no need to change a past record that is getting better as it gets older. Both of these problems include the fact that years have passed, and moreover, their marriages are trembling and require reconstruction. It is not easy when his father-in-law (Donald Moffat) usually reminds him of the greatest decline. Nevertheless, Dundee is persistent and will do anything to try to fix the biggest mistake in his life. Great fun for anyone who wants to enjoy their youth again. ***
