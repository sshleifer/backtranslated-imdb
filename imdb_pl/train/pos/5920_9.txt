The American icon Henry Fonda depicts "Elegant" John Howard, an aging truck driver who, after a long stay in the hospital, took over his beloved huge platform "Eleanor", which forced him to skip payment. Deciding that he would like to make another perfect run, he got out of the hospital, stole Eleanor and got involved with an old friend Penelope Pearson (Eileen Brennan), who needs to move his group of prostitutes. /> <br /> The wonderful performance of Fondasa is a natural anchor for a film that lures the heart strings as effectively as it tickles fun bones in more comedy scenes. An excellent cast, including Robert Englund, as a reluctant young sidekick, Susan Sarandon (who also receives a loan for co-producers), and Dub Taylor (delightful ham, as always, in the most blatantly comic part of the picture) helps immensely. br /> <br /> Ultimately, the life-affirming character of the painting and the thrilling journey carries an incredible weight; it is an image that, if you get involved in it, you can remember long after it's finished. <br /> <br /> The promise of an open road is clearly visible here; the village looks beautiful. Included with the wonderful music of Craig Safans, this is an extraordinary picture in terms of aesthetics. <br /> <br /> He loses something in the finale (characters played by John Byner and Austin Pendleton are not much more than intrusions), but he still retains good vibes thanks to the attractiveness of his main characters. <br /> <br /> Not at all such a drone image / drive-in that you can expect from the title (especially its alternative title, "The Great Smokey Roadblock"), is a satisfying movie experience that I can recommend without reservation. <br /> <br /> 9/10
