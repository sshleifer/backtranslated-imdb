As other reviewers have noted, this is one of Tarzan's best films. However, unlike others, I like the beginning of the movie because it seems to me that it is a fairly accurate representation of what commercial post must have looked like. In addition, an exposure is needed so that we know why Harry wants to return to the jungle. In addition, the beginning of the movie contains one of the most exciting and frightening chase sequences in history. This happens when the Harry's safari group must outrun the cannibal tribe. The pre-censorship values ​​add a lot of realism, genuinely portraying the terrible dangers that Europeans have to face in the jungle. The film also offers, though perhaps earlier, a detailed description of how terribly Africans were treated by their white employers. Besides, sexy Jane, thousands of elephants, a few great sets and two chety! You can not miss the classic adventure.
