If it turns out that you need an escape, something that will keep your attention for two hours and let you get lost in another world, Domino will satisfy that need. It's entertainment at last! The plot keeps your brain moving - one of those movies (like Usual Suspects) where you want to see it a second time to figure it out. I was wondering about Domino Harvey herself, how her life got interested in Hollywood. When it comes to acting, many star performances are not shown in trailers. And every actor who makes me forget who they are, did his job well. Not once did I think about Kierz in football uniform or in a pirate costume. And he admitted that Mickey Rourke plays Mickey Rourke well and often, but here, despite violence, he shows signs of being able to take care of other people.
