OLIVER TWIST was supposed to have controversy as well as success after Dickens published it in 1837. His image of life in the city ghettos was something shocking and new, and making him the main character of the novels of criminals was another innovation. /> <br /> One day he walked around London and passed a young woman with whom he was friendly. He said hello, but she was rather stiff to him. He could not understand it. A few days later, they met again and asked what he had done to upset her. "Well, if you must know, I did not like your last novel," she said. "Everyone really thinks about it very well." He was surprised: "What's wrong with that?" "Oh, Charles," she said, "I'm a Jew. How could you create a character like Fagin ?! "He did not expect it:" Well ... you know this process from last year's Ike Solomon, the thief's trainer. He's a model for Fagin, and he was a Jew. " <br /> <br /> Dickens said he did not settle the matter. "Yes," she replied, "he got what he deserved. But Charles, they did not call him "Jew Solomon", as you call Fagin a "Jew"! In addition, Solomon did not plan murder. Dickens had to admit that he might have been kidnapped. He left thinking about what she said. <br /> <br /> Oliver Twist has been published in several editions. Dickens tried to improve Fagin a bit. Then he came up with the idea. He rewrote the chapter "Fagin's Last Night Alive", showing the man's fears of hanging. He also added additional details. <br /> <br /> He let his friend know about his decision to change Fagin. About a day later, he met her at a friend's house. She looked at him like he was crazy. "Did not you like the change?" He asked. "Charles, what is changing - he is still a wicked villain called" Jew "! "Yes, I stopped them, but you did not see how terrified he was in the death cell in prison. The young woman noticed this, but she felt that he was so mean that he deserved such fears. "Ah ... then I was right about it ... and did you see the little details I added?" He asked. "What details?" She answered. "When you see Fagin for the first time, he's cooking dinner now ... are you reading this?", Dickens looked at her, expecting a sign of recognition. Instead, the lady looked confused. "I read that he was by the fireplace, but I had to review the passage." Dickens smiled, as if he was brilliant: "He cooks pork sausage for dinner." "What!" She cried. "He eats pork, my dear ... you see - he is not a good Jew!" His friend looked at him, shook his head and left his friend's house to his horror. She has not talked to him for years. <br /> <br /> Dickens never shook off his bigots, but the situation led to a partial attempt to fix his latest completed novel. IN OUR MUTUAL FRIEND (1865), he has a small figure, Mr. Riah, who is used by an unscrupulous owner to collect high rents from poor tenants. The owner claims that Mr. Riah will be blamed because he is a Jew. <br /> <br /> But Mr. Riah is a good man. He is a very good man. He is a very, very, very, very good man - so good that he is unbelievable. If Fagin saw Mr. Riah in action, he would probably chase him with a stick. <br /> <br /> The anti-Semitic picture of Fagin continues to this day. It is a measure of Dickens' genius as a writer who overcomes this novel. However, when presenting the story in the film, it still causes problems for screenwriters and directors: how can the film approach to a decent novel without fanatical fanatics be done after the Holocaust? David Lean showed how through Alec Guinness appears in one or two scenes showing the human side and confronting the crowd at the end with real dignity. Sir Carol Reed, in his musical version of the novel, did it even better, due to the rewriting of the original musical scenario. <br /> <br /> OLIVER was transformed into a musical hit of the West End in the mid-1960s and then he was taken to Broadway, where he was again a hit. With the great score of Lionel Bart, including "Food Glorious Food", "I review the situation", "Think about it", "Boy For Sale", "Who will buy", "How long does he need me", he deserves his success. Reed was good at casting roles, including his nephew Oliver Reed as Sykes, Ron Moody as Fagin, Mark Lester as Oliver, Jack Wild as Dodger, Shani Wallis as Nancy and Harry Secombe as Mr. Bumble. For the last ten years, there have been no great musical successes in Hollywood - the last musical that won the Oscar for the best painting was GIGI in 1958. OLIVER won it in 1968. <br /> <br /> And Fagin - how to deal with the eternal problem of caricature? In the musical, Fagin is not caught, judged and executed for murder. In the end, even Lean showed that Fagin tried to control his confederate in his actions. But here, Fagin realizes that he's getting too old to rely on this kind of life. Although he loses his treasures (the stolen items he kept because he knew their value and admired their beauty), he decides he can reform himself. He has permission to do so, accompanied by a faithful acolyte, an ingenious smart-wrestler. I think Dickens would not appreciate this change (his friend may have), but today's audience certainly accepts this change.
