OK, where should I start? ... This movie changed my life! The story was fluid. James Cahill went out alone. Initially, after the first look, I was disappointed that I did not see him on the silver screen. However, this was before the discovery of many DVD features !!!! The commentary of my god Jakes Cahill to the film was almost as impeccable as his acting. talked about the secrets of the industry used in the film, which you will gain only with experience. <br /> <br /> I was very impressed with the other actors. The scene in which the bodyguard is talking to the girl in the hall, reminded me of some of my favorite blue (pornographic) movies. I am certainly with Gangsta when she expresses her disappointment with the lack of continuity. <br /> <br /> I'm still delighted to watch any involved martial arts skills, just a school-tailored ... and maybe a guy who's stalling! All in all a timeless classic and the best movie that will come out of Europe for years! where are my Oscars at dawn !!!!!!!!!!!
