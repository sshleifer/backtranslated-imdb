I rented this movie in the form of a DVD, without knowing anything, part of the winter marathon watching every evening of the movie. After a few terrible American adventure movies (Ballistic, Daredevil, Cradle of Life) Zhu Warriors hit me as a genius original movie. The story is a complete nonsense, but honesty, goodness and total lack of irony I found in the film, and the film looks spectacular. Of course, special effects are not technically as flawless as those produced by Hollywood, but the filmmakers are more interested in color, composition and movement than realism, so many shots are breathtaking. With one shot, two superhuman figures stand on the rocky spiers of rock, before them a huge moon rises, the image perfectly balanced by three elements. In another, the princess warrior blows through the heavens behind her glowing sword like a bullet seeking heat. Colors explode from shot to shot, used to express emotions, not to represent reality. <br /> <br /> The heroes have the same simplicity and immediacy of the characters of the comics, without offering the depth of themselves, but referring to the archtypes that resonate deeper. Physically, several actors are amazingly beautiful. They play their roles straight, without irony and deception, so they are reliable. <br /> <br /> The most strange of all, despite the clumsiness of the plot and thin characteristics, I found myself very close to the tears at the end, touched by the beautiful simplicity of the actors and the extremely original, friendly vision of the director. <br /> <br />
