Samuel Fuller is an interesting filmmaker, mainly because he had a very inconsistent policy in his films. While "Shock Corridor" and "The Naked Kiss" represented the hypocrisy of America and America's madness, and "The Big Red One" was an effective portrait of the horrors of war, "Merrill's Marauders" painted the war as an essential hell and "Pickup on South Street" deals with dangers communist spies. All of his films make watching very funny, and Fuller was often categorized as a filmmaker, but Fuller was as good as any of the main studio performers. "Pickup on South Street" is no exception and despite outdated motives, the style of film is extremely ahead. It is also a very fast, compact and sometimes brutal film noir. <br /> <br /> Acting is fantastic. Richard Widmark creates for a great antihero, and Jean Peters is quite sexy as a girl who works for her communist spy. Thlema Ritter, however, is a spectacular thief in an absolutely delightful performance as a police stool. The angles Fuller employs are great, making the action sequences more exciting and violent (this is very violent for their time). The camera keeps moving, just as Tarantino and his school would do it forty years later. "Pickup on South Street" is a great noir thriller in action. "Shock Corridor" remains my favorite Fuller movie, but it is very close. (8.10)
