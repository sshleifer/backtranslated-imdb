I recently saw this film in Sky Cinema ... I must admit that it was a really good western with 2 big names. On the one hand is Charlton Heston, who plays the infamous and retired lawyer Samuel Burgade. On the other hand ... The dead James Coburn playing the wicked Zacha Provo .. seeking revenge on Burgade regardless of the price ..! <br /> <br /> Good things in this movie were really good characters. Most of the actors played very well .. Especially James Coburn, who I think was really mean in this movie .. But how was it ... <br /> <br /> Christopher Mitchum, who I "saw everywhere in other movies ... Playing in Brickman Hall. I felt that his character had been left out in the cold, but he manages to recover, joining forces with Burgade to overthrow the posse of Provo! / In conclusion, it was a great movie .. Very good to watch .. Great result of the late Jerry Goldsmith ... <br /> <br /> A great piece of the western personality ..! 8 out of 10.
