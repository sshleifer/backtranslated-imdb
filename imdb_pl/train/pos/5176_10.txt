The film must see everyone who has ever gone to camp or wanted. This film captures the absolute essence of what a summer camp is. It's funny, it's compassionate that makes you want to watch more about characters when the credits start to play a role. If you have not seen this movie ... what are you doing? take off your butt and run the video store. Successful summer :)
