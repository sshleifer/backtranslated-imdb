In New Orleans, an illegal immigrant feels sick and goes out of the game of poker, while winning a small criminal Blacki (Walter Jack Palance). He is chased by Blacki, and his men Raymond Fitch (Zero Mostel) and Poldi (Guy Thomajan), killed by Blacki, and his body is thrown into the sea. During the autopsy, Lieutenant Commander Lieutenant Dr Clinton Reed (Richard Widmark) of the US Public Health Service states that the dead man had pulmonary plague caused by rats and must find a person who had contact with a man in forty-eight hours to avoid epidemic. The mayor of the city appoints Skeptic Captain Tom Warren (Paul Douglas) to help Dr. Clint find the murderers infected with the plague and instill them. <br /> <br /> "Panic on the streets" reveals a simple story, but it is still effective and has a great villain. The captivating plot was not dated after fifty-seven years. Jack Palance performs base scum on his debut, and the camera works when he tries to escape from Zero Mostel is still very impressive. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "PÃ¢nico nas Ruas" ("Panic in the Streets")
