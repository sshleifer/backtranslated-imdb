A young cat tries to steal the soul of his brothers before he dies, but he only gets half, then he has to go on an adventure to get the other half ... or maybe not. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I'm not sure what's going on in this movie, which is full of very strange, very surreal images, some of which parents may find disturbing (eg cats cut off a part of a pig that is traveling with them and frying them like bacon, which all three of them). <br /> <br /> This is a very strange movie that some people have compared to Hello Kitty on acid, I think it looks more like Hello Kitty from Dali. (Certainly it is more vivid than Destino, which was directly based on his work). <br /> <br /> If you feel like a very minor movie that will challenge your perception of things, see this movie. Just be ready for some very strange images that will be burnt in your memory forever. <br /> <br />
