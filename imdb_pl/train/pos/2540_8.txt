Although it is not as famous as some of their other collaborations (such as THE BLACK CAT and THE BODY SNATCHER), it is a small horror, though the casting decisions were a bit strange. Boris Karloff plays doctor Janos Rukh, a strange scientist who lives in the Carpathians - near Dracula's family city. Bela Lugosi plays Dr. Beneta - whose nationalities have never been discussed, although the name certainly sounds French. I really think it would make sense to have two switching roles, because the role of the Carpathians seems to be adapted to Lugosi - especially with his accent. However, despite this extraordinary turnaround, both of them continued to do a great job. Karloff was definitely the main role, but Lugosi considered himself a relatively normal person - something he did not play very often in movies !! It seems that Dr. Rukh is a bit pariah, as other scientists (especially Benet) believe, that his theories are bizarre and pointless. However, during the film Rukh turns out to be right, and Benet is particularly generous in his new praise for Rukh. But, unfortunately, the wonderful new element that Rukh discovered, has a nasty side effect of turning it into a crazy killing machine (do not you hate it when it happens?). Although it could just be a simple, nice story of a scientist, the plot was well constructed, the figures were well developed, and crazy Rukh was NOT a one-dimensional killer, but a complex and interesting one. <br /> <br /> This film will appeal to everyone, except for people who hate old horror films. You can really say that Universal Pictures turned off all stops and made a movie with a bigger budget instead of cheap quickies for both Lugosi and Karloff, unfortunately, in later years. Good stuff.
