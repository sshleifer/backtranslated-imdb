It will be a bit short. First of all, do not listen to critics because it's not as bad as most say! Sniper uses the classic film formula, which many immediately reject as a disadvantage of the film. While the sniper does not reflect 100% of the truth about how military snipers operate in our country, he gives those who know nothing about Professional Sniper an insight into the Sniper world. And yes, the film has many disadvantages, but what movie does not it? There are many good scenes and good acts by Tom Berenger. I must say that the two worst scenes are at the beginning of the movie, in which Billy Zane in the helicopter, followed by Zane at the Marine bar. The best scene in the Sniper is Berenger in the middle of the field with the opposite force sweeping him !! There are also many good jungle shots and some classic shots with the camera, as if you were looking through a telescope. And yes, the Sniper's Motto is "one shot, one killing". Judge Sniper for yourself !! <br /> <br />
