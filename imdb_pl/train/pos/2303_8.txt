A MAN IN THE MOON is a warm and moving drama of maturation focusing on the farming family in the 1950s. The main story is about a 14-year-old girl (Reese Witherspoon) who falls in love with a 17-year-old neighbor (Jason London), who ends up with her older sister (Emily Warfield) and how the unexpected tragedy changes the dynamics of this family forever. The 1950's are beautifully recalled here, and the script gives you characters you care about almost immediately. Witherspoon is starting to show the Oscar winner, who will develop in this early role, and London is a charming leading man. Warfield gives old age to older sister who is also effective. Kudos for Sam Waterston and Tess Harper, who play the girls' parents and Gail Strickland, who plays London mum. I was unexpectedly moved by this silent and influencing drama, which arouses strong emotions and gives a deeper meaning to the term "family ties".
