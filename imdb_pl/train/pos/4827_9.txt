And that's why historical / biographical films are so important to us all and, moreover, when they are as well done as this! <br /> <br /> Before I saw "The Young Victoria", I knew a few things about Queen Victoria, but in the end I learned a lot more about it. <br /> <br /> Emily Blunt is just GREAT as Victoria (Who would have guessed!) and will probably be nominated this year for the Oscar. I personally support her ... <br /> <br /> On technical matters I am glad that it is a very successful production, with a wonderful Art Direction / Set Decoration and, of course, as it was expected to be a great periodic costume! <br /> <br /> The only drawback is that I want to see more and find out more about this interesting queen, but most of all an amazing woman and mother! <br /> <br /> BRAVO: 9 out of 10!
