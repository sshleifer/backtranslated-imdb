Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer is a very lost player on the short market of cartoons. This market is basically dominated by Looney Tunes shorts and Merry Melodies from Warner Bros. But MGM is also able to release hidden gems, such as "To Spring", an amazing story about the most beautiful time of the year. /> <br /> In the environment shown here, spring is not caused by natural cycles, but it is fabricated. And who? By small male elves that live underground. Every spring, when the snow begins to melt, they start to work. They begin by felling the columns from the rainbow rock, and then reduce them to rubble and use this debris to transform it into colorful fluids that will be transferred to the ground and carry grass, flowers ... In other words, spring! The first half of the cartoon represents the spring factory, but the second half is slightly different. He returns Old Man Winter and tries to extend the winter, destroying the work of the elves. From that moment we help in the fight between elves and Old Man Winter. <br /> <br /> The music here is heard wonderfully wonderful. The melodic parts are stuck in the head like a stain of ink on a piece of paper. The melodies of the second part are exciting and perfectly match the action. It is simply fantastic, Giorgio! Animation sequences are also joy. The colors are well mixed up, and every little detail is shown in a huge, epic environment. The concept itself is brilliant. Elves attract characters, like Old Man Winter, which effectively depicts the cold and ruthless feelings of the season. <br /> <br /> There is also a strong message here. The end of the battle seems to be lost to the elves, until one of the elves arriving will jump into action and lead the Elves to victory over the winter. The point is that only one person can change something. <br /> <br /> In summary, "To Spring" is an unusual lost classic from the times of short cartoons. What's even more unusual, the director of this cartoon made his debut here. Who is the director of "To Spring"? It's a William Hanna ...
