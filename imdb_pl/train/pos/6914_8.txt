This film contains one of Richard Dreyfuss's greatest performances as an actor who plays a dictator and does so convincingly that his own mother does not detect a cheater. Also this movie is fun, but it also has a serious side. What is particularly intriguing in this film is the figure of Madonna, who is the mistress of the dictator, but ultimately becomes the leader of the country. The evolution of Madonna from the master to the political leader greatly influenced the quality of the story and the entertainment value of the film. And the main character, who at the beginning of the movie is a difficult actor and a bit of buffoon, also evolves and enjoys respect at the end of the film. I liked the movie.
