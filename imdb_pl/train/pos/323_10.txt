It's a really great movie with a revolutionary message (both in form and content), which should not be missed by any fan of the French new wave or underground film. They barely open and close - we just fall into the world of consumer art, revolution and youth. This film has little to do with the document and is more interesting in playing with our ideas for advertising and its relation to reality. Real and unreal lines are crossed in a manner known from films discussing a document, but this time we do it because of consumption and marketing, not describing reality.
