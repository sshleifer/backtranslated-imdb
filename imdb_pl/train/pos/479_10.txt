Natalia Emily Watson is absolutely the most loving and romantic main character I have ever seen on screen. She is undoubtedly the queen of this film. Is it also transformed into a king? The intricate turning of chess games and the fight of families for control, power and victory are staggering. Just as chess masters do in the film, the director plays many games with our mind at the same time, but they all become intertwined with large or smaller patterns. Period, costumes and images of the Italian lake district from the beginning of the 20th century are wonderfully captured. One square of space is not wasted. <br /> <br /> So many great scenes are abundant, I can not count them all. I recommend budgeting enough time to watch the movie twice, perhaps within a week's interval, because you can not capture all the poetry in a 64-square, but multidimensional layout in one setting. <br /> <br /> I did not read Nabakov's book, but to try out the analogy of my own, what I read reminds me of another romantic triumphant poetic film like the game, Barry Levinson's The Natural. He completely rejected the unsuccessful ending of the fatalistic book by Bernard Malamud for romantic Impressionism, which was exceptionally American. Well, the director did it better, seamlessly combining Russian and Italian customs and customs as a background for enlightenment. The real story is that games are a zero sum; there is a winner and a loser, unless both competitors come to an end. But in life, and especially in the context of our immortal souls, we are limited only by these limitations and conventions of life to the extent that we allow others to break our spirit. <br /> <br /> Pure love, personified by Natalia Emily Watson, may exceed and let everyone strengthen us with their gifts at the same time. Only barriers raised by our fears can cut us off. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie (10/10).
