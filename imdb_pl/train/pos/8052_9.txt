This movie is not a kung fu movie. It's a comedy about kung fu. And if before Sammo Hung did not spend some time watching movies of the great French comic writer Jaques Tati (eg Esp. Jour de fÃªte), it certainly has the same wavelength. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think Tati movies are fun; but they are not for all tastes. Some have told me that they hate his job. I never guessed why, but I think it's because the character that Tati usually plays in is so completely dead, so it's not affected by the surrounding event (which usually causes) that many miss the more subtle with comical pieces of it. <br /> <br /> In any case, Tati's main theme - or at least his best-known - is taking a pretentiously small bourgeoisie with nineteenth-century sensitivity and dropping him into the twentieth-century France, where he has to face society is largely defined by the gradual destruction of these sensitivities. He usually has serious difficulties with small things such as turntables or radios. It is a threat in the car, but the world is not safer when it rides a bicycle. But by all this he never loses his confidence, which results from his inner recognition that the nineteenth century was more interesting than the twentieth century. <br /> <br /> In a similar way the figure of Sammo Hung is played by a boy from a country who comes to the big city of Hong Kong, completely convinced that what makes the city interesting is that Bruce Lee did kung fu movies there. It makes him have little trouble because he takes quick events that will never be noticed in a small town, but which are considered unsuitable in a big city - such as when it seems to urinate on the street, the cop stops him, just to discover that Hung is just squeezing water out of his shirt, soaked in an accidental immersion in the bay. Interestingly, in this gag, why Hung does not understand what is going on in the confusion of the policeman - in the town, until no one is watching, if you have to go, you have to go. In other words, Hung does not urinate on the street - but he would do it - and what kind of problem officer? Obviously Hung's obsession with Bruce Lee also causes him trouble. He beats a gang of bandits who refused to pay the uncle of the restaurant owner. Of course, in Bruce Lee's film, the bandits will be considered resurrected and would learn their lessons. But in Hong's Hong Kong, unfortunately, the reality wins, and the bandits return when he is not around to provoke his uncle. <br /> <br /> Of course, Hung finally triumphs, as always Tati. Such characters must always triumph (at least in comedy) because they are completely innocent and as such, despite comical errors and misunderstandings, they really represent what is best in the people we admire and want to be. We really do not want to be Bruce Lee (who must experience the loss of all his friends before he gets a chance to defeat the evil guy), we, in our own innocence, really want a world where Lee's characters are possible. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this world only exists on the film. <br /> <br /> "Ah, but what if ...?" - and in this question we find Sammo Hung in his comic book best.
