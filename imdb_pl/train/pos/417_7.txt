This movie has together Wild Bill Hickok, Calamity Jane, Buffalo Bill and General Custer. Gary Cooper plays Wild Bill and Jean Arthur plays Calamity Jane and Charles Bickford play a bad guy who sells weapons to Indians and finds it hard to recognize. For the first time Cecil B. DeMille and Gary Cooper worked together, and the next movie that was made was basically the same, but set at a different time. This film begins with the Lincoln killing and also applies to the Indian War. Calamity Jane is in love with Wild Bill, and Buffalo Bill is married and wants to stay home. This film also deals with Custer's last booth and is far from accurate. Gary Cooper is good as usual and I usually do not like Jean Arthur, but I liked her here.
