It must be the best movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Combine breathtaking photos with a great acting and thrilling plot and you'll get a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Dog Bite Dog grabbed me by the edge of my seat during some scenes, stepping back in horror at others, and left me drowning in my own tears after a tragic ending. <br /> <br /> The film left a deep impression on me. These shockingly violent scenes contrasted sharply with the moving and delicate scenes of "love". The film does not deserve the Cat III rating (nakedness); there are no naked scenes and the "love" scenes do not even include kissing or "doing". <br /> <br /> The message that this movie presented to me? All human beings, no matter how violent or cruel they may seem, have a delicate side. Edison Chen does a great job playing the role of murderous Pang. <br /> <br /> I am evaluating this film 10/10. It's a must-watch.
