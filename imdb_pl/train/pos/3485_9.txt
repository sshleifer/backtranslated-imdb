This Wrestlemania just did not do it for me. While some things, such as the royal battle and the involvement of celebrities, were a return to the good old days, so to speak, it seemed to be more sublime "in your home" than anything else. Above average ... worth a few matches, such as the tag team title match, although it is worth noting that the title change did not mean anything because it was reversed the next night.
