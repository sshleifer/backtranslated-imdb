I recently watched it on the Sundance channel. The idea of ​​the film was to bring many filmmakers, distinguished in their own country, to make short films, eleven of them in one film, focusing on one topic: 11 September. <br /> <br /> From the struggle in this film, I could tell why these filmmakers were great in their country because they had all the elements of a great movie. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a film from Iran, in which the teacher tries to teach students what happened on September 11, which they do not realize until later. <br /> <br /> The second film from France concerns deaf women who angrily write a letter to a lover while she is not aware of what is happening on television. <br /> <br /> The next film from Egypt assumes that the filmmaker himself is talking to a dead soldier about recent events not only about the terrorists of September 11, but about bombing in other places. <br /> <br /> the next comes from Bolivia, in which the girl learns about the events of September 11 and believes that they must march for them. <br /> <br /> Next from the country in Africa, in which a group of boys follows a man whom they consider to be Bin Ladin. <br /> <br /> The next comes from Mexico, where nothing is shown, but the sounds of that day. <br /> <br /> Next from Israel, with the participation of a reporter on the place of a bomb trying to get a report, but often talk about attacks. <br /> <br /> There are other movies that I can "remember right now, but all of them are powerful. It will restore your emotions from that day. <br /> <br /> 10/10
