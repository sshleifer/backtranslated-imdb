After watching Arthur on TV, I laughed so many times that Dudley Moore's role as Arthur the happy lucky drunk millionaire was hysterical, but John Gielgud as his servant / father Hobson was equally charming. I bought a DVD a few weeks ago and watched it, despite the passage of almost 27 years is still as pleasant as ever the role of Liza Minnelli, as the interest in love was fascinating, chemistry between them was magical. <br /> <br /> Arthur Bach, (Moore) is a spoiled drunk millionaire who has a bar account that sounds like a national debt he does not want to grow up and likes to act like a child. His activity is overseen by his English dry butler Bobson (Gielgud). Looks like no one cares for Arthur, except him, Arthur's father (Barbour) offers an ultimatum, if he does not marry a horrible blonde named Susan Johnson (Eikenberry), he will cut off his son's legacy of 750 million dollars for four weeks. <br /> <br /> However, Artur meets and falls in love with Linda Marolla (Minnelli), a young waitress of the working class and thief neckties, now faces a difficult decision to marry out of love or money. When Hobson dies, Arthur eventually grows up and interrupts him with Susan before marriage, leaving him both money and real love. <br /> <br /> Arthur is a really charming romantic comedy for everyone
