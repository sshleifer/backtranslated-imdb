First of all, no one can understand why this movie is so badly evaluated. This is not only the first really frightening movie for a long time for me, who has quite a tough experience with many years of horror experience, ranging from riding through dark rides (ghost trains) as a child. Secondly, the main actress Cheri Christian has a face that allows her to hope that she will be the leading actress in the most important photos of the future. Thirdly, this woman is so incredibly beautiful that I suggest that directors withdrew from all of Cameron Diazes, Eva Mendezes, and however the names of these ephemeral lamps are. Mrs. Christian is not light, but the sun. <br /> <br /> However, "Dark Remains" are also of great metaphysical importance. The idea that photographs show the essence of indirect rule between reality and "imagination" that are not visible with their own eyes is not new. But I have never seen in the film before that these creatures are visible in the pictures only for some people and only for specific times. This means that a photo is not only an iconic image of reality (thanks to which reality turns into a sign), but it becomes an alternative form of reality that can change as the "real" reality. Changing the sign means that it affects the photographed objects, i.e. The sign behaves like an object. Now, in our ordinary world of perception, objects often change characters. F. if someone grows a bird, his photo will show him a beard, not without, as it was before. But the opposite, changing the objects with the help of signs would mean that the picture with the beard is first and only then the beard grows on the man. This is a very straightforward case, which takes place in the case of photographs taken by the main character in prison in this film. This is new and we must be grateful for everything new in horror that usually repeats and changes the order of effects and functions that are already well known, mainly from the time of silence.
