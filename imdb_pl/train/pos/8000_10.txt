... do not read any summary of the plot, because the story may seem trivial, dead and meaningless. The film is perfect, the acting of both Denzel and Dakota (goes high, trust me) are simply fantastic, and the plot is amazing. Actually, "fantastic" is a small word that can be used for such talented actors. The film is based only on facts, and some characters are not fictitious, which is a shock I had during and after the film. If you like both actors and some crazy movies, you still have not watched your favorite yet ... Trust me, in the end you will have a strange and inexplicable feeling. The movie is amazing, see it, rent it, buy it or whatever ... just do not miss it
