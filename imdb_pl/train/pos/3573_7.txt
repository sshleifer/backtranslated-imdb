this film was almost a great movie with imagination. A mix of Shakespeare, pop, jazz and fairy tales. This film was an ingenious twist about Cinderella. This film has a strong cast, headed by Kathleen Turner, who is perfectly staffed. Everything except production values. I almost never think that the film needs special effects or large budgets, but with such a large production, as this one, it came out with the same obscene quality as any other TV movie. In addition to better photos, this movie was almost perfect. <br /> <br />
