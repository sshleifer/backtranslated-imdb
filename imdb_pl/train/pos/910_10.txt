It's nice to see Suraj Barjatya back in what's best. A story woven around a marriage. It's nice to have a movie that does not have one scene that you would avoid with your family. Although the story is simple and does not contain any new elements, you still like the movie, because of the presentation, performances, or actually the whole treatment. Hats off to Suraj .. The movie tells us that commitment leads to love. Presenting changes in the way of thinking, behaving after engagement is excellent. The director definitely thought about it, and the actors did it perfectly. Although the movie is slow, it does not bother you because you are so involved in the story that you just want to keep watching the joy of this new engaged couple. As a typical RajShree material, it has many sentimental scenes that can make the viewer cry (especially ladies). But when you leave the cinema, you are very happy and you feel that the ticket was worth it :-).
