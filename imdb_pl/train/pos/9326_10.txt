I have to be honest and say I bought this movie, not because of the content, but because David Cubitt is in it; I know ... shallow or what? - but, come on, Mr. Cubitt is a fantastic actor, to put it mildly. <br /> <br /> I really did not know what to expect after watching this movie, I read the second one, and those on other sites, but I must say that I was drawn into the world of brothers almost from the very beginning. David Cubitt as Theo and Colm Feore as Ryan are as trustworthy as two foreign brothers, the movie moves in their relationship when they start to get to know each other again after their father's death. A scene in which Theo finds out that Ryan is gay, she was great, literally entering the stage and trying to leave without noticing Ryan - which of course he has. <br /> <br /> The film has been very well researched and is therefore extremely sad, moving, uplifting and celebrating life in parts. I left this feeling of sadness over what Ryan had gone through, but also with the knowledge that the old drug addict, Theo, gave him hope and unconditional love. I agree with another reviewer who finds a scene where Theo says he will be a moving father, and I went a little further to say that I actually called my thoughts to Ryan when he cruelly says to Theo "What makes you think that you can be a father, and Theo simply says "You". Theo goes away then, but this small exchange of opinions shows the almost self-loving aspect of Ryan, who is being sharply raised by a simple retort. <br /> <br /> A well thought out movie in every respect, acting, directing, writing etc. are so well made. I really can not find anything else to say about this movie, except to say that it's very difficult to deal with the death of a loved one, but it's going great, to an infinite degree. Respect for the theme and the outpouring of love (without repentance and stupidity) speaks in this rather selfish world in which we live today. Well done for everyone interested. <br /> <br /> Few movies lead me to tears and give me a break to think about life in general, and to enjoy all the things that I have and do not be sad because of things I do not do, but this movie did it was incredibly uplifting considering the subject.
