We always watch American films with their particular accents from each region (south, west, etc.). We have the same here. All foreigners must watch this film and must have an open mind to accept a different culture, besides American and European almost dominate in the cinema industry. <br /> <br /> This movie tells us about a parallel world that is not even for those who live in a big city like São Paulo. All actors improvise and are very realistic. The camera gives us an idea of ​​their mixed world, loneliness of each character and invites us to share our world. <br /> <br /> It's a really great movie, and the worst rent even at home.
