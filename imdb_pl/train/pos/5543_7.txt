A very well made and frightening horror film from the PRC label, which usually produces really bad movies, such as DEVIL BAT or THE FLYING SERPENT. The German foreign director Wisbar does wonders with a small budget and his set of swamps in the studio. The thin and weird Charles Middleton is effective as a Strangler.
