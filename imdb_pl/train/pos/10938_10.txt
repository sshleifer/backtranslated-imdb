I rarely find a movie so completely satisfying that I have to talk about it immediately. This movie is definitely one of the best entertainment available and it is very authentic. I happened to see the dubbing version, but I'm on my way to download a DVD remaster with the original Chinese dialogue. Despite this, dubbing did not bother and sometimes provided humorous humor: "Poison Clan conquers the world !!!" <br /> <br /> The story remains true to Chinese methods of intrigue, tension and interpersonal relations. You can expect twists and turns when you reveal the identity of 5 venoms and expert pace. <br /> <br /> Martial arts choreography is a class in itself and you have to believe it. It's like watching real animals fighting with each other, but constructed from their own secret forms of martial arts. This level of skill among the cast is unrivaled in contemporary cinema. <br /> <br /> The combination provides a serious dose of old Chinese culture and I recommend it only on the basis of the real intention of the film, to tell the story of art and mastering its implementation. ... Of course, if you just want to see how people are pounding each other, together with the primitive forms of ancient Chinese torture, be my guest!
