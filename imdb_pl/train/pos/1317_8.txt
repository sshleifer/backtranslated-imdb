This anime was underestimated and it still is. There is not much children's film, as I have noticed, I keep coming back to this 10 years after I saw it for the first time. One of the better movies released. <br /> <br /> Animation, while it's not perfect, is good, camera tricks give her a 3D feel, and the story is still so good even today when I grew up and saw amateurs like Neon Genesis Evangelion and RahXephon. Nowhere is approaching to the depths, but try to see it from a light view. This is a story that should be entertained, not questioned. <br /> <br /> I'm still one of my favorites, I'm back when I feel like giggling over more light animes. Not to mention children's films, there are surprisingly sad moments in this, and you need to have a sense of humor to see everything.
