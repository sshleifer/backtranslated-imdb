This movie is amazing and I recommend it to both children and adults. The animation is beautiful, the characters are rich and interesting, and the story is addictive; much better than anything that the US studios were producing at the time. However, there are several objections to this statement. It is a pity that Disney bought the back catalog Studio Ghibli, and then proceeded to the massacre. My point is that Disney once again called the film, even though the original English version is very impressive. A new cast with Van Der Beek and others ruined him and took away a lot of character attractiveness, eg Pazu and Sheeta went from bold companions to crying teenagers. Original music is also much better than the Disney remix. The question is, why did Disney introduce such changes? It seems to me that thanks to Van Der Beek and others, Disney can draw more money, which is fair enough, but in a process that contaminates, film. It's still a beautiful movie and I still recommend it to everyone. My main beef is that Disney has ruined a childhood movie that I loved and still love. I'm lucky to have an original Japanese import with the original English dub, which I will be watching now!
