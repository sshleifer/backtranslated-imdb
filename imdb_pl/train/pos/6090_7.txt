jealousy is not as funny as I thought it would be at first, but after some reviews I read that it is much more fun than the people who gave it props, now it's true that it's not a gag for a minute, such as zoolander or dodgeball but Ben Stiller and Jack Black work together well, and Christopher Walken is as wonderful as never before, so the story tells about the character of Jack Black, who invents a spray that makes the dog Pooh disappear and Ben does not want any part of it, but when the product is created jack black rich ben starts to see jealousy, it is not great in every respect, and both ben stiller and black jack have fun and better movies under the belt, but if you're a fan or recommend it as a funny movie and I laughed my ass several times because a big fan of Ben Stiller id must say that it's less peace, but still great fun, give him a watch
