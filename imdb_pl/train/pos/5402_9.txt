Hitokiri (who translates more or less as "killing"), a / k / a "Tenchu", which he translates more or less as "divine punishment", presents Hideo Gosha at the top of his form. DO NOT miss this or any other classic Gosha, Goyokin! Hitokiri is not just one of Goshy's best films, it's one of the best samurai / chambara movies ever made, and maybe one of the best Japanese films ever exported. <br /> <br /> Watch out, everything is complicated details of the plot in Hitokiri can be difficult to follow for people who do not know the nineteenth-century history of Japan. Nevertheless, the human drama is obvious and open to all viewers. According to Gosha's standard, Hitokiri provides another variation on his traditional theme, "loyalty to you" in comparison to "doing the right thing." However, Gosha develops his favorite theme with such sophistication that it really is a movie (of course with Goyokin). <br /> <br /> I suppose it breaks down like this: If you want a simpler, more action-oriented Story, it's worth seeing Goyokin. However, if you want a more thoughtful, multi-layered (albeit grim) drama, see this one. <br /> <br /> (OK, OK, basically, the historical background is a huge force between many different samurai clans who are either (1) working on reform, but retaining the Tokugawa Shogunate and (2) those who are trying to install the emperor Meiji as the supreme ruler of Japan.Of course, the clans working "for" Emperor Meiji were often less interested in "reforming" Japan than in providing their own clan with more power in the "new world order." Ironically, the entire feudal system was officially abolished as one from the first reforms of the Meiji government, ironically - which makes the whole plot even more bittersweet.) <br /> <br /> What distinguishes Hitokiri from other Goshy movies is the mature sense of Goshy's cinematography . Each shot is carefully composed and (like Barry Lyndon Kubrick) each frame of the film can remain as a static composition. Of course, this is a typical Gosha. Hitokiri really stands out with stunning scenes, including (like in Goyokin) many exciting sea landscapes. Just watch the opening sequence and you're addicted! Make no mistake, this is not an English periodic song: Hitokiri is very brutal (do not say you were not warned). <br /> <br /> What else, apart from the camera's nice work, distinguishes Hitokiri? Performances seem to me a bit more subtle in this. Katsu Shintaro (z Zatoichi / Hanzo the Razor fame) stars as a conflict hero / anti-hero Okada Izo. Katsu manages to instill the humanity of a character who seems to be a more wild animal than a villain. Throughout the movie, you're never sure whether you're involved or rebellious by Okada. At the same time, Katsu's portrait of a starving hunger of respect and his later pathetic attempts at redemption seems so human that you can not feel empathy / compassion. Of course, after watching Nakadai Tatsuya playing a tortured hero in "Goyokin", it's great to see him playing such a ruthless villain in Hitokiri. It's just perfect, there's nothing more to say! <br /> <br /> As the last note, perhaps more interesting for fans than for ordinary fans, do not miss the last screen of Mishima Yukio (yes, closed gay right-wing ultranationalist novelist who committed suicide seppuku against a crowd of mocking Japanese military personnel who "He kidnapped" in 1970, and he had a film about his life and the work of Paul Schrader) who actually does a fairly solid job of portraying honorary (for the killer) Shinbei Tanaka.
