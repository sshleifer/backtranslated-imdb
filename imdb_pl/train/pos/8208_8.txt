I liked almost all of the films in the Dirty Harry series, except for the one which, in my opinion, is called "Enforcer". "Deadpool" was also a bit weak in areas, but I still liked it. This is one of my favorite series, if it's not about the big line "Go ahead, create my day". This one also contains an interesting, though familiar thread, someone who kills those who have made a mistake. Think of "Magnum Force" with less secret about who is behind the killings, and you have your storyline. It is true that there is a little more than this, because this game has a very nice final game in the theme park. It also contains Dirty Harry, who gets a bulldog as a gift and stumbles over Sandra Locke in a fairly humorous scene. The only question that remains is why Clint Eastwood must have had quite average actress Sandra Locke in many of his films. Each time it lowers the result, even if overall the film is pleasant for me. I admit that it is not bad here, but her character could have been much better than someone else. Another problem with this movie and other films about Dirty Harry, sometimes seem to be gun ads. I like guns in the same way as the next person, but do we really need scenes in which to explain all the strengths of his latest weapon and how many bullets he has? Still, a very nice entry into the film series Dirty Harry.
