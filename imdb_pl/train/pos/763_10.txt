This movie changed it all for me ... I've heard about breakdance and hip-hop, but I've never seen him professionally (hey I was an 11-year-old kid from the Netherlands!) When I saw this movie, everything changed. I was actively involved in the hip hop movement in our city, I started breakdance and wrote lyrics. <br /> <br /> To this day, I consider this film a personal favorite. Of course, filming and the meaning of "cinematographic" may not be so significant. But who cares if the movie was badly filmed, or did you see a microphone hanging over someone? That's what he's doing for you personally, that's what counts ...
