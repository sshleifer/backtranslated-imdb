The key to 40-year-old Virginia is not only that Andy Stitzer is a 40-year-old virgin, but rather the way Steve Carell presents him as one. In the crime genre of "comedy", which is characterized by a lack of humor and addictive characters, the 40-year-old virgin offers a colorful cast and an intelligent, cordial script that does not use his hero as the end of cruel jokes. The fact that Andy is still a virgin at the age of forty is not really a joke, as it is a curiosity. <br /> <br /> Carell, veteran of the Ferrell team at Anchorman and a former member of the Daily Show, uses the concept of film to expand his character? we understand why Andy is what he is. It's small things that make this movie work. When Andy's colleague in the electronics store asks him what he did for the weekend, Andy describes his unsuccessful cooking efforts. When Andy rides a bicycle to work, he signals his turns. Do not just decorate your home with figurines? he paints them and talks to them, and reveals that some of the really old belong to him from childhood. The smaller comedy will not even begin to focus on all these things. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite simplified? Colleague Andy's colleagues find out he never had sex and make it their personal mission to take him to bed with a woman. It's a childish idea and the film does not try to hide its youth. <br /> <br /> Andy's friends complement his neurotic nature: David (Paul Rudd) broke up with his girlfriend more than two years ago, but is still obsessed with her, Jay (Romany Malco) is a male woman, and Cal (Seth Rogen) is a tattooed sextoy. Their attempts to drag Andy into the bag slow down many times and each time leave Andy less and less optimistic. <br /> <br /> Finally, Andy meets lonely mother Trish (played by Catherine Keener) and, to the great disappointment, his disturbing friends who say that mothers are not worth it, falls in love with her. They start a relationship and agree to put off sex for twenty days? Trish is unaware that Andy is still a virgin. <br /> <br /> The 40-year-old Virgin was directed by Judd Apatow, the man who produced Anchorman and The Cable Guy, and launched the short-lived cult TV show Freaks and Geeks. Apatow is famous for its unique sense of humor and script? co-author Carell? offers a lot. <br /> <br /> After all, the most interesting and (even surprising) aspect of the 40-year-old Virgin is its maturity. Until now, you probably know that the film received enthusiastic reviews from critics, and even I was surprised by its warm welcome. But after watching the movie it's easy to understand why. We like Andy. We care for him. Is not he just a banality from a comedy cutout? is a real, living, breathing person. His neurotic features combine the best of Woody Allen with childish naivety. His friends are not unbelievable jerks, and his romance is turbulent and bittersweet. He hits the audience. <br /> <br /> Although this is not an ideal movie and it definitely contains quite primitive insinuations and sexual humor, it does not offend him to the extent that they could have other genre entries because we love people on the screen. The best erotic comedies work this way? from Risky Business to American Pie ?? and this is the main difference between something like a 40-year-old virgin and 40 days and 40 nights.
