I just saw the movie one day when I rented it, and I thought it was going to be another movie with a girl trying to prove her right, but Diane joined the box because she wanted to. I thought this movie was good. I gave him 8/10. Yes, it's good. Plus the movie with Michelle Rodriguez is always good. He even has only six years.
