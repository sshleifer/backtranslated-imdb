I'm a fan of movies about animals. If you can take the story and put the animals as main actors, you will usually win me. Homeward Bound did just that. They made a conspiracy that was as old as time and gave it a new turn. It was a total success. It is a very archetypal film. You have an obscene group (shadow) that is wise and logical, you have a nice but impetuous and distrustful Chance, and an insidious princess who thinks she should be pampered and praised. These three personalities reflect very well. I also like the way in which Chance and Sassy created such dynamic characters and were not late. Most people say that it can not be good because it is too much of a movie for children. They forget, however, that it is supposed to be a movie for children, and it still does not take away from the film. It's a good movie to watch when you're bored and you just want to watch a movie. It's a Disney movie without cartoons, a movie movie with a better story. No doubt I would advise you to watch it.
