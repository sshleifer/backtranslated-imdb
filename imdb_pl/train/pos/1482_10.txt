The best movie about marriage and family. These are very interesting reflections for couples who will come to the dangerous and paradoxical fascinating world of marriage and the family. This decision can be better or worst in our lives and in the lives of our children. Real interference or help from "friends" - or kata, if we leave. The real role of families: they can help or they can destroy us. A mad priest who is probably not too crazy, telling what can happen in accordance with statistics and reality. A couple who thinks in a "special" marriage experience a painful story in their own history. <br /> <br /> Who likes to marry? Nobody after a priest tells his story? if they leave the future in other hands, if they do not know WHAT is a marriage. That problems are real, that life requires a real commitment, a guarantee from everyone. That the real victims of divorce are children, with the real name of Andrea in movies or names. The fact that abortion is just an easy way out: sadness, regret and misfortune will be there after an abortion. That the state and social security think less in real family problems each time. Rumors of "friends", infidelity due to Steffania's weakness and desperation, because Tomasso lives his life as if he were alone. <br /> <br /> Maybe someone could think that this movie is a pessimistic movie, but not. Steffania and Tomasso, in my heart they like beautiful marriage and family, if not, why do they like marriage? A real and beautiful marriage depends only on the couple: on each of their decisions, on every action in their lives. The family can be a place where everyone feels loved because he or she is his or her only because of existence. The scenario is wonderful. The performances are great: Steffania and Tomasso, almost almost a cynical priest! Excellent direction and scenario. Great colors and camera management.
