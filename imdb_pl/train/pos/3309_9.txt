It's a great movie. If this is any indication, Hong Sang-Soo is really "the best kept secret of Asian cinema". It is very similar in style to Tsai Ming-Liang and Hou Hsiao-hsien, and covers many of the same themes as thematically, but I think that I am actually enjoying it all as a whole rather than any of their films. This obvious minimalism is somewhat less pronounced here than in their works, although it still perfectly matches this style (the camera never moves even once), and somehow I found the film to be less "consciously" slow than Tsai Ming-Liang or Hou Hsiao-hsien which in my opinion is the reason why I liked it more. Besides, it does not keep subjects as detached as Hou. I felt that the film is also more "complete" and less open (only barely) than some of their works, although it does not mean that it had much of what resembled a storyline. It would be hard for me to believe that Sophia Coppola was not directly influenced by the film "Lost in Translation" (scenes of a young woman wandering alone, and deteriorating in their hotel room in punk underpants can not help but seem familiar).
