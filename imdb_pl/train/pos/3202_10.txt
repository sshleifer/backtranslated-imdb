I do not understand why many IMDb users do not like this movie. Why do they think it's so scary, etc. It's no worse than anything else. Personally, I think that "Soldier" is a great movie, much better than most other films in the same genre. <br /> <br /> Reasons for which I liked "Soldier": Kurt Russel, Connie Nielsen, Jason Scott Lee, screenplay (David Webb Peoples), great visual effects and direction (Paul Anderson). <br /> <br /> I think that this is the best work I've seen from director Paul Anderson, who previously directed the entertainment of "Mortal Kombat" and not so much fun "Event Horizon".
