this film probably had a budget of $ 750 and still managed to defeat the Titanic. I rented it the day I crashed my mother's car, and that was the only thing that lifted my spirits! it should be linked to "The Assult of the Killer Bimbos". Things to pay attention to are: 1. A Chinese girl riding a blow 2. A scene in a white shirt that never changes 3. A screech that resembles a Flinstone while riding 4. A collision team carried by a redhead just before it arrives killed (no worry, I do not destroy any surprises, because it is very predictable) 5. A guy who thinks he needs to howl. 6. A psychic patient who plays a convincing job of being crazy, throwing out maniquen eyes. 7. One hour chase at the end with the participation of a teacher and a priest. 8. Womman writing graffiti on the bathroom wall. 9. last, but no less important, great special effects - especially a boob jab, which made ... heaven helped me ... loud noise. <br /> <br /> Have fun! <br /> <br />
