The first secret is to guess what the original Welles movie looked like. This makes it a real adventure - to see an incomplete skeleton and take advantage of film forensics, imagine a beautiful woman she once supported. <br /> <br /> If you do, you'll see and experience probably one of the best mystery movies ever. When the secrets go hand in hand, the narrative is rather ordinary: a simple diversion, one jealous husband as a red herring. <br /> <br /> It is wonderful to put this story through Welles in the artificial eye, seeing a dark, dark, multi-faceted world. The first real noir, but even darker. This is not a clearly twisted world, unless you think about the camera. What we see at first hand is someone who creates a vocabulary that will later become commonplace. <br /> <br /> During all the celebrations Kane was successful because of the great drama and history. The camera's eye was shocking, but experimental. Welles would go from there to explore Shakespeare's mysterious narrative and self-determination with that eye. Othello and MacBeth started in this period and I consider them to be part of one vision. <br /> <br /> Noir feels that it depends on the fact that people are not responsible for their lives, even a little - they are manipulated by random factors in the environment. In telling this story, Welles has to transform the environment into a character. Several characters as suspects in secret. <br /> <br /> In this way we have the famous lighting, blocking and angles we know (and since then we have seen countless times). We also have intentionally closed sets: a park, a yacht, a place for a picnic, an aquarium, a dock, a courtroom, a Chinese theater and a play house. I am sure that the barbarians have cut out many "external" narratives, not with character, but with these strange environments. <br /> <br /> My own solution to the secret lies in the fact that the funhouse did, among other environments introduced as suspects. In other words, manipulating Black Irish (who we know from notes and one scene inscribed in the trade union hall was an aspiring novelist) was not: the power of human conspiracy (park or civilized version, courtroom) or nature (picnic or civilized version, aquarium). <br /> <br /> Instead, it was a matter of deliberate whim of the gods for entertainment. This is, of course, a reference to what Welles does: placing these people (including him) in hell for our own whim, which was emphasized by the Beijing Opera with doped Wells. And of course, it leads to a funhouse, where the environment directly manipulates the perception. <br /> <br /> More on the subject of self-referential: he is certainly aware of the comment about his relationship with his exwife soon. But I believe that there is a strong subconscious commentary on their own, mocking environment in which he worked, the studio environment. Certainly Welles was just as confused as his character. And this twist took on the form of the murder of this film, leaving the rotting corpse mentioned at the beginning of this commentary. <br /> <br /> That poor Rita comes from China, he links the whole thing, the Chinese theater, the expected rape from above, the loss of a woman. An investment in the environment above all else.
