And let me tell you why: whoever decided to edit this movie to be suitable for television was very ill-advised. EVERYTHING ABOUT DRUGS IS CUTTED AND COMPLETED !!! How do they do it, you can ask? Well, they do not do it too well, that's for sure. Anyway, instead of marijuana, which Cheech and Chong are supposed to have in their possession, they are said to have diamonds! Nevertheless, the figures roam in a haze of marijuana smoke, stoning others along the way without any explanation!
