Despite the poor release in this country and the visible disregard in other countries (the rating of "R" in the States could not help - honestly, just because HBC uses the word C!), This is actually a fine piece of work. Sentimentality sometimes threatens suffocation, but is defeated by playing two leads. <br /> <br /> It's easy to get praise just because you play a physical or mental cripple (Daniel Day-Lewis, Geoffrey Rush, Dustin Hoffman, etc.) And Helena Bonham-Carter may not capture the physical degradation of MND, but her vocal stretching and ruthless emotional drive completely compensate for it. In fact, almost all her performances are guided through her eyes (and what eyes!). It is an intelligent turnaround from an actress who quickly resolves her English rose reputation and appears as a figure with a certain attitude. The awards must certainly take place, though not, unfortunately, for this wonderful performance. <br /> <br /> Branagh, it seems, never gave his all in the film (except perhaps "Hamlet", and there his game was weakened by a large cast). Here, however, at the head of other performances, playing on the hand complacency, unstable, ultimately loved guy with subtlety, which he did not always showed, and showing both intelligence and depth. In short, we believe him, just as we could NOT believe him as Frankenstein, as a priest in the Proposition, as a lawyer in The Gingerbread Man, even as Andrew in Peter's Friends. It is certainly his best performance - so why could not he produce goods much earlier? <br /> <br /> As a movie it looks more like a television offer, and without his stars it probably would not be very much. But it was nice to see how this couple is doing their socks in this way, and I am looking forward to seeing more of them (though not "Love's Labor's Lost" ...). 8 out of 10, but Branagh and HBC receive 10 out of 10.
