I love Rosario Dawson, I think she is one of the best actresses of the modern era. <br /> <br /> Origin seems to be more about self-sufficiency than anything else. It is a consistent tone in everything in the film. The dialog box is flat, the characters seem intentionally bland and one-sided. The only consequence is the representation of becoming independent in the characters and Rosario's journey from self-sufficiency to losing the initiation and back. <br /> <br /> The distribution of this as a classic rape is not appropriate and probably that's why so many people do not like the movie. The standard audience of "rape" would not particularly like this movie and maybe that's the point? The film asks more questions than it answers, and confronts it with the target group whether they like it or not. There is an irresistible relationship between the heroes and the target audience, and while the film does not pat the audience on the face with self-righteous audacity, he engages the viewer with what he can, or maybe not, all the wrong reasons. > <br /> Descent is a good movie that IMHO is seriously underestimated.
