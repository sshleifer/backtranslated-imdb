I just saw this movie in Santa Barbara. My friend knew someone who worked on him, so I thought I would check it out. I thought it was a really beautiful movie and I can not wait to look at it again. the actors were really good and I loved all the music! there was not much talk in the film, which at first seemed a bit strange, but when I got to it, I thought that history and acting were really emotional and meaningful, and I thought that it left a lot of imagination. I want to see the movie again, because so much has happened that I forgot many small things, but I know that I left the theater thinking about the film. it was beautifully filmed, and the whole thing was really special.
