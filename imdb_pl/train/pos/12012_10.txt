I saw it this morning at the Legacy Theater at the Joseph Smith Memorial Building in Salt Lake City. I assume that the level of joy during this film will largely depend on the level of acceptance of JÃ³zef's story. <br /> <br /> However, except that it was very well made, well made and had a nice result. If you get to Salt Lake City, you must see it at the Legacy Theater. I've never been in a nicer theater when it comes to image quality, sound quality and atmosphere throughout my life ... I wonder if the church would let me watch Batman Begins there! Since I am LDS and consider Joseph as a prophet, I was touched in a few places and I was led to tears several times ... which, I suppose, is expected because they handed out the tissues BEFORE the film started! Anyway, I was told that this movie is available at several LDS Tourist Centers around the world, if you have 70 minutes to see if you believe in Joseph Smith or not, tell a fascinating story.
