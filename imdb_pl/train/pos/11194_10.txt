Bad scenario, wrong direction, more than the best performances, overgrown dialogue. What more could you ask for? For laughter, there is nothing better than this. Zadora's excessive acting in combination with the old scenarios in which she found herself creates a funny parody of the Hollywood machine. Almost as much fun as "Spinal Tap", although apparently it was not intended as such. Do not miss the Ray Line's debut line "It looks like a penis".
