For me, this review may include spoilers, but I like watching movies without any idea what will happen, so I think that many other reviews of this movie include spoilers! <br /> <br /> I just watched the movie again and I have to repeat that it has the best ending of every movie. Always. Always. Always. The real translation of the "Beating of butterfly wings" is not strangely used as a translated title. I suppose they thought that most Americans do not know what Chaos theory is (except those who have seen or read "Jurassic Park"). The film is based on chaos theory and how one small event can affect the outcome of seemingly unrelated events that lead to one event. Film is a whirlwind of a wonderful cause and effect, because we follow a chain of chaos that interweaves between several characters (around 20?). In a sense, the ending seems inevitable, but if you think about it, it is the perfect ending. Think to yourself, "what else had to be said"? It is also a very bold ending. It is a pity that we must go abroad to get a jewel like this, but such an ending never came out of Hollywood. <br /> <br />
