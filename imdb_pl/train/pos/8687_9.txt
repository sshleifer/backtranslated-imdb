It was the second entry in the regular Columbo series, which is good today. Because I am able to take a closer look at the DVD and see how it is constructed, I am impressed by the direction of Bernard L. Kowalski (who directed the great MACHO CALLAHAN and countless television episodes) - watch how the actions of the murderer after the murder are shown on his two screens with the split screen effect, observe how the murder itself is shown in the assembly manner, watch the shot from the point of view of the corpse. In addition, the wild but impressive avant-garde musical score of the well-known jazz gent Gil Gille was amazing and helped to create the atmosphere. Supporting the performance of Brett Halsey as a golfer was great - such subtlety and complexity in the role that nine out of ten times would be a one-dimensional cut. "Formula" has not yet been determined when the film was filmed, so there are still some surprises in the Columbo methods. Of course Falk, Robert Culp and Ray Milland are top quality actors and it's nice to see their work - all men are known for many other roles, but they lose their characters here. In conclusion, this entry in the Columbo series - and MANY others - is as well made as a very good feature film.
