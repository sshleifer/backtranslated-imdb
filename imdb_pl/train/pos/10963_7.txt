I am very intrigued that Lee Radziwiłł, sister of Jackie Kennedy and the cousin of these women, will encourage Maysles to make "Big Edie" and "Little Edie." Certainly they can be considered as "skeletons" in the family closet. Additional features on DVD include several contemporary fashion designers who pass some of their ideas to these weird women. I would say that anyone interested in fashion would find a fascinating discussion of these designers. (ie, "Are they crazy? Or maybe I miss something?"). This movie is difficult to get. Netflix does not have it. Facets, however, do it.
