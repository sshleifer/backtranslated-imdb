It's really a family movie. He has absolutely genius animal training and "acting" (if you can call it that) (just think about the dog in "How the Grinch stole Christmas" ... it was just bad training). Paulie's story is very well made, well-reproduced and generally the characters are really polished. No more to say except that it is a GREAT MOVIE! <br /> <br /> My ratings: history 8,5 / 10, acting 7.5 / 10, animals + fx 8.5 / 10, photos 8/10. <br /> <br /> My overall rating: 8/10 - BIG FAMILY MOVIE AND VERY WORTH TO WATCH!
