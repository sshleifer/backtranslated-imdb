A group of popular high school students play a cruel joke on nerdy Marty (sympathetic performance of Simon Scuddamore), which leaves him terribly disfigured. Five years later, the gang returns to the disintegrating and abandoned high school for a meeting. Of course, the mad and vindictive Marty appears dressed in a jester costume to take revenge on her tormentors. Writers / directors Mark Ezra, Peter Litten and George Dugdale make all the enticing banal clich√©s that make the 80's play so much cheesy fun: false scary jumps, marauding Steadic shots, a fierce storm, wildly groovy hard rock soundtrack , a cool bit of free woman's nakedness, a completely absurd "what the hell?" supernatural climax, tacky makeup f / x, and one of those wonderfully lame "it was just a horrible dream" of false endings. What's more, sophisticated fragments of murder provide macabre goods: the most important events are the stomach of a man exploding after drinking a poisoned beer, a lady taking a sour bath, a guy crushed under a huge tractor, and two people are electrocuted with wild passionate sex. Thirty-something British cult horror Caroline Munro is fun to be confused as an American teenager in the first third round. The entire cast gives solid results, especially the outstanding work of Carmine Iannaccone as the leader of smartaleck Skip Pollack, Billy Hartman as the faded macho carnivorous Frank and Donna Yeager as the dirty whore Stella. Co-producer Dick Randall has the entertaining episodic role of the dark agent Munro. The romantic, rattling music of Harry Manfredini shamelessly processes signals from the results of "Friday the 13th." Alan Pudney's skillful cinematography goes well. Good, cheesy fun.
