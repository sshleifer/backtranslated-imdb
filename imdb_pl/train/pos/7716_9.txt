There is a good reason why Walter Pidgeon warns Leslie Nielson and his crew in front of an auxiliary ship he never dreamed of. <br /> <br /> As Dr. Edward Morbius, Pidgeon is the last to survive the expedition that came to this planet 20 years earlier. From that time on, he married another member of the expedition and had a daughter, Anna Franciszek. They are the only people left on this planet, once a family world of the ancient civilization known as Krell. <br /> <br /> Records decoded by Pidgeon indicate that Krell came to a cataclysm of unknown origin. The mechanism they left behind is still functioning. <br /> <br /> Perhaps functioning too well when the aid party members start to die, in a particularly gruesome way. <br /> <br /> I see all kinds of speculations about the remake and this is one movie that I will not remake, because it is as fresh as in 1956. The terms have changed, now we would say that the warp speed instead of hyper-propulsion, thanks to the persistent popularity of Star Trek. <br /> <br /> Perhaps we will not see men in a relief expedition in a flying saucer, like a spaceship. It may look more like Starship Enterprise or Ship from 2001 A Space Odyssey. It is interesting to look at science fiction movies from different generations and see how the concepts of the future change. <br /> <br /> The story of the Forbidden Planet is timeless, about mortal creatures trying to play God. /> <br /> You can not write about Forbidden Planet without commenting on Robby the Robot. This mechanical miracle, made by Pidgeon with the knowledge gained while studying Krell, was quite good. He received a new life in the sixties with the character of Robot with Lost In Space. His scenes with Earl Holliman, who plays a chef on a spacecraft and agrees with Earl's request for some house ghosts, is very funny. <br /> <br /> Robby and other special effects have been nominated for an Oscar, but lost to the Ten Commandments and parting with the Red Sea. Forbidden by Planet, misfortune to meet with a Hollywood founder, such as Cecil B. DeMille. <br /> <br /> The classics among you recognize Forbidden Planet as a futuristic reworking of The Tempest, which, if you think about it, could be one of them to venture into science fiction. <br /> <br /> My favorite among the cast is Warren Stevens, who sacrifices Leslie Nielsen to find out what he's dealing with. <br /> <br /> Never miss this when it is broadcast.
