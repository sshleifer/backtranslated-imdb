The 14-year-old is extremely happy in me that he is now able to make really good looking fantasy films and that they are angry, what with the Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and The Chronicles of Narnia does a lot of cash at the box office. This year we will see (and have already seen) a few others, in particular The Golden Compass, which has the most exciting trailer I have seen this year. Stardust, based on the novel by Neil Gaiman, appeared in cinemas this week with only a small preview. I did not see any previews, only a few ads. The critical reaction is a kind of blah. I would not even see him if it was not for the fact that I have to wait for a friend to see the Bourne Ultimatum and that nothing else has opened this weekend. Well, if you forgive a terrible pun, the stars must have been properly aligned because I went to see Star Dust and I loved it. This is not a huge movie like Lord of the Rings. The plot line is your primary fantasy task (the hero sets off on a search for a fallen star) filled with obstacles. But in this basic outline, the story is vivid and ingenious. It's just about having fun and a charming affair. And it works. There were a lot of big movies this summer, but none of them was as funny as this one. A lot is happening, but the story is well told and is almost completely consistent. This is not a masterpiece, but it can definitely occupy the same kind of land as something like The Princess Bride (though I do not like it as much as the previous movie). A lot of fun if you're a fan of this genre.
