This is probably the best rock instrument - British, better This Is Spinal Tap. Characters are reliable, the story is great and you can genuinely empathize with certain events - such as Ray's problem with the band's match. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is perfect. Real-life things, even if they are in the same key, you will be humming some songs for a few days. What I liked was almost a British cast, with a few favorite surnames. Å»ona Raya is priceless ... <br /> <br /> The movie never stretches, it just goes at the right pace and has really fun sections. A generator of really good passwords! <br /> <br /> It's a hidden diamond.
