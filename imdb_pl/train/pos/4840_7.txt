I saw the last DVD of Region 2 of this movie displayed in the "horror" section of the Oxford Street store, and also advertised as a "classic thriller". In fact, it is almost exclusively a vehicle of Arthur Askey, one of the most popular names in British comedy and light entertainment for over four decades. <br /> <br /> Maybe he is always happy, energetic and essentially good-natured humor as a culture shock for many accustomed to the sour and cynical taste of the British comedy of the last twenty-five years. However, there are still those who appreciate his lively and happy persona and the total avoidance of pathos. Askey was the idol of the great Tommy Cooper, who often borrowed the "self-curling" gag that Arthur tries to entertain stranded passengers. <br /> <br /> A striking, rare appearance of Linden Travers appears, which has an effect as a mysterious Julie.
