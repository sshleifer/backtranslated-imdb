My Super Ex Girlfriend turned out to be a nice surprise for me, I was really expecting a horrible movie that would probably be stupid and predictable, and you know what? It was! But this movie had so many great laughs and a funny story that everyone could get away. I know it was a very bad movie, but Uma and Anna were just great, and Steve was a great addition and a great cast who looked like they had a great time and it made the movie really work. > <br /> Jenny Johnson (terrifying, it's the real name of my best friend) is not a typical average librarian looking like a woman, when Matt, your average man, asks her that he is more than he expected, he asked G-Girl on a date, superhero of the world! But when she finds out what a jealous and crazy girl really is and decides it might be a good idea to spend some time alone, but Jenny will not have it, because he fell in love with another girl, Hannah, his life is a hell, I mean, let's face it, he could not choose a better girl to break with. <br /> <br /> The effect was trivial, but you're seriously moving alongside them quickly, history and cast made the story really work and I loved Uma in this movie, it was such a step from Prime. My Super Ex Girlfriend is a funny movie that you really should not take seriously, it's just a lovely romantic comedy that, if I could make fun of it, everyone could. <br /> <br /> 7/10
