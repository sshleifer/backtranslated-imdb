That's how I felt while watching this movie. I love it. It was funny. But I felt like I was making a sneaky insight into someone's psyche, and then he laughed when he turned around to make an interesting point. A friend puts it this way: <br /> <br /> "I feel that we have broken into someone's home and now we are watching their terrible home movies without their knowledge." <br /> <br /> Another of these facts is stranger than feature films. "Groovin 'Gary", the original "Beaver Kid", is a small town that appears on a nearby television station in the hope of making a movie - and certainly yes, though maybe not, as originally expected. With great hopes for fame and importance, he invites Harris to come and make a really terrible search for talents, which he organized in his hometown - bearing his own act of dragging "Olivia Newton-Don". <br /> <br /> Director Trent Harris is doing a great job in this slowly evolving history. Recording an uncomfortable kid who wants to be someone who changes over two consecutive reinterpretations into a history of freedom from repressed sexual identity in a small town in America. Harris also criticizes the attitude of a small town in America, the cult of celebrities and the exploitative practices of the film and television industry. <br /> <br /> Both Sean Penn and Grispin Glover perform stunning performances. young Sean Penn is the most suggestive - he follows closely the actual "Gary recordings", but with the strong nuances given to make sense of interaction in the way Harris wants it to happen. <br /> <br /> In the end of the wide naivety of the original Gary, which moved me - in contrast to these possible interpretations of his situation. <br /> <br /> A movie that you can not miss. I have not seen anything like it. <br /> <br /> Jakub.
