Scott Henderson, an engineer who employs Carol Richman as his assistant, aims to call her "Kansas" whenever she talks to her. He shows us that Carol, effectively played by Ella Raines, is to be a child in the forest, if it was about Manhattan from the 40's. Only a woman from outside the city would follow the shady bartender to the lonely subway. Even then, only a naive girl could take such an adventure. <br /> <br /> Robert Siodmak has directed this film noir very well. It shows the talent for infusing this story with a lot of raw sex that was surprising in those days. How else could we justify the way a drummer in an orchestral musical in which Scott takes a mysterious woman with an unusual hat makes such an explicit pass against a lady on a day? High-powered drummer played by Elisha Cook Jr. he does not hide his desires for any of the ladies who sit in the first row of the hit musical in which he plays. This was a clear invitation, first to the "phantom woman" of this story, Fay Helm; later, Cliff drummer, openly insinuates Elli Raines, who goes to the theater dressed as a mysterious lady, which her boss originally took. <br /> <br /> This is a film that will start with every viewer from the very beginning. There are things that are not explained in it, but it's interesting for him all the time. The killer is not revealed until the end. <br /> <br /> Ella Raines was an unappreciated actress with her expressive eyes. He is an opponent of much more experienced actors. Franchot Tone, a New York theater actor working in Hollywood, has never found the medium he deserved in this medium. He is effective as the best friend of an accused man. On the other hand, Alan Curtis is a man who accepts his fate in a frame and is saved only by the persistence of a woman who secretly loves him. Thomas Gomez, as Inspector Burgess, is the asset of the film as a detective who has doubts that the police caught the man who committed the crime. <br /> <br /> This movie will not let you down.
