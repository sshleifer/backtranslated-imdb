I must be honest. I watched and enjoyed this concert because it was disgusting, offensive, funny and lewd. Yes, there is a lot of humor for all tastes. If you have humor, for example, which is joking about people falling from skateboards, for example you will have a great time for it. <br /> <br /> Or, if you like people on extreme action actions bad, you will have a great time. And if you like scatological humor and extreme situations, you will enjoy the show. <br /> <br /> I like all three types of humor that "Dirty SÃ cheche" offers. I like to laugh at the situation on the show. "Jackass" is like a walk in the park compared to that. So if you're tired of Jackass's typical American stupidity, try the English extreme stupidity at this concert. With all due respect. <br /> <br /> This is a program that has little taste and class. It is not recommended for those who are easily offended or disgusting. <br /> <br /> These guys have to meet a psychologist. Especially the character Paco.
