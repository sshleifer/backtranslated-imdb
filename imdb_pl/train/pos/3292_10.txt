Paperhouse is the most moving and poignant movie I've ever seen. I think that often classified as "horror" is a serious mistake. Some journalists called him "The nightmare of a person thinking on Wiązów Street" and although I agree with the logic of his conclusions, I can not help it, but I think it is a badly deserved and misleading marker. Those who only see horror really miss here and only serve to show that they really do not think at all. <br /> <br /> In fact, trying to classify this great job is probably a bad idea. Simply put, Paperhouse is perfect in every refined detail and will always have a special place in my heart. As someone who was smarter than me once said, "the movie hits you on an entirely emotional level," which may somehow explain why my comments are so ruthlessly spurting. Honestly, I'm not sorry for that, so if you think my words are too sugar for your taste, stop reading now because there are more. <br /> <br /> It's rare to find a movie that has its heart is the pain and heartache of childhood and the struggle to overcome the terrible feelings of isolation and loneliness that can completely overwhelm us in this fragile time of our lives. Even more unusual is finding children's actors who can play their roles with the sensitivity and intelligence required to make everything work. In Charlotte Burke and Elliott Spiers we had an inspiring piece of the casting, and Paperhouse's long-lasting impact owes many of their ability to depict melancholy and alienation of childhood (often overlooked) in a smooth and convincing way. <br /> <br /> And yet both of these genius young stars seemed to slip through college and disappeared somehow. <br /> <br /> Add to this incredibly talented director (Bernard Rose), fantastic photos and the most beautiful and haunting soundtrack you can hear and you can start to understand why I have such sentiment and sympathy for this movie that no amount words can not express. <br /> <br />
