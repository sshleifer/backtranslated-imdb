This is not the same as other dance films. A few normal people found themselves in dance. Unlike Hollywood movies, the characters in this movie are not handsome or hot young people. They are someone you can see every day in their offices. They are a little depressed with their lives and finally find themselves and their dreams of dancing. It touches me very much.
