I was worried that my daughter might have a bad idea. I think the character of the "Dark Heart" is a little rough and I do not like the way it changes shape in the "average" frog, fox, boy? I was wrong, this movie was made for my child, not for me. She "gets" it when she passed (under?) My head. Of course, "I do not understand." This is not one of the NEW movies for children that adults will also enjoy. It is easy for the young, and the crew knew what they were doing. There is no political junk ether. There is no magic key that will save the world from us, no one has the right to access excess, and everyone is not happy all the time. And as a side benefit nobody will get TIRED! ?? Russwill.
