This film is not only funny, with excellent comedy, but also politically interesting. It was created at the end of the Soviet Union, but it makes fun of the Soviet mentality over and over again. History takes place in the early years of the Soviet Union and questions the justification of the revolution in both cultural and practical terms. Of course, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the bizarre principles of Soviet society are already relaxed, but ideology and mentality are still alive and well prepared for some well-deserved deconstruction. Fortunately, all this deep philosophical commentary is packed into a fun and entertaining package! <br /> <br /> Jur
