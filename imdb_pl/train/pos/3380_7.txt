I've seen a lot of science fiction from the '70s; some terribly bad, others provocative and really scary. Soylent Green fits the latter category. Yes, sometimes it's a bit of camps anyway, furniture is good for a chuckle or two, but part of the movie seems terribly prophetic. We are nine years before the film Blade Runner, who dares to imagine the future as something dark, frightening and nihilistic. Both Charlton Heston and Edward G. Robinson cope much better than the Ten Commandments, and Robinson's suicide scene is frighteningly prophetic to Kevorkian and his like. Some attitudes are outdated (can you imagine a filmmaker who would escape the concept of "women as furniture" in our "politically correct 90s"), but it's rare to find a movie from "Decade Me" to make you think. I would like to see it on the big screen, because even in the case of a panoramic presentation, I do not think that the overall scope of the film is due. Check it out.
