The first one was good and original. I was not a bad horror movie / comedy movie. I heard that a second was created and I had to watch it. <br /> <br /> What really makes this work movie is the character of Judd Nelson and sometimes a clever scenario. Quite a good scenario for the person who wrote Final Destination movies, and the direction was fine. Sometimes there are scenes that seem to have been filmed using a home video camera with a grainy appearance. <br /> <br /> A great TV movie. It was worth the loan and probably worth buying just to have amazing courtesies and to see Stanley Judd Nelson doing what he does best. <br /> <br /> I suggest to newcomers watching the first one before watching the sequel you will have an idea of ​​what Stanley looks like and get some history.
