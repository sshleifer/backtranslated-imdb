I love to buy a cheap, bad DVD with Alpha Video. One day I bought this one. This is the perfect stupid science fiction movie from the 1950s, all sexed. By filling in an unscientific EVERYTHING, scantily clad girls and a lot of melodrama, this is a nice movie for those who appreciate this kind of thing. And if you can "hang your disbelief" enough, you can really get out - not only because of the psychotic head or hitting the wardrobe, but in the end, with the character of the "perfect body". This is so . . . . what else to think about?
