"Bend It Like Beckham" is a film that has very few exhibitions in the United States. Probably this was due to the fact that the film was heavily British in dialogue and terminology and a lot of football (here football), which some may also have problems with the US in the United States. more information here. I think that the basis of the story (after a dream) is something that many people can associate with and finally "Bend It Like Beckham" turns out to be a good movie with a source of inspiration and really good acting. At first I was not too excited about watching this movie, but now I regret that I have not seen it before. I highly recommend this movie!
