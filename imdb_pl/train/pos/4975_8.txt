I have not seen it for God for a long time. Probably about 18 years ago? <br /> <br /> The film tells us (children) about human blood and circulatory system. Very professionally connected - Disney-style animation, as well as human actors - Frank Capra directed him, for God's sake! <br /> <br /> A bit exaggerated. I wonder if the very high value of production is worth what constitutes the value of information about the human body on the film tape? But the boy will be watching these kids: even now I clearly remember that Hemo himself provoked Dr.
