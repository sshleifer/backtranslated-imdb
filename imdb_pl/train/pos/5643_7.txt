Mary Pickford ("Born on July 4" as Angela Moore) is "The Little American"; he falls in love with Jack Holt (as Karl Von Austreim), who moved to America with his German father and American mother. Franco-American Raymond Hatton (as Count Jules de Destin of "Fighting Destins") fell in love with Mrs Pickford. Triangle love triangle finally ends in France, with the Great War (World War I, in retrospect) significantly complicates their lives. <br /> <br /> Mostly funny, if propaganda-defective, film by Cecil B. DeMille. The torpedoing and sinking of Pickford's ship reminds the Titanic. War intrigue becomes dramatic when Pickford slowly becomes a secret spy for France, while Germany occupies her home. Of course, the German lover Holt arrives. It was hard to believe that it took so long for them to recognize each other when he was raped, but it was dark; and earlier events made them believe each other dead. The film goes up in its symbolism. Pickford was, by the way, a Canadian - though few could deny she was not a "little American," for all reasons. <br /> <br /> THE FUN on the "extras" that later became the main stars, Wallace Beery, Colleen Moore and Ramon Novarro - especially, see how Mr. Novarro presents the quality of the "star" during one of the most memorable sequences film: Pickford and the wounded soldier greet each other when he is taken away by her on a stretcher. Novarro even orders Mary Pickford to write a letter for him; Of course he has a future in the pictures. In the future he is also associated with Ben Alexander, who plays the boy "Bobby"; he becomes a reliable child actor and grows up to become Jack Webb's partner in Dragnet. <br /> <br /> ******* The Little American (7/12/17) Cecil B.
