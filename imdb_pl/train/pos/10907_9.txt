I was rotating around the TV and HBO was showing double strange terrible diseases, so I turned to my twin sister and said, "Hey, that looks cool" - I really love documentaries - so we started watching them. At first I thought that Jonni Kennedy was a young man, but then he explained that due to his condition he never matured, so he could hear a high voice and a smaller body. He was on a crusade to raise money for his case. He had the most wonderful sense of humor combined with a beautiful sense of spirituality ... I cried, I looked at others, I laughed, I got up to get another handkerchief, and then I cried even more. When "time passed" Jonni Kennedy, he flew to heaven to be with angels. He was more than ready; he drew conclusions from this life and was free. I highly recommend it. If you do not fall in love with this guy, you have no heart.
