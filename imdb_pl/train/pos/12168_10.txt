"And Guy Thing" may not be a classic, but it is certainly a good, funny comedy. The plot focuses on Paul (Jason Lee), who wakes up in the morning after a bachelor party without memory, and Becky (Julia Stiles) lies naked on the bed. Before he can find out what happened, he leads Becky out of his apartment because his fianc√© Karen (Selma Blair) is approaching. After you can imagine, chaos follows. <br /> <br /> Almost every scene in "A Guy Thing" delivers loud laughter. The funniest moments come from times when Paul imagines what might happen if Karen says. Selma Blair is a really talented comedian, and the worst of the movie is that she's underestimated. It turns out, however, that it is more fun than Stiles' character, which is actually not so interesting. Of course, not every comedy is perfect. <br /> <br /> As I said, "A Guy Thing" is not classic, but it's not bad either, 7/10.
