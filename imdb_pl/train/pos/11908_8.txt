This movie plays very well with the audience. Especially when chase begins. Plus, Trevor Howard with her smart, smart charms and Jean Simmons with her innocent behavior and piercing eyes are great together. <br /> <br /> The film begins as a psychological drama, but after the murder turns into a thriller thriller, two wires lead to the border. Some may think that the pursuit is superfluous, but in reality the pursuit is necessary because it helps to clear the mind of Jean Simmons, leading her out of the oppressive household, and also helps to bring out a real killer - who is suddenly put in a position that must end work. The killer rightly believed that after the arrest of Simmons, he would be put off. And it is true that her lack of control in the household - as well as evidence showing her way - would in no way get out of the charge of murder. The pursuit that results from this helps to bring out the truth. <br /> <br /> This is an entertainment movie. Look for him if you can find him.
