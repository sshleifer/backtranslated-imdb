Still Crazy has been compared to Spinal Tap because both are comedies with washable R & R groups. Actually, the similarity ends here because Still Crazy is much better written and played a role, while the Spinal Tap script gets worse from the mild first 10 minutes to the drivel, which makes Beavis and Butthead seem sophisticated compared. Still Crazy is formal, but the sympathy of the heroes and the unexpectedly high quality of some music numbers have managed to balance the a priori predictability of the film. People who expect Spinal Tap-like satire would be disappointed with the light nature of the film, but I would have done the ironic Still Still routine over the pompous but unsuccessful satire shot of Spinal Tap.
