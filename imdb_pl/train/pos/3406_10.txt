In terms of visual beauty, this film is unique! I had no idea that Technicolor had left so early. Although I did not like the ending, the whole movie is fantastic and makes me want to be in North Africa. The cast is great, and Marlene Dietrich is a big plus and of course she is so alluring and I just loved her. Basil Rathbone is also perfect in this film. I could not experience scenery and scenery ... Hotel, palms, desert, everything is there ... the legionaries bring the movie "Beau Geste". They certainly do not make such films anymore. Do not miss this classic!
