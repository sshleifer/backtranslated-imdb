By Hook or By Crook is an extremely innovative film by a pair of extremely intelligent and talented filmmakers, Harry Dodge and Silas Howard. They manage to tell the original story in a characteristic film style, and it is beautifully made by Ann T. Rosetti and wonderfully written - truly poetic. <br /> <br /> Leading heroes are real heroes and serve as a rare model to follow and inspire to make shoes and trannies around the world. This film has so much energy, so much of Passion and the scruffy heart of San Francisco. I can not recommend it! <br /> <br /> The best movie of all time!
