I was browsing the list of Oscar winners and was surprised to see that this movie beat Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid for the best photo in 1969. However, after seeing him, I'm not surprised anymore. This far outperformed his style, cinematography and flashbacks to help develop the character of Joe Buck. <br /> <br /> The most amazing thing for me is the depth of character Joe Buck in such a short movie. I think Voight caught naivety and cruelty when he was provoked. Two scenes that really caught me is after getting a blowjob in the theater and when an older man is trying to get him. I think when he looks in the mirror, he tries to see if he really did - or is going to do - something terrible. <br /> <br /> I think it's a great Hoffman decision. Otherwise, he could be a typecast after the Graduate. Anyway, for some reason it was considered a great time.
