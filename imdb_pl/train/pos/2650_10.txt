Besides, my list of favorite filmmakers is: 1) Stanley Kubrick 2) God Allmighty 3) rest ... this movie is actually better than a book (and TV miniseries, although it is easy, considering the director). Impeccable film, acting and (always Kubrick's best skill) music - make it a masterpiece of horror. A few years ago I watched a TV miniseries and I liked this story and I was hoping to take care of it. THIS BLEW ME AWAY !!! It is much better than I ever imagined. It starts slowly (Kubrick trademark) and has a lot of downtime, which increases the tension. The intro scene is classic, and I have seen it about 20 times only for the shear atmosphere that it evokes throughout the film. Also, the movie does not offer too much gore (it only has so much and it is not at all tasteless) a trend that I hate in recent horror movies. Just watch!
