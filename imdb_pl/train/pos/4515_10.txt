This movie is absolutely fantastic !! If you watch it with your friends, it can be a very nice day ... Of course you need to know that the movie is stupid and very bad director and played (Tomba / Unziker is what a couple), and probably the worst movie in the world, but you can enjoy it very much. We watched it in 19 and it was a very nice evening. The first scenes are best when criminals kill Alex's friend and he tries to behave like a desperate, and the result is a comic scene of the first category ... And then, when he shows Levie (Antevleva, what name) "Palassio di giusstissia", then accident Levy, who once drives a car off the road, and a second later the car is completely empty! What a magic!
