Jason Bourne is sitting in a dusty room with blood on his hands trying to understand what he just did. Meanwhile, the head of the CIA in New York describes the agency's reaction to what happened on the screen. The American flag stands proudly in the middle of the desk in the foreground of the shot, but when it speaks, it slips out of sight when its plan is heading into morally doubtful territory, as if it were not related to the course of action taken by a government man is necessary in the interest of national security. <br /> <br /> This shot effectively captures the mood of the film. The Ultimatum also presents Bourne's quest to discover how he became Jason Bourne, as well as researching the human cost taken to protect us in the interests of stability and security. <br /> <br /> It is also probably the best movie you will see in the cinema this year. <br /> <br /> It's so intense. Bourne talks to Simon Ross (Considine) "It's not a story from the newspaper, it's real," and you almost believe him in the audience. The camera shakes, but remains stable enough to see everything and feel like Bourne, who tries to sneak out of the persecutors, and the performances are so good that these guys seem to be the characters they portray instead of being actors well-written roles. Action scenes are so brutally fast and well choreographed that they seem instinctive and not planned for the slightest movement; stunt work is nothing short of amazing. <br /> <br /> The pace is simply amazing. He keeps moving forward, but not so fast that the plot can not be assembled; The script provides the information you need as quickly and clearly as possible before moving on to the next set of actions. Although they are often straightforward (the Waterloo sequence is basically just a human on the phone watched by a man on the phone), they are charged with such a dramatic intensity that you can not take your eyes off them. The film is so focused on forwarding that it can not be carried away. <br /> <br /> With its intense activities, brilliant history and intelligent study of decisions taken in the name of national security, the Bourne series is one that accurately reflects the ambiguity of our century. The Ultimatum is its summit.
