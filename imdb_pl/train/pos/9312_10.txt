I really like watching this movie because of all the terrifying scenes of birds of prey. I like birds of prey because they are terrifying. My favorite parts are those in which the raptor looks behind the pillar, because it reminds me of the scene from Friday's thirteenth film with a girl who eats a banana. <br /> <br /> I really love watching this movie a lot, because computer graphics seem a bit false, but it's okay because after entering the movie it's hard to even notice what's going on and I think it has a good ending, even if I do not understand what's really happening on my first couple watching. I figured out over time and this is an important part. Another important part is how terrible dinosaurs can be if you watch them for the first time. <br /> <br /> THIS IS THE BEST VIDEO.
