Shamefully, before I saw this movie, I was not familiar with Helena Bonham Carter. <br /> <br /> I had to do some research to make sure that she was not actually affected, just like her character with (well?) what she was afflicted with. I was absolutely delighted with this beautiful lady. She did it flawlessly. <br /> <br /> Who would have thought that the sexually explicit circumstances associated with the last desires and needs of a unique young lady can be interpreted as delicate and romantic? Well, they can be when the right performers present them in the right way, like in this great movie. I forgot to mention how the dynamically beautiful Miss Carter looked in this film. I have often said that she was the most beautiful creature that ever graced the face of our land, but it seemed that she did it herself in this particular film. <br /> <br /> I hope that everyone who is watching this movie enjoy it as much as I do. Thank you for expressing your opinion.
