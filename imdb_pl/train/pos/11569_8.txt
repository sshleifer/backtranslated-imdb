"An Itch in Time" by Bob Clampett passes seven minutes of crazy action from a very small assumption. Elmer Fudd tells his dog that if he scratch himself again, he will get a terrifying bath. Unfortunately for a dog, a relentless flea makes it impossible to refrain from scratching. The cartoon switches between the progress of fleas in the dog's fur and the desperate attempts of the dog to deal with it. In a perfect sequence that really captures the itching frustration that can not be scratched, the dog turns from brown to blue to red on a polka dotted plaid! It sounds funny surreal, but it perfectly evokes an indescribable itching sensation in a way that only Clampett could. There are several other elements that make up the pure Clampett "An Itch in Time". It is a grotesque concept that leads to certain graphic scenes of pushing fleas on the dog's body. There is unrestrained violence that is reflected on every scene with the cat. First of all, these are dirty jokes, including a huge dog shot that causes the flea whistle flea and hysterical sequence in which the dog tries to scratch, pulling back along the floor. Temporarily he jumps up to talk to the audience: "Hey, cut it better. I may like it "! With a very limited concept, Clampett manages to create "An Itch in Time", an exceptional cartoon based on fine details. Like the early episode of "Seinfeld", "An Itch in Time" is virtually nothing but very funny.
