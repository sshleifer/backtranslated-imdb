"Painting is seeing and then remembering better than you saw." That's what Dick Heldar (Ronald Colman) says, painter in The Light That Failed. The film is in a great old Hollywood style, with Ronald Colman and a daring cast that includes Ida Lupino in her first important role, a reliable actor Dudley Digges (who also played alongside Colman in "Skazani") and a solid performance by the great actor Walter Hustin. <br /> <br /> The title and the initial sequences of the film largely reflect the fact that Dick will lose his eyesight. He is blinded by a discharge from the gun, because he and his beloved Maisie (Muriel Angelus) play with a gun. Later the wound during the fight in Sudan is a catalyst for his blindness. He becomes a famous painter, but he is already blinded by ambition and does not really reach his full potential until his eyes leave him. Enter the bad girl Bessie (Ida Lupino), and his self-destruction is in motion. Lupino is very strong in this role and Colman plays very well. Her evil tart reminds me of Bette Davis in Of Human Bondage. <br /> <br /> Well-preserved and well-directed, it's one of my favorite Colin melodramas.
