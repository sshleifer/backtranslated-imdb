It's a beautiful movie that all players play wonderfully. It will make you laugh and it will make you cry. The very end of the film makes me fog every time. If you want to see a great movie, that's it. Jimmy Stewert delivers a wonderfully witty performance, and Frank Morgan as Mr. Matuschek is enchanted. The diversity of Morgan's character is amazing. William Tracy as Pepi is a wonderful comic relief and provides some of the most important films and performances. Felix Bressart is a fantastic performance by Perovitch, a stumbling store employee whose ambition is to please those with whom he works. This is a simple story about how close associates can become and how two people who have great reluctance to each other fall in love with unusual circumstances.
