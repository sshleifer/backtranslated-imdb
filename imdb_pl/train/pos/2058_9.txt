This film is an interesting look at the species of a deadly scarecrow - it surprisingly manages to become larger than the sum of its parts. Medium assembly scenes, 30-year-old games with teenagers and excellent facial expressions combine to become one of the "new waves" of modern classics. As a viewer, I left the movie with the same sense of "shock and admiration" as I saw my Godfather in 1969 for the first time. The amazing portrait of Tiffany Gardner, morally bankrupt, Judy deserved her Grammy nomination, which was well documented stolen by Ricky Martin and restless hips. Unfortunately, none of the sequels did not meet the expectations of the original (as opposed to the Godfather series, which has improved with each part and should end in 2012 Godfather 4: Eat My Rage).
