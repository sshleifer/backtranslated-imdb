This film is a real masterpiece, it really is. It is rare for you to come across such a thrilling movement, full of fun, laughter, heartache and a little drama to keep you on your toes. <br /> <br /> A real family movie, Homeward Bound, tells the story of three brave animals that set out across the Rocky Mountains, trying to find their owners, tracking the changes they are going through and the obstacles they face along the way. One of the really stunning things in this movie is its ability to give people human personalities - the voice works so well. The shadow is a wonderful figure, old, wise and courageous, and watching him trying to save Sassy in the river was a very moving moment. Chance - who would not love a dog like Chance? He must be the most mischievous and lovable puppy ever shown on the big screen. And Sassy is very witty to the cat - she had me at the seams when she mocked the guardian; "Here is kitty kitty kitty ... not in your life, chubby." <br /> <br /> There were also many well-made emotional scenes, such as Sassy passing through the waterfall (I was really afraid of him), Shadow falling in a ditch (almost in tears), and then a fantastic ending when all three animals return to home ... including good old Shadow! <br /> <br /> Favorite all the time - anyone who does not like this movie can not just like animals. Rent it or buy it now and you will have happy memories that will last a lifetime.
