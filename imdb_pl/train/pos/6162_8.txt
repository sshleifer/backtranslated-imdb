I loved the masterpiece and to be honest, I also found Mary Poppins (though I love Julie Andrews and Dick VanDyke) to be stupid and sweet-sacred. Angela Lansbury plays her character perfectly and I do not know why people consider this movie distorted. It was magical and watching was fun. Each scene has a certain charm when you got to know the characters better. You really see how this small family, thrown together, learns to tie together, despite their age and differences. I thought the characters were well developed, especially Charles, who was in "The Age of Not Believing." Mary Poppins may be more popular and valued by others, but this little gem will be the one that I will always love and care for.
