During the funeral of the famous British journalist Joe Strombela (Ian McShane), his friends and colleagues recall how stubborn he was in seeking a scoop. Meanwhile, the late Joe reveals the identity of a serial tarot card killer from London. He betrays the Reaper and appears to the American student journalist Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson) who is on stage in the midst of the magic show of magician Sidney Waterman (Woody Allen) in London and tells her that the murderer of the aristocrat Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). Sondra drags Sida into the investigation, seeking evidence that Peter is a killer. However, he falls in love with it and asks if Joe Strombel is right. <br /> <br /> "Scoop" is another great comedy by Woody Allen outside of Manhattan, actually in London. His ironic and witty lines are simply fantastic, and I laughed a lot about his hero's fate in a country where people ride "on the wrong side". Sid Waterman is extremely funny and Woody Allen has a great comedian. However, his current muse Scarlett Johansson, of which I am a big fan, has excessive acting and gets upset at many points, changing his emphasis on histrionic pronunciation. Her character is absolutely stupid and dissolute, and I was very disappointed with her performance (probably for the first time in her filmography). But this supernatural comedy is still a fun and valuable entertainment. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Scoop ?? About Grande Furo "(" Scoop ?? The Big Scoop ")
