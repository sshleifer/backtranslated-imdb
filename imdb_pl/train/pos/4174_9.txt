... when this film proves so well that it really is unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Although a few lines, it was strange to see this movie, without subtitles, in an unknown language. My friend has sent VHS, including several articles with all poems translated into English. with her translation next to me, I began to see this story (it is actually a story) and I got stuck from the first melodies of the whistling melody during the initial subtitles. colors, this minimalistic acting (in most cases), absurd comedy, slapstick, thoughtful, beautiful ... along with several other movies (Paris, Texas and Nenette et Boni), this one is able to talk to anyone - without words. Whenever you have a chance, see this. Whatever you do - do not miss it. This is a unique experience. Oh, the acting is great, the soundtrack is brilliant, the story is simple and said a thousand times before - but rare (never?) Yes.
