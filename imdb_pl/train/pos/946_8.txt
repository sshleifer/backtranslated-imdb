Because Christmas has evolved over the years, regardless of whether we focus on religious or secular traditions, this is a time when people should behave a little better. It somehow slipped past Ebenezer Scrooge, a buyer and lender in nineteenth-century London. <br /> <br /> As his nephew points out to his uncle, he does not care about Christmas in any way, because Scrooge feels it's all a humbug. Mankind at Scrooge has been expelled a long time ago, a hard case, like his 20th century counterpart, Mr. Potter of Bedford Falls, New York. <br /> <br /> But as Charles Dickens said, Redemption is not too late for either of us, and a lonely spirit and three ghosts visit Scrooge and show him how. <br /> <br /> The Christmas Carol is such a timeless Christmas classic that we sometimes forget that it is the same social comment from Britain in the 19th century as Oliver Twist. The characters in this movie are middle and lower. Cratchits are a few tiers over street people in Oliver Twist, but they have to fight to stay there. Their home still exudes love and happiness, not thanks to the guy for whom Bob Cratchit works. <br /> <br /> Like George Bailey, who in his life did a lot of good and just had to remember how much Ebenezer Scrooge needed to wake up about the possibilities he still had to do something good in this old world. <br /> <br /> In his performances live and filmed, Patrick Stewart almost took the role of Scrooge. But George C. Scott shows the old miser in this movie quite well. His disgust, but with a trace of sadness that makes us become roots so that it can change. Scott joins the great tradition of people like Reginald Owen and Alastair Sim, who both interpreted Scrooge well. <br /> <br /> Among the supporting roles, I especially liked David Warner as Bob Cratchit and Edward Woodward as a hearty and stark spirit of the Christmas gift. <br /> <br /> According to IMDb, this is one of the 32 versions of A Christmas Carol that have been archived and are one of the best.
