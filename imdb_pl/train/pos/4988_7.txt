The Mana Castle is located in one of the settlements built for jerry on empty lands and parks, which at that time was called "Hoovervilles" named after our miserable 31st president who got stuck with the Great Depression that took place in his administration. The suggestion of this film is that the man's home is still his castle, even if it's just a hut in Hooverville. <br /> <br /> Spencer Tracy has such a hut and it's true that this guy, even in good times, does not work that much. But in the part very typical of Tracy, before he was cast as a priest in San Francisco, the beginning of many classic roles, he plays a hard, good-natured mug that Loretta Young takes. <br /> <br /> One about Man's Castle is that it shows the effects of the crisis for both women and men. Women imposed additional burdens on them, if men had problems finding a job, women had it twice as hard. And they were sexually harassed, and some of them resorted to prostitution only for a square meal. Spence takes Loretta Young, who faces such problems and does not make any demands on her castle. Soon, however, they are in love, although Tracy is not the type that calms down. <br /> <br /> The love scenes had some extra pleasure for them because Tracy and Young had a hot affair during the filming of Man's Castle. And both were Catholics and married, and in those days it was an insurmountable barrier to marriage. Both Tracy and Young accepted the Catholic faith quite seriously. <br /> <br /> Also in the cast there are Walter Connolly as a kind of father for the whole camp, Marjorie Rambeau, who survived all the traps that may be encountered and tries Young to empty her and Arthur Hohl, the really repulsive crawler he has on also young. Hohl brings the story of Man's Castle to a climax through his intrigues. <br /> <br /> A man's castle is grim for the Great Depression, not for a simple film escapist tariff for those who try to avoid this kind of reality in their entertainment.
