This movie is so funny that it makes everything else Eddie Murphy seems very disappointing (even Beverly Hills Cop and The Nutty Professor, who just shows how it really is good). Honestly, I do not think I ever laugh at something as much as Naked Gun and the rare Bargearse. This performance is amazing, although it must be said that it is certainly filled with the word starting with F, which has four letters (plus its extended version starting with M), but it did not bother me. Look, the funniest thing I've ever seen and probably the funniest thing you've ever had.
