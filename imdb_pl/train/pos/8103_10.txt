it was the most expensive movie when it was made. Sir Alexander Korda and H.G. Wells were outraged by his poor grades --- for good reason. it was and far ahead of its time. despite seemingly poor direction, probably editing, at the very beginning, work goes to a stunning conclusion. <br /> <br /> or his role as Sir Boss Ralph Richardson, or even better, his wives, Sir Cedric, as an opponent of cosmic struggle, central role of Raymond Massey "John Cabal" - all deliver amazing performances. <br /> <br /> scene with you. An incomparable set of Korda, a little girl, escaping to an absolutely "unmatched" stage, commenting "Life just becomes more beautiful and beautiful"? which quickly brings tears to every parent / grandfather. this is not a film for young people - unless "experienced", or rather those who have seen the "horror" that they oppose. <br /> <br /> surely "false parachuting" looks hokey --- when using "magnetic action", now called "mass driver", it can be seen as absurd, compared to rockets - give Sir Kordie a break - ladies . Wells made that choice. at +/- 8 million dollars, this movie went far beyond the "excessive budget" - so he concentrated on what he could do. <br /> <br /> the real power of this greatest cinema rests in "John Cabal's last statement about human destiny - his friend" Passworthy "doubts the wisdom of space travel, saying:" We are such small animals. " The right answer from John Cabal sounds (paraphrasing): "Yes, small animals, and if that is all we are, we must live and die as such." they are standing under a large astronomical telescope. shifts his hand over the night sky. "But we can have the whole Universe or nothing." - then the final chorus follows - "What will it be?" - this is not "Star Wars", "Blade Hunter" --- everything you can think of as "great" - this is Real Things. <br /> <br /> I remember Steven Hawking's last address, his latest "Medal of Honor" --- "Mankind must leave Earth or die. "- - the core of this work - I love" standard entertainment "- but this" relic "for the wise viewer offers much more. "What is it supposed to be?" Or in the right "mood" - whatever takes it - your breath dashed - "guarontee" - for humanity in general? the most important cinema. <br /> <br /> since the publication, I notice that many commented on the poor "media quality" examples of "survival". in the 1980s I developed a "proprietary" process of "coloring" that required a "clean" original. it led me to Michael Korda who sadly noticed that everyone had left - so we must relish what remains - "sad but true?".
