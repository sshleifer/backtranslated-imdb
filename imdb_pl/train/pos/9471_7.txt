Steve Carell plays Dan Burns, an uncle from the newspaper and a devoted single father to three girls. Dan gets to meet his ideal woman when he comes home greatly, only to find out that he is in a relationship with his brother. <br /> <br /> What should a man do? <br /> <br /> I preferred "Dan In Real Life", but I imagine that success or something will depend on whether you are willing to accept Steve Carell playing a relatively simple and restrained role, instead of going through wide comedy moves made him such a success. If you can not put up with it, do not be afraid, "Get Smart" will appear later this year, but for the recording I thought it was very good. <br /> <br /> "Dan In Real Life" begins like your typical, accidentally entertaining, family drama, but becomes more playful and fun when it goes together, and Carell's frustration about his situation grows. It is not massively original (but if you only saw movies with original ideas, the selection of films would be really small, right?), But "Dan In Real Life" is fun and well manned (which would not fall in love with Juliette Binoche luminous at first sight) Make the most of an insightful scenario that contains many reflections on the meaning and passion of love. <br /> <br /> I hope Steve Carell will push and do something so interesting again.
