The first cooperation between Schoedsack and Cooper is a fascinating documentary about the migration of the Bakhtiari tribe from Persia. Twice a year, over 50,000 people and half a million animals cross rivers and mountains to get to the pasture. You will feel like a spoiled weakling after seeing those people who feed their animals through the icy water and walk barefoot on the snow to cross the mountains, trying to force their animals to walk on the steep and narrow mountain paths.
