Although it was a disaster at the box office, it's my favorite movie. It gives a powerful message of the family. He has a lot of violence and has one song with a group of girls in a bikini. Compared to other bollywood movies, the action scenes in this movie are more realistic. This is an amazing combination of Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan. If you want to see Godfather Indians, Amitabh presents it in this movie. Do not read the critic's review, they are simply unaware. This movie has a good mix of comedy, romance, drama, and especially action. So if you want to see a more realistic action than Main Hoon Na (still a good movie), this is a movie.
