BSG is one of my favorite TV series. I was lucky to start watching him because the series reached the last season. It was a marathon for me from beginning to end and an amazing ride! <br /> <br /> As soon as I noticed the pilot in Hulu, I knew exactly what I was, only by title - Caprica! Although some things do not add up, when you compare both series, it is still beautifully made. There was no mention of the holobands in Battlestar Galactica or virtual worlds, but maybe I could not get to the series far enough to explain why. <br /> <br /> I recommend this show to anyone who loves the universe, technology and alternative fantasies of our world. This program is very interesting and will make you want to watch more!
