It's time for Gunga Din to be released on DVD. I can not tell you exactly how many times I watched this great movie, but it never tires. The main actors worked great together. Victor Mclaglen (Sgt McChesney), Cary Grant (Sgt Cutter) and Douglas Fairbanks Jr (Sgt Ballentine) are an unrivaled team. <br /> <br /> I just can not get out of their exploits in India. Your first look at Sergeant Three is when you see them fighting with other soldiers on the so-called treasure map. Three sergeants are sent on an expedition to find out what happened to the communication line and enter a mostly deserted city - or so they think. <br /> <br /> They are involved in the necessary repairs and will soon find a few "residents" in hiding. Shortly after they are attacked by a group of madmen and barely escaping back to the base. <br /> <br /> They are later sent to the next mission, which gives Sgt Cutter the chance to hunt for gold with Din. They find a temple of gold and are imprisoned by evil followers of Kali. Din is sent for help, and Cutter is captured. Soon McChesney and Ballentine arrive from Din, and they are too caught up. <br /> <br /> In the face of death, they look helplessly as their regiment comes to save them. The villains are watching and are about to throw an unexpected attack when the wounded Din climbs up to the golden dome and blows the trumpet, which then warns the British against an ambush. By doing this, Din is shot. <br /> <br /> Soldiers attack the bad guys and soon defeat them. Finally, Din is honored when he becomes an honorary corporal in the British Army.
