John Carpenter's Halloween <br /> <br /> Is this the greatest horror of all time? no ... maybe not for everyone, but it is and will always be for me. The film is a pure genius and will always have a special place in my heart. <br /> <br /> It's unfortunate that I did not see the movie after twenty years of its release, but even twenty years later, after the kitschy cats came and went, the movie still had the same effect as the one I had do. My father suggested that before the trip, I would see Halloween H20, which I throw out and rent Halloween 1 and 2, to get the full story, and after seeing Halloween it was pretty clear that it defines and sets the genre Slasher. <br /> <br /> The story is simple. In 1963, Michael Audrey Myers killed his sister Judith in a cold blood with a large butcher knife. Imprisoned for fifteen years, where he was treated by Dr. Sam Loomis, he escapes and returns to his hometown of Haddonfield, where he begins to haunt three young girls: Laurie Strode, an innocent bookworm, Annie Brackett, a hard talking sarcastic and Lynda Van Der Klok beautiful and sexually energetic young girl. Dr. Loomis follows Michael here, where he uses the help of the municipal sheriff Leigh Brackett, who remains skeptical about his story of a psychotic assassin. Michael ruthlessly looks at the girls and starts killing them one by one until only the sweet innocent Laurie remains, which is the main target on Michael's list. <br /> <br /> The cast of the movie was brilliant and all actors and actresses gave the best performances, Jamie Lee Curtis was stunning in her first role in the film, when Laurie Strode and Donald Pleasance gave a thrilling performance with their little role as Loomis. Nick Castle, who plays Michael, did a great job as a soulless and evil killer, and his movements and body movements were excellent. <br /> <br /> One of the biggest advantages of this film is the bloodcurdling result of John Carpenter who created one of the most known horror motifs known today. Blue Lighting was frightening and effective, and one of the great moments in this movie is when the young Laurie crouches against the wall after seeing her dead friends, and in the shadow behind her face, Michael materializes before he strikes. Michael's mask was one of those things that irritated my spine most. The white, emotionless face worked perfectly. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie so great, it's not a bloody movie as opposed to the cheap Friday 13. movies, in fact there is little blood in this movie and it works on tension and tension. <br /> <br /> It has become so clear that Halloween has spawned films such as Friday The 13 and characters like Jason Voorhees, of which he is an ordinary rip off of Michael Myers. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I suggest that you see this movie at least once in your life, because it is a turning point in film production and is undoubtedly not the biggest one of the greatest horrors of all time.
