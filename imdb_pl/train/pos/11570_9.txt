Elmer Fudd is laughing, sitting on a comfortable chair and reading his comic, and his dog sits comfortably next to the fireplace. Everything is peaceful until the flea comes. (The flea is dressed in a farmer's outfit with a large sombrero and wears a bag with the name "A. Flea".) He pulls out the telescope and notices the dog. (We see a big shot in the dog's bottom, and the flea whistles in excitement, shouting "T-Bone!" Then he sings: "There's food around the corner, there's food around the corner!") <br /> <br /> It sets the story a lovely but unbearable flea tormenting a poor dog. The pooch is hilarious because it reacts to a flea. <br /> <br /> Drawings of his huge teeth next to escaping fleas are clever, and the dialogue with the dog made me laugh a few times. This can be the funniest dog I've ever seen in a cartoon! Poor dog, under the threat of bathing, NOT to react when a stupid flea causes pain. It is almost painful to see how a flea uses a dog on picks, pneumatic hammers and the like. He puts firecrackers in the back of the dog. It's brutal!
