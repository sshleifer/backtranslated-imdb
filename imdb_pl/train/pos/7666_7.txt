Two sorcerers fought in the fourth dimension, one (Brian Thompson as Kabal) tries to destroy the Earth, the other (Jeffrey Combs as Anton Mordrid) tries to save him. "Doctor Mordrid" is a nice fantasy that offers a lot of cheese. The plot is quite stupid and gore is completely absent, but the movie is very short and funny. So if you have enough time to kill, give him that look. My rating: 7 out of 10.
