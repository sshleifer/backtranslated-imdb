After passing the title of the movie "Pecker" is a great movie, perhaps one of the best John Waters. The great cast, led by the strong performances of Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci, makes the story very funny and very real. There are a few shocking scenes that are definitely not suitable for young children, but there are for some purpose. Unfortunately, this film was not produced massively, and most of the audience will not have the opportunity to see it. If the opportunity arises, go to this video.
