Hitler's visit to Rome is the background to this delicate story of love, friendship, homosexuality and fascism. Sophia Loren plays six children at the housewife and mother, who stay at home while her whole family goes to a military parade in honor of Hitler and Mussolini. He must stay at home because the family can not afford a maid. However, she would like to go because, together with the entire housing complex in which she lives, she is a devoted admirer of Il Duce. <br /> <br /> However, there is one exception. On the other side of the courtyard, Marcello Mastroianni sits on a chair, thinking about suicide. Reason? He is homosexual and therefore recently lost his job as a radio announcer. The film really begins when these two people meet by accident. Mastroianni is in despair and needs a friend very much. Loren, frustrated with her cheating husband, does not understand Mastroianni, and in the masterfully filmed, directed and played stage on the roof of the building complex offers her body only to be rejected. The initial wedge soon replaces her hunger for this man, the anti-fascist, that homosexual, this other world who is so eager to give her everything she wants. <br /> <br /> This is a beautifully made movie with two of the most talented actors in history. Loren proves here that she is an actress of caliber when she is well directed. It is a simple but powerful film about fascism, love, ordinary people and, above all, the human condition. Despite the sad ending, there is hope in the background, everything will change, someone will understand.
