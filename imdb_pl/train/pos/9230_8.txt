You can say a lot about this film. This is not your typical nunsploitation. Of course, there is nudity and sex with nuns, but this is almost accidental in history. <br /> <br /> It is in the XV-century Italy, during the martyrdom of 800 Christians in Otranto. The battle between Muslims and Christians occupies a significant part of the film. It was interesting to see everyone running away from Muslim treasures, and the Mother Superior asked, "Why are you afraid of Muslims, do not do anything that Christians did to you?" There was certainly enough torture on both sides. <br /> <br /> Sister Flavia (Florinda Bolkan) is sent to the monastery for opposing her father. In this process, he is a witness and abolishes many things: the gelding of a stallion, raping a local woman by a new prince, torture of a nun who was defeated during a visit by Tarantula Sect and whipping himself when he escaped with a Jew. Torture was particularly gruesome with the hot wax poured on the nun, and her nipples were cut off. <br /> <br /> Sister Flavia will certainly get into trouble, questioning the male-dominated society in which he lives. He even asks Jesus why father, son and holy spirit are all human beings. <br /> <br /> Finally, he joins the Muslim leader as his lover and rakes the monastery. Here you can see more body than you can enjoy at the same time. But a tragedy is coming. She manages to take revenge on everyone, including the prince and her father, but discovers that the Muslim lover treats her exactly the same. She is a woman and that's all. <br /> <br /> I will not describe what the holy men of the Church have done to this heretic at the end, but this precedes the torture of Pi≈Ça or Hostel for decades. <br /> <br /> Nunsploitation fans will be satisfied with the delicacies, but cinema lovers will find plenty of meat to digest.
