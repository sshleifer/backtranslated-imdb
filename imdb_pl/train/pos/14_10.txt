This film has a special place in my heart, because when I first caught it, I taught reading and writing skills in adults. It called me very much, and even to the outstanding student I had at the time. There are scenes that make you swallow sudden emotions, and these even smile on your face by simply identifying with the characters and their situation. <br /> <br /> The excellent performances of Jane Fonda and Robert DeNiro, who have achieved a rank thanks to their best work, the great turn of the young Martha Plimpton, inspiring story and amazing musical score, make it the most enjoyable and rewarding experience.
