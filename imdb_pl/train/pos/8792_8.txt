A fun kung fu movie, with actors, fictional and battle scenes cutting above the average chop. All casts are nice characters and skilled martial artists. The patriotic comedies of Alexander Fu-Shen are pleasing to watch, and his strict companion shows particularly impressive skills. For me, the only glaring disadvantage of the movie is the size of the cast - it sometimes happens that it is a bit mistaken when the movie is spinning and changing between different threads, and some characters are not as full of ideas as you would like. <br /> <br /> But the kung fu film should be evaluated primarily for the quality of the action, and the Shaolin Temple definitely provides this number. The movie reaches a climax in the battle with a lot of horses, thanks to which each character can show his skills against a worthy opponent. <br /> <br /> In general, Shaolin Temple is a nice low-budget kung fu movie. Not to the quality of a good movie Jet Li, but definitely worth seeing fans of this genre. My rating: 8/10. <br /> <br /> Various remarks: The 1987 version of Warner Home Video, which I saw, was (predictably) poorly dubbed, and lacked full cast and cast.
