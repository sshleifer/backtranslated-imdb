Made in the same year as "Vertigo", it is also a captivating film, though in a much lighter style. In winter, it takes place in an enchanted New York: Kim Novak is a witch who casts a spell on James Stewart, but instead gets caught. An interesting side light is that Novak's rival is Janice Rule, who created a part of Madge in the "Picnic" on Broadway (a part that Novak would do on the movies).
