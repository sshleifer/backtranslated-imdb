To all unhappy people who did everything from complaining about dialogue, budget, this and that ... who wants to hear it? If you missed the sense of this beautiful film, it's your loss. The rest of us who love this movie do not care about what you think. I am a guy who has seen thousands of movies in my life, and this one is in my own body, in my book. It was not meant to be a document or a completely factual description of what happened that night. This is the most amazing love story ever made. I know it's the cynical 90's and the millennium everyone has dizziness, but give it a rest. Someone on this comment board complained that he made too much money! How is it weak? He made money packages in every civilized country in the world and is the most profitable movie in the world. I will gladly support the majority this time. Okay, cynics, it's time to crawl back under your rock, I'm done.
