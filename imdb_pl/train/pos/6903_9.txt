This underestimated movie is one of my favorites. I can watch it over and over again. Dreyfus and Braga are champions, but Raul Julia steals the show! Daring, scary humorous Addom Gomez, with the right tone for this disrespectful parody of this often-told story. <br /> <br /> Generally, uninhibited and unappreciated, Moon Over Parador lets you check the reality and join the fun on the screen. Two thumbs up!
