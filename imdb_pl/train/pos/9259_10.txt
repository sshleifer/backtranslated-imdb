It was simple, yet so nice. I think that the whole sense of sexual segregation in society, which can be bitter, has been shown very gently. He had a bitter hummer inside. The fact that most of the actors were not professionals made the film more tangible and more realistic. There was also a documentary website in the film. The best scenes were those for which all the girls who were banned from watching were passionately listening to the soldier who was supposed to watch over them by broadcasting the game. If you're an Iranian, cheering and dancing on the streets after winning the game, you fill your national pride !! If you are not an Iranian, you will still love the same!
