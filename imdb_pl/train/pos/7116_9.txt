Nobody would argue that this war movie of 1945 was a masterpiece. (How can a war movie from 1945 be a masterpiece?) And yet it is extremely effective in telling the true story of Al Schmidt, blinded by Guadalcanal, played by John Garfield, who spent his days in the blindfold to capture the nuances of a blind person. Robert Leckie, in "Helmet for My Pillow", denigrates Schmidt's popularity in favor of his fox partner who died, writing that "the country had to have live heroes". <br /> <br /> Well, I suppose the country did it. And they had one here. The film features a single battle scene, associated with a studio series, lasting only ten minutes and appearing less than half the movie, not recorded for the culmination, but it is the most terrifying and realistic image of men under fire, which I remember seeing on screen in including those in "Saving Private Ryan". Men scream with fear, shout at each other and at the enemy, bleed and die without the help of color, stereo sound, rustling or gore. <br /> <br /> Just from a technological point of view the film is unique. It's not just that we find out how complicated the .30 machine gun carbine mechanism is, or that it must be fired in a series of just a few rounds or that it is not waved around like a fire hose, like in many other war films. Technical precision improves the quality of the riveting of the stage. The need to stick to short bursts is terrifying when dozens of screaming enemies spill over a stream at a distance of fifty feet, solely to exterminate you and your two isolated comrades confined to a small shooting position. <br /> <br /> The performances are solid, if not daring, including the ubiquitous support of the forties, John Ridgeley, and the radiant youthful Eleanor Parker. The love story of framing is frugal, but it works and ultimately is very moving. A striking dream sequence was taken into account. It's not Bunuel, but for a routine film from 1945, it stands out as original and effective. <br /> <br /> Albert Maltz could have overwritten the script or could have been changed by someone else. You could use this kind of pruning that could introduce the much-needed ambiguity. Nevertheless, there are strange verbal punctuations that have a surprising effect on the viewer - "Why did not God kill me?" And "In the eyes, Lee. Take them in the eye! "Deep suffering in a few harsh words. And a surprising amount of bitterness expressed by wounded veterans in a war movie from 1945. <br /> <br /> Comments that may seem false to the contemporary viewer, but maybe they should not: an outdated native language that is hard to believe for many modern children can ever be pronounced - "private gab", "dope", "Drip", "Gee", "you stupid junk", "dame", "puffy guy" and "feel sorry". Consider the historical context and let us be good in our judgments. At that time, some of this stupid jargon was in the lead. <br /> <br /> Real vulnerabilities? Wounded veterans meet and argue with each other about how much they have a common future, and the argument is over-solved with the following request: "That you have a silver plate in your head, does not mean that people will think that you are bad human. Sometimes there are voices and silent prayers that are both unnecessary and unimaginable. "Please, God, let him come back to me" and that kind of thing. <br /> <br /> Well, filmmakers have acted within the limits of their time. Maybe that's why the final fade is in the photo of Independence Hall, and the inspirational varieties of "America the Beautiful" swell in the back. <br /> <br /> None of this can undo the advantages of the movie, which are significant, especially the impact of this terrifying battle scene. It's not so often on TV. If you have a chance, catch her.
