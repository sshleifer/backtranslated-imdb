Here's one that will appeal to the whole family ... even those who consider themselves too old for a fairy tale. Shelley Duvall has overtaken this unique, ingenious approach to almost all popular childhood tales. Scripts offer new phrases in the fairy tales we grew up in, and contain a handful of stars in each episode. "Cinderella" is no exception to the Duvall standard and in my opinion this is one of the top five series, highlighted by Jennifer Beals (remember her with "Flashdance" - and she is still in Hollywood making a film here and there) in the title role, Jean Stapleton as a godmother with a southern accent and Ewa Arden as the embodiment of a wicked stepmother. Edie McClurg ("Ferris Bueller's Day Off") and Jane Alden create a fun duo as a step-sister. Matthew Broderick is kind prince Henry. You will come back for it!
