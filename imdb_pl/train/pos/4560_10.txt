I just came back from the "My Left Foot" show in our public library. What an emotional experience - I feel exhausted and raised. <br /> <br /> This is the story of Christy Brown, an Irish writer and painter, based on the autobiographical autobiography 'My Left Foot'. Christy was born with cerebral palsy so that the only limb he had good control over was his left foot. The doctors advised the parents that he was hopelessly mentally disabled, but his mother did not give up and, like Annie Sullivan with Helen Keller, helped him achieve a breakthrough in which he learned the alphabet and then read, write and paint. <br /> <br /> This film won the Oscar for Daniel Day-Lewis (best actor) and the best supporting actress for an actress playing his mother; she also received Oscar nominations for the best picture, best director and best adaptation scenario. <br /> <br /> As a retired clinical psychologist and family therapist, while many movies can entertain me, many of them often also leave me to understand fictions or improbabilities in realistic psychological reactions. <br /> <br /> Not this movie - it was absolutely "on the spot" in presenting typical Irish roles and behavior of parents (see eg typical Irish families in "Ethnicity and Family Therapy") and an uneven emotional maturity of Christy Brown - some immature ones personality reactions that have been further strengthened by capturing father's traits. <br /> <br /> The film presents a greater truth when changing certain sequences into its development (painting and writing) and condensing several important people into one person in order to tell a coherent, credible story, not burdened with small, distracting, less important facts . (See Christy Brown in Wikipedia for more accuracy.) The DVD version, which was shown, had several English subtitles that were a great help in understanding Christy's speech (and some Irish statements); in the initial version of the movie it could not be missing. (If you see it on DVD, enable this option.) <br /> <br /> Daniel Day-Lewis's performance is one of the biggest, credible actor programs I've ever seen. Really wonderful, outstanding, supreme. <br /> <br /> "My left foot" bears more than some resemblance to the newer movie "The Diving Bell & the Butterfly", in which everyone presents the life of a real person to successfully overcome the imprisonment and isolation of extremely severe physical impairment. <br /> <br /> And in doing so, he resonates with William Ernest Henley's Invictus, which begins: "Beyond the night that covers me, // Black as Pit from the pole to the pole, // Thank you to all the gods who they can be: For my invincible soul.
