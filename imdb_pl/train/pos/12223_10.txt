I saw the real crime when it first appeared in the mid-nineties and I watched it many times. This is a great mystery about Mary (played by Alicja Silverstone), a high school girl from a California town who was a younger sister of a classmate, tortured and killed by an unknown murderer. Mary meets Tony (played by Kevin Dillon), a policeman who sees how bright he is and decide to work together to find a killer. <br /> <br /> Many suspects in this. True Crime is very "real" or real to me. I have read the review of the newsgroup in which someone wrote that the total suspension of disbelief is present here and is so true. Alicia Silverstone is perfect in this role, and Kevin Dillon and Bill Nunn do a great job, as do other actors. Locations are there, and the screenwriter / director Pat Verducci really captures some of the realities of teenage life and loneliness of Mary (see the scene in which Mary wakes up from the dream sequence after watching Tony's photos). I would like Verducci to make more films. <br /> <br /> I have not seen any other movie similar to True Crime. 10/10
