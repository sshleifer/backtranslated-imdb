I'm not an ordinary commentator on this site, but seeing how underrated this video is, I'm trying to write some comments and comments about it. I had a good time watching this movie, maybe because Cat is all I want to be, I do not intend to publish spoilers or reveal threads, but there are things that I really found amazing, the way it manipulates people, it's just divine . it's a very underrated movie, I'm missing arguments, I usually like to enjoy, and then I do not talk about it when you go to the cinema to have fun, and I really liked 1h53, I stayed in a dark room. It is necessary to see until the pleasure disappears. let's try not to be so critical. Thank you for reading.
