The sequence of the "Kingdom" is more bloody and even more twisted. I only saw half (I was exhausted and could not sit for the whole 5 1/2 hour), but I loved what I saw. Spirits, blood, murder, poisoning, mutated children, voodoo ... that's all! If you have a strong stomach and you like weird movies, this is for you. <br /> <br /> Also, you do not need to see Part 1 to understand ... you understand it! <Br /> <br /> Does anyone know if Kingdoms 1 and 2 are available on DVD? Sitting in these marathon films in the theater is exhausting. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it probably will not be "Kingdom 3" - Ernst-Hugo Jaregard (Sig) died a year after he was filmed. But you never know!
