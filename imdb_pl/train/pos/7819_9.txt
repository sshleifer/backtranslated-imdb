What a movie! I never imagined that Richard Attenborough would have such a movie in it. Gandhi always left me indifferent, except for the performance of Ben Kingsley, and I never considered Attenborough a particularly good filmmaker. But Cry Freedom has interested me just like a few movies recently. This is an exciting, mesmerizing political movie with great performances by Kevin Kline and young Denzel Washington. <br /> <br /> Kline plays Donald Woods, the publisher of a newspaper from South Africa, who befriends civil rights activist Steve Biko. It starts as a difficult friendship because Woods sees Biko as a black supremator who hates white people. But Biko, thanks to his polite words, optimistic attitude and total transparency, wins with Woods and introduces him to the reality of apartheid, which Woods did not know about. <br /> <br /> Biko is a decent, law-abiding citizen who altruistically opposes any prejudice and system that holds back his people. One night, from an illegal meeting, he was arrested and beaten to death. The authorities are trying to appease the case because Biko has become a great personality in South Africa. But thanks to Woods' efforts, the truth comes out. But what should be a triumph becomes a nightmare when Woods and his family become the target of the secret police. <br /> <br /> This movie has an interesting structure. In fact, he has two narrations: first he talks about the life and death of Biko. This is an incredible first half, completely dominated by Washington's charisma in what can be its biggest performance. <br /> <br /> The second half, no less interesting, tells how Woods tries to escape from South Africa to publish a book about Biko. Woods has become the enemy of the state, a forbidden person, which means he can not meet people or leave his country. Plus he is constantly being spied by the police. Kevin Kline also gives great results in the second half. <br /> <br /> Although the first half is quite simple, the second one is doing interesting things with the edition, giving Biko a flashing and events that show the repression of the blacks of South Africans. Some may argue that this is more interesting, but for me the other half is just as captivating as Woods and his family come up with a bold escape plan from South Africa. <br /> <br /> The last minutes were so painful that he was in tears. The result of George Fenton and Jonas Gwangwa certainly had something to do with it. Although I have never been a fan of Fenton (I can not stand his Gandhi score), I think the score for Cry Freedom is one of the most beautiful pieces ever made for the cinema. The movie, thanks to the music associated with powerful images, sometimes achieved incredible peaks of emotions. <br /> <br /> Cry Freedom is definitely not a movie just to watch him because of Denzel Washington. It is a film that should be cultivated in its entirety. By acting, writing, creating music, editing, cinematography, they combine into an excellent synthesis to create a ode to the power of the human spirit. This movie deserves a place alongside films like The Pianist, Life Is beautiful and The Shawshank Redemption.
