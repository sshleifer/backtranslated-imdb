Another for the Babes & Bullets crowd. The story is much sharper than any other musical I've ever seen: the cannons hid the missing legs of the females and placed each generative in the second, in a way similar to an intelligent commentary, than we could expect in the premises. More effective than the modern "drama". It is difficult to identify with a woman who is holding a cannon in her pants - in the legend. Unusual if context is taken into account. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the cannon brings 90% of surprises, this film also chronicles how greed replaces all other considerations in the life of a group of yakuz who seek a woman who keeps her leg hidden in a rocket cannon / missile (hence the lack of scenes) group or thong) Hidden missile launcher, which is withdrawn from the back of the heroes back, seemingly out of nowhere, in the Dead or Alive in Miike (1999), Torch taken out of the air by the heroine at the end of the original Tom (2000) or the shocking scene of throwing flames in the Sunny Gets Blue (1992), all this shows the third world of Cantinflas-esquire influence on contemporary Japanese cinema, which I can not explain, but I can not complain. <br /> <br /> You will not see good quality movies of this essence created in Hollywood, its extinct and cheap nonsense, which pump out for a cheap thrill, are almost ridiculous. This is a real movie and although it is great in its entirety, the ending is a brilliant, if not a ruthless rip off of some of Sergio Leon's paintings, with the participation of cannons in which the legs should be, and it is certainly right!
