The first review I saw says "what does madhur bhandarkar finally say?" Should he say something so decisive. <br /> <br /> The most beautiful thing about page 3 is that there are no pages after it. No propaganda. It is a film that records so many angles of the issue (I do not know what I call the "problem" here), but like every average film does not come up with a solution. I was so intrigued when I realized that the movie ended in almost the same scenario as it began. <br /> <br /> The film defines so many characters that are completely with completely different priorities and different ideologies, but all parts of the system, which is all the more apathetic. I would like to be able to say more, but there will be more spoilers ahead of us. Watch page 3 if you want to see one of the most mature films of recent times.
