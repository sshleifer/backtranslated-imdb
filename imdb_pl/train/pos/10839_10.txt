I noticed this video in the video store a few years ago and rented it. My husband and I liked it so much that we bought VHS and we have been enjoying it since then. <br /> <br /> The plot has been well discussed, so there is no need to discuss it. The point is that this movie deserves to be watched repeatedly. The Americans, especially, will not get all the jokes the first time. I know not. <br /> <br /> This movie is funny, moving, sad - all at the same time. When Ray proposes a toast at her daughter's wedding, it causes disgust. When Karen calls Tony "Brian" when he tries to kiss her, it is painful. When Beano is finally trapped by a black woman, she is too funny for words. <br /> <br /> And music: it's as good as any movie soundtrack I've heard for years. I danced in the salon to "All Over the World". <br /> <br /> Each performance is absolutely perfect. Bill Nighy was rightly praised for the role of Ray, a man who had too many bad journeys. Stephen Rea is perfect as Tony, a nice keyboardist who has worn a flashlight for Karen over the years. He has an appealing look that makes women want to hug him. But all the actors are equally brilliant. <br /> <br /> Ignore any pans you read about this film and see. It's a gem.
