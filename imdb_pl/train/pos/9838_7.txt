Born Again is a good episode of Season 1. A little reincarnation, in my opinion, is cool. The more I watch him, the more I like him, but for me he will never rise above "Very good". Even if it is not very memorable, I will always remember it as an episode of reincarnation. In any case, now I will say what is good and bad in this episode, <br /> <br /> Okay: Oragami. Oh Yeah! <br /> <br /> This Fish Tank was nice. =] <br /> <br /> Thrown out of the window. Very stylish. x] <br /> <br /> Bad: Marry the wife of your best friend!? O_O <br /> <br /> What a random choice for reincarnation. <br /> <br /> Why did the guy who died from tangling his scarf, instead take off his scarf? > <br /> Conclusion: OK, not very memorable. 7/10
