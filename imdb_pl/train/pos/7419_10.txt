Based on the preview I saw, I went to "The Shower" expecting a sweet little comedy; what I found was a deeply moving drama of family life told in one of the most lush photographic images I have ever seen. In addition, the subsequent reflection made me appreciate the sudden cuts of scenes from the past (in the arid areas of northern China and the Tibetan plain): is memory not so frequent? In an instant I'm here, in the next I'm in a landscape from the past, just like that .... <br /> <br /> Not only would I strongly recommend this movie, but I would place it among the two or three best films I've seen in 60 years. <br /> <br /> By the way, a few years ago in the US appeared another Asian "comedy" as "Shall We Dance?" (Japanese language). As in the case of "The Shower", the preview did not give the smallest picture of the depth of the film, which turned out to be a subtle psychological examination (although a wedge full of funny moments). Is there any concern from distributors that the films seem too "important" or "deep" to appeal to US viewers?
