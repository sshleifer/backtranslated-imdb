David Webb Peoples meets Paul Anderson ... if it sounds weird to you, then you're right, because it is. <br /> <br /> The people are known for their scripts about the moral implications of what is good and bad, the value of life, etc ... He discussed these issues in Bladerunner, Unforgiven, and in almost all of his scenarios there is something like that. <br /> <br /> Paul Anderson's first successful film was a brutal thriller. No wonder all his other films are available! And here is a violent thriller with moral implications! <br /> <br /> The folk script is quite visible in the first half of the movie. Soldiers trained from birth, learned to kill and never had a normal life. They are replaced by better, genetically modified soldiers, and Todd, one of the original soldiers, stays on the planet and is left to die. There he must deal with a group of refugees, some want others to hate him, and here is an interesting drama. BUT NEXT ... <br /> <br /> ... Balls start to fly when new soldiers move to the planet for military training and try to kill all people. There is a big, violent, loud action, and the Peoples scenario turns into a festival of Anderson's action. It's hard to believe that the script was written this way, but the end product is better than I expected. Funny, though not very inspiring and exciting after the start of the action. 7/10 <br /> <br /> Rated R: a lot of violence
