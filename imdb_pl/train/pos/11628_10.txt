"I did not want it complicated, Leese. I have to assume that it will read. " In this tense action thriller, fear escapes by 30,000 feet. Night flight to Miami quickly becomes a battle for survival when Lisa (Rachel McAdams) realizes that her partner (Cillian Murphy) plans to use her as part of a bloodcurdling conspiracy. As the minutes pass, she is in a race against time to warn potential victims before her delay. <br /> <br /> One of the many reasons I love this movie is chemistry between two stars, McAdams and Murphy, who are also my two favorite actors. For example, the early scenes at the airport sound more like a romantic comedy: two people bumping into each other ... I have to pass them to two, for making a film like this work. Especially Murphy's character ... Jackson, who seems to be a little bit complicated in that he is charming and innocent, yet he tries to do his job and make Lisa feel trapped physically and mentally. I mean, in some parts, he's really worried about Lisa. <br /> <br /> A great thrill. Many of the movies I do not want to watch are prequel or sequel, but I would not really mind the prequel that would happen with Jackson watching Lisa. The favorite scene is probably the headbutt scene, because it was so unexpected. There was also such a nice addition to the famous pen scene. When is he going to move? There was also a nice change in Lisa McAdam, where she changed from victim to fight. I also loved the scene in which she sits in court and pretends to ask some ladies for a food court questionnaire. How wonderful was Murphy with all his fatigue .....
