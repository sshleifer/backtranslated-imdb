This is one of my favorite movies of all time. It's great, and acting is brilliant. In the scene in which Michael Caine calls the tears of the policemen, and then stops the waterworks, when he ends, the connection really shows the brilliance of Cain. Returns are very funny. The film is at the highest level.
