I saw "Brother's Shadow" at the Tribeca Film Festival and two days later I thought about it. The story of a prodigal son (Scott Cohen) returning to an ordinary furniture company in a family after going to prison, offers all the necessary features of a solid drama - unforgettable characters; sharp, careful dialogue; sensitive use of the camera by a filmmaker who thinks visually. <br /> <br /> What's more, it presents something that is currently too rare in a multiplex: an uncompromising vision of mature sensitivity. The talent of director-scriptwriter Todd S. Yellin seems to emerge fully, but we feel that he (like his protagonist) paid premiums. He knows how real people are fighting in this world and knows how much we want to see - or at least experience substitute - success. However, Yellin respects the audience too much to smoke smoke at our back ends. In the end, we see that Jake's triumph is not in commissions or even in the respect of his family, but in "work" he could not give up if he tried. <br /> <br /> This is a necessary topic in the world (and especially in the film industry), which can not rise above the "bottom line". This film deserves a wide audience.
