That's My Bush is a live action project created by the creators of South Park, Trey Parker and Matt Stone. The performance was canceled after one season, not because of bad reviews (in fact it received good reviews), but because it was very expensive. is quite a funny parody of the average TV sitcom on the net. It is also a political satire. Now it is not as good as South Park, but it is a very funny sitcom parody, and quite a good political satire. the guy who plays in my bush looks like him! If you can find the program, check it. There is a lot of laughter that you can have! <br /> <br /> 9/10
