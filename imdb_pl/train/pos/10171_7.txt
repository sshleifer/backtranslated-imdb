Once, when I was in college and had an international trade fair, a Soviet poster with the inscription "Ne boltay!" Appeared in the Russian section, meaning "Do not gossip!". "I translated it" for the "generation" of television viewers as "Do not be Gladys Kravitz!" (Referring to the nosy neighbor in "Bewitched"). <br /> <br /> However, when you see the result of gossip in Pvt. Snafu short "Rumors", you see that it is not quite fun. In this case, an infinitely powerless soldier hears something about the bombing and immediately assumes that the Axis Power has attacked the United States. He tells this to someone who tells someone else who is telling someone else, and it continues. As in the "Russians are coming, the Russians are coming", the story is becoming increasingly disproportionate every time, so when he returns to Snafu ... well, you know what I mean! Yes, it's mainly propaganda from the Second World War - with an offensive word for the Japanese - but I must say that Pvt. Snafu shorts were quite funny. Of course, since they had Dr. Seuss's writing and Mel Blanc's voices, it's no surprise that these were quite cold. Worth seeing.
