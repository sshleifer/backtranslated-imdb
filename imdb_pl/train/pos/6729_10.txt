If you've seen Dogtown and the Z-Boys or have any interest in seeing a real, not a grotesque, "real American" side of America, then Riding Giants will hit deeper than anything you've seen before. <br /> <br /> This movie is "unreal", an easy date, if at all, but extremely suitable, if you can extract any form of literal meaning from it - it's a 100% actual document, but with the whole drama of the opera and the seemingly apparent love, expert and knowledge, rooted in Stacy Peralta's directing and narrative, this film expertly guides you from the wave to the great wave, keeping you completely fascinated by everything you get for the privilege of seeing. <br /> <br /> This film is a symphony, created in the same way as Beethovens 9, beginning beautifully from the prelude in Hawaii, plunging deeply into human emotions in Santa Cruz and ending with the uproar, triumph and crescendo in the exploits of Laird Hamilton, again on Hawaii. <br /> <br /> Like classical music; like 9th Beethoven, Ride of the Valkyries or Barbers Adagio for strings, this may be the only song you like, but it's worth it. Trust me.
