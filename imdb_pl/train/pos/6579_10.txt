Do you know the best version of the Quo Vadis screen? ever made. Well, yes, the plot is not as strong and obvious as in the book, sometimes it meanders and loses tension between aesthetic subtleties. But the film is really and beautifully "strange", it has a mystery and style, that there are definitely no other versions - with R. Taylor and the new from Poland. It has the atmosphere of Roman decadence, the beauty of falling paganism and Christian infancy. At least I believe that it does.) Brandauer, Forrest and Syudov did an excellent job of presenting their characters. Petroniusz Forrest seems to be the greatest success of the cast (let alone Brandauerze, who is one of the greatest actors in history) and gathers the very essence of this dying world (IMHO). this is it! That's how it happened, guys ...))) IMHO
