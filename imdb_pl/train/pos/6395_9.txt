For me, this is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Overcoming racism, struggling with life and proving that he is not an ordinary "cookie", Carl Brashear is an amazing character to play, which puts Kuba in his best light, the best performance in his life. De Niro, who is a living legend, gives THIS SOMETHING to the film. He adored his character in the film, but he gives so much good acting to this movie, a great performance. And the look of the beautiful Charlize was and as always is a big plus for any movie. So if you have not seen this movie, I highly recommend it for those who love courage, greatness, who seek inspiration. You must look this great drama. My vote 9/10.
