I can only agree with the taximeter that it is a fantastic movie and should be watched by a wide audience. Imagination on the display, visual interpretation of the script, humor is always surprising. The two wires are great and they really carry the film. My advice is: do not even watch the trailer, just rent a movie and watch it without expectations. I've rented from a hit, so it's easily available in brisbane, not everyone will enjoy it, but I think most people will have an opinion, and it's always good, unless it's "stupid". I loved this movie, you just do not see this gem every day. This should become a favorite cult. Try it, you can just feel just like me.
