I just caught an episode about Brad, addicted to cocaine, who became addicted to drugs on the street after his bicycle racing career went to waste as soon as it began. I must say that the story of his bicycle career was more painful than drug addiction. This is the young boy who wins the bike race on the left and right side and is invited to train with the Olympic training team for two weeks, and immediately after arrival offends Lance Armstrong, one of the greatest athletes who ever lived, and is generally soulless for everyone at all. Understandably, he is soon asked to leave. Most of the series is about his struggle with addiction and how he regained his life, but I wanted to know what was wrong with him so that his behavior would be like a butt? <br /> <br /> In any case, I was confused about how this series was made because it shows Brad at the height of his addiction. We see footage of his service and sleeping in gutters and ditches, and even burning crack. I did not even know it was legal, but why did the film crew just follow it and film it? Are they doing it in the hope that this guy will turn his life away and give them material for a good TV episode? <br /> <br /> In any case, it is an enlightening show, because it shows the effects of different addictions and total control over how they can take over people's lives. Sometimes it's hard to watch, because you really see how much family and friends are suffering in the face of the addict's indifference, although I must admit that in the end everything seems a bit too clean. There are moments in episodes, when there are terrible things and everything seems lost, but still, and maybe I should warn you about spoilers here, everything has a bit too happy feelings at the end and I have a feeling this is a very rare phenomenon in real life. But is it still a show about people who are trying to help other people and you can never really complain about something like that?
