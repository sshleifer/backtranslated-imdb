I've never been a big fan of horror movies. They usually try cheap tricks to scare their audience like loud noises and scary children. They usually lack originality and contain excess jewelry. The only horror I like is Stir of Echoes with Kevin Bacon. He was well-made and had a great story. But he joined him and maybe even surpassed him from The Shining Stanley Kubrick, probably the most horrible movie in history. <br /> <br /> The film follows the writer (Jack Nicholson) and his family who agree to look after the hotel, it is closed for the winter. There were rumors of a haunted place, and the last resident went crazy and murdered his family. But Jack is convinced that everything will be fine and he can use peace to overcome the writing block. However, after months of loneliness and silence, Jack becomes grouchy and then brutal. Is it a fever in the cabin, is there anything in the hotel that drives him crazy? <br /> <br /> One of the most frightening parts of the movie is the sense of isolation Kubrick does. The hotel is very quiet and the rooms are huge but always empty. He is also incredibly calm when Jack's son rides his bike through barren corridors. The performance of Jack Nicholson is also one of his best, frightening me and making me sure I will leave once in a while. My favorite scene is talking to the ghost from the fridge. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Shining is the peak of horror, beating snotty snotty, such as Ring and The Blair Projekt Witch. He may be an old man, but he is certainly good. 8/10
