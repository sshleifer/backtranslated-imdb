A bloody gangster story that unfolds during the Great Depression. He tells us about another notorious murderer Michael (Mike) Salliwan. This time the story turns the other way: Mike is fighting to save his life and his only remaining son, because the rest of his family was killed because of the dirty play of his own boss. He's got revenge and gives his son an honorable future, but eventually he gets killed. Such stories never have a happy ending. <br /> <br /> The role of Mike Salliwan Sr. has been greatly played by Tom Hanks, and part of Mr. Rooney (the mafia boss) was made by Paul Newman. The film makes a great impression and we hear the well-known phrase 'we rob banks'. This movie is still worth watching, although one could expect something bigger than Sam Mendes after his American Beauty.
