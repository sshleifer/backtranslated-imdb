I remember that I came across this unique one while surfing the canals in 1965. I have never heard of Barbra before. When the concert ended, I thought, "That's probably the best TV thing I'll ever see in my life." 42 years later is true. There is still nothing so amazing, as truly amazing as the talent that has been shown here. You can talk about all the super stars you want, this is the greatest of them! <br /> <br /> You call it, she can do it. Comedy, pathos, sensual seduction, ballads, Barbra is a real storyteller. Her ability to download everything she tries is legendary. But this exception originated at the beginning and helped to create a legend that quickly became. Despite the fact that she had come so far in such a short time, she fulfilled her promise, revealing more of her talents. But they are all here from the very beginning. You will not be disappointed in watching this.
