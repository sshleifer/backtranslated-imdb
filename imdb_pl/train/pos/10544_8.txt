"Cube" (1997), the first film by Vincenzo, was one of the most interesting and difficult ideas I've ever seen, speaking about movies. They had only one scene, a group of actors and a story. What made it so special was the effective direction, great dialogues and the bizarre condition that the characters must deal like rats in a maze. His second film, "Cypher" (2002), was entirely related to his story, but was not as good as "Cube", but here the characters are again tested as rats. <br /> <br /> "Nothing" is something very interesting and makes Vincenzo return to his "Cube days", closing characters once again in a completely different space, without re-playing with characters such as playing with rats in the experience room. But instead of the science fiction thriller (even some of these promotional trailers and wrong trailers looked like this), "Nothing" is a loose and light comedy that can certainly be called a modern satire about our society, as well as an intolerant world lived. Once again, Vicenzo amazes us with a great idea for something so small. 2 actors and a blinding white scenario, it's all you have the most time and you do not need more. While "Cube" is a claustrophobic experience, and "Cypher" is misleading, "Nothing" is completely opposite, but at the same time desperate. <br /> <br /> This film proves once again that a smart idea is much more than just a millionth budget. Of course, the movie sometimes fails, but its main idea means a lot and compensates for all the drawbacks. There is nothing more to say about this movie, because everything is a brilliant surprise and a completely different experience that I had in films from "Cube".
