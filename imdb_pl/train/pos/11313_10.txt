Gino Costa (Massimo Girotti) is a young and handsome tramp who comes to the road bar. He meets a young, beautiful and dissatisfied wife, Giovanna BraganÄ™ (Clara Calamai) and her old and fat husband, Giuseppe Bragan (Juan de Landa), the owners of the bar. He exchanges his mechanical skills for food and accommodation and has an affair with Giovanni. They both decide to kill Giuseppe by doing a car accident. Their relationships affect the sense of guilt and police investigation. This masterpiece ends tragically. Noir and neo-realistic Luchino Visconti's film is excellent. I watch this version for the first time. "The postman always calls twice". I loved the version from 1946 with Lana Turner and the version from 1981, in which Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange have one of the hottest sex scenes in cinema history, but this is certainly the best. My voice is ten.
