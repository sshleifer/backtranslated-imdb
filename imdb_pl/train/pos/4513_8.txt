A kid with ideals who is trying to change things around him. A boy who is forced to become a man because of the system. A system that hides the truth and violates the right to exist. The boy, inspired by Martin Luther King, gets up and tells the truth. A family that breaks up and fights with it. A movie from which you can not hide. You see things, and you hear things and feel things that you will die to the day you die, have never really happened. Violence, frustration, abuse of power, parents who can do nothing, and a boy with, I'm sorry, balls, a boy who will not accept things that will not let anything happen to him, a child with power and a kid who behaves like a professional like never before has done anything else, asking this film to the end and anyone who wants to see how it came to abuse in the 1960s.
