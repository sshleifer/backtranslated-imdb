<br /> <br /> Everything is relative, it seems to be the main theme from the very beginning of this eleven songs by eleven directors. This means that what may be a priority for people like Bush, Blair and Company may not affect many other people, ordinary people. From the initial scene in which an Iranian teacher tries to make the most important thing on his young disciples that has happened, the result is that children are not impressed because the neighbor's death and such things apparently affect them much more than anything that could have happened New York, in the US, wherever it is, this series of almost documentary stylized pieces proves that not all things are equal to all people, as some world leaders try to prophesy. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that the attack on the WTC was a fatal event in every respect, you can get the impression that both politicians and television operators tend to blow up all the things - wonderfully manifested in one of these pieces. Would the same international reaction happen if the attack took place, say, Lagos, say Jakarta, or even Rio de Janeiro? I do not think so much. It seems that the messages are distorted depending on what is going on: much more time is devoted to the earthquake in Italy, say, than one decade more devastating in Outer Mongolia. Larger distances seem to reduce the size of the disaster. <br /> <br /> This series of eleven pieces helps to put things in a better perspective - or, maybe I should say, some songs have, because each director freely invented his own story, his own translation of the perspective that you can not evaluate all the advantages, but individually for each 11-minute segment. <br /> <br /> Under no circumstances should one conclude that it is an anti-American film: it would be too easy to read various messages that appear in the segments. However, it is not pro-American. Eleven segments take different attitudes, and the common link - if there is one - is that the WTC attack disaster must be viewed from different points of view. Only then will people like George Bush even begin to understand the planet on which he lives. <br /> <br /> Clearly stated in one segment is my belief, which I have been hiding for two years: America has not learned this lesson. And the lesson is that the US must share this planet with the rest of humanity - not dominate its ruthless economic persuasion or ordinary power. Instead of learning that the US can not continue to stamp everyone and everywhere, their political leaders, helped and instigated by Blair (and even Aznar), have become even more arrogant and even more intolerant, which does not help anyone in Afghanistan or Iraq at present, not speaking about something else. The White House mentality is totally rejected: the US and Great Britain attacked Iraq and caused all the chaos, so they should explain the mess they caused - not to insist on the UN and other nations to delve into a helping hand, and thus find an easy way out of confusion . <br /> <br /> Radical attitudes adopted by the US (and even Israel) will be met only by the radical attitudes of Islamic people who have been preparing fanatical fundamentalism for years, if only to hide their own macho uselessness, ie stoning women to death or simply covering them from the tops of the head to the dusty ground. <br /> <br /> The world is in a terrible mess, fueled by the greed of a few rich countries, who seem not to see or understand anything from more multifaceted perspectives. This film in eleven separate pieces accurately depicts this grim and stupid attitude.
