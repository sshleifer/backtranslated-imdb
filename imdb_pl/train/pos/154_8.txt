"El Mar" directed by the Catalan director Agusti Villarony, based on the novel by Blai Bonet, shows the history of Spain seen by the Balearic Islands, which takes the viewer to the civil war in this country. The film focuses on three friends and follows them from the first days of the Majorca war to a few years later, when two of these friends meet again when they are in a sanatorium, lost in the countryside. > <br /> For the first time, we meet three boys who play happily. Not everything is what it seems. The tragic death of one of them indicates the cruelty of the one who commits a bad act. The boys ruled out a young girl, their age, from participating in their games. <br /> <br /> When we meet an adult Ramallo again, he is on his way to the sanatorium. He seems to be suffering from tuberculosis. To his surprise, Manuel Tur, one of his childhood friends, is also treated, and a young girl who has not been accepted into their games is now one of the nuns who oversees their health care. It is obvious that Tur is looking at Ramallo in a way that means he is in love with a hard tyranny. Their relationship will have devastating consequences. <br /> <br /> Roger Casamajor does a good job of introducing senior Ramallo. Bruno Bergonzino impresses Tur, the sensitive youth. Antonia Torrens plays Sor Francisca with conviction. Angela Molina, introduces himself as Carmen, the wife of the caretaker of the institution. Simon Andreu is perfect as Alcantara. <br /> <br /> "El Mar" is a dark film that clearly shows the talents of Agusti Villarona, thanks to which the novel comes alive for the viewer.
