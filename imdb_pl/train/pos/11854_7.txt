I agree with "Jerry". This is a very underrated cosmic film (of course, how many good low-budget ARE NOT did not appreciate?) If I remember correctly, solving the mystery was a kind of a variation (but not a rip off) of 2001, because the computer controlling the spaceship was actually a human being, which has somehow been turned into a computer. And like HAL, they tried to disconnect his "mind", but not mechanical parts, and like in the case of HAL, it led to a catastrophe. There is at least one funny moment. When the character Christopher Cary, who can not find any food, finds an abandoned bird, something like an ominous moment appears, but in the end, the obvious thing does not happen.
