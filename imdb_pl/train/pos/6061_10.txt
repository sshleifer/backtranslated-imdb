I liked the movie so much that I watched it twice and that is something to say about the documentary. Music, photos and sound are absolutely stunning, as you might expect from Imax. Although it is shot for these great Imax cinemas, it looks and sounds wonderful in my home system. In fact, it would be the perfect DVD for demonstrating your system. <br /> <br /> The topic is also fascinating. It's about Mario Andretti and his son Michael. I was already a fan of Mario, because he is the best racing driver in history, because he is the only person who won the CART Championship, F1 Championship, Daytona 500 and Indianapolis 500. The script follows the path of two cars very important for father and son. The first car is in a chicken coop and turns out to be the first roadster that Mario has ever driven, and we are following the restoration to glittering perfection. The second car is Michael's new racing car, and we follow him from cutting through the form during the racing season. Imax gives the right magic to build and fascinate the construction of the car. <br /> <br /> Paul Newman, who was the owner of the Michael Amoretti band during the creation of this film, tells the film. His anecdotes and wit, taken from many years as the owner and driver, are largely suitable for production. <br /> <br /> The main feature is the racing scenes. Increase the volume here! There is something about driving over 200 miles per hour and a musical score that catches you completely to experience what you will not forget. Wow! <br /> <br /> The last magical element is the humanity of the Andretti family. This god of the world of racing, Mario Andretti, is a loving father who watches over his son's care with pride. They work together so well that every father and son should see it. You can say that they are a close family. I would like everyone to have this experience.
