Before Cujo was the devilish dog Lucky. In 1978, on Halloween night, the premiere of "Devil Dog, The Hound of Hell". The story of a family gaining a new puppy (from a farmer who happens to be in the neighborhood selling fruit and vegetables) because their Skipper dog was killed. Everyone loves a new dog, but there is something strange about it. <br /> <br /> It does not take long before father Mike Barry (Richard Crenna, First Blood) begins to notice. His wife Betty (Yvette Mimieux, Where are the boys, Jackson County prison, Snowbeast) is different and his children Charlie and Bonnie (Ike Eisenman, Witch Mountain and Fantastic Vourage and Kim Richards, Witch Mountain, Nanny and Professor, Hello Larry, Tuff- Turf) have also changed. Does the dog have anything to do with it? He is determined to learn and do everything to save his family. <br /> <br /> This movie is great because it has Ike and Kim playing a darker side of themselves than what we've seen on those witches from mountain movies. This is one of the many television dramas from the 1970s that were horrifying for television horror. The music was terrifying, and even the end I will not tell you to think about. <br /> <br /> In this film there are also Ken Kercheval (Cliff Barnes of Dallas) and R.G. Armstrong (who could not stay away from devil movies remember "Race with the Devil"?) <br /> <br /> It's worth to watch it.
