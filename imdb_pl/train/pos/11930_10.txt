This movie was pretty good. I'm not a big fan of baseball, but it's a movie that was made to understand the meaning of love, determination, heart, etc. <br/> <br /> Danny Glover, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Brenda Fricker, Christopher Lloyd, Tony Danza and Milton Davis Jr. they are presented with many talented actors and understand this sport. The plot was credible and I love this message. William Dear and the boys created a great movie. <br /> <br /> Most sports videos focus on real stories or events and often do not work well. But this film hits 10 on the scale of perfection, although there were some minor mistakes here. <br /> <br /> 10/10
