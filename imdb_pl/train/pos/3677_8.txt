Fortunately, I last saw it on a plane to Singapore (I thought I missed it in the movie Cinemalaya). Paris, je t'aime is a collection of 20 short films (about 5 minutes each) 20 directors showing love in different pockets of modern Paris. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite segments is "Parc Monceau" by Alfonso Cuarn (Great Hopes, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban), which was made with one continuous shot and contains Nick Nolte. <br /> <br /> The "Tuileries" of Coen brothers with Steve Buscim as a tourist in the subway was fun! Juliette Binoche and Willem Dafoe in "Place des Victoires" were persecuted. <br /> <br /> For Maggie Gyllenhaal as an American actress / drug addict in the "Quartier des Enfants Rouges" presented the anticipation and heart occupation in such a short period the time was simply brilliant. <br /> <br /> Elijah Wood as a vampire victim in "Quartier de la Madeleine" was quite surreal, while Emily Mortimer and Rufus Sewell played a lovely couple in Wes Craven's "Pre-Lachaise." <br /> <br /> Natalie Portman was beautiful as usual, as an actress of a French boy with visual disabilities in "Faubourg Saint-Denis". But despite many representations of young love, the more mature execution of Genesis Rowlands in "Latin Quartier" was equally inspiring. <br /> <br /> This movie is perfect for people with ADHD, because each sequence is conducted and thought carefully. <br /> <br /> There are also many unforgettable quotes. One of them is especially the one from the cheating husband, who finally leaves his lover to stay with his dying wife in the last days: "Pretending to be a man in love, he became a man in love."
