If you believe movies, Chinese ghosts are much nicer and more malicious than their Western counterparts. The plot of the three films "Chinese Ghost" are largely identical, but the direction is perfect, and the details and color are such that it is not a big problem. As always, humor is an integral part of the film, which is accompanied by many attacks. For those who have not yet met the Chinese GhostStory trilogy, this movie is an interesting departure from the western genre of horror / ghost; for those who have, another nice fun in the Chinese spirit world.
