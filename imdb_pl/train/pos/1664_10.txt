I thought that this movie was stunning, with completely outstanding performances by Valentina Cervi (Artemisia Gentileschi). place. The passion that Artemisia gives to its art is simply spectacular to watch. <br /> <br /> Although not every character was clearly beautiful, it made the movie more realistic because the hair on the face and clothes was perfect at the moment. <br /> <br /> Generally, I thought this movie is fantastic.
