Cary Grant and Myrna Loy are perfectly staffed as a middle-class couple who wants to build the home of their dreams. Everything begins with reasonable plans and expectations, both of which are interrupted by countless complications and the explosion of the original budget. <br /> <br /> There are many great laughs (even if the story is a bit thin) will surely entertain celebrity fans or the Hollywood comedy style from the late 1940s. A definite attraction comes when the performer goes through all expenses, which must have sounded quite exaggerated for recipients from 1948. When he leaves, he assures the client (Grant) that he can achieve a reduction of $ 100.00 from total ... or at least $ 50.00 ... but certainly $ 25.00. Cheerful!
