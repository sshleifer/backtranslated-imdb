"Father of the Pride" was another of those good performances, which unfortunately do not have a long life. And this is quite sad, especially if you take into account that almost all the time the worst programs are still on the air (think in "Simple Life"). , the show has its advantages. Animation is just right, unbelievable, but good. The characters are the best. All animals are very nice and funny, and even Sigfried and Roy had their moments. The music was good, I liked many songs. <br /> <br /> Even if the program is not very original, I think it had a lot of potential. very famous, but I loved it, it did not have the recognition it deserved. What a pity .
