What begins as a generation conflict in this film ends with understanding, seriousness and grace. The film winds around Europe with her father, and her young son cramped in a car over 3,000 miles. Spasms force life styles, beliefs and life skills to collide. There really is no clear winner. All this is at the end as an experience, an experience of many layers of life. For those interested in understanding Islam, this film offers a generous and gentle look without being intrusive in relation to the program. It is a story about a young son, his disrespectful and rebellious nature turns to openness to receive more ways of life.
