Spoilers! Classic rubbish from the 70's! The Swedish gal (Helga) made this movie so great. She was beautiful, but what really happened to me was sexuality. Throughout the film, she emanated a huge amount of sexuality. Her best scenes were when she stimulated herself. Every time she was on the screen, I became fascinated. <br /> <br /> Also, Doctor Julia (the sister of the dark male bonfire film) was very visually interesting. Although most 12-year-old girls have bigger breasts than Julia, she knew how to use what she had, and her scenes (especially scenes with a silk blouse and a black skirt) also ruthlessly attracted my attention. You also loved the main stage where bats undressed her necks; I do not know if I've ever seen anything more absurd, yet sexy. Classic things!
