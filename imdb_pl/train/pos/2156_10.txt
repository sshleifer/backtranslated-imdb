This movie is one of my favorite foreign films, some of them are Amilee and My Life As a Dog. The similarities with these films, as with so many great foreign films, consist in taking away the mundane piece of life and transforming it into a deep, sincere lesson. <br /> <br /> In Japan, a man bored with his prosaic life and ruts of marital life, he sees a beautiful Japanese woman staring at the window of a dance studio. When the train has to pass it is enchanted. But is it only thanks to her beauty, her distant gaze or connection, which both will discover that they divide? <br /> <br /> Shall We Dance has unforgettable great characters who have to deal with painful realities, crossing them through the world of dance. Breaking the traditional forms and stereotypes of Japanese society, they risk everything for happiness and discover that joy is not too far away. This is one of those films that is so magical and meaningful, and in itself goes beyond mundaneness, showing the real magic and miracle that life can be.
