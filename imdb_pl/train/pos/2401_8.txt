Guy Kibbee gives the viewer a lot of laughter. Like most candidates, he hardly knows anything. Warren William, very, under the judged actor, is excellent in giving instructions to Kibbee; that is, it teaches him to say something that does not mean anything to the voting public. A campaign based on a lack of comment, "I will take it into account" and "Maybe yes, but again, maybe not" is almost an excellent way to win the election. In short, a stupid candidate, the greater the chance that he will win. In the end, society can identify with such a person. When it comes to film, it does a lot of comedy.
