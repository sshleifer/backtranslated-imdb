I intend to commemorate the tenth anniversary of Marcello Mastroianni's death with many of his unwanted films that I have on VHS; However, given my uninterrupted Christmas marathon, I had to do just this! It just so happens that he has one of his best performances - and he was rightly nominated for the Oscar (just like the movie itself). It was also one of 14 collaborations with the most famous star that emerged from Italy, Sophia Loren; Both, by the way, play here against the type - she is a naughty housewife and he is homosexual! <br /> <br /> Incidentally, the title of the film has a double meaning: the main characters meet on the historic day Hitler came to Italy to meet Mussolini (the event itself was shown in long archival materials), but more specifically refers to the "short meeting" of the stars, in which they share moments of friendship, revelation and, in short, passion - although everyone knows that a return to their normal existence is inevitable, which leads to a sudden bittersweet ending of the film. It is practically two-handed (with all other characters - except for the nosy concierge of a block of flats in which history takes place in full - including the harsh and patriotic husband Loren, unexpectedly played by John Vernon, appears only in the initial and final sequences); despite this, the tight setting does not discourage director Scola (to record, this is his seventh movie, which I watched and I have three more on VHS) and the operator Pasqualino De Santis, so that the result - although the key is generally low - is far from stagy: the camera can walk in different parts of a large building, observing the proceedings accurately or dispassionately, as the situation requires, but always willingly. <br /> <br /> Narration, of course, depends entirely on the appearances of the two stars, to be convincing, and both provide (their chemistry on the screen is incomparable); it is interesting, however, that while Loren went away with rewards in his home, Mastroianni's moving but ineffable outsider (a somewhat dubious film seems to equate his sexual deviance with anti-fascism!), which overall impressed the international audience!
