Since their nasty divorce with the Disney Company (with Miramax's Disney brand), the Weinstein Company seems to specialize in extraordinary films that are undervalued and viewed by only a few. THE FLOCK is a perfect example. <br /> <br /> A story about civil servants who have a nasty job in tracking registered sex offenders, this photo will tell more about sex offenders than the entire law season and Order - SVU. <br /> <br /> Richard Gere gives the best performance ever as a soft spoken agent consumed by the task. Claire Danes has one chance to appear in a solid role (instead of scrap, which usually gets stuck) and uses the novice as much as possible. Cinematography, stimulation, editing all this at first glance - and I did not see any trace of a jumping camera with a lack of attention or excessive camera cuts that others complained about. The topic is treated with restraint, but it is still a difficult topic and can make you sick. <br /> <br /> Fifty years ago, there was almost no problem with the types of sexual offenses presented here in abundance that would shock even the jaded. Then came the decisions of the Supreme Court, which at the same time bound police hands, because the "laws" of sexual perverts were opened, and America was turned into a buyer's paradise to give them sexual perversion, both willing and reluctant. Each such step met with the praise of the liberals who celebrated Warren's sick deeds with glossy covers on Time and Newsweek. Daily liberals also praised the Court's actions and mocked those who disagree. In 2007, how many Americans know that the type of pornography that depicts wild violence and torture of young women - you can subscribe to and is subsidized by the rate of rebates issued by the US post office. One part of the problem - a problem that can destroy the family to shreds. <br /> <br /> Richard Gere is a liberal, but he gives his best. Perhaps he gained wisdom in his mature age.
