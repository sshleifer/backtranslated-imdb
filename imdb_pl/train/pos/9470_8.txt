I'm not a fan of Steve Carell, but I like the movie about Dan, a council columnist who goes to his parents' house to stay with his children and ends up in falling in love with his brother's girlfriend. This is a story told earlier, but not so. There are simply too many small pieces that make the movie better than it should. The cast is great and even if Carell is not my cup of tea, she's pretty good as a widower who has everything to know, but discovers that knowledge is different from feeling and sometimes life surprises you. Sometimes witty and wise in the way the annoying Hallmark card may be, the movie still manages to grow up on you and be more than just a millstone run. Worth to see
