This film is basically filmed on the camera by the actors. In some respects, the mockumentary in a different way, the video from the killers is full because of the Columbine-style attack. Although this movie does not answer all the big questions, it gives an insight into how easy it would be to free yourself. The film shows how the actors illegally shortened shotguns, made bombs from pipes and developed a plan of action for "Zero Day". Actors (if you could call them that) were brilliant, apparently they borrowed very much from their own lives, but at no stage did I detect them really acting (something Tom Cruise should try). The use of CCTV and 911 at the end was brilliant, but I'm not sure if we needed the last scene. In general, a really good movie on a very difficult topic.
