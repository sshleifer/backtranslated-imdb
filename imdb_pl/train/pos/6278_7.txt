I saw it during a flight to the USA and at first I was a bit skeptical because several people said that there are so many characters in it that you did not recognize any of them. However, I did not find it at all. The film is fast, but it is due to the nature of the director and the star. The pursuit scenes are excellent and so they can be predictable, but they are not true for most films. The main villain is a bit disappointed, Christopher Eccelston is not as convincing as he could be, but he said it was still a good movie.
