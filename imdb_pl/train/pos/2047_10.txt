This movie was my home. At the age of 29, I remember my 80's and my father working in a factory. I came to the conclusion that if I worked hard, if I was proud and never gave up, I could also have an American Dream, a home, a few kids, a car that I call my own. I have noticed, however, that without a degree in something (as opposed to my father who gave up the ninth grade) and a deep sense of greed and laziness, you can not get anywhere. if someone has this movie on DVD or VHS. it's made for television, and I saw it an hour ago. Ic, I can not find him anywhere! I would like to show this to my friends, my pseudo friends, family and other relatives, see what they think and remind them that once the Americans WORKed in the name of feeling of honor and that we are proud of what we are excellent !! I think that feeling still exists, but in a hesitant downturn, when so many things are created abroad ...
