I saw this movie after seeing the version of Paltrowa. I found this very good and I thought it would not be so good ... but I was wrong: the British version was much better and more enjoyable! I think Jeremy Northam is more "nice" than Mark Strong, but I can say that Strong catches much better Knightley Austen. In any case, both versions are good, but everyone who loved Austen's books should watch this movie. I agree with * caalling *: Andrew Davies has changed a few things, but he remains true to the original. <br /> <br /> 10 of 10 <br /> <br /> My 2 cents!
