Like almost everyone who has commented on this video, I can only wonder why it never appeared on the video. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing him around the age of 12 in "The Late Show" around 1972.

But the scenes I REALLY liked were those that depended on Lord Kitchener's death aboard the HMS Hampshire almost exactly 90 years ago. Scenes of the convicted cruiser approaching the minefield in the storm were really chilling in their veins, as I remember. <br /> <br /> I do not remember the musical score, but the comments of others now make me curious.
