Cinderella is a beautiful young woman who is cruelly treated by her evil stepmother and half-sisters. One day the ball will be in honor of the prince, but Cinderella has no chance, because her stepmother and step-sister will not let her. With the help of her fairy godmother and her animal friends, she is at the ball with a warning about returning home before midnight. At the ball he meets a handsome prince from a fairy tale. When the clock hits midnight, he runs home, leaving behind one of the glass slippers. With the help of animal friends, he reveals his true identity. She and the prince were married later and live happily ever after. <br /> <br /> Cinderella, released 56 years ago, has been a huge box office success and still impresses the public to this day. Has a well-written script. The characters are unforgettable. The songs, including "A Dream is A Wish Your Heart Makes", "So This Is Love", and a great "Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo", help to tell a story. It was my favorite movie growing up and did not lose anything of its charm. A real masterpiece of Disney! Recommended. 10/10 P.S. The latest version of the DVD is the best way to appreciate this movie, including scenarios, deleted scenes, music videos, radio programs from the year and the restored movie printout!
