I'm honestly surprised how little was done in the Columbine massacre movie. There is no bigger document, very mysterious. Fortunately, we are blessed with the talent of Ben Coccio, who directed ZERO DAY, and Gus Van Sant, who made equally great SUN. Two different approaches to this event, which have a common idea that the real cause of the massacre will always be a secret, that there is something ultimately surprising and unknowable in the motivations of two killers, and what really led them to bring this fantasy into a terrible reality. ZERO DAY, allegedly consisting of video tapes taken by shooters and found after the event, is absolutely riveting. Even if you know where you are going, you still hope that it will NOT "go there" ... and the tension in the last minutes of the movie is terrible. The film is great from top to bottom, from the director to the script (not very improvised, though it seems very spontaneous), to the two main actors, as well as supporting players. Only one aspect of ZERO DAY worries me. Okay, so we can not understand why the shooters will do what they did, but certainly one of the authors was their LIE. However, these boys do not really seem angry. They can say a few things to show that they did, but in reality they did not convince me that they had something in them that forced them to kill innocent people. But that still leaves me feeling "why ???" the director Coccio wants. In any case, rent or buy this movie, it will sneak in and stay with you for a long time. The people at BLAIR WITCH could wish only the kind of success these guys had in creating a successful documentary.
