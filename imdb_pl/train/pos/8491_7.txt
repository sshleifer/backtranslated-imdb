I saw this movie when it was new. Later, I hired him in Japan after three years spent here, fearing that I would be sad when I saw him in the harsh light of my extended international experience. The film pleasantly surprised me, how exactly it represents the clash of culture between Japan and Pennsylvania (where I am from). Not all things are in place, but the tone is perfect. <br /> <br /> I am still in Japan many years later and I am still enjoying this film with equal treatment of both sides in history. Interestingly, although the Japanese-American actors spoke Japanese in the original, the dialog was re-added in the Japanese version to hide the obvious problems with the delivery of the second language. <br /> <br /> I noticed that one reviewer uses this in the Japanese class. I think you can learn more about what to expect after meeting Japan, watching this movie than reading "serious" books on the subject (most of which were written in the 1980s and financed by the promotion of Japanese companies) . br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by dragging the average rating caused by one-star reviewers who, among other things, decided that the Japanese do not want to build cars in the USA. (Of course, the Japanese work there in many factories to be close to customers and avoid commercial friction.) This is a very warm and funny movie, which I would rate higher, if not a few stereotypes from the 80s, such as dancing around cheap electronic disco music. Michael Keaton has never been more fun.
