I've never heard about this movie, I saw it on DVD. A great movie, a great example of a movie that made every cast member make it work. He did not overdo it with a typical Hollywood movie with the same old overcrowded actors. No current quotation of "A" list actor could have made a performance in this movie. Memories of my own military experience after the Vietnam War. She focused on the people who were sent to fight. As the heroes showed, who had fears and emotions, even if some of them volunteered to serve. They were also ordinary people, some were simply not cut down to military life, I remember some of my experience - to put it mildly, I could not adapt to military life - but I will never forget them - I should stay in touch. I highly recommend and then think about those who serve today in Afghanistan. Basic training is a journey, notice that sergeants are not morning people and may need a "sensitivity training" HA! HA! HA!
