THAT is everyone who thinks 1. It was a boring TV show 2. Halle berry and denzel Washington did not deserve their Oscars <br /> <br /> CLOSE F ** K UP !! It was one of the Academy's best awards, because it was a moment in history, so that the black "Black actress" won the academy award for the best actress, so many of our black sisters were ignored for many years by the academy. Honestly, I stopped watching academic prizes because of the lack of diversity among both the winners and the nominees. For me, it was just a group of white people who patted each other on the back. The Academy had many chances to vote for black actresses that were brilliant in movies, such as Alfre Woodard, Whoopi Goldberg, Diana Ross, Mary jean Babtise, but not 2. Jagoda Halle deserved that Oscar, without any competition, was under pressure to vote for her so long that the deserved actresses have been ignored by the academy, the majority of which consists of white voters, yes, yes, Nicole kidman sang very nicely in turbulent pink, but the time has come for the black people to be honored at these shows. Like Mr. Washington, the academy was owed to him after this unjust loss for all who think that race is not a problem of "probably white people" in the film industry, well, many of the most talented black actresses have been reduced to the stereotype typical of white people. I think she is a black woman or there is no Angela base. I do not expect many white people to understand all this because they never had to deal with it. Think about it that he asked it
