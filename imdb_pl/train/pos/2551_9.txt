This almost unknown gem was based on the French farce - which shows, and I mean the compliment. <br /> <br /> Caroline (Lee) is being run by a wealthy Argentine (Roland), who asks his father for a hand in marriage. But Caroline is already married to Anthony (Colman), who just arrived by plane and immediately launches a reminiscence directed to the public about the last time Caroline decided she was in love with someone else: a dilettante-sculptor (Gardiner). The film presents the history of Anthony's strategy in decoupling Caroline from the sculptor and how this experience helps him in Argentina. <br /> <br /> It's perfectly planted: Ronald Colman is the most refined and charming, Reginald Gardiner is the most proud, Gilbert Roland is the most exotic, and Anna Lee is just wonderfully capricious. The film is wonderfully directed by Lewis Milestone (who also produced it); all production is like a job of love. There are great touches like breaking the frame and addressing the camera by Colman, as well as the unique use of the sliding door bar-cabinet. It is a sin that it has not been released on DVD - it is a kind of film that can itself arouse interest in classical film.
