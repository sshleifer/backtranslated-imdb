My babysitter was a fan, so during the adolescence I saw many older episodes. I'm not a fan of Scooby Doo, so I'm not sure why I left the TV when the program was released. To my surprise, I found it pleasant. For me Shaggy and Scooby were the only interesting characters * avoiding tomatoes from other fans *, so I like the fact that they focus only on these two. However, this can cause fans of original programs to hate it. I like voice acting, especially Phinius Phibes. I liked to listen to him before I knew he was Jeff Bennett. And Jim Meskimen like Robi, I think he really likes his job as an actor. I also draw from technicians with their somewhat autistic personalities and their desires to play Dungeons and Dragons or to play scenes from Star Wars (of course not named by the names in the series).
