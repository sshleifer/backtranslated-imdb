but equally fun and random! I love it or hate it, but do not expect a sophisticated storyline or biting cliff. Think of it as Seinfeld, but without the next and repeated performances of crazy characters (well ... so far, I have a feeling that I will develop my favorite as the season continues). <br /> <br /> "Creating Consolation" is not for people with a weak mood - you should enjoy them with the least effort on the part of the brain. That's why this program embodies everything I need in the program when I come back from work in the evening: a superficial conversation in the background with the right amount of "cute" characters that I can enjoy when I finally look up at the computer to see what I'm missing. <br /> <br /> Funnier than most of today's series, quieter than the evening at NASCAR. The right mix of dead air and returns. I can not wait for the next one.
