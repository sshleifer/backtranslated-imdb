Being a fan of "Columbo", I was very disappointed with "Corky Romano". Though it is certainly a funny movie, the hero of Fob's boss has a lot to say from a nice lieutenant in which he played for many years, especially with the offensive language he used. After "Corky Romano" I was honestly surprised and embarrassed by Mr. Peter Falk. HOWEVER, after watching "Finding John Christmas" and its predecessor, "A Town Without Christmas", for the first time within a week of myself, I must say that "Max", the amazing character of Peter Falk in both films, is certainly equally unforgettable and nice like "Columbo". Although parts of the movie are quite predictable, such scenes in no way take away the pleasure of watching the story. I would also like to record both these heartfelt Christmas movies and I highly recommend them, regardless of whether you are a fan of Falka, a Christmas star, or just someone who likes the occasional movie of the week. This movie may get lost among the crowds of vacation movies, so find "Finding John Christmas" before it's too late.
