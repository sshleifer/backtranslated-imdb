I love this movie / short thing. Jason Steele is amazing! My favorite parts are The French Song and the opening title when the spatula soldier yells "SPOONS!". I am blown away every time. I recommend this film to fans of Knox Klaymation and people who like other Jason Steele movies. His style of animation is very original. To see detailed backgrounds, you need several views. His humor is also fun and definitely not something you will hear earlier. Like Max, a deformed spatula with a sound and light system that radiates colorful lights and happy music when talking about your unhappy life. It's a great animation to watch anywhere, anytime.
