Some of those guys who watch movies and complain about their lives forget something: the DVD menu system. I tell you, I watched the main screen repeated 35 times. It was amazing. A cinematic tapestry of cascading glare that made me stand where he was, and that was the beginning. Repeated sum and Bam! I was addicted. Time after time. And more. <br /> <br /> "Doot de doot, de doo de dodedo". And this is just a soundtrack! <br /> <br /> I was put on my bed, curled up with my Vaio. The rain is on a flat roof, and today the soft is again soft. The cat is comfortable, and my ankle, which crosses in me, is already rested. I jumped on DVD. I was hypnotized. Through the night. "Doot de doot, de doo de dodedo." <br /> <br /> Blob. Look at this. Steve Queen, two cops and one girl in a dress. Two thumbs up!
