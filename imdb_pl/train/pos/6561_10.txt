Honestly, this is the best reality show that anyone has come up with. To win money, you must be SMART. Not only do you have to be bold, athletic, clever, etc. In fact, it requires skill. Not like some lamellas that are these days. And yet they have only two seasons! Bull .. they must restore this show !! <br /> <br /> Still, they will have difficulty pulling Anderson Cooper out of CNN. He was great. <br /> <br /> But seriously, it was an amazing performance. You never knew who will be when. It was great fun trying to discover the mole yourself! It was a spectacle that you could play alone if you wanted! <br /> <br /> RESTORE MOLE !!!! RESTORE MOLE !!!!
