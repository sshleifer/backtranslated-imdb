Let's eliminate all discussions about the use of non-Asian actors playing Asian roles. The film is 67 years old. In 1937, the Heads of Studies believed that every actor could / should be able to play any role. The actors had contracts and they did not always have a choice as to what role they played. End of the story. <br /> <br /> This is a really great epic tale of love, individual rights, class layers and problems of men / women. The main element of the film are two excellent performances by Luise Rainer and Paul Muni. <br /> <br /> Muni plays Wang, a Chinese farmer who is about to take his wife (Rainer). From the very beginning, he treats her with respect, at a time when women were seen as little more than the hired help. Without giving up too much film, they go through the ups and downs of all relationships, and although history can take place at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, history and many of their feelings seem credible. > <br /> Apart from the fact that the film lasts about 5-10 minutes longer than necessary, and the performances of Charley Grapewin and Walter Connolly are typical characters from the 1930s, it is really a great movie that unfortunately became victim of political correctness. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10
