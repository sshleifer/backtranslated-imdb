Muppets of Jim Henson were my favorite from childhood. This movie makes me feel like a child again. Okay, the Muppets are back with Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog and their friends. The assumption is that they try to get on Broadway in a musical show, somewhere other than in New York. You will see episodes of the then mayor of New York, Ed Koch. Anyway, this year the movie ends 25 years and I hope that today's kids will learn to appreciate the lightness of the Muppets Gang. The problem with the show was lost Kermit and the gang must find him in New York. It's worth watching for children and even sentimental adults like me.
