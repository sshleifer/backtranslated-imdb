Ossessione <br /> <br /> Luchino Visconti's debut film, this Italian noir is generally considered the initiator of the neorealist movement - well, he says that in the back of the box - and is sometimes a penetrating, sometimes painful portrait of lonely individuals in a moral flow. Located in fascist Italy, an assortment of supporting characters - including an innocent tramp who supports the communist virtues - embody the desperate desperation of a country seeking its identity from outside, drifting fantasies of longing for the soul. Although Visconti's compassion for civil rights deprived and his ability to express regrettable conditions was already well developed, the spider web of deception is frail - although the basis of the noir is the creation of a hero manipulated by fate and femme fatale, Gino is so hopeless here that you are afraid that he may deserve it - cosmic irony is too didactic, and the unlawful relationship has been straining. Nevertheless, it is determined and necessary, although its real influence on the history of the film is certainly controversial.
