He saw the film in August at the 27th Annual National Association of Black Journalists in Milwaukee, WI, this is the first public show. THE FILM IS GREAT !!! Derek Luke is wonderful as Antwone Fisher. This young actor has a very bright future. True Antwone Fisher did a great job writing the movie, and Denzel's direction is right. See the opening weekend. You will not be dissapointed.
