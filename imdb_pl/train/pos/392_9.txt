Zu's legend, as I saw it, was a very interesting story. I think that many people who did not like it did not see the hidden mythology of the film. They were expecting something similar to Star Wars and it was not like that. I think Joseph Campbell would like this movie. There were many metaphors and hidden meanings that the average viewer could have missed. We all have tops of swords in them. We all have to go to our own cave of blood in our lives. We all have to face our insomnia someday. It was admitted that some of the narrative was somewhat misleading, and some of the action was sometimes a bit hokey, but I think that other points of the film easily rewarded it. I would watch it again. <br /> <br /> I do not know if there is a difference between The Legend of Zu (which I saw in Mandarin with English subtitles) and Zu Warriors (dubbed US version). an audience that really would deplete this movie.
