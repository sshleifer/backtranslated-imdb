This film is best described or compared to "Big Fish" (Tim Burton's film). But this is less impressive and more history in you. And of course here is not the father, but his grandfather tells stories. <br /> <br /> The story of the movie moves back and forth (so the outline of the story in IMDb can tell you more than you would like to read before watching the movie). It's quite fun and addictive, even if you're going from one story to another and you've got some dramatic moments too. It also surprises you here and there with things you would not expect. Nice video that deserves attention, especially if you like such videos! : about)
