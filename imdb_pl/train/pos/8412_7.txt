Those who were involved in the camera so early in their life had to discover their potential early. This is a good story about the type of playboy who needs money and inadvertently sells his soul to Satan for a lot of money. Unfortunately, the soul is his doublet and must often confront him, tearing his life apart. There are some great scenes with people extinguishing and, of course, scenes when both are on stage at the same time. The middle part is a bit boring, but the story of Faust√≥w is always in the viewer's consciousness. One thing that I have to mention is the overall unattractiveness of people in the film. In addition, they very much departed from many activities that would at least give some life to the thing. I first learned about this movie about 25 years ago and finally I could see it. I was not disappointed.
