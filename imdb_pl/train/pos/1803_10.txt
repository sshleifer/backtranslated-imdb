My dog ​​has recently died, and this was a movie that I loved as a child, so I had to see it to try to cheer up. <br /> <br /> (Watch out for the dog, I mean Spoilers.) This movie is not just for kids and it's not ordinary. The film was set in New Orleans in 1939. First of all, the dog was not presented as an additional family member in this film, but as an adult with his own complicated life to deal with. <br /> <br /> At the beginning, Charlie is not too different from his dishonest and brutal business partner Carface. He is driven by money, greedy and simply escaped from the death cell, as he states at the beginning of this function. The difference between Charlie and Carface is that Charlie can learn and want to listen to others; Anne Marie and his helper, Itchy. Carface will not even listen to a fat, ugly dog ​​with big glasses that's closest to him. <br /> <br /> Carface tries to murder the hero, because he wants 100% of profits in his business and will not be satisfied only 50% - a very unusual way to kill a German Shepherd. Besides eating meals through a prehistoric alligator who saves you life because you can sing, it's highly unlikely whether you're a dog or not. This is a cartoon and that's why it's logical. <br /> <br /> Carface's revenge method involves murder, while Charlie believes that success is the best revenge, or financial success. After surviving the death, he starts a business, acquiring a source of funding for Carface, a very talented girl who can communicate with animals. They win a lot of races, and Charlie tells her that he will give money to the poor - a hint of tips: Charlie and Itchy live in a junkyard and are therefore poor. He uses money in the casino / bar / theater, not in the "poor". The reason why Anne Marie can talk to animals is that she has compassion and he listens carefully. He teaches Charlie's ethics, pointing to his gambling, lying and stealing. Charlie tries to make up for it by buying her dresses. She added the ethics that his business needed, while Charlie managed, and Itchy provided the construction. <br /> <br /> Carface uses violence and property damage to destroy Charlie's interest, which is not protected by the government. Charlie is losing everything and all he has left is this little girl. In the end, he had to choose between his life and his own. First he pulls out the watch from the protection, and puts it away when the girl begins to sink. Both the girl and the watch sank, and he had to choose which one he chose the girl. <br /> <br /> A great part of this movie that focuses on a person's ability to learn from evil in time and the child's ability to deal with the natural occurrence of an animal's death is such that he never shows anyone who is dying! The watch symbolizes his life and the watch is submerged and stopped. All deaths were suggestive, even for the villain. Until now, I have not cried in this movie and I have derived so much more from it that I had to save it and share it with you.
