The theater club of my school will be exhibiting this concert in the spring of 2002 and I can only hope that we will be so good! I recently watched the movie as "research" on my role (Rosie Alvarez) and I would like to say that Vanessa Williams is the coolest one! <br /> <br /> Wow! The cast of this movie was correct (with one exception). Jason Alexander, oh my fool, is there anything he can not do? He was the greatest Albert Peterson in history - I especially liked his funny facial expression and dance during "Put on a Happy Face!" He is so great! Vanessa Williams, as I said earlier, is the coolest. She was beautiful Rosie, and her passage from the secretary to the seducer was completely reliable. Tyne Daly was hilarious because the unbearable mother of Albert and George Wendt were wonderful as irritated Mr. McAfee (however, I LOVE Paul Lynde's performance in the 1963 version!). Brigitta Dau dismissed me like Ursula Merkle; she really inhibited it! And Marc Kudisch was an amazing Conrad Birdie ... "Suffer!" <br /> <br /> There was only one casting I did not understand and, as you will see from previous comments, many other people do not understand. Chynna Phillips as Kim McAfee - what was it? That means she's really pretty and very talented, but ... she looks a little too old for the role. Eh, maybe I'm a delusion. <br /> <br /> Okay, I'd highly recommend this movie anyway. He will leave you smiling! <br /> <br />
