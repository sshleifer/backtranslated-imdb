Daniel Day-Lewis is the most versatile actor in the world. English aristocratic snob in "The Room with a View", a passionate Irish thief in "In the Name of the Father", a brash butcher in the "Gangs of New York" (in a spectacle ten times stronger than Adrian Brody in Pianist) and as outrageous Cristy Brown with cerebral palsy My Left Foot (to name a few). His roles affect each other, but each of them is separate and completely unique. It changes completely, with every character he accepts. And I'm starting to believe that it can work like anything. Everything. <br /> <br /> As Cristy Brown is stunning. He does not ridicule the character and does not pity over the character. Difficult achievement. And Cristy Brown comes alive. A wise man. An outrageous man. Man. <br /> <br /> This film, despite minor errors related to the transition to the stage and the like, is an inspiration. Yes, it's predictable. But is it stupid sentimental? No. I laughed. I cried. Not a moment of cheese. Proof that this is not a Hollywood movie. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is the restaurant scene, when Cristy discusses the painters with Eileen, Peter and her friends. Here's where Daniel Day-Lewis reaches the climax. "I will kick you in the only part of your anatomy that is animated." "Throw away a cripple!" And his performance never slows down, never weakens and is beautiful. Just. He has a lot of time here on the screen. I watch him again and I never get tired of Crista's penetrating gaze, trembling and guttural speeches. <br /> <br /> Must see. Fo sho, yo!
