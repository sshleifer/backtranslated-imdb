Hi, I was an alanrickman. I am still crazy-holikiem. It was another movie that I watched partly on television. Then I had to get the video tape to finally find out how it ends. Then I wanted a DVD because the tape showed the first signs of decay after a few weeks. After the DVD I had to put my hands on the soundtrack. Then on several movie posters and the film script. At the moment it has become so bad that I try to make other people addicted to my website and Crazy Still events. <br /> <br /> How could this happen? What made me addicted? <br /> <br /> OK, this is one of those funny, but somehow sad and melancholy intelligent comedies that can only be produced by the British. <br /> <br /> All right, the movie is worlds except for things like "This Is Spinal Tap", because of characters that are not childish or super cool, but real. This is a story about people who are also aging. The story of people who get along. Or not. It contains the best actors. Tim Spall. Stephen Rea. Bruce Robinson. Jimmy Nail. And Bill Nighy. Bill Nighy, who performs one of the best performances I've ever seen in a movie. <br /> <br /> Well, the soundtrack is unbelievable. Foreigner Mick Jones wrote songs for an imaginary Strange Fruit band. Jimmy Nail, playing on bass Les Wickes and Bill Nighy, playing egocentric but awkward vocalist Ray Simms, really sings. We know about Jimmy Nail, but if you've only heard Bill Nighy singing in Love Actually, you have no idea how big and powerful his voice is. <br /> <br /> Well, you will have a fever for every scene that will come for the X time, especially those concert stages. You would die to really stand in the dancing crowd when Strange Fruit does "All Over The World", singing all over your throat. You want to cry and celebrate with thousands of people the rebirth of real Strange Fruit on the Wisbech festival scene. <br /> <br /> It's difficult, but ... I'm addicted to this movie. I'm addicted to Strange Fruit. If there is a world in which this band really exists, I would like to move there. <br /> <br /> I'm still crazy ... someone?
