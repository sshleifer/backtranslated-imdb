As we all know, the subgenre of sexual comedy is quite crowded. Just being too picky is not enough. I have seen and heard so many nasty jokes and actions that the sexual comedy really needs other positive points that I can enjoy nowadays. <br /> <br /> In the 40-year-old virgin I knew basically what to expect; In the end, I saw ads; "Is it true that if you do not use it, you will lose it?" I did not expect to find heart and honest attempts to develop the character. There are still strange "out of the wall" characters that we see so much in Adam Sandler's films and there is still enough inappropriate language to sink Noah's Ark, but somehow the movie has a valuable love story and yes, even a message. <br /> <br /> The main character of Andy is (unfortunately for me) the person I can relate to. In the first picture I see that he even shares my love for the Mystery Science Theater 3000 (he has a poster for the film on the wall) and throughout the film we can see his really neat collection of antiques. Andy also has plenty of video games and practical knowledge about movies and technologies. Andy does not want to buy a car because he prefers his bike. The most important of all; Andy is a nice man, he does not swear and he respects women so much that he stays away from them. Combine all these factors and everyone starts thinking that he is a serial killer. This is like my life story. <br /> <br /> Other characters have fun stories that go hand in hand with their slightly exaggerated personalities and all work at a certain level, but not like Andy. I felt it was a bit distracting because Andy and his girlfriend Trish are really the only truly human characters in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> I suppose that since I mentioned one defect, I might as well bring other visible to the light. History is clever, but too predictable and when it comes to romance; It's quite simple. He's been dealing with Andy's relationship with Trish for a long time and we all know what's going to happen. Sure, his last tour is a bit different than we can expect, but you know what will happen in the end, and I assure you that this is happening. These are definitely small spots on the film, but there are so many good things here that I can easily ignore a few mistakes. <br /> <br /> When I say "good", I mean "bad", of course. It's a sex comedy and wants to be angry. For the most part, I think that it worked. There are so many funny scenes like Andy trying to get rid of an erection after refusing to have sex with Trish. Or the scene where Andy goes with Trish's daughter to a sex education lesson, where he ends up asking more questions than anyone else. Ah, and we must not forget about the classic wax sequence of waxing "Ooh! Como se llama! "An interesting little note about this scene; actor Steve Carell actually waxed his stomach, and the pain shown is real. Of course, they only did one thing, but it was still very bold of him. <br /> <br /> Actually, since we're talking about Steve Carell, I'd like to say that he has now risen on my list of respected comedians, which is quite strange because I did not even know who he was before watching the movie. I was so impressed with his writing, acting and time that now I really want to keep an eye on his future roles. This man has the talent of the 40-year-old Virgin proves this. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I had doubts about this movie, but the early word was positive and I knew I would finally see it. I'm glad I did it because it's probably one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time and maybe something that's worth seeing. It's not just a series of sexy gags, but rather a series of sexy gags intertwined with a very valuable character and a truly touching romance. Now forgive me, and I forgive my guts; I can not believe I wrote this ... <br /> <br /> My review of Frider Waves: http://friderwaves.com/index.php?page=virgin
