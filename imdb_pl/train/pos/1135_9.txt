I saw it for the first time in the cinema, when it appeared, and the crowd was really in the movie, which made the experience even more fun. This is a great cast of characters, in which there are many big names, some of which were not as recognizable as now. I think it's a great idea if you follow any of these actors or you love them in other movies to add it to the list you are watching. Some scenes remind me of a kind of well-done comedy, like the Birdcage, and even The Clue, a kind of weird spontaneously appearing comedy, with some really professional delivery from these beloved actors. The film did a great job, giving you insight, perhaps even very realistic, in the culture of soap during the day.
