A great screenplay and one of the best actors the world has ever produced. Montand gives the police concept of a "lone wolf" as a whole new dimension of intensity and, most importantly, credibility. <br /> <br /> When a typical Hollywood policeman loses family, friends and pets to kill him, he was usually given a minute of regret. But when the sixty seconds are over, he collects himself, packs his weapon, and joyfully shoots enemies one by one. <br /> <br /> Marc Ferrot from Montand is really devastated - by the murder of his girlfriend, of course, but also by saying that he has another lover. In his confusion and anger he does not seek revenge, but he must still look for the true perpetrator of the crime, where his fingerprints are on the whole scene. In this way, all his actions become inevitable logically. This is the main reason why this film sticks us to our places, but definitely not the only one.
