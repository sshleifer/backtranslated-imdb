"The Lion King" is undoubtedly my favorite Disney movie of all time, so I came to the conclusion that maybe I should give another chance and I did it. Lion King 1 1/2 was quite good and had fun with Timon and Puma. The only problem I feel is that sometimes no explanations are needed because they can create holes in the storyline and just feel the desire to explain themselves. Well, I highly recommend this movie for King's fans or just a family night. It's a funny movie with the same laughs and nice characters as the first one. I hope that I will receive the same in the third part of the Lion King series. Sit back and think only Hakuna Matata! I mean, no worries! <br /> <br /> 8/10
