Let's shorten a long story. I loved every minute of it. A lavish fantasy in the true style of Arabian nights. There is a bad mage, a pretty princess, a genie and everyone lives happily ever after. Modern Hollywoond certainly has one or two things that you can learn from this classic. Just argue: the special effects are quite outdated (although he loved Sabu with a gin foot!)
