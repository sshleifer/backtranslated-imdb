Critical and financial flap after the first release, the critics turned around and said that this film is the best director. The film "La Ronde" resembles a movie, when the guys from the detective agency (Ben Gazzara, John Ritter and Blaine Novak) behave, fall in love with one of the most bizarre and beautiful women seen in the film (Audrey Hepburn), Colleen Camp, Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hansen). A large part of the scenario was written ad-libbed or re-written on the day of shooting, which gives the film airy character. Ben Gazzara is perfect as the main detective convincing Audrey Hepburn after dropping the singer Colleen Camp and seeing the taxi driver Patti Hansen on the sidelines. John Ritter is ineptly following Dorothy Stratten and falls in love with her instantly. Blaine Novak has several girlfriends that he chases (including Joyce Hyser and Elizabeth Pena). This movie has great performances in the supurb cast. Awards are Audrey Hepburn (no line in the first half of the movie). Ben Gazzara has never been better (and an inspiring choice for romantic running), and Colleen Camp has one of his best roles as Christy Miller, the manic country singer. She is delighted when she looks at how she fires her lines in rat-a-tat-tat. Highly recommended! ********* stars!
