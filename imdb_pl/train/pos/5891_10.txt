THE ITALIAN is an amazingly successful movie for its time. A stunning shot, with light effects that are really sublime, is an early jewel that clearly shows REGINALD BARKER as a pioneer on a par with D.W. GRIFFITH and MAURICE TOURNEUR. As many of Thomas Ince's inspections exposed over production, it is difficult to get to know, but this film still has extraordinary power. The simple story of an Italian immigrant struggling to keep his family alive in New York is very moving. The themes of social injustice, revenge and forgiveness are now completely valid. The use of close-ups is excellent, and the power of GEORGE BEBAN is electrifying. Now we need a really good print that has been transferred to a DVD so that we can really appreciate this early masterpiece of the cinema.
