Surrealist film noir released shortly after "real" classic definitions of the genre "The Maltese Falcon", "Double Indemnity" and "The Postman Always Rings Twice". Welles' films should not be evaluated for others. He played according to different rules. In fact, he played. It starts where other femme fatale films end, so a vaguely logical (but interesting) crime story is decorated with a show of Wellesian scenes (typical style of rapid fire), dialogue (many "hard" philosophies) and unusual acting (well Hayworth probably intentionally one-dimensional) . For Welles, "genre" could mean "formula", but he seemed to like to use "secrets" as a background for his "pastimes."
