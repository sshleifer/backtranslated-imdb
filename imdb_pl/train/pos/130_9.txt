In October 1945, the American descendent of Germany Leopold Kessler (Jean-Marc Barr) arrives in post-war Frankfurt, and his bitter uncle Kessler (Ernst-Hugo Järegård) gets him a job on the Zentropa railway line as the conductor of a sleeping car. Traveling by train, learning his profession, he sees destroyed occupied Germany and meets Katharina Hartmann (Barbara Sukowa), the daughter of a former powerful entrepreneur in the transport industry and the owner of Zentropy, Max Hartmann (Jørgen Reenberg). Leopold remains neutral between allied forces and Germany and realizes that there is a terrorist group called "Werewolves" killing allied sympathizers and leading subversive activities against allied forces. He falls in love with Katharin and sooner reveals that she was a "Werewolf". When Max commits suicide, Leopold is also pressured by "Werewolves" and must take a position and make a decision. <br /> <br /> "Europa" is an impressive and tormented story of Kafkan about the great Danish director Lars von Trierze. Using an expressionist style that resembles Fritz Lang and alternately gorgeous black and white cinematography with colorful details, this film reveals the difficult period of Germany and some of the problems that this great nation had to face after defeating the war. Very impressive action of occupying forces destroying resources that could allow for a faster reconstruction of the destroyed country, and corruption with a Jew who should identify Max. Jean-Marc Barr has an amazing performance in the role of a man who wants to remain neutral, but is manipulated everywhere by everyone. The hypnotic narration of Max Von Sydow is another accent of the class in the awarded film. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'Europe'
