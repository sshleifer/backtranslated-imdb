The Three Stooges has always been one of the many actors I loved. I love almost all the shorts they have created. I love all six Stoogs (Curly, Shemp, Moe, Larry, Joe and Curly Joe)! All shorts are fun and also play many other great actors and actresses, many of which were in many shorts! In my opinion, The Three Stooges is one of the greatest actors in history and is the funniest comedy band! <br /> <br /> This is a good Three Stooges short. It's fun and his cast includes Christine McIntyre, Symon Boniface, Gino Corrado, Fred Kelsey, Sam Flint, Chester Conklin, Theodore Lorch, Lynton Brent, Judy Malcolm, Vernon Dent, John Tyrrell, Heinie Conklin and Bess Flowers. The Stooges did very well in this short one! I recommend this one!
