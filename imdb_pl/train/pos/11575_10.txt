Saying this, I mean that it is not a well made movie, but it is a very good version of the real event and the best description so far. If you're a fan of World War II, this is a treat for you because there are three of the four members of the saboteurs playing roles in this film. At best, it is a theater acting, but it is still as it was said before half document. <br /> <br /> I personally am an avid fan of our almost human heroes of World War II, and there should be hundreds of these films showing us what they did to keep them from being forgotten by future generations. Because now children do not read books, watch movies. <br /> <br /> So if you want extravagance, rent a Private Ryan, this is the truth about the persistent pain, outrageous endurance and willingness to fight when everything seems lost.
