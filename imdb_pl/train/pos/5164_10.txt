I attended the Chesapeake camp. He was at the head of the Chesapeake Bay on the North East River in MD. It was a similar summer camp with houses. It was founded by Coatesville, PA YMCA. I started as a young camp, and later became a junior, senior adviser and later director of Waterfront. If the camp was still there, I would do everything in my power to become the director of the camp. Unfortunately, the YMCA powers decided to close the camp and sell it as MD. I visited the former camp a few years later by ship and I was worried about the neglect of the MD condition and the natural destruction of mother nature. The area of ​​350 acres served so many with all the advantages of contact with nature offers. A black man named Curtis Ford and his family were residents and guardians of the property. Mr. Curtis was my friend and mentor. I loved his every being. Although he could not swim, he was a waterman. If I asked him where the fish were biting, he would designate a place and I would have a ball. At the end of summer, he was also a family camp. These memories will be with me for eternity.
