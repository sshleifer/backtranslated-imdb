The story of a thief boy from Baghdad (as it was once written) attracted filmmakers from Raoul Walsh in 1924, who played Douglas Fairbanks in the first, dumb, "Thief of Baghdad", for less impressive, newer attempts. The best, however, is the version from the 1940s, which in its time was a surprising, magical set of special effects of the highest quality. These effects continue to affect their charm. <br /> <br /> No less than six directors are mentioned in the technical movie in which Sabu acted as a boy thief, Abu, John Justin as a deputy monarch deputy, Ahmad and June Duprez as a charming princess sought after by Ahmad and chased by evil Vizier, Jaffar, played by the malevolent Conrad Veidt. The giant genie is efficiently performed by Rex Ingram. <br /> <br /> Ahmad was treacherously depraved by Jaffar, and when he was later arrested by this treacherous serpent, he and boy, Abu, suffer what clearly affects the fate. Ahmad becomes blind and Abu becomes a charming mutt. Their Hollywood-style adventures are fun, but the special effects make the movie work. <br /> <br /> Two men were responsible for everything from the magical flying carpet to the giant genie who jumped out of the bottle with a black tornado-like whirlpool: Lawrence W. Butler and Tom Howard. (Incidentally, Howard did special effects for the 1961 version of the movie. Both men had a long and outstanding career in technical wizardry.) Duprez is exceptionally charming, while little is called to serious acting. Ahmad Justina designs a driven but dreamy romanticism untouched by erotic impulses. Sabu is really the main actor in many scenes and he is very good. In the case of a film intended for both children and adults, there is a lot of violence, but no blood. Still, I do not think anyone under the age of eight will see the "Baghdad thief". <br /> <br /> This movie makes periodic performances on television, but today my teenage son and I saw him in the theater with several young people present. It was great to see children in a prosperous community responding with applause and applause to special effects that seem primitive to them. <br /> <br /> "Bagdy Thief" is a pre-war Hollywood classic from the time when strong production values ​​often lead to lasting attractive and important releases. This is one of the best of its kind. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
