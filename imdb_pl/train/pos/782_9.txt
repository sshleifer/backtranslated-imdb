This is a very moving picture of about forty best friends in a small town in England. In a younger piano instructor, we find passionate love and a new beginning. When tragedy strikes and hearts change forever. Definitely a movie in which you can have a box of tissues! Powerful work. This is definitely one of my favorite movies of all time. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER !!! SPOILER ALERT !! SPOILER !! * <br /> <br /> The main character is her young, handsome piano instructor and a passionate romance flourishes. Her two jealous "friends" play an immature trick that quickly leads to a tragedy. He loses his love and friends in one foul. Finally, an unexpected surprise attracts them to you (in my opinion, her forgiveness is not justified)
