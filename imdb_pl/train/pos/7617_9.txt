A very addictive series. I've never seen an exact combination of drama, action, tension and science fiction before. I am impressed with each chapter. The script is very intelligent, I do not know how the creators come up with all these amazing stories, each character has a strange past, troubles, turbulent relationships, gives the show a human sense needed to create intimate characters. <br /> <br /> The most incredible thing is that all characters are interrelated: numbers that they've known before, without knowing about it, and so on. Another, an enigmatic security system and the Darma initiative are elements that do not allow us to lose a chapter. <br /> <br /> Mr. JJ Abrams, what do you think to create this amazing story?
