A Chinese scholar who criticizes the harsh arrogant nationalist, inflammatory politics of the ruling clique around the emperor in pre-war Japan, is accused of being a "communist" and a prison for life. His loving wife, who supports her husband and his ideas completely, stays alone to save her family from hunger. This film is a huge statue erected in honor of the role of mother in the history of mankind. Sayuri Yoshinaga is no less than lofty in the title role and the monumental scandal was that she did not receive an Asian Oscar for the best female role in 2009. She reached a young girl with very limited potential for acting. <br /> This deeply moving and most "human" feature is a must for all "real children" on earth.
