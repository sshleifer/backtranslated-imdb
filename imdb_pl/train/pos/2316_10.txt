I watched this movie by accident, I am curious about the trailer on TV. I like when I discover such films, small, sensitive stories about ordinary people. Even if the end is tragic, "The Man in the Moon" has some funny moments, especially with the first characterization of Dani, with her innocent and pure romance with Court. It's a really beautiful, moving love story with three important points: the performance of Reese Witherspoon, which upheld its promises in the world of cinema, beautiful photos of "Old Lion" by Freddie Francis and the fantastic result of James Newton Howard, is really the soul of the movie. His themes (deserving an Oscar nomination) are so intimate and lyrical that it seems that they have changed the script in music.
