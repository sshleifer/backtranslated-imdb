I love this movie ever since I first saw it in 1979. I'm still amazed at how exactly Kurt Russell introduces Elvis, to how he moves and what his faces are. Sometimes it's scary how it looks, works and talks like a real Elvis. Fortunately, it's released on DVD, so all of us who have been waiting can finally have an excellent version of the full-length movie. I have heard critics who say there are some inaccuracies or some omissions, but I think that remembering that John Carpenter had about 2 1/2 hours to work and that it was shown on television (only two years after Elvis's death!), that he did a great job with it. In fact, I have not seen another Elvis movie that would be close to that. Highly recommended.
