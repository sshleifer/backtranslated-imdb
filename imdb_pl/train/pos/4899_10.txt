I am glad that I saw this movie in the store. I was looking for happy movies, and this one turned out to be a real gem. I loved the fact that the movie, this kind of love story, did not concern the beautiful twenties; it is rather a story of beautiful sixty-year-olds who used to be twenty-year-olds. It is a good, well written and wonderfully played tale, in which also fantastic music from the time of World War II is woven. It is also a great surprise for lovers of the Scottish castle. It made me smile and was ready to watch him again, which I did a few more times before I turned it on.
