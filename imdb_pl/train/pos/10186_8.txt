Okay, I know it does not design India in a good light. But the main theme of the film is not India, it is Shakti. The power of the ruler and the power of the mother. The relationship between Nandini and her husband and son absorbs you warmly. Then everything goes wrong. The interaction between Nandini and her father-in-law - the power of their dysfunctional relationship - and the life that has changed are the strengths of this film. Shah Rukh Khan's performance seems to be a simple episode compared to the credible desperation of Karisma Kapoor. It is easy to get caught up in love, violence and redemption of life in this film and find yourself on the point of a sigh of relief and sadness. Musical interludes are strengths, reliable and well made.
