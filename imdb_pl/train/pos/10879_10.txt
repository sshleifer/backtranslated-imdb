Ever since I heard about it, I wanted to see the cut that took place last year. In any case, I have to see today, and when the movie started, I thought it started a week, but after 10 minutes it was better. I thought the movie was quite good. but what I did not like was the killer, I was thinking just before hiring that she would probably suck just like the city legends: the final cut, I almost died. usually everything in the final UL cut required improvement. CUT is 100 times better than UL: final cut. The best part of CUT are the scenes of the killer and death. The killer copies MO F *** ING ASS. <br /> <br /> I give 8 out of 10 points
