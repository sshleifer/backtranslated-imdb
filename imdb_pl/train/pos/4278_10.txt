This is a movie that I've seen more times than any other (I think I saw it on average once a year, since it was released). And every time I see it, it's just as fantastic and it always reveals something new to me. The cast was most likely a combination of Yu's best films in the history of cinema. This film is an absolute must for any self-respecting movie lover. In the same league: Maratonci trce pocasni krug, Balkan spijun and Otac na sluzbenom putu. This is the poker videos that everyone should have in their private video collection.
