If you read "Mother Night" and liked it so much (like me), you just have to see the movie, understand that you have to understand the basic element of writing Vonnguta - that apart from his story lies Vonnegut and that I can not put the human mind on the screen . His humor can not simply be rewritten by the script, nor even the best actor's performance. I believe that this movie exceeds the key questions that Vonnegut puts in his book, but these frequent cynical satire moments found on the site are not on the screen. Does this mean that the film does not hit the mark? Of course not. In my opinion, the film succeeds because it does not try to recreate the experience of reading a book (it is not a medium for people too lazy to turn the page). It works because it takes the fundamental elements of history created by one of America's true artistic treasures and presents it without pretense. I saw other film versions of Vonnegut's books, in which the director apparently tries to convey Vonnegut's genius and loses control over his own craft. I would not put this movie as one of the best I've seen, but it stands on its own feet, as it is worth seeing. By taking Vonnegut's "voice" from the film's narrative or trying to put it in as much as possible, Mother Night perfectly tells her story and retains her basic history lessons without fuss, distraction or disappointment.
