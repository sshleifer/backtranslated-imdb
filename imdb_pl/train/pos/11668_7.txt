In 1945, after a series of solid propaganda pieces from World War II, Errola Flynn's control of the American coffers began to fall, so despite the increased weight of the waning look, he began a series of films about the genre that he had previously invented his name: swashbuckler. The first of them was good - ADVENTURES OF DON JUAN (1948) - but it also turned out to be his last big budget Hollywood vehicle. He spent the remaining days in which he wielded the sword, wandering all over Europe: in England for KIM (1950), THE MASTER OF BALLANTRAE (1953) and THE DARK AVENGER (1955), in France for ADVENTURES OF CAPTAIN FABIAN (1951) and Italy for interrupted THE TALE OF WILLIAM TELL (1953) and CROSSED SWORDS (1954) not seen much. However, Hollywood condemned him for the last time in his old ways of sailing - although rather on a modest budget Universal, and not on the production of Warner Brothers "A", which he was used to when on top ... <br /> <br /> Still glorious Cinematography Technicolor jumps off the screen and while the older and more flabby Flynn may look like the pale shadow of his former self, his redheaded lady leading Maureen O'Hara has a field day as a pirate leader who desires deep affection and wants to be treated like a lady. Anthony Quinn was still a few years away from his larger vehicles, so here he is typically seen as bad - pirate captain Roc Brasiliano, a role he attacks with gusto. Like THE BLACK SHIELD OF FALWORTH (1954) - which preceded this review - AGAINST ALL FLAGOM brings me back to my beloved childhood days of continuous television watching, when classic Hollywood movies were on the agenda both in local and neighboring Italian channels. <br /> <br /> From what I know, this could have been the first pirate movie I've ever seen, and complains about today's generation of young people who supposedly believe that the blatantly exaggerated PIRATES The CARIBBEAN Trilogy is what piracy is about ! As I said before, ANY ALL FLAGOM may not be the best pirate yarn ever brought to the screen, but it's a solid example of this fertile genre. Nowadays, the love perseverance of a child Indian princess (Alice Kelley) against her pirate abductor Flynn may seem terribly stupid, but the rest - despite the apparent lack of scaling of PERSONAL SEA (1940) and BLACK SWAN (1942) to mention the best sailing activities of her stars - is energetic and reasonably involving. Incidentally, the movie was later reworked as THE KING'S PIRATE (1967) with Doug McClure! <br /> <br /> To what extent it is worth it, the unprecedented cash success of this unappetizing modern series is probably what prompted reluctant film studios to vacuum the titles of swashbuckling catalogs and release them on DVD, actually actually, AGAINST ALL FLAGOM, was the only a jewel in the ill-conceived "Pirates of the Golden Age Movie Collection" set from Universal, which also included obscure slags such as BUCCANEER'S GIRL (1950; with Yvonne De Carlo), DOULE CROSSBONES (1951; with Donald O'Connor) and YANKEE BUCCANEER (1952; with Jeff Chandler)! Value for money, maybe, but so far I have only acquired Errol Flynn's traffic from other sources; nevertheless, if the mood hits me in the future, I would like to put my hands on similar sea adventures, such as Edward Dmytyk's MUTINY (1952), the already mentioned YANKEE BUCCANEER and PIRATES OF TORTUGA (1961).
