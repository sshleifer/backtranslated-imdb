"Intruz (L'Intrus)" is a visual pilgrimage through a mysterious life. <br /> <br /> Grizzled Michel Subor plays "Louisa Trebora" like Jason Bourne as an old man with a hidden past, living simply in an isolated hut in the forest with legitimate paranoia (but attracting pretty young women who might be useful for him). We learn more about it through dreams, retrospectives and journeys that can evolve chronologically or not, as well as through its brutal interactions with family, lovers, collaborators and striking nemesis. Similarly to the case of "Lime", the film resonates with the regret of parents / children and a suspicious past revealed through clips from an old movie with the same actor as a young man (here Paul Gégauff's adventure film "Le Reflux" from 1965). <br /> <br /> In full contrast, we meet his son Sidney (Grégoire Colin), who must be the sexiest domestic husband in the world, because he sweetly and seductively repairs the house and takes care of the child, toddler and everyone needs his working wife. Certainly the director / co-author Claire Denis had to create it as a feminine fantasy if there ever was one lesson for other filmmakers during the making of the foreplay. There is an additional extended scene in which he searches for his father in the forest while he carefully carries his angelic child in a purse. He is everything that his father does not have, and he has every relationship that his father can not sustain; no wonder his father is a "madman". I spent the rest of the movie in fear that something bad would happen to him, because the true nature of the heart of his alienated father was gradually played out before our eyes. <br /> <br /> The movie is a mystery, but Subor is absolutely fascinating when we watch him cross countries and negotiate wicked offers, and the narrative of the reader for Beau Denis' Beau Travail was annoying anyway. We must learn from the horizon and random signs that travel to Geneva, Korea and the South Pacific. Time passes is indicated by the changing seasons and scars arising and healing. There are many images of water for purification and distance. <br /> <br /> Continuing his fascination with the transformation of colonialism into globalization, and also playing a bit on the stereotypes of the Mysterious Orient and Russian criminals, Denis incorporated elements of Robert Louis Stevenson, Paul Gauguin and Marlon Brando Tahiti idyll and 40-page memories of the French philosopher Jean-Paul Lucy Nancy, the last of the title and plot of the heart transplant used for the ironic subject of limited immortality, which has consequences. <br /> <br /> While "Louis" thinks he has managed to cross borders, rules and customs, in the last act there is a bit of amusement, because the locals do not really know what to do with him and try to help him solve his quixotic odyssey even when it is in isolation again. <br /> <br /> Several people in the audience came out of frustration at the elliptical, but strikingly beautiful method of telling stories. An unconventional narrative raises many plot questions about details.
