When a stiff pneumonic plague (variety of bubonic plague) appears, a US health official, Dr. Clinton Reed (Richard Widmark) immediately quarantines everyone he knows is close to the body. Unfortunately, the stiff got this way by murder and there is a good chance that the killer will spread the plague, leading to an epidemic. Enters the police captain Tom Warren (Paul Douglas), who is taken to track down the murderer as quickly as possible and prevent a possible national catastrophe. <br /> <br /> Although Panika on the streets is a high quality film, he suffers from a bit out of focus and a bit too broad (my reason to lower the score to eight). He follows genres from a noirish gangster to a medical catastrophe, police procedures, thrillers, and even romances. <br /> <br /> This is not the best work of director Elii Kazan, but this is a bit disingenuous. In the end, Kazan is responsible for such masterpieces as A Streetcar Named Desire (1951), On The Waterfront (1954) and East of Eden (1955). This film precedes this film, but Kazan said he was "unconnected" by the studio. Too much of this freedom may partly contribute to the growth. The action takes place in New Orleans, the city where Kazan "wandered after ... night and day, so I knew him well." He wanted to use the environment. "It's so gorgeous and colorful. I wanted boats, steam engines, magazines, jazz ponds - all of New Orleans. " <br /> <br /> Kazan deals well with any type of panic on the streets, but you can combine them better. The film would gain thanks to maintaining one or two moods. Stretching in terms of the setting would still work. Part of the dilemma may have been caused by the fact that Panic on the streets was an attempt to combine two stories of writers Edna and Edward Anhalt, "Quarantine" and "Some Like" Em Cold ". <br /> <br /> The gangster material that ends strongly on the territory of the thriller with the extended chase scene at the end of the movie is probably the main attraction. No wonder Kazan said he believes that the villains are "more colorful" - and I've never had much love for good guys. I do not like Puritans. " The second is the only material that approaches the "panic" of the title - the discovery of plague and attempts to track exposed people, instill them and stop the disease. While in these two "moods" there is a lot of uncertainty, most of the film is also quite a simple drama, and the tempo is more typical for this genre. <br /> <br /> The whole dialogue is perfect. The stylistic difference in relation to many contemporary films can not be more pronounced. He is intelligent, delivered quickly and well spoken by each character. Conflict is not created by "stupid" decisions, but intelligent movements; the events and actions of the characters are more like a chess game. When unusual attitudes are taken, such as Reed stopping the scourge of newspapers, he gives relatively long justifications for his decisions that other characters are arguing over. <br /> <br /> In light of this, it is interesting that Kazan believed that "decency, religion, ethics and the middle class all murder us." This idea enters the film through changes in the norm or additions from it made by the characters. For example, the main gangster Blackie (Jack Palance in his first role in the movie) is offered the card "Get out of jail for free" if he will cooperate with combating the plague. <br /> <br /> Technical aspects of the film are fine, if not exceptional, but the real reasons for watching are performances, an intriguing scenario and a well-written dialogue.
