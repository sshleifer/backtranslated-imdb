I grew up in Brazil and visited the beautiful coast where it was filmed. This area is called "Parati" and is part of the "Green Coast" of the State of Rio de Janeiro. It is about 150 miles from the city of Rio de Janeiro. <br /> <br /> This film brings to life the world of the sixteenth-century Brazil, where Europeans barely began to discover the coast, which was still in virgin condition and rarely populated by various native tribes. The French and Portuguese fought with each other for territory and an advantage in wood trade in Brazil, constantly negotiating with the natives, who also fought with each other for whatever reasons. <br /> <br /> One unmatched French ("a mercenary") is left to die by his own countrymen, but manages to escape and is imprisoned by a completely naked native tribe. While he is the "slave" of the chief, according to the tribe's customs, he can live in relative comfort for months until there is an appropriate time to be killed and eaten in the ritual of revenge. > <br /> What I love about this film is that it reproduces details of the villages of the natives and their lifestyle (they walked naked and they were cannibals) and asks us to recognize and accept life in those times, it was like this: In the beautiful garden of Eden, life was filthy, violent, full of pathetic superstitions and bizarre customs. Europeans come and bring their own problems, including more violence through better weapons and greed. There are no romantic "noble savages" or "heroic explorers", only people try to survive in a difficult world. <br /> <br /> The film is neither overly sympathetic nor disregarded by the natives. From what I know on this subject, the picture is quite accurate, which adds to the air of uniqueness to the project: how many films have you seen about the life of Brazilian natives and their early romances with Europeans?
