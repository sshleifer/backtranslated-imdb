A rather unpleasant business with Bela Lugosi as a mad scientist (with an assistant similar to Renfield and his mother, a dwarf and yes, the wife of a scientist (sounds like a Greenaway movie really lol). Lugosi gives his wife dead injections of brides (why? Who knows ?) for his wife to look beautiful.He gets brides after doing a clever trick with some orchids that make the brides collapse at the altar, just HAPPY that he's around to get a shovel, and decides to come up with a story He gets all the clues about the orchids and Lugosi, Heaven knows where the police were. Soon he goes to Bel's bedside, when he meets a strange-looking doctor who may or may not be an eeeevil, everything accumulates in a completely stretched plan to get a false wedding to catch a mad scientist, but it seems that the scientist has an x-ray vision like a udare her plans, Oh no, what's going to happen? This movie is a bit of guilt. Lugosi is great, his hangers are very strange, in some places the story is quite nasty, which makes everything look the most. A fun little view.
