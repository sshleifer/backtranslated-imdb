There is a story (perhaps apocryphal) of an exchange between Bruce Willis and Terry Gilliam at the beginning of the Twelve Apes. Gilliam (purportedly) made a long list (think about a plane from the fifth element) and handed it over to Butch Bruce. He was entitled "Things that Bruce Willis does when it works." It ended with a simple message saying "please, do not do any of the above in my film". <br /> <br /> There is a fact about this film (definitely true). Gilliam had nothing to do with writing. <br /> <br /> I argue that these two factors have played a huge role in creating an extraordinary (if not commercial) success of The Twelve Monkeys. <br /> <br /> Visually, Twelve Monkeys are everything we rightly expect from Gilliam's movie. It is also full of Gilliamesque surrealism and general (but wonderful) strangeness. Gilliam is delighted with the bad public opinion. Although the ending of the Twelve Monkeys will not surprise anyone who has sat in the first real, Gilliam borrows heavily from Kafka's clockwork, the bureaucratic constant movement of characters towards their fate. This is the journey and the change of character that passes, which is worrying. <br /> <br /> I love Gilliam's movies (especially Brazil). But everyone suffers from the same weakness. It seems that he has so many ideas and so much enthusiasm that his films almost always end up in a tangled mess (especially in Brazil). I still maintain that Brazil is Gilliam's concert tour, but you can not deny that The Twelve Monkey's is a breath of fresh air in the department of tight plans. Style, substance and form seem to combine in a way that is usually not visible in the former Python. <br/> <br /> Regardless of the truth of the above gossip, Gilliam also manages to get the first (and unusual) results from the bald one. Bruce is great in this movie, as does the cast, especially appropriately disgusted - and very scary - Brad Pitt. <br /> <br /> More than ten years have passed since the movie's release. When I looked at it again, I realized that it did not really age. Of course I changed. It made me look at the film with fresh eyes. It seems to me that this is an adequate tribute to the film, which at least partly concerns reflections in the mirrors, changed perspectives and the absurd one-way journey in time that we all create. The first movie. 8/10.
