It is difficult to describe the Bug with words, it is one of those movies that you really need to see to understand them. He follows a narrative that is more fluid and interesting than anything I've seen in the Hollywood release lately. When his characters react to the chain of events in various ways, and events dictate different paths for the characters, the audience is only an observer. The almost proustish narration of thought, spontaneity of the script will make you stick to the screen, waiting impatiently, how it all ends. And when it comes to thematic elements ... in the film there is a special sequence that goes from melancholy to brightness and beauty, and then to tragedy, in about a minute. And it works. <br /> <br /> This movie is pure magic. It reminds me why an independent film is probably the brightest star the film industry currently has. Perhaps with more videos about Bug quality, people will start to pay attention to this.
