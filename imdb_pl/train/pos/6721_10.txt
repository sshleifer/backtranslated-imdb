If we could deduce the heart and soul of sport - no, pure lifestyle - surfing to its perfect form, this document did it. This document shows that life is not only waves, but above all, people, pioneers and modern avant-garde, which shifts the wave of the great wave further than ever before. <br /> <br /> Stacy Peralta - a virtual legend from my early 80s as a skateboard as a teenager SoCal - assembled a ream of amazing material and interviewed the film material to the essence and created something that is not just a document but a masterpiece species. When his heart and soul are in the subject - and this is obvious - his genius abounds in a pure vision that does not delight, does not skimmer or sentiment his subject. Worship surfers and lifestyle in the surf / beach, but also do not bleach them. There is also a difficult reality in sport. <br /> <br /> There are so many things that can be said about this film, about surfers, early sport history and wild wave fans who profile. Greg Noll, the first personality of the great wave that probably started this sport; Jeff Carter, an amazing guy who practically rode alone for 15 years in the extremely dangerous great surf Maverick in Northern California; and, the central element of the documentary, Laird Hamliton, a modern messiah of surfing on big waves. <br /> <br /> A huge heart and warmth are among all these guys - and a few girls who appear in the camera - and a deep and powerful love for surfing and the ocean that appears in every word. I found a story about how a Hamilton adopted father met him and how Hamilton, a small 4- or 5-year-old boy, practically forced him to become his father, especially cordial (and again devoid of syrupy sentimentality). <br /> <br /> If you like to surf - or even not - it's a great documentary that you have to watch, if only because you're a form student or someone who just appreciates incredibly well-made art.
