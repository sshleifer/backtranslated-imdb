Comedy Jewel. Lots of loud laughs, scenes from the store and pub made me laugh in an uncontrollable way. Characters are recognizable and dialogue is well watched - I know people like that! Humor is surprisingly gentle, and the movie (it may sound strange) brings to mind the comedy Ealing. It's a bizarre little movie with lots of details. This certainly requires many observations. I watched it several times (I showed all my friends!) And every time I notice something new - a bit of dialogue, something visual that I did not notice before. I could be really picky and find some shortcomings in the movie, but I'm not going to do it because it's great fun in general, a good movie that's really worth watching and everyone with a sense of humor has to enjoy. It's a movie that will find friends and I hope there are a lot of them. Oh .... and it has a great soundtrack.
