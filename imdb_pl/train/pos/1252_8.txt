The endless borders of our inhumanity to our kind never fail me. This truly amazing story of a terrifying and largely unprecedented population is convincing, well documented and furious. As an American I am constantly humiliated by the behavior of my country and this is just another in our long catalog of international humiliation. Ssimy. This is probably the first John Pilger documentary I've seen, but I immediately wanted to see what else he did. My only complaint and the reason I released this movie only 8 out of 10 is that Pilger shows us this parody and frightening cooperation between US and UK governments, demanding that we, viewers / citizens, be complicit in our inaction ... but it does not suggest how to help. I do not know about Great Britain, but America has almost prevented citizens from participating in government activities. A gesture in the right direction can help the cause of the islanders.
