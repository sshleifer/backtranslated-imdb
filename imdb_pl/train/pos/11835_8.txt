Although I wanted to watch this movie because I saw the trailer for the first time, I was very surprised by this film. While some elements and actions of the heroes seemed a bit too cartoonish, "the dark nature of the film really makes it a completely different experience. Instead of a story about well-being, this movie takes you in a different direction that is uplifting, but also disturbing. Most children will not understand some of the darker moments in the movie, which makes the film rather watchful for adults. I was also impressed by cinematography, animation and digital animation to create a smooth network of pans and tilts. The musical score was once again solid, which proves that Hans Zimmer is a great guy when it comes to animated scores, and I never thought I would say that I really like the music of Brian Adams.
