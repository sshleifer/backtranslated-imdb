Stylishly filmed, picturesquely photographed and brilliantly played? Crosby's interpretation seems quite right, Hardwicke has his best role in history, while Bendix is ​​also a feast? this Yankee appeal is universal and irresistible. <br /> <br /> Of course, songs are one of the main joys of the movie. As you might expect, Bing has a beautiful voice. And while Hardwicke's solo has been cut out, we can still hear him singing heartily when he dances with Crosby and Bendix cheerfully in their famous "Busy Doing Nothing" novelty. It is also a feast for Rhonda Fleming, who, although enjoying a wide stage and concert career as a singer, rarely had the chance to hear her at the cinema. She has a beautiful voice that more than suits her thrilling appearance, and she looks very appealing in Mary Kay Dodson costumes. <br /> <br /> Director Tay Garnett draws the most from his generous budget, using all the resources at his command to present each wonderful scene as efficiently as possible. (Perhaps the eclipse seems a bit too fancy, but who is complaining?) <br /> <br /> In short, as described by the trailer, the joy of entertainment from the beginning to the end.
