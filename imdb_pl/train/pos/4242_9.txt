I read the book and saw the movie. Both perfect. Film is a diamond among coals in this period. Liebman and Selby dominate the screen and transmit the intensity of their flawless characters. This movie should make them stars. Shame in the studio that he did not put everything that was behind this film. It could easily be a franchise. Release on DVD is a must and a worthy remake will enliven this movie. Look for it in the TV guide and if you see it on the list, no matter how late, watch it. You will not be dissapointed. Do yourself another favor - read the book (same title). It will blow you away. Times have changed dramatically since those days, or at least we like to think so.
