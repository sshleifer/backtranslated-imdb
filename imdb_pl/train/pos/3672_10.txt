A trial documentary about a pair of Canadian producers, Bobby Myers (Matthew Modine) and Paul Linder (Saul Rubinek), trying to make their first movie in the late seventies. Hollywood North is a comic tale about their fight for everything, despite many conflicting threads. <br /> <br /> Hollywood North acts as a movie in a way very similar to why This Is Spinal Tap (1984) works so well. Namely, although in some respects exaggerated, it is very close to the truth, and the truth consists of "behind the scenes" facts, which are very different from the public face of the industry. Making a movie is not easy and it must have been particularly difficult in Canada in the late seventies. Dozens, if not hundreds, take part in the films. Many have incompatible desires, motivations and personalities. The financiers and screen talent are especially important, as if either busted out or become independent at any stage, when the film is in production, it may endanger the whole scandal, either requiring extensive changes, or completely abandoning the film. > <br /> It's no wonder that Hollywood North is focused on this kind of relationship. The result is an excellent movie that is both funny and tragic. The screenplay is impeccable and the performances are at the highest level. This is a must for any aspiring filmmaker and anyone seriously interested in film crafts. It should also be more than entertainment for every viewer with a bit of intelligence and sense of humor. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 from me.
