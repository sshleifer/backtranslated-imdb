This independent B & W function, DV consistently shakes, surprises and entertains thanks to its ability to create the craziest situations, and then find humor and interest in them. It's all fun and absurd, but it's as absurd as most of the movie should be, it's the heart and reality that keeps the film on the ground, keeps the whole song from complete madness and that's where the real message lies. This film is about how we all survive in a crazy world. It seems to be the heart of the movie. For such a crazy and useless, as it happens, Leon, 30 years old. the old newsboy-hero always tries to keep it together. It is like a child who is always trying to catch a balloon that flows away so that everything goes as well as possible so that everyone can have what they want. <br /> <br /> Acting in the film could go far up, but the unique cast really keeps the piece coherent. Van Meter is probably the best of this group, with a show that shines through her absurd sick tics. Like the characters in the movie, we do not pay attention to her sudden bursts to see the real person underneath. <br /> <br /> Majkowski is a real genius here. He takes the highest absurd twists and holds them real. It's his script and his cast help keep the whole thing on the surface. This is a true testimony of Majkowski's skills and everyone involved in the fact that this film, with its grotesque story and characters, never gets on its nerves. Majkowski made a film that could be revolting and repulsive, and somehow gave him heart and humor. This is a unique movie. It can not be bypassed. <br /> <br />
