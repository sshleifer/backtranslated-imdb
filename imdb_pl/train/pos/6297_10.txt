My friends and I have just discussed how frustrated we are about the way films are made, especially romantic comedies. We feel offended by the jerk that Hollywood handles these days, because they behave as if everything was fine. <br /> <br /> Well, everything is not good ... except for a few bright spots like this movie. There are no big actors, a big budget, I do not think he has a big release (I rented from Hollywood Video), there really is nothing that most of the budget romantic comedy would have. <br /> <br /> But she missed the majority. She had great chemistry between love interests, "Parker" (Jonathan Schaech) and "Sam" (Alison Eastwood). Their love story was not forced on us, like many. The director was in no hurry to allow these heroes to get to know each other. Their story reminded me of one of my favorites, "Tootsie." <br /> <br /> The cast added not only really funny comic moments, but also the depth of history. The character of James LeGros was absolutely priceless. Sam's homosexual friend was hysterical. Parker's interaction with his colleagues on the hot psychic line was great fun. <br /> <br /> I was laughing, I was crying, I remembered how wonderful it is to fall in love.
