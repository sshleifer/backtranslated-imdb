If you are investigating facts about UFOs, then this film is very important. The "meat" of the film is Buzz Aldrin's comments. He is without a doubt the best in America. Trained to be objective, honest and factual in their reports. Many American astronauts of all ages have reported some kind of contact or UFO sightings and there are films from some of these missions. At least something happened that requires further objective investigation. I think that Buzz Aldrin's testimony shows that it is possible that other worlds will be interested in our progress. Like all alleged documentaries, this one can be tilted, but contains further information and opinions of the great American hero. These do not come every day. So the fact that some people are not interested in the details should not discourage you from watching this movie. If nothing else, it is interesting and I recommend you watch with an open mind.
