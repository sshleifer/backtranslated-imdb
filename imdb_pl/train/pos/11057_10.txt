I was 10 years old when this program was on TV. It definitely was my favorite. The actors were very credible. Alexandra Bastedo was just great ... I just order a DVD (15 episodes). They did not have superpowers. They simply had better human skills (strength, hearing, vision). The three actors were very good in their roles, very credible. There was a good story in each episode. At that time there were no special effects or explosions anywhere, so the script was supposed to be good and the characters were great. There were no fancy things like in other programs. They did not try to joke every 2 minutes to make a light show. I highly recommend this TV program to anyone who likes good things.
