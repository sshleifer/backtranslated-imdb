While the titles of the films contain the word "Mother", the first thing that comes to mind is the mother's love for her children. <br /> <br /> However, Mother tells a different story. <br /> <br /> The mother does not talk about the love between her mother and her child or about how she sacrifices herself for the sake of her child. Here the director of Notting Hill Roger Michell tells us how mother's love for a man about the age of half her age hurts people around her. <br /> <br /> Before Daniel Craig plays James Bond, here's Darren, a man who helps to renovate his mother's son's home and sleep with her daughter. Anne Reid, who was a well-known face in the TV series, takes on the difficult role of the main character, May. <br /> <br /> The story begins in May, in the face of the sudden loss of her husband, Toots, a family visit with her son Bobby. While he befriends Darren, a DIY enthusiast who renovates Bobby's house, she was shocked to learn that her daughter, Paula, was sleeping with Darren. At the same time, May struggled with life after Toots's death. Fearing that Harry and Paula do not want her, May begins to discover that her life is going on until she spends the afternoon with Darren. <br /> <br /> Darren was nice and friendly in May and could soon find some feeling for Darren. Instead of treating him like a friend, she treated a man who was about half the younger, from love to couple. Later May found sexual pleasure with Darren, where he gave her the pleasure she could never find on anyone else. And this is the beginning of a catastrophe that can lead to the breakup of the family. <br /> <br /> The mother examines the inner world of a widow who wanted to try something that she never had in her life, and a consolation for someone who is there for her to get closer to her. You can say that since May, buying afternoon tea for Darren, to satisfy the sexual needs of a man younger than her, where he finally gave her more than she expected. <br /> <br /> Anne Reid made the breakthrough role of Maya, because earlier she was best known for her role in television series. Because there are not many films in her life story, Mother drew her attention from the critics. On the other hand, Daniel Craig played a similar role in his film career as Sylvia (2003) and Enduring Love (2004). If his returning role of James Bond fails, film reviewers should not forget that he has a better performance in small productions during his film career, and the Mother is one of them. <br /> <br /> Mother may not be the favorite of everyone, but it is certainly not an ordinary matin√©e program, which accompanies tea and scones accompanied by butter and jam.
