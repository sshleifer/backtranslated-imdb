We must remember that the 1950s were practically empty cards when it comes to films. Hollywood went from patriotic war movies, noirs, two rolls, etc. to movies with news. We had Blackboard Jungle, On the Waterfront and so on. Some people may think that this is improvement. I do not. Who was the tycoon who said: If you want to send a message, call Western Union? He was right. These psychological thrillers are less entertaining than some remote therapy. <br /> <br /> This one is pip. It's about three sisters trying to take control of the property of their deceased father. One of them, perhaps the only one worth the redemption, requires the help of a company pilot to help her keep the rest of the family. Initially, he is in it for money, but eventually falls into it. Meanwhile, the rest of the family plans to sabotage the affair. The results are predictable. In this movie you have a bit of everything. Sexual tension between the sisters. A bit subtle masochism. Hereditary madness - if there is such a thing. We never meet with parents, but they really must have been screwed up. The cast is virtually unknown. One or two actors sound familiar. Acting is so bad that it's hard to believe. It was released under the umbrella of United Artists by Bel-Air Productions. It was filmed near LA mostly at night and probably without permission. The end was so strange that I thought it was a joke. It looked as if they ran out of money, and the producer decided to pack them in the middle of the stage. <br /> <br /> I can not explain it - even for myself - but I gave this stack a basket of 8/10. I'm familiar with the term "It's so bad that it's good," but I do not think I ever came across this phenomenon. Well, maybe "Hot Rods to Hell", but this one certainly fits. You can try this if you love movies that seem to be made in someone's basement.
