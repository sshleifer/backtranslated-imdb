I liked the movie as a child when it came out, and it still is. A simple story covering the search of a kidnapped girl and an adventurer literally straight from the knowledge in the paperback. It has actors who were more recognizable in those days. This should not stop the viewer from giving him a whirl. Wayne Crawford appears as the main character of Jake Speed. Of course, he can take some elements off Romancing the Stone and Indiana Jones. But this movie is done well enough to keep it away from the basement. I'm surprised that too many people do not know about it. It had to be dimmed by other movies in cinemas in '86. I watched it then on cable TV. It can be difficult to find because there is no imprint on VHS and DVD. I managed to get a DVD from eBay for less than 8 bucks! Cool moves.
