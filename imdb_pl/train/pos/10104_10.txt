The performance of Om Puri, Smity Patil and Sadashiv Amrapurkar and all of the chemistry are well arranged, along with a minimalist approach to storytelling and directed by Govind Nihlani. Vijay Tendulkar's dialogues are also great. <br /> <br /> I have not seen another movie like that. It's one whole, each piece suits the story so nicely. You can not be impressed by this movie. <br /> <br /> Amrish Puri descends as an overbearing husband and "baap" Om Puri. Om Puri is a young man caught between a sense of duty and an inability to fight the system. Sadhashiv as Rama Shetty gives almost the right accent to the film with its smiling and soft black character. The first meeting of Anand Velankara with Rama Szetta in Sadhashiv is amazingly stunning. Smita Patil does not play the main role, but her role does not divert attention from the main story. <br /> <br /> To all this, Kafi Inamdar plays the role of a policeman who reconciled with the system and its operation. Speaking the right things in the right places and knowing how to stay out of trouble. He is also Om Puri's "guru" and helps him when he gets in trouble. <br /> <br /> The film not only focuses on the difficulties faced by the policeman who is trying to do his duty, but also on the other side of the brutality in police custody. Om Puri renders hopelessness and burning desire to free herself in this unique performance at Ardh Satya. <br /> <br /> A feast for all the avid fans of Indian cinema.
