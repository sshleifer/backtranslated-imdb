I will be honest. I have this movie, so I can laugh at it. I mean, "Hood of the Living Dead"? What other reaction can I have? The point is that the film (and its creators) decided that it will not laugh at it. Instead, he will try to be a good movie. <br /> <br /> And you know what? It was terribly close. A little less cheese in random music, a bit more professionalism in photography, acting, incidents (like props - I love the Best Buy bag) ... well, this is not a zombie genre, but it's still quite a nice movie. And acting, writing and tempo are surprisingly better than I expected. There's even a bit of decent humor, as two of our leading debates, how to decide if a dead zombie is really dead. <br /> <br /> If you can overlook a low budget (which leaves fingerprints in everything, unfortunately) and almost constant vulgarity, it can be quite a nice time in movies. No, it's not great. Yes, it could have been better. But the creators, actors, crew, everyone tried to make a good movie (instead of the classical camp) and that's what counts. The zombie movie line in campa is a mile long and I thank you for not adding it. <br /> <br /> Kudos for the Quiroz brothers. I would like to see what they will do next. And hey, someone, give them a budget!
