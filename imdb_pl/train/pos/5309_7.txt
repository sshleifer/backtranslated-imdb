The best part about this movie is that it's fun. He is full of humorous characters and interesting situations, ranging from a carefree, innocent Pecker (played attractively by Edward Furlong) who likes to photograph almost everything he sees in everyday life. Other great characters are Pecker's friend Matt ("he's a thief, but he's a really nice guy"), Pecker's sister Chrissy (who is addicted to sugar) and Catholic grandmother Pecker, who discovers life in the statue of the Holy Mother in her room. <br /> <br /> The film gently shows how every day life has many riches to offer, and it manages to achieve this goal without being too heavy in this regard. When sending messages about the value and dignity of "ordinary people" there is always the risk of slipping into something opposite "sharper than you" - but "Pecker" avoids these traps, allowing the audience to reach the goal, while allowing enough space for viewers, to compare this message with your own thoughts on this topic. <br /> <br /> I recommend the movie mainly because it is a lot of fun.
