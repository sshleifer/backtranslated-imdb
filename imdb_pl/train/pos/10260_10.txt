The first part of this notorious series of horrors depicts a woman being kidnapped by a gang of black-clad men who torture her for a few days before finally killing her. It is whipped wildly, rotates endlessly around the chair, pulls nails, animal insides are thrown at her, hot boiling water is poured on her and finally her eyeball is punctured with a needle (really sick and nasty scene). one is the closest to a film that can be obtained without committing a murder on the tape. Of course, some special effects are rather weak, but the idea of ​​making snuff is quite macabre. I also saw "Flowers of flesh and blood" which is more bloody and sadistic, but less disturbing. In any case, this is a must for fans of horror!
