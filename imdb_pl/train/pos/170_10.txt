Do not listen to fuddy-duddy critics on it, this is a gem! Young rich Joan and her brother are penniless after their father's death - and now they have to work for a living! She obviously becomes a reporter, and he, just as naturally, a mob driver! Thanks to the gangster Clark Gable, the wild case of their careers. In the meantime, there is a chance to swim in lingerie for the moon for a group of nice young things and for Joanna to perform some risky dance numbers (with the whole grace of a steam shovel). But none of this should be taken seriously - it's fun to play these great days in front of the code when Hollywood was really naughty. Joan looks great and shows a lot of emotions that would give her a career so long-lived (thank God she stopped dancing!). Gable is unusual as a slimy gangster - he was not a star yet, so he did not have to be a hero. It's great to see him play something else. And William Bakewell is perfect as a poor confused brother. There are also some great photomontages and photos that follow courtesy of director Harry Beaumont, who moves the piece at a fast pace - and occasionally winks at the audience! Great fun!
