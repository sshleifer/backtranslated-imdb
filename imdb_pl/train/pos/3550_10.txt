That's how the music genre came about. Humor, talent, romance and action have been combined into one whole. <br /> <br /> Frank Sinatra was wonderful. Nothing more needs to be said. Marlon Brando, although not a singer, did a great job, winning the hearts of many, playing Sky Masterson. The fact that he could not sing, he added to his character. The ladies in the film were fine, but the men in the film definitely stole the show. <br /> <br /> This is a real classic that can be appreciated at any age. It connects with all recipients and makes you smile and laugh. <br /> <br /> Definitely the movie you want to watch and enjoy!
