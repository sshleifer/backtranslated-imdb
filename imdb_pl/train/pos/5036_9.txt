Bill Paxton, Aliens, Near Dark and Terminator fame, surprises me with his debut as director for Frailty. It hits all the cylinders, but at the end there is one unbelievable that affects the FBI agent (Powers Booth), who subtracts the point from this cold and thought provoking thriller. Besides, this movie was fine. <br /> <br /> Bill Paxton plays dad. He never gave the name, but it is not the weakness of the movie. In fact, it strengthens the film, allowing the viewer to perceive it as a kind of symbol. One day he has a vision he sent from God, telling him that the world is coming to an end and both he and his two sons Fenton Meiks (Matt OLeary) and Adam Meiks (Jeremy Sumpter) have to refine the demons and kill them. Demons look like normal people they kill, and this makes the viewer wonder if dad has just lost his senses, or whether he is really doing god's work. There are scenes that reflect both points, which adds confusion and gives the film more tension. <br /> <br /> The story is told in retrospection by one of the sons who is already an adult (Matthew McConaughey) and speaks with an FBI agent Wesley Doyle (Powers Booth) who is very skeptical and right. After all, it's not everyday that someone comes to your office and tells you that he knows who the killer is. <br /> <br /> The film has many twists and turns, and Bill Paxton perfectly directs us, keeping us in tune with no loss of interest. Acting is amazing. The two young leaders and Paxton work great together, looking like a normal family, even though everyone is involved in the murder. As I said, there is one unbelievableness associated with Powers Booth, but it really is not a big deal. It was an extremely well made film with faith and family.
