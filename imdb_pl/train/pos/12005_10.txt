This movie was the best movie I've ever seen. Being LDS, I highly recommend this film because you are better able to understand the life of Joseph Smith. Although the film has not been created with renowned actors, it is an extraordinary and life-changing film that everyone can admire and appreciate. I saw this movie with my family and I can testify that we all changed our minds. This movie allows people to really understand how hard life was for a prophet and how many worries he had before him. After watching the movie, there was not a single dry eye in the whole room. Everyone was moved by what they saw, and I have not been the same since I saw him. I highly recommend this film to everyone.
