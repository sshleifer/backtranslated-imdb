I watched this program as a child and I loved it! I watched it when it came to Toonami YATA ago .... Sheesh, I sound so old! I had to be 13 or 14 when he showed up ... But in any case he had a great feature line, and I'm one of those girls who watched (and ADORED) Sailormoon and loved it. Animation was not the best ... Actually quite fun in some parts, and the voice game was VERY bad at first, but it was a good watch and I found myself getting involved in it day after day. br /> <br /> Samurai Troopers / Ronin Warriors is a classic and all-time one of my favorites. Go Ryo !!!!
