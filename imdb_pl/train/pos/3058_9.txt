I bought it a year ago or more for $ 2 (yep, $ 2), I left it on the shelf for ages, now I watch a DVD, while fascinated by the cold. <br /> <br /> This is a haunted movie. Great performances of all involved, especially 6-year-old boy (about the only smiles you got in this movie). <br /> <br /> The story reminds me of my favorite movie, Grosse Pointe Blank, but of course it is light, it is a heavy heart. <br /> <br /> As a psychologist, clinical and judicial psychologist, the thrill shook my spine when the identity of the new contract was revealed. A terrible thing! A great job over and over again. <br /> <br /> Pete
