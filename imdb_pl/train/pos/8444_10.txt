After about a 7-year stony road on NBC it was decided to make only one last Super tranche. The series was several times in a bubble because it did not have numbers that would qualify it for the TV booth. He always had a large, hard core of hard supporters' bodies. <br /> <br /> It was almost as if the series with the full title "HOMICIDE: LIFE ON THE STREET" (1993-99) was kind of "Mr. In-Between "series. She was too big to simply cancel it, but too small to get the case of "Furious Ratings." <br /> <br /> During an uncertain period on Friday nights they presented one of the best and most daring artistic hour dramas. I said it artistically, artistically !! But please, remember that we mean Artistic, but not only Phony, Pretentious, Pedantic, Politically Correct. ; this super episode was prepared just like this 2-hour production for a TV movie. <br /> <br /> Looking at all the events of previous seasons and the parade of regular characters, the production team went out and gave us what turned out to be a super shipment. <br /> <br /> OUR HISTORY? ????? When we join the story, it turns out that the officer in charge of the homicide unit in Baltimore, Lieutenant Al Giardello, "pulled out the pin", that is, he withdrew from work. But "G" is not ready for retirement yet. So instead of a rocking chair on a fishing rod, we find out that Al runs to the mayor of Charm City. <br /> <br /> Being in the city, stopping campaigns and speaking, former detective Lieutenant takes a killer ball. He lives, but in a coma he is taken to hospital. <br /> <br /> The news is spreading fast and, as if officially called, we'll find all the Baltimore Unit detectives we saw at the show to offer their services and help. It is a great meeting of all those former and present gumshoes, when they go through and follow every trail and the ability to drive. <br /> <br /> The producer has found a way to deal with those who died earlier, bringing their memories to history. They managed to answer some lengthy questions and even introduce some to the undisclosed. The whole story ends the series in the most satisfying and original way. But at least for now we leave it as "classified". <br /> <br /> Unpacking everything into a neat little package, this TV movie will surely receive our support. When it comes to evaluating the "HOMICIDE FILM", we must even award him A or A +. But regardless of the class, he did not reach such a high level as a typical weekly episode.
