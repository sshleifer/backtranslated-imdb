In a sea of ​​nonsense that Hollywood (and others) are still exhibiting, this is one of those uncut diamonds. A small, simple movie that is very funny and leaves you feeling that you not only lost an hour and a half of life. <br /> <br /> Ashley Judd is really amazing in this movie. I have never been a fan or noticed before, but returning and seeing her early performance, I was convinced that she is extremely talented. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie was for me a college job, so I was skeptical. I thought, "Oh, boy, some stupid, chic flutter or feminine male nonsense ..." I was pleasantly surprised. Without analyzing many important topics, let me just say that if you have not seen it yet, do yourself a favor and check it out. Sometimes mundane movies with pieces of life are the best, and that's great.
