I saw this movie when it was released, and when I was 12 years old :) I still vividly recall the wonderful scenes of how the hero / heroine escapes every time he faces danger :) And the best feature of the film was the portrait of a villain! I think that many so-called action movies copied many "escape scenes" from this movie !! And not only does it impress me when I see such copying, but it always increases my appreciation for this masterpiece! :) The main actors acted great. Slow and realistic development of chemistry b / w hero and heroine was extremely natural and wonderfully portrayed. As children, we felt that the love that had developed them was very natural :) The way in which they meet and overcome all their trials and sufferings was something that could make even children realize the value of true love, dedication and care. I recommend that everyone see this movie when they get a chance !! - Vijay.
