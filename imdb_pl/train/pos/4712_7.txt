The jokes are obvious, the gags are trivial, and the characters are characatures - but I could not stop laughing with his very funny movie. No matter how many times I see it, I still have a chance and recommend it to all lovers of mindless entertainment. It contains many quotes and some of the best gags I have seen to this day. If you've had a bad week and you need a giggle, hire this on your way home on Friday evening to give your weekend a good start.
