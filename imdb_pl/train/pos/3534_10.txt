This is a very unusual movie in which the star with the highest bill does not seem to be literally halfway. Even so, I was engaged to the Widmowa Dama hook. Curtis, though competent, like falsely accused Scott Henderson, looks a bit of tough sympathy (perhaps he should have shaved a mustache), and his behavior after returning home should convince the cops at least to some extent his innocence. While another commentator had a problem with Franchot Tone as Jack Marlowe, I thought his character was impressively complex. He is not a villain of action. Excellent character actor Elisha Cook Jr. he is again in top form as a "small man with large ambitions". His drumming in musical numbers added to the breeze of eroticism. This film, however, is run by a very talented and beautiful Ella Raines, because Henderson's lover, Carol Richmond, would be devoted. She definitely has talent, and her presence on the screen is part of the Lauren Bacall tradition. This is the first of her work I've seen and I'm definitely willing to see her other roles. The rest of the cast is also more than competent. To sum up, the very satisfying secret of the film noir, which is viewed today fully reflects the dark and complex urban world for which it is intended. Recommended, 8/10.
