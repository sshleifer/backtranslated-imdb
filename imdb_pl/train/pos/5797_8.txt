And I do not say it in a bad way. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie at the cinema when I was 6 or 7 years old. For me and my cousins ​​it was magical, beautiful and terrifying at the same time. When we left the theater, Michael was our best friend, even though we knew he had no idea about it. <br /> <br /> Over the years I've seen this movie being broadcasted a few times, but I've always changed the channel. Even seeing a few seconds will restore this feeling of magic and warm my heart. And I liked it that way. <br /> <br /> So I saw this movie only once and I think it was a good decision not to watch it again. If I saw it today, I know I could not help dealing with the criticism of MJ's acting, plot (if it was) and this and that. For me it is a childhood memory, so my feelings for him come from a child from 20 years ago. <br /> <br /> I see that my adult intervenes in my judgment and gives him 8 for memories and wonderful music. For the little kid who watched him with admiration 20 years ago, it is definitely worth 10.
