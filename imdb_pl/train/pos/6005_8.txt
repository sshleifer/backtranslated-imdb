Although this film is slightly decontaminated (because it was created at a time when people just did not talk about sex), it is an extremely helpful short film showing girls in preschool to know what to expect during menstruation. No wonder that it was paid by the Kotex concern, although many may be surprised that Disney produced this film - because in the 1940s and 1960s many educational films were made. However well a film was made, I think the creator of the film missed a real opportunity. Instead of the nice voice of a female narrator and relatively bland visualizations, it would be great if they used Minnie Mouse and the rest of the Disney gang !! I know it would give old Walt a heart attack, but that would be a great movie! Incidentally, although in the film the concept of sex is barely suggested, it EXACTLY explains the explanation of menstruation. However, there are some details missing (especially regarding the relationship), which I think are included in the attached booklet. <br /> <br /> Now, if only I can find out why I watched the cartoon about menstruation.
