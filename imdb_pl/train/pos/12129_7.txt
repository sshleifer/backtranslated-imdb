This is a well-directed film by John Cromwell, who was not a great director, but who made some great films, including The Prsoner of Zenda from 1937. The action takes place in London, which is able to handle only Hollywood, climatic, but not reminiscent of a real story. It is a tale of obsession and frustrated love from Somerset Maughan's novel. <br /> <br /> I could not wait for the DVD, because I've never seen it before and being a big admirer of Bette Davis, I wanted to see her in the role she thought to be one of the greatest. So I bought it. She looked good, but I'm sorry that her London accent just made me laugh. Bette Davis was one of the greatest movie actresses, do not make a mistake, but here she did one. You could not take her character seriously. It was not as gruesome as the accent of Dney Van Dyke, "Mary Poppins," but close. <br /> <br /> Another main role was Leslie Howard and he did it brilliantly. He was a subtle and intelligent actor. Supporting actors are doing well. It is worth watching despite Ms Davis's vocal gymnastics.
