I can really say that I felt a movie in its true essence, where mind games from dreamy reality enter the surrealistic aspect of the future facing Tom Cruise. I was not too concerned about Tom Cruise's acting prowess, but I have to say that it seems to be impressive at every point in the movie ... not only because of the immersive story, but also because of his own personality being given to the main character form. .. they connect, then they talk and they are beautiful. I must say, however, that this film does not fit into the "average movie of the weekend", which you will randomly select and watch with joy; It carries strong feelings and characters, so do not wash it with your beer and pop-corns. I certainly need something more.
