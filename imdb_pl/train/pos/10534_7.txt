Regardless of whether it's a good movie or not, these kinds of movies have to be done. He remembers me from the movie "I love Huckabees," a predominantly mysterious movie in which Isabelle Huppert is sodomized by a young American in a muddy pond, cheerfully sadistic-masochistic (?? !!!!). I hope that the director will go further across the border, as if I felt that Vincenzo Natali's choices are not always subtle (some scenes were unfortunate "tarte-à-la-crème", like a childish slapstick), speaking about the script and cinematography? The color "Cube" was black, "Nothing" is white, more joyful, surprisingly than the previous films of Natalia.
