My favorite novel Austen and Paltrow are by no means my favorite actress, but I think the movie is almost delightful. Paltrow does a good job, and Cummings, Stevenson and the one who plays "Miss Bates" are absolutely amazing. The period details are not alienating; in fact, the movie is just right. But the real "find" is Jeremy Northam as Mr Knightley. It could not be better casting, IMO. I hated Mr. K in this novel, but in the movie I thought he was a wonderful man and a man. Northam's good look and smiling eyes do not bother either! Highly recommended. Anar
