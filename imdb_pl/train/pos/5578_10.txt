The funny and insightful perspective of the world of dating is presented in this off-beat comedy by the first writer / director Peter M. Cohen. The story unfolds when the four heroes meet each week at a local restaurant to talk about their unlucky dates. We meet Brad: a handsome playboy on the wall with fast and sharp language; Zeek: a cynical, sensitive writer; Jonathan: a sexually troubled guy with a passion for hand creams and masturbation; and Eric: a married guy who appreciates weekly meetings with his lonely friends in the hope of some enlightenment of his boring and banal existence. The trials and torments of lonely male concerts in New York are fun, reflecting those of Sex in the City and the new comedy HBO The Mind of Married Man, and bring insight into scamming. The story changes when three singletons meet with Mia - amused by Amanda Peet - and everyone falls into it. He seduces everyone with his amazing ability to adapt to the personality that they exhibit. When they realize that everyone met and fell in love with the same woman, they chose her for their friendship. Bita is a realistic representation of the world of dating, which the critic did not recognize. Speaking in simple language, they did not hit the nail on the head. The protagonist is the caricatures of real people. Exaggerations are hysterical, mix satire and humbleness and should not be taken as seriously as criticism suggests. See this movie, you'll laugh from beginning to end.
