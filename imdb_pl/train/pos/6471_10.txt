A short comedy of our group. <br /> <br /> The gang forces Spanky to watch his younger siblings. Taking care of these FORGOTTEN BABIES turns out to be quite a chore, leaving a small chive without choice, how to come up with some ingenious solutions to the problem of caring for a child ... in this funny little movie, probably the best. Highlight: Spanky tells the story of the movie TARZAN, which he recently saw among viewers. The film's heroes recognize Billy Gilbert's voice in a radio drama.
