When I was told about this film, I thought it would be another movie. I was wrong. This film is a powerful message about judging others. I was deeply moved. Everyone I met has recommended this movie. Nobody came back, saying it was bad. Busy, she also did a great job with her role in this movie. I do not know much about her acting career, but wow, the way she completed this performance was great. <br /> <br /> At the beginning it was a bit slow. But after she went to the hospital ... wow, the movie is rising again. I have no idea why this movie was not used in the movie world. I would like this film to be re-released and advertised more ... because it sends a powerful message in just one and a half hours.
