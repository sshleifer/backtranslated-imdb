I loved it so much that I bought a DVD and a novel at the same time. Chemistry between actors (including small Arthur) is amazing and exciting. <br /> <br /> She could use some more time for delicious Frederick Lawrence (played by James Purefoy). And Gilbert Markham was amazingly "on it" from the very beginning of the movie. <br /> <br /> The one who impressed me the most with shocking admiration was Rupert Graves as Arthur Huntingdon. I love him in Saga Forsyte and everything I've seen in him. But he overtakes himself here as Arthur. In my wildest dreams, I could not imagine him playing a mad psychic like Arthur Huntingdon. But he does it. And I love it. And I love him.
