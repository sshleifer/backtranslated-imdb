When you come across the jewel of such a movie, you realize why the 1980s were the greatest decade of your life. It was rock music, like movies ... especially horror movies. The filmmakers knew how to play with us, and "Trick or Treat" is obvious. When the rocker Sammi Curr, which most probably was written after W.A.S. singer Blackie Lawless, dies in a hotel fire, his fan # 1 Eddie, is desperate. He goes to a friend and local DJ Nuke (Gene Simmons) for support. Nuke gives him a copy of the last recording that Sammi made; it is the only available copy. She was handed over to a radio station to be played live on Halloween night. When Eddie plays, he restores Sammi somehow. He helps Eddie with the persecutors at school, but then he gets out of control. It's definitely one great movie. The bad news is that this movie is exhausted. I paid $ 25.00 to finally get to eBay. You should also ... $$ well spent!
