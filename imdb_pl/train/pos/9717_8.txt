How to lose friends and alienate people is honest one of the best comedy I've seen this year, along with Pineapple Express and Step Brothers. This is not one of those "gross" comedies, which are largely based on jokes and humor in the toilet, and instead move at a friendly pace, and you'll be easily attached to the developing narrative. Simon Pegg nails him in the coffin with his funny portrait of a water figure and quickly breaks away from the tripod he once belonged to in England (the other two are Nick Frost and Edgar Wright). It is difficult to be at the forefront of the Hollywood food chain, which is clearly seen on the example of Pegg. His first role was in the lead of David Schwimmer's Run Fatboy Run, but received summer reviews from critics and audiences. His second attempt is this film, which received quite positive reviews from the majority, but it was a flop at the box office. I still have not lost faith in him and I will still be there when I want to get the third shot for glory. <br /> <br /> Other characters were well manned from Jeff Bridges to Danny Hustin and Gillian Anderson. To my surprise, Kirsten Dunst, in my opinion, did well in this film as the angle of love for Pegg, but the spark I saw in Interview with the vampire is still lost. He must find him, quickly, because he may suffer the consequences of getting lost in the land of "rom-coms" forever.
