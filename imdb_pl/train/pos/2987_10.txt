This is the crying that the Beaches have never been. Although I really wanted to love Beaches, it always seemed too hasty to "feel" it (although its soundtrack is one of my favorite records). On the other hand, Stella moves in a slower (and sometimes too slow) pace, and although she is a bit manipulative in her tearing story of a devoted mother, she works because Bette and the rest of the cast are getting involved in great performances. 10/10
