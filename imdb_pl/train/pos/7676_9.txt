Excellent! Together with my wife, we joined a large line to see Holly at the Edinburgh film festival. After watching the movie, I can understand why there was such a long queue. Holly is a moving story about an impossible relationship between two people. He is a young girl, he is a tired man of the West. The film grabbed every bone in our body. There are no graphic scenes or anything that is difficult to watch - it is the surrealism of normality that really kicks you. The film is beautifully filmed. Among other things, we loved the scene where Patrick teaches Holly to ride a small motorcycle. The severity of Thuy Ngoyen (she can not believe it was her first acting career) and Ron Livingston's performance stayed with me for a few days. Highly recommended.
