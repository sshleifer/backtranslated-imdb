Maybe I have to examine my head, but I thought it was a pretty good movie. CG is not too bad. I saw worse. The appearance of creatures (and by creatures that I mean good and bad snake) was action scenes with snakes were really good, I thought. Sometimes there are some logical errors, and history does not always make sense. But for the creation function it is much worse. other creatures seemed torn from other films, so it's not entirely original. I think that the heart of the story is original. I like this movie, but I still say it was pretty good. I also liked music. All in all, I think Dragon Wars is around 7/10
