New York has never looked so good! And no one has anyone in this movie. The script is a bit light but you can not help but you'll like this movie or any of the characters. You almost want people to really exist. The attractiveness of the actors is what really puts it together (John Ritter, Colleen Camp and the late Dorothy Stratten are particularly good).
