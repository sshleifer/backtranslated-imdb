I do not watch a lot of porn, but I love porn stars. And I love bloody movies. So when I heard about the gore porn movie, I was really excited. Of course, it was years ago and when I heard about all the problems with creating and ending the movie, I never thought I would see him. But I did and I'm not ashamed to admit that I loved it, even with all its disadvantages. <br /> <br /> First, the disadvantages. The story takes place in Ireland and is called Samhain, but the story that it seemed to want to tell is about the Sawney Beane clan from Scotland. So why not set it up and skip the third-class report on Samhain / Irish / Halloween immigrants? In addition, he breaks his own rules, stating that you are safe on the trails, but then mutants of cannibals just begin to run amok everywhere. You never know how many cannibals we're dealing with. There is a large stone castle, which is obviously ancient, but nobody noticed it before. Self-aware references to horrors are annoying, as are characters. The protagonist has a retrospective montage of all her dead friends, including a character that NEVER SHOULD. The end does not make sense. <br /> <br /> So what works? Blood! Sure, I would like more, but it was refreshing to see such a nasty movie that was not afraid of being anything more than a movie about up. Two murders are exaggerated, and Taylor Hayes has a nice disgusting scene. Two wild murders are even longer on DVD. I always thought that gore could beat a stupid story, and Evil Breed strengthened it.
