I just finished watching this movie and I can honestly say that it is a work of art. I was very surprised to see the overall rating of 5.2. <br /> <br /> Guy not only combines the cast from the movie list and creates such wonderful characters from them that he gave us a movie with a fantastically diverse plot with lots of imagination. <br /> <br /> Too many people want movies with a story that can be understood and passed on to their plates ... but these are movies that weaken reviews because they are too predictable. <br /> <br /> This movie is unique. Get it now!
