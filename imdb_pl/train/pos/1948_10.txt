It's a great end to the show. The fact that Adm. Janeway was able to make a double change in Borg, he was wonderful. The fact that she allowed herself to infect, thus infecting the queen with a "poison" that was essentially over, Borg was wonderful. The manner in which they ended also left a few, not many, for the film about the meeting. However, they brought them home, and the way they did it was fantastic !! It was sad to say goodbye to part of my family. Finally, Tom and B'Lanna have their child when they enter the square of Alpha. it was a great way to show a new beginning. It would be nice if we had some sort of downhill movie - just to see where their characters would be today.
