In Carmen, Saura once again aims to establish a dynamic relationship between reality and fiction, between real passions of personality in a dance band preparing choreography for the dance parts of the Carmen opera and scriptural passions from the fictional Carmen story, the famous fatal mixture of the free spirit (read disrespect for fidelity) and her ability to drive people mad with lust. Saura used the same fiction of the vehicle / reality in the earlier black and white film Bodes de Sangre (Blood Wedding). But while tensions between Blood Wedding dancers showed how they evolved into fictional characters to be made by directing their emotions to their roles, in Carmen, the parallelism between minor, libidinal impulse dancers, the unit during rehearsals and spiritual forging associated with the mythical Carmen never come close to faith. It remains a gadget and that's why it bothers you. You really need to see Blood Wedding next to Carmen to appreciate the comparison. However, it does not matter much, the melodrama that Saura tries to impose on his Carmen, because Flamenco dance and guitar music rehearsals, which account for 95% of the film by some of the most famous dancers and flamenco musicians, more than pay the entry price. Faulty movie and a miracle: perfect for doing Keats' "negative ability"?
