Kurosawa intertwines a story in which the character is as diverse as any other Shakespeare drama, and the acting is faithful to this story, and each star plays its role as part of a larger story. It's moving, fun and intriguing in all parts. Character development is almost perfect, the photos are vivid and engaging, and history attracts you. <br /> <br /> I would like to say that "samurai" and those who are obsessed with the dynasty from the end of the 18th and 19th century, stories from Japan can spoil this film as Kurosawa's best work. Perhaps not the best, but even in the worst case, Kurosawa is better than many of the best. This story is based on raising the mundane life of ordinary people in times of great change, that it is timeless, even though it is set in a not-so-distant past. <br /> <br /> I heartily recommend to every film lover, especially those who will probably continue reading the novel on which the movie is based.
