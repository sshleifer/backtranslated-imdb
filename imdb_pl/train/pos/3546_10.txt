One of the best musicals ever made is an example in which producers and the director were not afraid to choose actors for their talent, not for what people can expect. The lighting and the set are unique, which gives a very interesting effect (it has a special name that I can not think about). The dialog box is also unique because no contractions are used. The film is well thought out, beautifully played and interesting from beginning to end. MUSIC is a real joy. Such a set of first-class songs, from the beginning to the end, which are perfectly made and arranged. In addition, the music is very original and very memorable, and I think it is better than many musicals from the thirties to the sixties. Certainly has more original and beautiful songs than most musicals, which can only have two or three. Not bad for a director without experience in this type of films. Another feature is that it is fresh every time it sees it.
