I thought "The River of Souls" is a very good movie Babylon 5, with exceptional performances by Martin Sheen, Tracy Scoggins and Ian MacShane. If it was an episode of the series (without humor), it would probably be one of my favorite independent tales from the series. <br /> <br /> Personally, I always preferred Scoggins to Christian, although JMS was also not written for most of the series and had to endure the story of Byron / Telepath. If you get rid of the sad humor about the brothel and "poorer" actors in these scenes, then this movie is solid. Probably my third favorite of four films, but not bad at all.
