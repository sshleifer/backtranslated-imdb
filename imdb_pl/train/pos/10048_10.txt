From time to time, the conversation changes into "favorite movies". I will mention the Titanic and at least some people will giggle. I do not pay attention to them, because I know that five years ago the same people were moved to tears by the same movie. And they are too embarrassed to admit it now. <br /> <br /> It's simply the first time in a long time I've moved the Titanic. Expecting that we would just start to enjoy this story again, I was surprised that the movie lost its power during these five years. I cried again ... in all the same places. It brought me back to 1997, when I can remember how a film that no one has thought has even become the most popular movie of all time. A film that fell into public consciousness like no other movie I can remember (yes, even more than Star Wars). And today, many people will not even admit that they liked it. People, let's do something simple - you do not look great when you're researching this movie. You look like a cynical contactless. <br /> <br /> No movie is perfect, and this one has a few mistakes. Some dialogues fall, and part of the story surrounding two lovers meets a little too carefully. However, nothing distracts this movie. <br /> <br /> Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are wonderful. Leo is one of the best actors of his generation. Wait until you see him in the New York Gangs before you call him anything more than a pretty boy. Kate Winslet was so strong in this movie. The film really belonged to her and beautifully held her. <br /> <br /> James Cameron coped with what many thought was impossible by recreating a completely credible Titanic. The sinking scenes were terrifying, just like that night. If someone can say that the effects were bad, he is beyond me. I was completely fascinated. <br /> <br /> This movie is one memorable scene after another. Titanic leaving the port of Southampton. Rose and Jack on the bow, "flying". "Iceberg, right!" The screws hang unbelievably from the ocean. Screams of convicts after the fall. And this ending, which led even the most demanding man in the theater to tears. <br /> <br /> Music, which was also the victim of the film's success, was a key ingredient. The result of James Horner was simply perfect. And the theme of love was beautiful and tragic. It is a pity that the pop version of Celine Dion had to destroy this huge piece of music for so many. <br /> <br /> I admit that I'm a Titanic fan. Therefore, I was happy to see the ship as we have never seen it - in all its beauty. Perhaps watching this sink affected me more than some, because throughout my life I was so much interested in the ship. I doubt, however, that many of those I saw who were crying were Titanic fans. I praise Cameron for telling this story to the masses who have never demeaned the tragedy. The film was made with such humanity. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer said it better than I ever could: Open your heart on the Titanic, and you will not be disappointed.
