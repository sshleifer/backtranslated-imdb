Class Reunion is a very underestimated comedy gem. It's 1982, and Lizzie Borden High class from 1972 returns there for a 10-year meeting, among them there are usual stereotypes, handsome, babe, fat and nerd, etc. But former students are in a difficult night, one of their classmates Walter Baloer, class mollusk who became a comedic student for the rest of the class on the night of graduation and has been in the mental home since then, Walter escapes and now plans to avenge his humiliation ,,, <br /> <br /> Despite the dark premise this is really an excuse for many funny gags and sets. To say that much more would ruin the movie, but if you liked the Naked Gun and Airplane movies, would you love it, and what other movie does the cameraman Chuck Berry have? A great comedy that deserves a wider audience.
