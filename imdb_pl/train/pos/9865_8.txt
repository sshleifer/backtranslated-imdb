I saw a movie with two adult children. Although he was not as clever as Shrek, I thought it was rather good. In the cinema surrounded by children who were on vacation, there was no sound, so I know that children liked it. The parents also seemed engaged. The death and apparent death of the characters led to appropriate sighs and comments. I hope people realize that this movie was created for children. As such he was successful, although I liked it too. Personally, I liked Scrat !!
