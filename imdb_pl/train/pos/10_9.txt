I'm a man, I do not give female films, but it's a really well made special story. I do not have personal love for Jane Fonda as a person, but she does one great job while DeNiro is his usual great self. Everything is well done: acting, directing, visualizations, settings, photography, casting. If you can enjoy the history of real people and true love - it's a winner.
