Very interesting entertainment with the charm of old movies. Tarzan does not hesitate to face the greatest dangers, if the moment requires it, and we all enjoy its success. The most interesting thing for me is a man without special powers, who is struggling with problems and defeats them only with human skills (he was a great swimmer and had a great scream)
