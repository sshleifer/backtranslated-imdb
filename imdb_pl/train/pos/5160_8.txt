Dr. McCoy and Mr. Spock are trapped in the ice age of the planet, while Cpt. Kirk is in the colonial period of the same planet. However, the first couple have the most difficult time. Apart from the frost and the sanctuary, which can only be found in the caves, there is the third resident, beautiful and sexy Zarabeth (Mariette Hartley). Because Spock spends more time in this era, he slowly begins to return to the patterns of behavior of his ancestors, feeling the natural attraction to Zarabeth and throwing "caution in the wind" that he will ever leave this place. Only with the constant "reminders" of Dr. McCoy Spock holds out some knowledge of reality. <br /> <br /> This is one of the few moments when a character can show "emotions" and Nimoy (Spock) plays him to the hilt, approaching to throw away a beray from Deforest Kelly (McCoy). Surprising in the previous part, Captain Kirk (William Shatner) could not get a girl, another plus for this. <br /> <br /> The eternal "old man" Ian Wolfe assesses the role of "Mr. Atoza," the librarian responsible for sending the trio back to the past.
