I would not call it "My Back! A Dinosaur's Story "is simply a children's version of" Jurassic Park ". I find it more interesting. Like the previous one, he questions the safety of bringing beings from one age to ours. But it really opens my eyes when I see who delivered the voices: John Goodman, Rhea Perlman, Jay Leno, Walter Cronkite, Julia Child, Kenneth Mars, Yeardley Smith, Martin Short and Larry King. To paraphrase this: the actor, the woman "Cheers", the host of the "Tonight Show", the most trusted name in the news, the famous chef, police chief "Young Frankenstein", Lisa Simpson, one of the Three Amigos and Guy from CNN. <br /> <br /> But I probably should not focus only on the cast. I thought that this movie has something for children (pure fun) and for adults (natural history). It is true that this is escapism, but perceptive. I would say that John Goodman making Rex's voice here is a kind of precursor to his voice in "Monsters Inc". Worth seeing.
