SPOILERS BY: <br /> <br /> I'm really in the minority, but I liked the movie. This is not classic, but definitely engages and drives adrenaline. I definitely thought it was worth at least 7 points. <br /> <br /> Maybe the reason I liked it is that I did not see the original. Something tells me that this film will be the strongest fans of people who have not seen the original version, and therefore have little to compare. It was not a masterpiece, but I got into it a lot and really wanted to see the original. <br /> <br /> There were several things in it. One of them was Kowalkski's casting. Viggo Mortenson was wonderful and really brought a lot of charisma to this role. Because most of the movie fell on his shoulders, he really had to be perfect and he was. It was a great role for him. <br /> <br /> Another interesting thing about Vansishing Point was the fact that it is designed for television. I had no idea it was while watching. I certainly thought it was a big movie and I would never guess that it was not a big screen release. <br /> <br /> I found this story very absorbing. I'm not one of the action movies, but I fell into it. In addition, it was more than an action movie in which there was drama, mysticism, love story, bizarre people in every direction. (I did not even recognize Priest.) And it was moving. It was not a great movie, but you can watch it. <br /> <br /> And then there is the ending. It is a powerful blow and if someone has been involved in this story up to this point, it is very difficult not to be shocked at the very end. I'm not sure what I think about the ending. It follows that Kowalkski survived and although I am very skeptical about how it would be possible, it is a movie, and realism is not a component that always appears during the creation of the film. <br /> <br /> So I would have to say that the end was unbelievably unrealistic, but very touching in a manipulative way that I usually do not like, but for some reason, it's almost forgivable in this movie. It must be admitted that many things were only props for the story (were the villains already a stereotype?) But the creators were right, even if they had many mistakes. Having said that, I will admit that I understand why someone who is a big fan of the original hates this version, because although I did not see the original, I saw many original films that I loved to work with terrible results. (My great reluctance is in fact a consequence.) But I understand low grades if the original is of such high quality. <br /> <br /> People compared it to Smoky and the Bandit. And what about the road version of "Legends Of The Fall" that also meets with "Thelma and Louese"? I certainly felt the touch of both films (both of which I am a fan.) I do not think it is a great movie though. It was better than average for me, but far from great. But it was a fascinating, adrenaline-driven, moving movie with a great cast of the main character. My vote is 7 out of 10.
