I liked these movies. This is another Yash paradise movie that, as you know, will look good on the screen, the whole character is always nice or very nice, with one exception, which you know will eventually cover with love ... Another principle of the Yash paradise movie is that the hero or heroine; They have only one or no parent. Let's get back to all these films. MPK Suman did not have a mum, HMAPK Salman did not have parents, and FINAL rule is that 90% will probably see him cry Alock Nath ... <br /> <br /> The movie is good too . At the beginning it is a bit slow but provides entertainment. There's almost no comedy, but it makes you smile a lot. A small child (hero's nephew) is well placed and provides a very good one liner. The actress is very pretty but shy, you will not get it in real life. this film does not have large, happy families living in a BIG house, which was a good idea and allowed to distinguish the film from other films. At the end of the movie there will be many women crying. There is no strong message from this movie, but it is a good watch. If you are married (arranged marriage), the movie will remind you about what you have gone through. And if not, it will inform and maybe scare you ... <br /> <br /> In general a very good looking movie. No big threads and twists, but a very gentle movie, very similar to the classic Bollywood.
