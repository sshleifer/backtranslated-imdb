There is inspiration in it for 25 years. Starting from the existential themes of Blade Runner and ending with a vision of the future - with corporate billboards advertising their products, technology of later films Matrix and AI Spielberg, and finally black and white graphic novel looks similar in the style of Sin City. The creators put a lot of effort into the visual department, and the result is a well crafted future neo-noir. Add a crime story and you have an interesting movie. I know what I wanted to have, but regardless of the stunning visual effects, it was not enough to reach the final goal.
