Claire Denis has repeatedly shown that the film does not have to tell stories, that it is enough to create an experience that will allow the viewer to take the ingredients and make them what they want. <br /> <br /> At first, the idea of ​​the most non-linear movie is an older man living on the Franco-Swiss border, a man dedicated to his dogs, who still has a lover, but whose heart condition is increasingly threatening his life. He has a son with a small family who rarely meets with him, but when he discovers that he needs a heart transplant, he decides to go to Tahiti through Japan to get a heart transplant in the black market and re-ignite the lost relationship with his son. He created Tahitian women many years ago. <br /> <br /> What Denis does in this outline of the story is to use her camera to explore the loneliness of the soul, the vastness of nature, human interaction with humans vs animals, etc. Most of the time, the "film" does not make sense, but it is because we are trying too hard to connect all the dots presented before us in beautiful pictures. Life is in a way like this: we look, see, observe, integrate, process and do what we want. <br /> <br /> Using this form of making movies (just like in the weirdly beautiful "Beau Travail") Claire Denis has developed a signature technique. Regardless of whether the viewer finds satisfaction with the finished product, it has much to do with our individual methods of processing visual and conceptual information. This is an interesting and visually captivating movie, but many viewers will find it too long, with a very small amount of discourse. Maybe watching again will change it. Grady Harp
