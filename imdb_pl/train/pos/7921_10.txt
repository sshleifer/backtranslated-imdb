It's funny, watch it !!! <br /> <br /> OK, they want 10 lines, so there: It's a parody of werewolf movies from the '50s and' 70s. A lot of satire, some political. It feels like an early Clouseau movie (probably thanks to Alan Arkin), but with a smaller tap. If you like Naked Guns movies, you'll like it (again, less slapstick in this). <br /> <br /> Actually, humor ranges from light sexual innuendies (unavoidable in teenagers' comedies) to truly moving socio-political satire. Transforming Moon High School from the '50s to' 70s is really fun. The sequence of changing presidential portraits is brilliant! OK, maybe not brilliant, but still funny. There are a lot of (historical) cracks, beginning with the paranoia of the Cold War of the 1950s and inflation in the late 1970s. <br /> <br /> In any case, just watch the movie if you have a chance!
