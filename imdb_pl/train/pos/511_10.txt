I see this movie for the first time almost 21 years ago, when it was ITV (before the time of cable and satellite television) Matin√©e. I was out of school with Mumps and I was completely wrapped in a movie. I have it on a purchased movie for about 10 years and I want to get a copy of it on DVD. David Niven is my favorite actor of all time and I think that the parody that surpassed him looked many times when Oscars appeared. I also think that the queen should impersonate him, as easily as he did for the film industry as much as Sean Connery or Anthony Hopkins. the way the film changes from black and white to color and back, it's well done, and the movie has such great actors as Roger Livesy, Marius Goring and early performance of Richard Attenborough.
