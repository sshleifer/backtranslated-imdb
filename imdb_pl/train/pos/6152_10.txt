Fantastic, fantastic, probably the best Disney music adventure. I love this movie for over 35 years because it's so clever, smart and fun. Even despite the stupid scenes of a "flying bed", other scenes and dialogue are magical and fun. Could they choose someone better than Angela Lansbury to play in Eglantine? I can not think of someone more suitable for this role. Making this classic would be as stupid as remaking Mary Poppins. <br /> <br /> David Tomlinson, although he had few film roles, absolutely shines in this adventure. He was a comic genius, which is often forgotten. Angry, primitive Englishman - no one could really make slapstick and pull it with grace. It would be a tragic remake of this movie, because Tomlinson has been dead for several years and no one can enter his shoes and do justice. other movies with witches simply do not catch. I especially like the place where Germans attack the Eglantine house and must defend it in any way. <br /> <br /> Hanging around, bouncing at the bottom of the beautiful salt sea. Richard and Robert Sherman outdid each other in musical numbers. All are fantastic and worth remembering, Portobello Road is one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> A great movie that's still holding !!
