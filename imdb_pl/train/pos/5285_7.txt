You might think that you are in the middle of a serious tour when the story takes place mainly between two characters when they travel about 3,000 miles from France to Saudi Arabia, traveling through most of Europe - Italy, Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovenia, Turkey, before arriving at Near East. But this is not a trip and there are no breaks for sightseeing. <br /> <br /> Reda's father is in his first years and wants to do Haj. However, as walking and taking a mule is out of the question, he chooses a car trip to Mecca. He can not drive, so he gets involved in helping Reda, in protest of his son, to bring him there in their broken vehicle. <br /> <br /> But Reda does not see the point of taking him when his father could pick up the plane. He rebukes that he has suspended his personal life on this pilgrimage he could not understand. And that's why we set out on this arduous journey with father and son, without being the best buddies. <br /> <br /> The beauty of this film is a witness to the development of a father and son pair, the challenges facing them, the strange people they meet, forced to play in different weather conditions and alternately between motels and sleep in the car . We see in them an obvious generational gap that tries to communicate with each other, father tries to impose his son, and the son tries to prove that he is an adult, but the circumstances that we see reveal that Reda is quite a good fish out of the water. Thanks to many meetings, they really connect well, despite the differences. <br /> <br /> It's quite likely that this movie will be released here last week, to coincide with Hari Ray Haji and have the opportunity to see our heroes join other pilgrims in their Haj. The final scene in Mecca is really remarkable, and you will also feel claustrophobia and fear when Reda tries to hunt his father among thousands of people gathered. Europe's goals were perhaps deliberately not deliberated to build anticipation and focus on the ultimate destination. <br /> <br /> He certainly called home the idea of ​​how to tell and show relatives how much you appreciate who they are. Do not miss this, anyway, book early - I was pleasantly surprised that tonight was still a full house.
