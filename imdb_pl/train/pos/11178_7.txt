MUIEJSZY SPOILER <br /> <br /> An underestimated little shocking Stephen King. It is not perfect when it comes to imagination - even if the ruthless performances of Dale Midkiff and Denise Crosby would be better, they would still be bad elements of mystical history with them. The old micmac cemetery of Micmac, terminally ill sister Rachel and Jacob-Marley-Victor Victor Pascow never really coalesce into something, and the film in some places is confused and exaggerated. But not many horror films are really perfect, and what you may not be able to do in other areas is catching up with the shock of being shocked. "Pet Sematary" can be one of the cruelest horrors in the latest memory, with his murderous zombie child and his incredibly insensitive depiction of Zelda. It's politically incorrect, tasteless, it's free - and yet it makes us squirm with disgust in a way that "safer" horrors can never. Add to this one of Fred Gwynne's best performances and Mary Lambert's brilliant direction, and you'll get an extremely satisfying horrible movie - even with the hokey ending. I highly recommend it for fans of the genre. 7.5 out of 10.
