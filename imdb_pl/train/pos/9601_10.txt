Darius Goes West is an amazing documentary about a teenager (Weems) with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and his 11 friends who take him on a sightseeing trip to see if "Pimp My Ride" is printing his wheelchair. <br /> <br /> I recently watched the movie at the Sunscreen Film Festival. He played twice during the festival. This film is an amazing story about the human spirit and spirit of Weem's friends. I do not often talk about movies, but after watching this movie, I feel moved to do something about it. Each festival in which this film took part won a prize. He is on the Tribeca Film Festival and flies to London and Athens in Greece. I would not be surprised if this film reached up to Oscar. It is getting out of control. If anyone has the chance to see this movie, wherever he plays, go! Take as many people as possible and go! He is heading to New Orleans for a film festival, then to Atlanta and Palm Beach, Florida. Darius is from Georgia, so I expect tickets for the Atlanta show will be sold out soon if they are not. Please, see this movie! DGW (talk about it) <br /> <br /> -Kish
