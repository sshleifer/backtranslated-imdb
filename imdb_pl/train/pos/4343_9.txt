An excellent endearing film with Peter Falk and Paul Reiser joining forces as father and father. <br /> <br /> Dad one evening appears to say that after more than 40 years of marriage, mom (Olympia Dukakis) left him /> <br /> The rest of the movie depicts father and son on a one-day trip to reject father's thoughts about what happened. Away from them, daughters can play with detectives. <br /> <br /> The story shows the adventures of father and son in their discussion about life, which should be why mom complained about her father when they discussed life with their philosophies. <br /> <br /> We see an unexpected fishing trip and a game of billiards that leads to a close fight. Both men seem to break free from everyday life. <br /> <br /> The end is a fall when we find out why mom suddenly left. It becomes a story of courage and human spirit in the face of adversity. It is never too late to change.
