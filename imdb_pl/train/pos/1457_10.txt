I have watched this document twice - and although I am a great fan of films, most documentary films do not draw my attention. This film, however, was hypnotizing. Almost every shot is perfect - it says a lot more than an audio commentary (which is not in this document). <br /> <br /> The concept of this movie is amazing, I can not boast of it enough. Mardi Gras beads - who would have thought? <br /> <br /> An amazing and excellent selection of interviews - footage from a factory in China - the movie makes you feel as if you were there. <br /> <br /> I have political awareness - and I have read a few books on globalization, so nothing in this film was a surprise for me. However, I thought about it so much. <br /> <br /> I also really want this world to be a better place. <br /> <br /> A million kudos for the filmmaker - and thanks for making this movie. <br /> <br /> I'd like everyone to see that.
