I was about 11 years old and discovered that I live 0.48 miles from my uncle's home. Uncle's house is on Westway Dr, Deer Park, TX. they have added houses since the film was made. I do not know the house number, but you can check it out. I'm 21 now and I like watching this movie. the Spencer strap is no longer theirs. Pasadena ISD wants to build his school. Last week I was driving at home, the house still looks great. My dad and uncle will go to the street, where the house is, and watch the actors enter and leave the house, trying to make a movie. where John crosses the rupture of the railway line, increased 225. When I hear about John, who is playing with his son, I start thinking about when he created a city cowboy aged 26 or 25.
