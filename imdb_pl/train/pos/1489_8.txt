In general, the movie is fine. I think it is better than Sepet and much better than Gubr in terms of its history, its sentimental value. <br /> <br /> There are several scenes that make me move. Yes, I agree that the boy (Mukhsin) played very well. Excellent. I can say that his acting is almost natural. <br /> <br /> However, the song "Ne Me Quitte Pas" by Nina Simone really "menaikkan" my "bulu" "roma". <br /> <br /> I love the song. Both songs. "Ne Me Quitte Pas" and "Hujan". I just downloaded the song. Beautiful. <br /> <br /> And I greet Yasmin. The final credit of the film makes me move again. We see how Yasmin really appreciated her parents in a unique way. <br /> <br /> I think that the movie deserves the Grand Prix of the International Jury at the Berlin Film Festival. <br /> <br /> I give 8.5 1o stars.
