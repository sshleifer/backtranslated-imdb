This is the best achievement from the period of Social Realism by Georg Wilhelm Pabst based on the tragedy of early 1906, which consumed the lives of nearly 1,100 French miners as a coal dust explosion deep in the mines of Courrieres in northern France after a three-week fire, finally releasing lethal drinking gas that led to fatalities. Estimated designer Erno Metzner creates raw sets that simulate tragedy, providing perception of reality, enriched with unmatched sound editing, with the only music produced by integral orchestras at the beginning and end of the work, for which the sound effects have the same meaning of the fascinating visuals of the outstanding director . The way of the "invisible edition" of Pabst, which reveals the action from shot to shot by the player's movements, turns out to be seamlessly integrated with this groundbreaking film, which also presents sophisticated photos using cameras mounted on vehicles, allowing the director to move between scenes without cutting. Although the cardinal theme of the work refers to socialist dogmas, in its details lies the unforgettable power of this film, born of the unflattering abilities of Pabst in combining many plot features into a tapestry cinema that arouses admiration for German rescue units whose homeland is very proud but despairing because of catastrophic losses for the families of French victims; certainly a breakthrough triumph that fully stimulates today for cineaste, as it was at the time of its first release.
