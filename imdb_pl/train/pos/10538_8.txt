I work in a movie shop and that's why I'm always looking for a great movie. I decided to check Nothing because he sat in our Canadian department and tried to support the film industry of my country. I was surprised. The film presents David Hewlett and Andrew Miller in a very funny story that seems to delve into our minds and relationships ... without hard work. It is consistently comedic through the interaction of two characters, as well as several fun exchanges ("We can not be dead, we have a cable!"). What's more, I can say without noticing that it is worth a shot, even if you abandon it in the first half hour.
