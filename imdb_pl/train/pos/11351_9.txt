An excellent movie. The whole picture was shot in Budapest, so I'm proud. My little problem was that the trains in the film belonged to the Hungarian State Railways (M√ÅV) and you can see that they were used in a large train, not in a local queue - according to the story that Chikatilo took from his victims local train stations . Besides, the movie is great.
