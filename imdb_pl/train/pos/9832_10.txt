Wow, it was a great Italian movie "ZOMBIE" by two great directors Luci Fulci ("ZOMBIE") and Bruno Mattie ("Hell of the Living Dead") Lucio started this film and he was sick, so the great Bruno took power and it turned out to be surprising better than I expected, so if you saw "HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD" directed by Bruno Mattie and saw "ZOMBIE" directed by Lucio Fulci and enjoyed both one and one of the motifs, this is the movie you have to watch has a great "ZOMBIE" makeup equal to the great look of "ZOMBIES" has a funny flying head "ZOMBIE"! And "ZOMBIE" birds that spit on you acid and turn into "ZOMBIE" (That Only Happed To Two) People, but these are mainly wonderful toxic "ZOMBIE", as in Bruno Matties "HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD". So if you like Italian movies "ZOMBIE" or simply "ZOMBIE", check out this movie. Italian movie "ZOMBIE"!
