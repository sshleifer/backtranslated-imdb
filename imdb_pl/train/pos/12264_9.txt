If you have a very close and long relationship with the world of Tintin ... do yourself a favor and watch this beautiful documentary about Hergé and his life creating Tintin. It is such a brilliant and very cool production. The whole story of Hergé and people, as well as many different situations, which he influenced, for good and for bad, is amazing. There is a very good and obvious relationship between the comic book and this one. I will definitely be digging up my Tintin albums in my basement. The film itself is also very well-spoken and has a great ambient sound. I really hope people will find it as intriguing as me!
