This potboiler, filmed in Hong Kong, has more melodrama than the weekly "The Young & The Restless". This one is rather a return to the original trilogy "Emmanuelle" (especially "Goodbye Emmanuelle") than D'Amato sleazefest. Chai Lee (Emy Wong) goes through a stunning transformation from a stupid nurse into a hot street. A future Italian porn star / politician, Illona Staller, who later goes under the name Ciccolina (and has sex with HIV positive John Holmes), plays in the Emy competition. Exotic locations and decent soft-core scenes. Recommended for fans of the original "Emmanuelle", which I am one!
