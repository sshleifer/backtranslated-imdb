A beautiful movie, pure Cassavetes style. Gena Rowland gives a stunning performance of a declining actress, dealing with success, aging, loneliness ... and alcoholism. He tries to escape from his subconscious ghosts, embodied by the ghost of death of a young girl. Accepting oneself, the human condition, although its general difficulties, is the real goal of the film. The parallelity of the theatrical sequences and the film itself is mysterious: it is as if the stage has become an output for Heroin. If all American films could only be of the highest quality, dealing with interpersonal relationships at the adult level, not trying to infantilize and standardize feelings ... One of the best dramas in history. 10/10
