Being the first feature film with Robert De Niro (though not released after years), it is worth a look. The role of De Niro is not huge, and at the same time fun as one of two friends who first try to prevent the marriage of other friends, but then they chase him to make him do it. Any ardent fan of De Niro will have a chance for an early performance probably of the best actor.
