This is a family film that is automatically disabled for some people. It seems that too many people do not want to watch movies that are not burdened with a lack of arms and legs, unjustified violence and enough curses to fill the New York phone book. This movie is not one of them. It's clich√©, it's a formula, but it's also fun. It does not require you to think, it does not require you to accept the movie as a reality. He just does what a good movie should do, that is, voluntarily suspend the disbelief for two hours and enjoy the adventure. The cast is good, not perfect. As another commentator remarked, the sound score of John Williams was, as usual, perfect. And the fact that a lot of film was shot in Huntsville on a real space camp made him even more credible. <br /> <br /> It was ironic that the original release of the film was delayed for several months due to the Challenger Shuttle, which could play a large part in its original theatrical opening, but the movie eventually helped concentrate the dreams of many young people back on the space and possibilities that are in them. SO sit with children and get ready for fun.
