Tonight I saw this movie at NYC in Landmark Sunshine. I did not know what to expect, I did not read too much about it, because I knew that I would see it no matter what. All in all, it is very well done. It does not focus on the generalization of "antiwar" claims that have left politics outside of me. The soldiers spoke mainly about their toxicity during training in the recruit camp and how hard it was when they returned to civilian life. It was really good to see Paul Rieckhoff and Camilo Mejia, who talked about the difficulties in surviving not only the war, but also refusing to issue an order to return when it was against personal morality. Make no mistake - this is not an anti-war movie. Anyone who says he has not seen it or does not live with war scars on their souls.
