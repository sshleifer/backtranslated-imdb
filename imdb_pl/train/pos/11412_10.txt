Two young girls, Mischa Barton as Frankie and Ingrid Uribe as Hazel play nicely and intelligently, although the story is imaginative. Young Hazel running after the mayor seems out of place, to be honest. <br /> <br /> While acting is well done by everyone interested, the film lacks the real atmosphere of the drama. Perhaps we have developed into reality in movies, just like comparing Pollyanna to How Green Was My Valley! It does not matter, each of them is good in its own way. <br /> <br /> I admire Joan Plowright, even if her role here is somewhat subordinate. The medium of road distractions is well suited for younger viewers and how nice it is to be exposed to excellent classical music, which is almost rare! <br /> <br /> I consider this movie a welcome change because it reflects the silence, thoughtful values ​​for years of growing up and non-violence thanks to God. An interesting family movie.
