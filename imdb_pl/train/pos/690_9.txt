I had no idea what the movie was about, and even I knew it existed until about 1 month ago when I came across the search for other films dominated by Dominic Monaghan. I thought that this movie was a strange insight into the mind of the sleeping person and what his mind can experience in the hours when they are awake, when the rest of the world sleeps around him, it was an interesting movie and a good part was played by the House ... .. I believe that even if this movie can not be bought anywhere (well, I have never seen it), you have to see it if you ever get a chance because it really makes you think about those people around us who can not sleep and have to suffer night after night, they were not able to sleep or they slept only one hour each night, so generally it was an interesting movie about good substance.
