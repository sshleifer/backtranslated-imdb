A serious comedy. Produced by Ross Hunter, the French version of "Les Joies de la famille" (later Americanized as "A Very Rich Woman") is plush, well manned, sometimes funny ... and unfortunately timeless. A rich Californian widow who seems to be wasting her money is stolen by her two grown-up, greedy daughters, who are afraid that Mama Rosie will carelessly release her legacy. The whole issue of an important - but older woman - woman sent home against her will, and later forced to prove that she is healthy at the trial, is a sensitive material for comedy (and for his recognition, director David Lowell Rich does not overload the image with the help of gags or obvious sentiments). Some of the humor is a bit broad and does not work, but Rosalind Russell understands the seriousness of this scenario and never gets a false note. Sandra Dee is also good as granddaughter of Rosalind, and James Farentino is charming as a young lawyer. The film has so much to say about the meaning of our elders and how they spend their time remaining, that the seriousness of the theme "Rosie!" Almost gets lost in a hurry to a happy ending. The image leaves you smile - and at the same time you wonder how old the ladies are who have never been so lucky. *** with ****
