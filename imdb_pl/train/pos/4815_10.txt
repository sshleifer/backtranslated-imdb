This is on my list of favorite movies of all time! It's a fantastic and insightful movie. It was historically interesting and great to watch! I thought Emily Blunt's acting was fantastic, and Rupert Friend was a fantastic Albert, Albert was the best actor. The costumes were great, and the settings and scenes, such as the opera, were amazing and detailed. I just loved it! I loved childhood scenes when John Conroy "persecutes." And where her mother says she has to go up the stairs with an adult. Once again, the writers did it! They produced this fantastic scenario! <br /> <br /> It deserves the rewards they have received. (Oscar and BAFTA win Sandy Powell for the costume design.) BAFTA for the best makeup and hair, Oscar in the best achievement in the direction of art, Best achievement in costume, Best achievement in makeup. awards for best actress Emily Blunt, CDG for perfection in costume design for the film - Hampton's International Film Awards for Best Audience Award, PFCS for best costume costume VFCC for best actress, Emily Blunt.) Total 10 wins and 11 nominations ! It's pretty good! http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0962736/awards See for yourself, it's really interesting! Personally, Rupert Friend should receive the prize.
