Well, it's time. I really gave up all hope that this season will be a special episode. Although there were still too many gray to hohum entries, at least this episode was good. It is quite funny that director Rob Schmidt, who has only a good Wrong Turn to his credit and writer John Esposito, whose only current scripts included Tale Of The Mummy and Graveyard Shift, should be the ones that give us the best written provoking episode of the season. In "Right To Die" we treat the story of Cliff and the abbey. At the beginning of the episode the couple is having a conversation. Abbey caught Cliff's imposter and desperately tries to get her back. During the conversation, they are in a car accident in which Cliff has only scrapes and bruises, but Abbey is thrown out of the car and burns when the spark ignites and the gasoline that drips on her burns. And these are just configuration people. After reaching the hospital, Cliff has to decide if the abbey should live in this condition without skin and only nervous reflexes. There is also a side effect. Whenever it falls, Abbey goes as a ghost and causes trouble for all people. Without a doubt, this is the best episode of the season and certainly is one of the best episodes in history. From the macabre effects to the strained script that he dropped into a few twists and turns that I've never seen, and a tangible tone that almost touches him, Right To Die should have the right to live forever.
