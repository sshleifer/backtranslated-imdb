Have you ever wondered where ideas for romance novels and other released documents come from? According to "Jake Speed" they are based on real people, they experience the adventures they write about and publish. This film is high-quality entertainment for the whole family, moderate violence and scant clothes in the worst case scenario. Language is also not a problem, and jokes are fun at all levels. This look of "Austin Powers" on "Indian Jones", without exaggerations of Michael Myers. I highly recommend this film for children between 10 and 15 years old.
