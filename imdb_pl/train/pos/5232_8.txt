This film is a journey through the mind of a scriptwriter caught in his own paradoxical philosophy. He always studies the illusory question of "who am I" and "what am I?" This is a bold and thought-provoking company. There is a load of beautiful paintings, inspired by sleep, paradoxes reminiscent of Escher, resembling the drawing of a hand, or rather erasing itself. More and more often we follow the writer in his agony over what to say and what to film, we see him calling the wife who went to Peru, leaving him care over his child, which he performs with less and less attention, until he is so absorbed dilemma that almost he does not look at the child anymore. His wife comes back and makes a scene, destroys notes and helps him cross the last threshold until he erases it himself. Intertwined with pictures that are pleasing to the eye and destroying, the story is mainly philosophical. It's about the Mayan veil, the world of illusion. The paradox of the film, however, is that he has to talk and think a lot to prove that thinking should stop. During more than two hours of provocative beauty and rapid philosophizing, the film made me want a silence or a shorter film. If this was the purpose of the creator, he succeeded quite well.
