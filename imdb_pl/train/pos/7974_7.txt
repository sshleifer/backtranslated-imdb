I consider this film a typical French tap in the face of America. The camera too often focuses on thick people, on slovenly homes and in tacky rural areas. While the narrative seems to be compassionate and admire people from a small town who are presented to the viewer, he uses them and humiliates them. Undoubtedly, there were slim people and decent organized houses in Glencoe, but Malle decided to show us the worst of what you could see. <br /> <br /> I can only hope that some American filmmakers will go to France to reveal to the American public its worst elements. I can assure you, as a frequent guest in France, that everything is not good there. Foreign immigrants are not easily assimilated, creating serious social inequalities. But Americans are not inclined to expose the French to their prejudices against their compatriots and to be jealous of the US, so we will probably not see films on the subject.
