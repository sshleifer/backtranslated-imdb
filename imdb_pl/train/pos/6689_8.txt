As a comic book reader who still sees himself as totally a child in the heart, I admit that I could have been somewhat biased towards this film. I mean, there has not been a good superhero movie for some time (NOTE: Batman Forever was NOT a good movie about superheroes). I really wanted this movie to be good and unlike most of my recent trips to the cinema (read the Blair Witch Project) I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> Mysterious men were definitely not effects, tension filled with action, it was a comedy. On this basis, he succeeded. Everyone laughed in a small theater, and applause and laughs in the last scene. Stiller and Garofolo are as funny as ever, and Azaria adds a bit of madness. William H. Macy plays a great simpleton, while Kel Mitchell and Paul Rubens, driven by farts, are only added to make the kids happy. <br /> <br /> Although the sets are bizarre (and sometimes they seem to be both Batman and Blade Runner), and some jokes are obvious, it's still just fun. There are several lines that will catch even the most tired viewer and bring tears of laughter among us. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie. Although it is not a classic classic, it is twice as funny as the latest Austin Powers. The magazine is good and the cast is GREAT. If you are worried, plan your morning and pay less, but in both cases you will be pleasantly surprised. I mean, who from time to time is not associated with losers?
