In 1948, it was my favorite movie of all time. Betty Grable costumes were so thrilling that I wanted to grow up to be and dress like that. Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., could not resist, like this magnificent Hungarian officer. Stupid and fluffy as this movie may appear at the beginning, when I was eight years old, it seemed to me that I would say something important about the relationship between men and women. I saw it again; I was surprised that it still is.
