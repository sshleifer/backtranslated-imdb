IN COLD BLOOD is masterfully directed and adapted by Richard Brooks. However, it is also so realistic that it is sometimes more clinical than entertainment. Talking about the brutal killing of the Midwestern family, the author Truman Capote focused on the trifles, wrapping himself and the reader in the subject and subjects! Brooks leaves wildly from this approach in favor of something closer. Although he films real places, he keeps a distance. The murderers are depicted as depraved by the imbeciles who were certainly there. They are not perceived as ill-understood souls (as in the book of Capote), and the wildness of their deeds is terrifyingly dull. Scott Wilson and Robert Blake are excellent killers, as well as the supporting cast, including John Forsythe and Paul Stewart as a reporter (the character of Capote?). The main photograph is the great Conrad Hall.
