This is one of those movies that you can meet while surfing the sewers on a Saturday afternoon. You get into it and watch the whole thing. I thought it was well done and I really felt that I can feel the characters. Although it is a bit slow, focusing more on the relationship between Bonnie and Clyde and their family members, it has never been boring. We really do not see too many robberies for which they were so legendary, and instead, most of the shootings take place when the police are ambushed. I thought that Tracey Needham, who played Bonnie, really did well with her character. The transition from a pretty village girl to a cold-blooded assassin is a difficult task to present, and I enjoyed the subtlety she brought to the role. made for a television film.
