Luchino Visconti was light years ahead of its contemporaries. The great directors of Italy from the 1940s and 1950s were men who understood the medium, but it was Luchino Visconti, a visitor, who dared to bring a film to show what he could do. He clearly shows his genius at the beginning of his outstanding career in "Ossessione," a film based on James Cain's "Postman Always Ring Twice," which was later created by Hollywood, but this version pales in comparison with what Visconti has achieved in the film. Luchino Visconti and his colleagues on the screen are unchanged Alberto Moravia, a man who knew about the impact of passion on people. <br /> <br /> The movie has been well-preserved in the last DVD format watched. The film is a must for all serious movie fans, because we can see how Visconti's vision translated the text into a movie that sounds genuinely reliable, which was missing in the American version. <br /> <br /> What's happening with watching a movie is the intensity that the director received from his key players. The wonderful Clara Calamai performs an amazing job as Giovanna, the woman who married an older man, but when Gino appears in her life, all she wants to do is get rid of the polite man who gave her a chance in life. Giovanna is one of the best performances in the works of Mrs. Calamai in the Italian cinema. The last sequence of the film shows Mrs. Calamai at its best in an ironic act that serves as a moral redemption for the monstrous crime that has been committed. <br /> <br /> Equally perfect is Massimo Girotti, one of the best actors of his generation, who appears as Gino, a hunky man who arouses an obsessive passion in Giovanna. Gino is the perfect man for Giovanna, something that Mr. Girotti designs with such ease and sophistication that was not previously on screen. Mr. Girotti makes a man come alive in a performance that seems so easy, but with another actor it may not be so obvious. Juan DeLanda is seen as Giuseppe, an older man who fell in love with Giovanna. In fact, his character rings more than his counterpart in the American movie, where he is perceived more as a buffoon. <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully photographed by Domenico Scala and Aldo Tonti. They gave the film a naturalistic look that was liked by Italian directors of the era. The original score of Giuseppe Rosati is perfect. Visconti, a man who loved opera and was one of the best directors, also includes the arias of Bizet and Verdi, which fit well into the context of the film. <br /> <br /> "Ossessione" is a film that should be appreciated because you see the great Luchino Visconti at the top of your form.
