Who knew they could be so funny? Christopher Meloni and Janel Moloney are known for their excellent work in the hottest television dramas. ("Law and order: SVU" and "The West Wing") Put them together on a big screen, and you'll get an engaging romantic comedy with lots of laughter. <br /> <br /> The actors develop a relationship story with impressive skills, leaving the audience in love with Barry Singer (Meloni), despite the fact that he is a stand-up comic book that also happens to be an upset sexist jerk. I will support him, despite taking all his insecurities with the opposite sex and chasing Thea (Moloney) in the middle of the country in the hope of winning her heart. They have little in common ... but when Barry finally opens his heart, you'll wonder why Thea is still running away. <br /> <br /> Souler Opposite is a great movie with an incredible cast and talented writer. Worth your time. <br /> <br />
