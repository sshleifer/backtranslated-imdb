I argue that no matter how much I search, I will never find a better version of the movie "Othello". If you love Kenneth Branagh's magnificent masterpieces "Much Noise about Nothing" (1993) and "Hamlet" (1996), just like I am dead, you will be sure that you will also find Oliver Parker's Othello. Laurence Fishburne has had many great roles in his career. He was great at "Boys n the hood" (1991) - I always considered his funny role of furious styles for his greatest achievement. Of course, before I saw it. <br /> <br /> He plays the role of Othello and is probably in the most demanding role in his entire career, but he does a great, fantastic job. Ir√®ne Jacob is absolutely charming Desdemona and Kenneth Branagh are simply phenomenal in the most fascinating role of the story curve, manipulate the villain Iago. The wonderful "Othello" is part of the absolute elite among the brilliant works of Shakespeare. He deals with his favorite subjects: tortuosity, envy, lies and jealousy. This film adaptation is certainly one of the best films I've seen, based on the plays of William Shakespeare.
