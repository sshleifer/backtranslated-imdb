First of all, I would like to say that I am a big fan of Sarah Silverman, and having other people who say it, and then jerk the pilot, is beyond me. Everything in the remote was in the typical form of Sarah Silverman, maybe it is not simply fun, but the situation and delivery matter. <br /> <br /> If you like Jesus is Magic, I do not see how you would not like it. It has the same flow and the same rhythm. This is only true for real fans, but if you are, you'll be happy. <br /> <br /> Again only for real fans, there is no way to do it. If you're not used to her style, you will not understand why it's funny. However, it is and I hope you think so too.
