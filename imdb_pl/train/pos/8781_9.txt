I consider myself a connoisseur of boxing movies and that is why there is only one thing that prevents me from calling "Gentleman Jim" the best boxing movie ever made. This is Robert Wise / Paul Newman's movie "Somebody likes me there". This film may be number 1, but "Gentleman Jim" is close to number 2. <br /> <br /> The film not only chronicles the rise of James J. Corbett, but also shows the sport of boxing a key time of transition. At the end of the nineteenth century, the box departed from the brutal days of naked rules to the more "gentlemanly" times of the Marquis of Queensbury Marquis. And sport has been moving away from the times when it was an illegal spectacle and to a time of acceptance and respect. <br /> <br /> "Jim's gentleman" in those days is not realistic. He is romantic and sometimes even a bit hokey. But always delightfully. Errol Flynn is perfect as a "gentleman" Jim, who is not really a "gentleman" but only a fast speaker from the working class. Alexis Smith is delightful as a woman from the upper class with whom she has love / hatred (and we all know that love will win this match in the end). <br /> <br /> At the end of "Gentleman Jim", the great John L Sullivan (whose famous line was NOT "I lick any man in the world" of course ... again romanticism) passes his belt to Corbett. It really is one of the best scenes in any sport movement. Realistic? No. But wonderful. Hey, if you want realism, look at the "Raging Bull". It's a much more realistic boxing movie. But "Gentleman Jim" is much more entertaining.
