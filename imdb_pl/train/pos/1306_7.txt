Extremely simple actor, played by cast and filmed by the director, who obviously took the material seriously. Imperfect, as you might expect from a film clearly shot in a tight budget, but the drama is involved - it's one of those films that, after repeating it on Cinemax 2 or More Max, or whatever it's called, ends with 40 minute blocks, when you have to go to work. Along W / "Deathstalker 2", "Chopping Mall" and "The Assault", a reminder that Wynorski is a much more talented director than many of his colleagues from low-budget brathels, who has real ability to walk a genre film, when he really is interested in the material (e.g. Do not worry about watching any of his Shannon Tweed movies with 3 or 4 titles!) Actors who have not had enough to do recently (Mancuso, Ford, even Gary Sandy for chrissakes) have really put in some of their best roles for years - as in the case of Grieco, he has the right appearance, although his acting is a bit monotonous - it is clear that his character is to be self-destructive film all the time, but Grieco does not transmit it. I checked IMDB and see that the writer also wrote for the director of "Sorority House Massacre 2" and "Dinosaur Island" - both small classics, but of course "stupid" Roger Cormon-like Cinema - it resembles some of the better B photos of Jonathan Demme and Jonathan Kaplan from the 1970s - it gives an operational element, but at the same time offers dramaturgy - a real step forward. Not the "Citizen Kane" and the comic last moments are somewhat destructive, but well-written, driven by the heroes above-average action actor. Small achievements such as this should not be overlooked when they appear, which is a rarity (as I was reminded when I tried to sit through Albert Heat's monster called "Heatseeker" that night - it's low budget things are not as easy as it looks) but that's another story!)
