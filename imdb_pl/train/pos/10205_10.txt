I remembered the case, it was behind the box with the movie that I thought I was borrowing, I did not find out until I came home and watched it. Absolutely fantastic! great movie and one of my three favorite favorites of all time, I recommend it to everyone! <br /> <br /> The story is pleasant and easy to follow, it could be easily mixed up, but the director's actors do a great job holding it together. <br /> <br /> The actors themselves are fantastic, they show a great character and do a great job. <br /> <br /> I need to find a copy somewhere ...
