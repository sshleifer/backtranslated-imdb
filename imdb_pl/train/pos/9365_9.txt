I saw it also at the show last night. I was absolutely delighted with how much the movie was better than I expected. Few films can combine the dark comedy and the current drama of events, and not disintegrate in the conclusion. <br /> <br /> I am not bothering to rewrite the plot too much, because I think you know less about this movie makes it much better. But let me say that Adam Sandler's performance was really refreshing and real. He was funny and much more fun than most of his last comedies. Don Cheadle was always credible. <br /> <br /> This movie is not funny, like Borat or Billy Madison, but it has a good pace. I would say that 90% of the audience would laugh at most of the movie. In the middle of the movie, he slows down to deal with the dramatic end of things and he's really good at it. <br /> <br /> I also thought it was really cool, instead of playing the whole black friend / white friend whom they decided to ignore and focus on the relationships themselves.
