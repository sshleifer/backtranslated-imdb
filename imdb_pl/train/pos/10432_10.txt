I must admit that at the beginning I was a little reluctant to watch this movie. I thought it was this stupid little romantic movie about a French woman who meets on a train with an American girl and decides to visit Vienna with him. Actually, I was not impressed with this kind of script because it still made me believe that it was just a movie. Even so, I watched it! And I was amazed ... "Before sunrise" is one of the few movies that dare to speak more philosophically, reflecting on the fact that at the moment of our birth we are doomed to death or that it is an average idea that the couple should rest together for eternity, or that we humans can sometimes afford to live in fairy tales. <br /> <br /> The ending was wonderfully chosen (we do not know if they will meet again in six months, at six o'clock, at the Viennese station) - in our optimism we sincerely hope. The actors behaved in a very good way, so I started to believe that I, myself, can experience such a love story.
