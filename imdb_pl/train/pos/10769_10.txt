I love Monte Carlo and I really liked this movie. I thought everyone was very good. I did not know Richard Lewis, I thought he made his character (Julian Peters) very engaging, funny and attractive. Sean Young was very good as a dreamy rejected girl with a golden heart. George Hamilton was a charming and perfect Italian gigolo. John Candy has a field day as bon vivant. James Belushi is hysterical as a total jerk. Cybill Shepard gave a very sweet performance as a nice, defenseless ignored housewife. A great cast of the band. Lots of talent, a smart scenario, a lot going on and beautiful locations. It's nice to pick me up for a gloomy day. Especially in winter, when the trip to Europe is nowhere on the horizon.
