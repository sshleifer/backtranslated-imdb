After seeing the horrible, horrible, terrible BATMAN: DEAD END, I knew that I had to see it when I heard about it. <br /> <br /> Pressing the game to see the trailer, I thought I was in another hideous short of what so far looked like another evil, would-be filmmaker trying to bring a new depth to the existing character. But instead, he was greeted with the BIG trailer of the film, which unfortunately does not exist, because I would like to see a finished movie, even if it only lasted 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> THE BEST FOR THE BATMAN FOR BATMAN: DEAD END, and then a little bit. <br /> <br /> I can not wait for the next shortcut!
