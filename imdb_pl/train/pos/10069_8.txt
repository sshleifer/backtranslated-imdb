This film is worth seeing for visual beauty and moving alone, but there is also an interesting cultural subgenesis of alienation. Women and performers (both gathered as a supporting transvestite operatic star) are doomed to be pushed to subordinate roles in China. This makes the unlikely bond between the older street performer and the younger girl even stronger as a triumph over native culture. <br /> <br /> The only problem I had with this movie was the tendency of the soundtrack to grow larger, unnecessary emotions performed by the actors. <br /> <br /> A welcome alternative to unsatisfying summer action movies.
