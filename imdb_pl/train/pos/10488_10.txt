After an Oscar nomination in Brenda's "Secrets and Lies", Blethyn starred in the equally wonderful "Saving Grace". And let me tell you, this is not a movie that can be found every day. <br /> <br /> After her husband commits suicide, Grace Trevethyn (Brenda Blethyn) discovers that her irresponsible financial decisions have left her with a huge debt. Fortunately, he finds a way to make ends meet: marijuana. That's right, Grace is starting to grow it. <br /> <br /> Every aspect of this movie was played with great effect; There is no boring moment anywhere. And I certainly have not seen the upcoming final scene! But in any case, you must see this movie. After watching this, you can feel a little more festive. If nothing else, it can be a good lesson about knowing your finances. But of course there is much more in it!
