We do not have to lose this movie, it's one of the biggest I've ever seen. Jean Pierre Leaud is amazing (more than usual), and the movie is one of the most unforgettable in nouvelle vogue. Jean Eustache is no longer on this earth, we only have black and white paintings to remember one of the greatest and most respected French directors. You just have to love this masterpiece. I will never forget it. <br /> <br /> P.: I apologize for English ...
