This film was nominated for the best shot, but lost to Casablanca, but Paul Lukas defeated Humphrey Bogart as the best actor. I do not understand why Lucile Watson was nominated for the best supporting actor, I just do not think she'll do a very good job. Bette Davis and Paul Lukas and their three children leave Mexico and come to the United States in the first scene of the film. They travel by train to Davis relatives' house. Davis and Lukas were in the underground to stop the Nazis, so they are very tired and need a rest. But when they come back home, their Nazis live there and they can not do much about it. It turns out that the Nazis only care about money and are ready to make a deal with Lukas. It's more than a story, but you can find out about it.
