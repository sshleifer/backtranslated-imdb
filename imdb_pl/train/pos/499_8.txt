The Enterprise pilot has one thing that has been missing since the original Star Trek: a dose of realistic, defective personalities. Utopian figures of the next generation became tiresome, they were so noble that they were unbelievable. I also like the sub-thread that people are bitter towards Vulcan. It's funny to see them as pretentious snobs. It makes me wait for people to become the dominant race between them, although I do not think it will work during the show. The only negatives that jumped on me were "fast cut off the end after 2 hours", which is common among many concerts at Trek. The second was the shameless excavation for evaluating several pointless sexy scenes. It was out of place, a good science fiction series should be able to stand alone without trying to hide some teenage skin. But it's not my job to make the program profitable, so well. <br /> <br /> Let's see how the next episode is done.
