What a great film ... <br /> <br /> Accompanied by the Oscar-winning composer RACHEL PORTMAN of lush, emotional and dreamy music, this film remains a pure delight worth watching more than once a year. <br /> <br /> Incredible casting ... <br /> <br /> Gwyneth Paltrow was perfect for the role of Emma. Toni Collette was great as Harriett Smith. <br /> <br /> The character who stole the movie is MISS BATES !!! She hypnotized to watch, she found herself on the edge of her chair, she just kept to her every word and she laughed hysterically with her. One of the most endearing characters I have met for centuries. From one of the opening scenes, when he thanks Mr. Woodhouse for sending this "lovely quarter of pork ... HUSK, MOTHER !!!" he yells to his daffy and clearly handicapped mother, Mrs Bates (played by mother Emma Thompson, Phyllida Law), who it looks abandoned and lost. <br /> <br /> The comical ways Emma would avoid Ms. Bates's embarrassing builds on one of the truly thrilling scenes at a picnic, when Emma insults Miss Bates, who cruelly kicks in her heart. Then we see stuttering poor Miss Bates and on the verge of tears and so crushed that you can not help but feel her heart breaking in her name. This is a classic scene that has to be scrolled and played over and over again ... <br /> <br /> The ending ends with "Sense & Sensibility" and is one of the greatest lessons about how to marry someone's best friend ... <br /> <br /> I hope this movie will delight you all the same as me. <br /> <br /> HAVE ADOPTED IT!
