Sometimes I watch a movie and I am impressed by it? and it is still not easy to explain why I liked it so much. This mainly applies to unusual movies? those that are hard to compare with the rest. Good night Mister Tom is one of those special movies. Is there a lot of emotions in this movie? and the acting was so good that when I watched the movie, I cried and laughed when the story unfolded. Young Nick Robinson ?? is a young boy (William) evacuated from London because of raid there during World War II. Tom, played by John Thaw, is an old man leaving the village where the evacuees were sent. <br /> <br /> Initially, Tom refuses to take any responsibility - for example, taking care of a restless boyfriend? but he accepts because he has no choice. During his stay, Mr. Tom discovers how awful William's life was? beside his luggage, my mother sent a belt and wrote instructions to her son's host? Do not hesitate to use it. This belt is berried in the field? You should never use it in such a brutal way. Mr. Tom provides real home to William, and the boy is happy with his new life, goes to school, makes new friends and discovers hidden talents. Suddenly, William's letter is called home in London with a letter saying he is not feeling well? And it starts again? Only this time is worse? There are many feelings in this film? love, fear, sadness, happiness, pain, hope? and a lot more. Good night Mr. Tom is another masterpiece of British cinema comparable only with others, such as Dear Frankie and Billy Elliot ?? if you want to compare. I really enjoyed watching and I highly recommend it. Before the end of the review I would also like to mention the great performance of Thomas Orange as Zaca reminded me of my friend from my childhood (:
