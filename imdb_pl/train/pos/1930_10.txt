This movie is funny, original and beautifully directed. I became a group of BIG BAD SWIM, following her at film festivals always and everywhere. I've seen it half a dozen times and every time an enthusiastic reaction of the audience confirmed my feeling that it is one of the best films that will appear for years. Almost every festival he showed was sold out or won an audience award. It's obvious that people love this movie, and even more clearly why they do it. The pictures are great, the characteristics and acting are brilliant, the ending is fantastic and the direction full of compassion, wisdom and the art of perfect timing. It is hard to believe that this is Ishai Setton's first film. I hope it will be released soon so that everyone can see it.
