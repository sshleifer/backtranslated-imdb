ANCHORS AWEIGH is a funny MGM musical that will appeal to fans of the genre, but I would not rate it there with classics such as SINGIN IN THE RAIN or THE BAND WAGON. It was the first of three musicals in which Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra performed. Kelly and Sinatra play Joe Brady and Clarence Doolittle, two seafarers on vacation in Hollywood who make friends with a young boy (Dean Stockwell), who introduces them to his attractive young aunt (Kathryn Grayson), a fighting actress who works as an extra person in MGM. Although both guys are initially interested in Grayson, he eventually prefers Joe, but Clarence later makes contact with the waitress (Pamela Britton) who, he finds out, comes from his hometown of Brooklyn. The paper-thin plot leaves room for some great musical numbers, including "We Hate to Leave", lamenting Joe and Clarence to fellow sailors when they leave the ship; Grayson's violent translation of "Jalousie"; Sinatra's sleepy interpretation of "I Fall in Love Too Easily" (a number that is unfortunately removed from some of the prints) and "The Worry Song", a fancy dance that Kelly performs with animated Jerry the Mouse from fame Tom and Jerry. Kelly also performs a kind of Kissing Bandit fantasy ballet that competes with his Pirate Ballet in later THE PIRATE. Kelly is in top form here, in a strong and energetic performance that brought him an Oscar nomination for the best actor, and Sinatra's seemingly shy character is undeniably sexy. A funny diversion for fans of the MGM music factory.
