It happened to me to catch this film at a show in Brooklyn - it's difficult to describe the plot; he has a lot of crazy characters, but let's say it's hard for me to choose which one of them made me laugh the most, I would not know where to start. Even peripheral roles are well-written and well-preserved. <br /> <br /> There are many little things that make it unique and very pleasant, it has a few "devices" that appear and add another funny layer. It's refreshing to look; not some recycled materials that I've seen many times. If this movie could reach a wider audience, I'm sure it would be a real crowd enthusiast, the story is so original and honest. <br /> <br /> There is a lot to like, funny stories, blunders and misunderstandings that create the final act and dramatic conclusion. Cross Eyed is a very funny movie with a heart; It's a touching story with a fast comedic tempo. It's definitely worth seeing!
