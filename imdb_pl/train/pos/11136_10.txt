"Midnight Cowboy" is one of those films that have been considered a masterpiece for a good reason - it is one of the best films in American history. It is both artistically correct and fully accessible and commercial. No wonder that after the first release it turned out to be a great success. But be careful, this is also one of the most thrilling movies ever made. The heroes are memorable, well-developed and ultimately tragic. Filmmakers should be applauded for not giving us the end of Hollywood, which was basically mandatory in the 80's. That's why I value the years 1967-1977 in the American film. This is the time when well-made, innovative and above all gloomy films can be made with the large budgets that Hollywood can offer. All this ended when "Star Wars" appeared. <br /> <br /> The direction of John Schlesinger makes the material work. It combines simplified style with experimental editing. Unlike many other films containing these psychedelic effects, "Midnight Cowboy" has aged quite well. It is still as powerful as after the first release. Acting, however, is what makes this masterpiece. Backgrounds of heroes are never fully explained, but their performances make them completely developed. Both Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman are absolutely memorable and sympathetic (despite their sometimes reprehensible actions). Besides, being a fan of classic exploitation movies, I loved the scenes taking place on the infamous 42nd street. "Midnight Cowboy" is close to perfection and is one of the most powerful films in history. (10/10)
