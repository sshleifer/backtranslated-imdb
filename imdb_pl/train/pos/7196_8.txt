As a series, go to "Zorro's Fighting Legion" is one of the best action series from the thirties. Made during the period when the studios could still cast a large cast, this one has a "wall to wall" action for 12 chapters. <br /> <br /> In 1824, the president of the newly created Republic of Mexico, Benito Juarez (Carleton Young), is trying to put his new country on a solid financial basis. To this end, he arranged to send rich gold shipments to the capital from the local San Mendolita mine. <br /> <br /> The members of the commune are to steal the parcel on behalf of Don-del-Oro and the golden armed god who, with the help of the local tribe, Yaqui, hopes to become the ruler of Mexico. He is against Don Francisco (Guy D'Ennery) who creates a legion of locals to help Juarez. When don Franciso is murdered by the people of Don-del-Oro, a stranger, don Diego (Reed Hadley) arrives in the city. Diego aka Zorro takes over the legion with the help of his friends Ramona (William Corson) and Juan (Budd Buster). The symbolic heroine of the song is Ramona's sister, Volita (Sheila D'Arcy). <br /> <br /> Both Diego and Ramon occupy positions in the local ruling Counsil. It soon turns out that some other members of the Council are in cahoots with Don-del-Oro. First, the president of the Council (Leander de Cordova), head of the militia Manuel (John Merton), chief judge Pablo (C. Montague Shaw) and Gonzolez (Edmund Cobb). Zorro suspects that one of these people is Don-del-Oro, but who? <br /> <br /> Here are some escapes from Zorro's hair and his confederates from the supporters of Don-del-Oro. We always have a collapsing rope bridge, a deep abyss between two cliffs, over which only Zorro can jump safely, and an ordinary assortment of explosions, fires and coaches and cars crashing against the cliff. Hats off to the magnificent stunt team of the Republic led by the legendary Yakima Canutt and Yrigoyens, Bill and Joe. Canutt performs his stunt stunt in a team of fleeing horses, and then falls under the carriage, which he repeated in other films, including in Stagecoach by John Ford in the same year. <br /> <br /> In any case, Zorro finally exposes the false god Don-del-Oro and restores peace in the valley before heading into the sunset in chapter 12. <br /> <br /> Others in the cast are Jim Pierce, Curley Dresden and Charlie King as people of Don-del-Oro, and if you look closely, you can see pieces of the future star of the show and Lone Ranger Clayton Moore and stuntman Canutt in pieces. By the way, "Big" Jim Pierce can best be remembered for playing Tarzana in 1927 "Tarzan and the Golden Liom" (1927) and for a marriage with Joan Burroughs, the daughter of the creator of Tarzan Edgar Rice Burroughs. <br /> <br /> Very pleasant.
