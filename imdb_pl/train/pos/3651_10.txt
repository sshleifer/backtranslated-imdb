Pandora's clock is one of the best thrillers you'll ever read and it's one of the best thrillers you'll ever see. A very faithful adaptation of the novel by John J. Nance, which had a terribly real script in the novel, becomes even more here. <br /> <br /> Despite being designed for television, this is the best entertainment. The cast is great and falls into a character from the novel so well that one would think that they are reading a novel. Richard Dean Anderson goes beyond the shadow of Macgyver and gives the best results of his previous career. Jane Leeves has a great role as an assistant ambassador in a role that proves that she can be a great dramatic actor. Daphne Zuniga is great as Dr. Sanders and despite the fact that the character is a man in the book, he works very well. Robert Loggia, Edward Herrmann, Robert Guillaume and the rest of the cast are top-notch and match their innovative counterparts. <br /> <br /> Of course, changes in history (including a small change in the end), but these changes are better than in the novel. The story is realistic and I believe in the way it was presented, which makes it the best film from a series of aircraft since the original movie at the airport. The production values ​​are high and although the special effects may look as good as they did a decade ago, they work well. The sets are great, especially the CIA and Oval Office, showing that the developers have spent a lot of time doing this job. <br /> <br /> It does not matter if you see it first and read it, then you read the novel each other. Just do both, and you will not regret losing four hours for this movie and how long it will take you to read the novel. It will make you breathless.
