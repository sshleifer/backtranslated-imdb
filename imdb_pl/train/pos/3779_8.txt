I got the first Bill and Ted movie for Christmas and I had to get the second one when I saw him in the store. This one was (I think) as funny as the first, but a stranger story. The funny thing was that they had their own peculiar hell and they had to play death. The funny thing was that they played silly little games, like a tip. The only thing I would change was that Station and Death are in the band, but otherwise it was great.
