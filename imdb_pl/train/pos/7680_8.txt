"Holly" is a film based on problems, but it is neither manipulative nor too sentimental. His heart is a movie based on characters that would not be so effective without the spiritual portrayals of Patrick (Ron Livingston), a lost soul with a gradually awakening conscience, and Holly (Thuy Nguyen), a strong will, but eventually a matched young Vietnamese. From lively places and photos to effective editing - everything is honest and well made. The contemporary classical score may initially scare away a little, but it is a top-class composition and emphasizes the admirable reticence that is visible throughout the text. This film, which raises many issues, but provides some unequivocal answers, ultimately manages to raise awareness and compassion for Holly and many people who share her fate. Recognition for those who have managed to do it.
