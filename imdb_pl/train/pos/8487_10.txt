I remember watching "Gung Ho" as a child with my mother and wondering why she always cried for the last few minutes. Of course, the whole movie was fun for me, especially the mannerisms of the heroes. It was only when I was much older and watching him again that I realized how deep the program is. <br /> <br /> Michael Keaton and Gedde Watanabe shine in the role of unwilling mediators. Keaton ceases to amaze me with his real style of supplying the line, and Watanabe adds humor and pathos to the mix. I also thought that Patti Yasutake (Umeki) was simply fantastic in the role of a comic. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is one of the most underrated films of the 80's. We can all learn lessons from the combination of American and Japanese employees in this movie ... sometimes you can * really * have 'the best of both worlds'. And now I understand why my mother felt like in those closing moments. I would also prefer to have one of these cars.
