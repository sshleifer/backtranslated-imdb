In the thirties, the studios used short films such as this as a testing ground for new actors, given their relative ease of production compared to full-length feature films, so it is interesting to play Shirley Temple, which has long been established itself as the best-known star of all time. On the other hand, it probably was not the one that was tested, I imagine it would be Frank Coghlan Jr. who played Brother Shirley Sonny in the movie and provided relatively less impressive performance. On the other hand, 9-year-old Shirley Temple was probably not an easy accompanying act. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with Gaga's unbelievable sight with a leaky ceiling, which I think Shirley Temple intended to cast a contemptuous glance at the ceiling, illustrate the working class's status in the film and ensure a clear transition to the next scene, where Shirley happily stomps in the rain. <br /> <br /> It's Sonny "Birthday, and his father makes sporadic and terribly unsuccessful attempts to hide the fact that he wants to give Sonny the dog he really wants for himself, but Sonny is afraid of dogs because he bit him once and he was terrified from. It is interesting that when his father insists on getting a dog, Sonny decides to run away from home, instead of having a dog at home, and because he escapes aimlessly in sight, it is also interesting that the film illustrates what seems to be indifference to homeless, which exceeds even the amazing indifference that exists today. <br /> <br /> Sonny passes a man cooking bacon on an iron skillet on the side of the railway tracks (just after the train, which, considering how close the tracks are, you would think that he would blow a guy off the tracks, but no matter what) . After Sonny resigns from sharing breakfast because of a sour look, which his happy smile receives from a guy, he continues, and the homeless disappears from the movie. It is interesting to think about what a longer movie would do, because it leaves this poor guy as a loose end. <br /> <br /> It does not matter, Sonny soon hears the dog whimpering under the goat as he passes by and jumps down to find a dog with barbs. It may seem trivial that he immediately takes the dog and accepts it because he just left home because of fear of dogs, but it seemed to me that he simply had to be reminded of his power over the dogs, but of their lack of power over him. As soon as he saw the dog in need, he overcame his fear. <br /> <br /> Hey, if that's all you need, all I have to do is find a helpless spider and I'm set! <br /> <br /> This is a very convenient movie where everything works exactly as it should, but it's cool enough and nice enough (and short enough) to keep it fun. We do not expect an epic storyline in a 19-minute film anymore, but Pardon My Pups still packs a significant amount of history and character development in a short time. At the end of the movie there is a fight scene that must have made Charlie Chaplin proud. I'm not an expert on Shirley Temple movies, but it's not hard to see how she became the most famous star of all time.
