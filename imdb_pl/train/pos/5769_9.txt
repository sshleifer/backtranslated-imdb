Will you all want to put hell of Todd's cards!?! Let's give you $ 30,000 to make a movie and see what you come up with! The guy got 735 zombies and regular cast for free! Sure, acting is sometimes funny. Yes, makeup is not the best you will ever see. But that's also not the worst, if you want to see it, watch the Zombie Nation with zombie boobs. <br /> <br /> It's pure, old-fashioned Guerilla production! Todd is a seasoned professional and a nice guy. There are holes on the plot, yes. The story seems stretched. But hell, I still love this movie. I would like Todd Sheets to come out of hiding and remake what he intended. If you've ever tried to make a movie, you know that just completing it is an achievement in itself.
