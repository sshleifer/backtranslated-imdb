Like TALK RADIO, THE BOOTH is basically predictable (TALK RADIO, because we know the truth about what happened, THE BOOTH because - let's face it - genre and basic configuration). In this case, it is not necessarily a bad thing. This means, in essence, that the filmmakers did not finally shoot as they would, say, in the American version of the story. THE BOOTH is relentlessly approaching his (pre-forgotten) application, but it is so beautifully made on every level that you can enjoy the ride in the way you could travel on a famous cruise (very picturesque). It reminds me of the horrible story of Harlan Ellison, FLOP SWEAT. Claustrophobia is sometimes almost palpable. Worth a nice, long look.
