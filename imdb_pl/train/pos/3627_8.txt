What a funny movie! I was expecting a sad movie for children and found that I liked it more than teenagers. Take a handkerchief, it is not sad, it only "moves" in parts. Finally, it is a "good feeling" for the whole family. Note: it's over 2 hours, so consider leaving the smallest "squirmers" for it. AP
