Freddy Krueger returns to the dreamed persecutor from Wiązów Street, the great character actor Robert Englund returns in the sequel of the nightmare 5, the dreamed child. I hope that I have correctly received the number. There were so many of them, and this is one of the best, especially for episodes by: Rosanne Barr (then Arnold) tom Arnold, johnny depp, (who made the first nightmare in 84) alice cooper (singer) you will see Freddy as tormented a child, a teenager who loves pain and a family guy (frightening) effects are very funny and creative, in the cast there are also Lisa Zane (sister of Billy) breckin Meyer (car trip) yaphet kotto (alien, live and die) and Amanda Donahue (father knows best) I was one of the people who saw it in 3D and also ending. I love 3D movies. I missed the first 3d wave in 1953 (I was not born yet). The second wave took place in 1983. Like all Freddy's films. this one stands out as one of the better, not counting the first, who was absolutely brilliant, Freddy became a new monster of the 80s and 90s, with Jason voorhees, chucky, micheal myers and leather face.can you imagine a movie with everyone? I recommend it to all Freddy's fans and horror fans.
