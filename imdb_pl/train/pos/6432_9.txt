Thanks to intelligent script and stable hand Writer / Director Kevin Meyer "Perfect Alibi" is a funny and very nice secret thriller. The film starts methodically and creates a pair when the tips begin to reveal that nothing is what it seems. Teri Garr and Hector Elizondo are wonderful when they join forces to unravel the mystery, reminding me of Nick and Nora Charles from the movies "Thin Man". Kathleen Quinlan is great as the tormented wife of Alex McArthur and the roles of characters played by veterans Charles Martin Smith, Bruce McGill, Anne Ramsey and Estelle Harris are well made and provide plenty of momentum in time. There's even Rex Linna's cameo. In total, I felt like I was reading a good book by the fire.
