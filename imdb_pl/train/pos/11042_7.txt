Four prisoners are in prison in a cell: Carrère (Gérald Laroche), who used his company to commit a fraud and was betrayed by his wife; drag Lassalle (Philippe Laudenbach) and his protégé, late Pâquerette (Dimitri Rataud), who ate his six-month-old sister; and intellectual Marcus (Clovis Cornillac) who killed his wife. One night Carrère finds an ancient magazine hidden in a hole in the cell wall. They realize that the book was written by Danvers (Geoffrey Carey) at the beginning of the last century and concerns black magic. They decide to read and use its content to escape from prison when they find out the truth about Danvers' fate. "Maléfique" is an original, intriguing and claustrophobic French low-budget horror. The story is practically in the same place, there are no stereotypes and it attracts the viewer's attention to the last scene. I am a big fan of French cinema, usually romances, dramas and police stories, but I've noticed that recently I've seen some good French horror movies like "Un Jeu d 'Enfants", "Belphegor" and "Dead End". My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'Sinais do Mal' ('Signs of evil')
