The usual cat and mouse antics abound until Jerry jumps into a bottle of invisible ink. He gets a great idea of ​​torturing Tom without his knowledge. The cat becomes wise and tries to do things to "see" jerry, even if it is not stupid evidence. Of course, Jerry gets Butch known as Killer aka Spike the dog (even if it's late in short, and his contribution is minimal) Brilliant animated short, which in a sense reminded me of the one with a white mouse that terrifies Tom so much. Most of the gags are active and violent, just as every good short moment should be. This fun drawing can be found on the "Tom & Jerry" album from the Spotlight DVD collection "<br /> <br /> My class: B +
