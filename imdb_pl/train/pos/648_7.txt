I decided to watch it because of the recommendations from this site. I must say it was worth it. However, keep in mind that this movie will last 210 minutes. If you do not have the strength, get it on tape and watch it for a few nights. <br /> <br /> Now, in the film, what I say will contain "spoilers", and if not the mind, here goes: <br /> <br /> Alexandre is a lofty vagabond, womanizer and gigolo. He lives with an older woman named Marie. Marie owns a retail store and provides Alex. Alex spends time in cafes and restaurants. History reveals that Alex previously impregnated Gilberte, with whom he once lived. Gilberte tossed him to a less attractive man she did not love because Alex had mistreated and mistreated her. At this point Alex was ready to take up a job and help raise his child before he found out that Gilberte had stopped working and was planning to marry someone else. <br /> <br /> By chance, Alexandre meets with a nanny nurse called Veronika and have a relationship with them. Veronika fell in love with Alex for the first time after this horrible sex she had with men in the past. Marie and Veronika are struggling with Alex's feeling and have ménage à trois. Finally, it turned out that Veronika was pregnant with Alex's baby, and Alex asked her to marry him. We assume (as mentioned in the Gilberte situation) that Alexandre will get a job and become a supplier for her newly found love and family. There is hope! <br /> <br /> With the title "La Maman et la putain", I inferred that Jean Eustache referred to the figure of Veronica Françoise Lebrun. She was a whore, and then she became a mother. Therefore, mother and whore are the same person? Anyway, what do I know! French films are mostly (not all) very talkative, aimlessly political, preaching, theatrical, bland, lamenting and full of quotes. Lebrun and Léaud played well with their stubborn characters and kept the film together because part of the script became a bit confused and chaotic. <br /> <br /> Nice effort. 7/10.
