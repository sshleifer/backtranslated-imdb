There is no point in telling stories because it has been done by enough reviewers. Here are some different slants from one of these "religious nuts", as one fanatical reviewer tolerates that. <br /> <br /> 1) "Baby Face" (1933) is probably a classic example that has ever been filmed about how women can manipulate men through sex. There is a lot of truth in what Barbara Stanwyck demonstrates in this film: look sweet, do not throw eyelashes, offer your body for free ..... and men will turn over to help you whatever you want. > <br /> In this case, it was about promotion with the final goal of the money ..... a lot. At least four men in this movie assures it, even if it destroys their lives in this process. <br /> <br /> 2) The ending - which many reviewers seemed to hate - gives another great news: all money and material goods in the world will not make people feel satisfied. A sad comment that so many "critics" would prefer to have immoral messages, preferring insanity over content. No wonder, I think. <br /> <br /> Whatever you look at it, the movie is fun at first, and Stanwyck has some great lines, especially at the beginning when he talks about his primitive father and his unruly bar customers. At just over 70 minutes, this movie moves at a fast pace and ends before you know it.
