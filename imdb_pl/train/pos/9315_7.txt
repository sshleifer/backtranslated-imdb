Outstanding attorney Walter Pidgeon deals with the murder of pro bono, wins the acquittal and discovers that his client (Keefe Braselle) was not only guilty, but also part of the extortion ring, reaching the highest parts of the city. Under the influence of his own complicity, he undertakes an investigation, finds the identity of an "unknown man" who heads the syndicate and murders him. <br /> <br /> Ironies get involved when Braselle is accused of this second murder and Pidgeon must defend him, pointing to the existence of another "unknown man" - himself. The Unknown Man, although slightly smaller than the urban character and long rhetoric, belongs to the noir cycle with less style or structure than recognition of the ubiquitous corruption of American urban policy, which came to light in the post-war years.
