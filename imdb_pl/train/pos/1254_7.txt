Ed Harris's work in this film is consistent with his standard of excellence, i.e. Steal the screen away from everyone he shares with, including powerful Sean Connery. The film, which is a bit more saintly, comes alive only in the scenes when Harris is interrogated by a lawyer for another convict. It's breathtaking, the master class in artistic control. <br /> <br /> The other cast members are adepts, and Connery is reliable, like Fishbourne, but the story itself has nothing. The plot depends largely on the assumption that a black prisoner will always be treated badly and forced by white law enforcement officers. It is a motor that drives the plot, good or bad, and makes you feel a bit cheated at the end. <br /> <br /> It's still worth watching to see Harris in action.
