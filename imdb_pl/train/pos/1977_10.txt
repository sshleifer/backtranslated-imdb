I really love this movie. I remember that when I was in class 2, my teacher showed us on a 16mm film tape. This film, however, can be a bit scary for second graders, such as the scene in which Bill murders Nancy and sees Fagin's face for the first time on the screen. One of my relatives has had enough of watching this movie because she studied it in the music class. If I was a teacher and I could judge the people who produced this great movie, I would give them A +.
