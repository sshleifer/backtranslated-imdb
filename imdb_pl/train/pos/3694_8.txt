I was not sure what to expect from this movie, given its amazing collection of stars and directors, but it did not disappoint. <br /> <br /> For me one of the main attractions was the last episode with an American tourist talking with a terrifying French accent (which made me feel better with mine), which was quite moving and a great way to end the movie. <br /> <br /> The history of the paramedic and victim of stabbing was also very moving, and for the clean comedy Coen Brothers and Steve Buscemi receive the prize. Tom Tykwer's clip was also impressive, though rather ambitious in its scope. <br /> <br /> However, Bob Hoskins' segment was completely valuable, and the vampire's story was completely farce. Dialogue in Wes Craven's section was also very forced, and Chinatown's story was completely incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> In total, this movie is worth watching for good pieces and has a strong finish. It is not too painful to sit in bad sections - and so they last only 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> Ca vaut la peine !!!
