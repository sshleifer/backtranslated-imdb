My first Fassbinder was a great experience. Film and alternative cinema (a small hall, with uncomfortable seats, the audience had to wait until the filmrolls were changed) were perfectly matched. <br /> <br /> There were a lot of cliches in the film, but Fassbinder introduced them so cleverly that I found them really funny. The sound was also brilliant (sometimes it came back louder than dialogue). <br /> <br /> Everything seemed to be in the right place. And I loved the way postwar times were presented. Real fun! <br /> <br />
