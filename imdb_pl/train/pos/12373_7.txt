Time was not good for this movie. Once a controversial adaptation of the best-selling Jeffrey Konvitz, now this movie looks like a regular version of a typical spookfest. Leaving macabre accents (especially crazy, compared to the highest finale), it is basically a glossy horror for people who are not interested in this genre. He has a remarkable cast in small roles (Jose Ferrer, Ava Gardner, Eli Wallach, Burgess Meredith, Christopher Walken and many others), but something tells me that the producers wanted such an expensive cast to convince the audience that this is not your average movie about low quality (producers of catastrophic films from the 70s had a similar idea). I liked to see familiar faces, but the story is very stupid and no matter how high the movie class is, it works at the level of the average operational film from the 1970s (although this is not a bad thing). Nevertheless, it is a nice movie, especially for those viewers who like to watch the stars. As always, the matte work of Albert Whitlock is unique. Overall, quite funny.
