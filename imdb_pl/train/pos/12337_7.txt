Poor Ivy: Although she was born like this, she was unlucky to marry a charming wastrel (Richard Ney). Because the film takes place in the 1920s or '30s, when the rigid victorian ideas of the class began to fire at the edges, this uncertain status worries her excessively. Gretorexists (because they are called) do not know where their next shilling comes from, but there are also sailing events and fancy balls in elegant pleasunces to tempt. When Ivy (Joan Fontaine) meets a wealthy older gent (Herbert Marshall, who had to be born in middle-aged age), sets one of her extraordinary chapeaux for him. Fortunately, one of the beaux that is still lacing (Patric Knowles) is a doctor whose offices provide a poison box with which hubby says goodbye. The fact that it's Knowles does not cause its phase, even if the hours pass, until it is hanged by the neck until death. The plot depends on the inspector Sir Cedric Hardwicke; Knowles' mother (rebel Lucile Watson); and loyal housewife Knowles (Una O'Connor). Wood himself adds subtle accents to this above-average melodrama; Fontaine's luminous face supplies the rest.
