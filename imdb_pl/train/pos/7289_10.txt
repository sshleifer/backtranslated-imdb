It was one of the first CREEPY movies I've ever seen ... I was about 5 years old then. It frightened me GOOD! But that night I put chewing gum in one eye to be like a monster ... and my mother got very upset. She had to clean her eye with alcohol and the next day my eye smelled of BILATER MINT! NOW IT'S A MOVIE! Hey, time for it was a great movie. The head sitting on the lab top was as real as it was then. And if your 5 is VERY AGAINST! Children are now spoiled by special effects that show too much and leave nothing to the mind's imagination. Your mind can imagine things more frightening than special effects! (IMO)
