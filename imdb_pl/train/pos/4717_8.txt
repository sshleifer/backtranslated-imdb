How can someone not love this movie? I think it's a funny trick of all old gangster movies; if you've never seen them, watch it. Michael Keaton has the ball in this role, as everything goes. One guy spins English every time he talks, and Griffin Dunn plays in unconscious D. A. but my favorite role must be Joe Piscopo. It has all the best lines. Danny DeVito, Alan Hale, Ray Walston are in this stellar movie in which gangster gangsters are much more fun than the "Mafia" for the criminal underworld.
