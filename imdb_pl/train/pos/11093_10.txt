It's a great "little" movie. I say "small" because there are not a hundred shots or a dozen explosions, like in the movie John Woo. Great performances of Roy Scheider and three "bad guys". John Frankenheimer seems to have more luck in small productions. The film is very easy to watch, the story is more like a yarn than a washing machine - instead of everything that happens around, it seems that everything gets worse when the plot gets thicker. A great ending, very positive. I have never read Elmore Leonard's book, but it can not be very different from the movie because it feels like I was watching Elmore Leonard's movie.
