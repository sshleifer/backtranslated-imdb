Clary's beauty and charm are the main reason for watching this movie. "Hula" does not match Clara's best films, but it's still nice. he dances, rides horses and chases the man he loves. this film takes just over an hour and was directed by the future Oscar winner, the winner of fleming (he left with the wind). if you like Clara, I recommend "hula".
