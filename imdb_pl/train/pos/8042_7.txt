**** SPOILERS **** The film "Sniper" is undoubtedly based on the exploits of the legendary sniper US Marine Carlos "Gunny" Hathcock. Humble, gentle voice of Mr. Rogers, who collected as many as 300 confirmed and unconfirmed Vietcong and North Vietnamese military killings during his two routes in "Nam." This shows how deadly and effectively trained military sniper really is. <br /> <br /> Tom Berenger is a great clam and deadly sergeant Thomas Beckett, who at the end of his career as a leading US Marine sniper, but later in the film realizes that living as a civilian will be pointless. Because he has nothing to do with the skills he learned in the US Marines, unless he decides to become a mobster. Backett reluctantly accepts his fate as a professional life-assassin for his country. <br /> <br /> The story of the film "Sniper" focuses on Sergeant Beckett with the help of former US silver medalist Richard Miller, Billy Zane, former US government agent and agent, sent deep into the Panama jungle. The two snipers are to take out the rebel General Miguel Alveraze, Frederick Miraglittoa and the Colombian drug king Raul Ochoa, Carlos Alveraze, who supports him in the planned takeover of the country by the military. <br /> <br /> We see earlier in the film Sgt. Beckett's range and eliminating the leader of the rebels, which in my opinion was the best scene in "Sniper". This shows step by step how Sgt. Beckett with the help of his observer Cpt. Papich, Aden Young, does his job. There is also a sub-story, which was later discontinued in the film about the rebel sniper DeSilva, Ewald Wiley, who persecuted Beckett and who later killed Papich when they both waited for being taken out of the jungle by a military helicopter. One would think that a deadly cat and a mouse are taking place between them, which will end when the movie ends, but Sgt. Beckett had no problems with sending DeSilva at the beginning of the movie, using the unsuspecting Miller as a bait. <br /> <br /> What hurts the film the most is the last fifteen minutes when the story went from one shot to one killing sniper on a rambo-like ending Sgt. Beckett and Agent Miller are fighting with a whole battalion of rebels with bullets flying as densely as the London fog. <br /> <br /> "Sniper" is still worth watching because it tells about a person who until now was not very effective in war films: a lonely killer who kills with the precision and skills of a master of diamonds or an excellent neurosurgeon and who does it's a total mystery.
