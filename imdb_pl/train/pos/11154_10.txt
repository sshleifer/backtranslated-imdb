In my opinion, this is one of the greatest films made in America and he deserves every prize he has won, and is on the AFI Top 100 list (though he is shyly too low on the list of 250 best IMDBs, only # 183 as this magazine). If you like to play at the highest level (Voight and Hoffman is a great match), well-drawn characteristics and an ingenious direction, editing and photos, you'll love it just like me. Schlesinger paints a lively, always credible picture of a New York scene from the late 1960s, and many victims fight to defeat personal demons and survive amidst the misery, poverty and hopelessness of 42nd Street in New York. <br /> <br /> The film techniques used here perfectly reflect the atmosphere of the underground film movement in New York (and the city) and are nothing short of dazzling. I saw many ideas (including quick fire editing, retrospective readings, drug / travel sequences and a cartoon face slipped during the murder scene to convey anxiety and terror) stolen by other filmmakers. br /> <br /> The relationship between Joe and Ratso is treated in such a way as to be perceived as an extremely strong friendship OR having a homosexual basis. I think the director has dealt with it in a subtle way, not to cope with the censorship of those times, but to focus his energy on the importance of a strong human relationship in life, whether sexual or not. <br /> <br /> MIDNIGHT COWBOY is a brave, moving movie about the enormity, influence and meaning that has completely lost its influence over the years, so if you have not seen it, you really miss the real American classic. I recommend this movie to everyone. <br /> <br /> Score: 10 out of 10.
