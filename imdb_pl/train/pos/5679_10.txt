After the success of the second part, Richard Curtis and Ben Elton decided that Blackadder should have a third appearance. This time, instead of the Tudor times or the Elizabethan times, Edmund Blackadder (nominated by BAFTA Rowan Atkinson) lives in the times of the French Revolution. Accompanying now stupid but nice Baldrick (Tony Robinson) Blackadder is the "faithful" butler of George, Prince of Wales Regent (Hugh Laurie). In this third series, to the wonderfully written sitcom, Blackadder tries everything he can to become rich and powerful. He tries to pick you in a rotten neighborhood, tries to sell a book, tries to win a bet about The Scarlet Pimpernel, tries to be a man on the highway and finally poses as a prince. This is a very good part of the popular comedy. It includes performances by Robbie Coltrane, Tim McInnerny, Miranda Richardson and Stephen Fry. She won the BAFTA award for the best comedy series and was nominated for the best design and best makeup award. Rowan Atkinson was number 18 on the 50 Best British Actors, he was 24 on Comedy Comedy, he was number 8 on British favorite comedy, Edmund Blackadder was number 3 on the 100 Best Television Signs, and he was the number 3 on the world's largest comedians and Blackadder ( all four series) were number 2 in the British Best Sitcom. Outstanding!
