Other reviewers have summarized this film noir well. I just wanted to add to "Whew!" Comment one of the reviewers regarding evidently coke driven Elish Cook drums. It was doozy, I have to say. Cook deserved some recognition for his crazy performance. <br /> <br /> Some interesting things to think about: Cook appeared as a waiter in the film Barbara Stanwyck from 1941. "The ball of fire". He was a waiter in the nightclub where Barbara sang, and the legendary drummer Gene Krupa played the drums, the most energetically. Is it too much to suggest that Spazzia's drumming of Cook in the later film "Phantom Lady" was very inspired by Krupa's work, as Cook shows 3 years earlier? <br /> <br /> If you are watching Krupa in the "Fireball", I think you will notice similar movements of the body. Of course, you can hope that HE did not receive any medication at that time!
