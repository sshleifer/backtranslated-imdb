Certainly one of the best British films ever made, if not one of the best films ever made. Script, photos, directing and acting in the classroom on your own. This film works on many levels. So why is it completely unavailable on tape, DVD. Never shown on TV? Why is it hidden when it is regularly screened at the National Film Theater in London for packed houses?
