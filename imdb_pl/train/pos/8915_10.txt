THE BLOB is a great horror, not only because of the spontaneously frightening images of his almost unstoppable, soluble body of the title character, but because it contains a real social message. In many ways it is a "good horror film". A clever storyline has helped immensely thanks to the solid performances of the entire cast. Two romantic leads, Steve McQueen and Aneta Corsaut, bring surprising depth and sentimentality to conduct. They are misunderstood, but they are very good young people and it is very easy to root them out. <br /> <br /> This is a pro-social film, and his underage criminal characters cause trouble mainly from boredom, not from some bad character. Steve McQueen's rival rival almost seems to be an early-stage enemy, but he quickly joins the McQueen campaign to save the city from the leaking invader when he sees the seriousness of McQueen. In this way, the situation of the character, who at first glance seems to be cartoony, suddenly acquires depth and human realism. <br /> <br /> Initial skepticism of the authorities against the wild claims of children turned out to be wrong - and when the threat is recognized by all, the whole conflict in society disappears. This goal unification and the fight against "troublesome" teenagers become official when Aneta Corsaut's father breaks into school to get the extinguishers needed to freeze the drops. On any other day, breaking into a school will be considered an act of vandalism typical of a juvenile offender - this is a necessary action performed by an adult on that particular day. At this turning point, it is clear that there is no division between young and old. <br /> <br /> This is an extraordinary film because it recognizes the perception of the "generational gap", but suggests that it is more imaginary than real, and given the real crisis, people will naturally come together to restore order. "The Blob" is an excellent tonic for the type of depression that usually accompanies watching "Night of the Living Dead" (1968). <br /> <br /> Much has been done with cheap but innovative film (and effective!) visual effects. They are undeniably clever. Many of the anti-gravity tricks we see, made by Blob, have been achieved thanks to miniature sets designed for rotation. The camera was usually attached to the sets in a very "locked" position (the lights must have been similarly attached so that the lighting remained stable when the room was reversed in this way). These scenes were often photographed one frame at a time when the room was slowly turning - the drop of silicone was very slow and its operation required acceleration. In a sense, it was similar to time-lapse photography, but with the use of a drop of silicone, not an articulated marionette. Even today, the effects are surprising and bizarre. <br /> <br /> A very good movie with the exploiting title, BLOB, is a must.
