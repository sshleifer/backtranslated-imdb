I have read the other reviews and found a few to compare the film v real life (e.g., What you need to do to get to music school), Britney Bashing etc. Etc., So let's focus on film and news. <Br /> <br /> I rated this movie on 7 out of 10 for ages 8 to 14 and for a family movie. For the average adult man .... 2 out of 10. <br /> <br /> I like pop / rock, I'm 45 years old. I know about Britney Spears, but I never realized that she was actually singing Harder until I read the credits and those reviews. I did not recognize her poster on the wall, so I was not worried about "self-promotion". <br /> <br /> I watch movies for entertainment. I do not care about casting, lighting, producers, directors, etc. What is the movie and whether it amuses me. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie for news. The biggest epidemic in the world is low self-esteem (which is a completely different story), so observed with a view to sending, because this is the area of ​​interest. The film is light, bright and airy, great for children. I discovered that the Texas Twang began to disappear in the whole film and of course there are only so many ways to transfer the resignation / do not give up the message, so yes, it was a bit predictable. Great message ... there should be more. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great family movie, but take Hannibal for a guy who watches alone.
