Von Trier once explained how he created such a strong involvement of the viewer with his films, placing his film world inside the real world and the imagined world. As viewers, we believe that we are watching a "real" story, while in reality we are completely manipulated, often to the point that the film is disturbing (Dancer in the Dark) or painful (The Idiots / Idioterne). Of course, Dogme's films acted only as a carrier of this theory (apart from the creation of the reflective floodlight of Leon Trier). <br /> <br /> The story is typical of Von Trier: our hero is idealistic, he seems to balance his relationship with everyone, but he soon becomes a victim of problems that others have created in the past. An idealist must inevitably reject society in order to remain an idealist and become a terrorist. Humanity is corrupt, and purity only leads to (self) destruction. (These elements were also very ubiquitous in Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark.) The film is also full of cynical (even humorous) tones about the role of Germans and Americans in post-war Germany. <br /> <br /> As a technical achievement the film is wonderfully designed: moving and fading blurred colors, screen overlays, actions on various overlays (the most interesting is shooting the future mayor). In this video, we can see how good Von Trier deals with film as a technical medium. In his later works, it seems that he gives up (as if he was no longer interested in technical achievements, because they become so easily available).
