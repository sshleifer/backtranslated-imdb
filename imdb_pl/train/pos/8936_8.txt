After Beau Beaurav, everyone waited for Claire Denis to perform a masterpiece that never existed. Now he has it. Denis makes a huge leap in this movie, an orgy of great pictures, an elliptical edition and deliberately vague narrative events that seem strange and behave even stranger. There is a nominal plot (derived partly from Jean-Luc Nancy's book of the same title) about a mature man in need of a heart transplant who is looking for a Tahitian son whom he abandoned a long time ago; but mainly it is the study of the idea of ​​personal and cultural intrusions. It takes several observations to fully understand and has stimulation problems approaching the end, but it is even more advanced and catchy than anything I've seen this year. I miss this at my own risk.
