I grew up in South West Virginia; I am more or less the same age as (perhaps even a year older than) Homer Hickam, author of "The Rocket Boys", a book that is the real foundation of this heart-warming movie. <br /> <br /> So I am referring closely to the topic of coal mining in West Virginia and to the stunning effect that Sputnik then had on all of us (October 4, 1957). The Rocket Boys continued a wonderful life for themselves. I went to study in the field of physics and computer engineering. All because Sputnik has awakened many young people to the "scientific gap" in the US during the Cold War ... <br /> <br /> This is a great movie for everyone, of all ages. But if you grew up in West Virginia in the late fifties, it would touch the core of your being. <br /> <br /> Everyone: Get it; Watch it; I recommend it to my friends ... who will thank you many times.
