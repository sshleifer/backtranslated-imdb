I really do not know what people have against this movie, but it's definitely one of my favorites. This is not teaching, it is not anchored by what is moral, it should not be controversial. It's only God. Every possible God, regardless of religion. And it is really fun. <br /> <br /> Jim Carry plays Bruce Nolan, a TV reporter who usually gets stuck on the lighter side of the news, desperately wanting to prove himself (more or less to himself) that he can be taken seriously and do a good job at work anchor. This ride is slowly led by his beautiful girlfriend Grace (Jennifer Aniston). When the final straws are performed, he does not laugh quickly, but he screams in the face of God, who in turn gives Bruce the power. Bruce makes his life better for him until he is condemned to help others, and then he still misses his point of power. Meanwhile, his constant excitement associated with his own life makes him more selfish, leaving his relationship on dangerous ground. <br /> <br /> OK, it was a bit long. But as the plot works well. Step by step fashion, in which we meet the challenges of being God, is much better than combining his problems together and is able to hide quite well. <br /> <br /> As you probably know, hearing this movie in the first place, Carrey's perfect acting act remains in character (which, fortunately, it is) and controls the film scene and gives it a stage. Regardless of whether they admit it or not, the role was written or rewritten only for Carrey. Without it, humor would become flat, because humor is half the execution. And above all, humor is very good. But without Carrey it would be like to want this wonderful life. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Aniston is great and, no matter what some people say, it does not work as the only excuse for the third act. At least you do not think about it when you see it. It gives you a hearty performance and makes you forget you're watching a movie, she and Carrey feel very much like a real couple. <br /> <br /> The movie has the impression that ggooooodd (see movie to understand), has a very nice feeling, deals with the idea appropriately and better than expected, and generally should not be called slapped, only for to save Carrey's career (which is nowhere to be found).
