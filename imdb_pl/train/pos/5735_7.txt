This is a short, primitive animated series of David Lynch (as he says at the beginning), which is a consequence of unfortunate forest accidents, wearing a large man, with a wife who suffers from stress disorders and an annoying son. Both of these elements are repeatedly harassed in short episodes and there is no real conspiracy. It is easier if you think of it as an extremely strange, slightly macabre Looney Tunes - with more gore, profanity, bloody violence and occasional mirth. <br /> <br /> I bought a DVD with Eraserhead with Eraserhead previously seen. Do not look at this series, if you want an artistic masterpiece - that's not all. In fact, it seems that this is a statement against such things, because its rough style spits out in the face of any animation convention that can be seen. As Lynch says: "If it's funny, it's just funny because we see the absurdity of it all."
