I hate reading reviews that say something like "Do not waste time, this movie stinks with ice". He has this for a reviewer for me, he may have some naive charm. If you like other films from the "Whistler" series, this one will be watched. If you like 40-year-old films, this one will be watched. <br /> <br /> This film is not in my opinion as good as any of the earlier entries in the series, in which the main character was Richard Dix. It is much slower and the plot is trivial. You've seen the same narrative device used in many other movies and usually better. <br /> <br /> But acting is good, just like lighting and dialogue. He simply lacks energy and probably you will discover exactly what is going on and how it all will end up no more than a quarter of the way. <br /> <br /> The Whistler series is semi-noir, and there the nature, mood, lighting, camera movement and angles are more important than history itself. But this movie is not noir. It's too light and Hollywood is innocent for that. Neither the figure of Richard Dix nor any of his ladies from previous films would have to end well. You just never knew exactly. <br /> <br /> But I still recommend it for at least one viewing. I have seen him at least twice and have received a reasonable amount of pleasure from it every time.
