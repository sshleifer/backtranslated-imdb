TESS OF THE STORM COUNTRY is probably the best movie from all Mary Pickford movies. After two hours, there was not a silent movie from 1922, but he still is interested in it about 80 years after his filming. Mary gives one of her best performances, sometimes the role seems to be the performance of the "biggest hits" with pieces of Mary innocent, Maria, the little devil, Maria, the mother, Mary spitfires, Maria the romantic heroine, etc. The guilds that were often used in one movie in past. The film is surprisingly honest in relation to one illegitimate child supporting the hero in 1922, and at some point our Little Mary is considered an unmarried mother! If Oscars took place in 1922, undoubtedly the best Oscar actress for a year would be for Mary.
