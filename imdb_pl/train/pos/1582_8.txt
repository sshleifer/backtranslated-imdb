Another small fragment of the huge Holocaust puzzle is presented in this document about the Rosenstrasse protest in Berlin, which I did not know about, which began at the end of February 1943. Details are given in the appendix, which follows this review. <br /> <br /> The film narrative presents the history of this protest in a different, contemporary history that begins in New York at the present time. Here, a wealthy, non-observant Jewish woman whose husband has just died, shakes her children and others, insisting on an extremely orthodox ritual of mourning. He goes even further, demanding that the non-Jewish fianc√© of his daughter leave the house. <br /> <br /> The suffering daughter Hannah (Maria Schrader) meets for the first time from an older cousin who during the World War II in Berlin her mother at the age of 8 was taken and protected by an Aryan woman. Hannah drops everything, goes to Berlin and finds a 90-year-old woman, Lena Fischer. Hannah easily convinces a woman to tell her story. Everything seems rather too pat. <br /> <br /> Then the film improves, focusing on long retrospectives mainly on the events of 1943 that surrounded the protest, in which the fictional central figure is the same Mrs. Fischer at the age of 33 (played wonderfully by Katja Riemann) a baroness and talented pianist who is married to Fabian (Martin Feifel), a Jewish concert violinist, one of the men detained on the Rosenstrasse site. <br /> <br /> The narrative briefly intertwines from time to time, they return to the present and also end in New York. While the scenes in the present are saturated with color, the scenes from 1943 are rinsed out, strong in blue and gray shades. <br /> <br /> The quality of the game is generally quite good, what can we expect, taking into account the deep reservoir of talent in Germany and the direction of Margarethe von Trotta, the most prominent film woman of German German cinema, was an actress. <br /> <br /> The story of the protest is told simply. There is only one feature that would help: notes with text at the end, indicating the final result for people detained at Rosenstrasse, which was the result, because the attachment below explains incredibly positively. <br /> <br /> "Rosenstrasse" did not perform well in the opinion of the majority of film critics. Too long, unnecessarily layered, providing gender stereotypes, manipulating music: so do ordinary raps. This is too long. But in this film I found a raw, powerful, spontaneous and absolutely persuasive voice of protest from women who kept the vigil outside the place on Rosenstrasse, where their Jewish relatives and others were detained. I have not found anything flashy, modern or manipulative in this performance. <br /> <br /> The very lack of extreme violence (no one was shot or otherwise physically brutal) increased my tension, which gradually increased as the film progressed. You are waiting for some malicious attack at any moment. Later, the movie stayed with me. I woke up later at night when I saw the movie, my mind was filled with gloomy, melancholy, chaotic images and feelings conjured up by the film. For me, this rarely happens. (In German and English). My rating: 8/10 (B +). (Seen 5/05/05).

But before the deportation of the prisoners could happen in this case, the wives and other relatives learned about what was happening and came to the address of Rosenstrasse, first in duels and twos and then in increasing numbers. <br /> <br /> Maybe six thousand people took part in the protest, though not everyone at the same time. Women demanded from their husbands day after day for a week. Unarmed, unorganized and deprived of leaders, they faced the most violent forces the Third Reich had. <br /> <br /> Joseph Goebbels, Gauleiter (District Governor or Leader) of Berlin, wishing this city would be racially clean, was also responsible for the public morale of the nation. In both cases he feared the possible effects of women's actions. Instead of inviting more open opposition, shooting women on the streets and fearing the compromise of the "Final Solution", Goebbels, with the consent of Hitler, released the prisoners of Rosenstrasse and even ordered the return of twenty-five of them who had already been sent to Auschwitz! <br /> <br /> Both for Hitler and Goebbels the decision was only a postponement of the inevitable. But they were wrong. Almost everyone released from Rosenstrasse survived the war. Women have achieved an amazing victory over the forces of destruction.
