By a happy coincidence in the same year that Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak created the haunting masterpiece of Alfred Hitchcock, "Vertigo," they created this light comedy. Maybe two actors had to do it after the weight of the Hitchcock movie. In any case, it's a great addition to "Vertigo" because it rediscovers a very unlikely but powerful affair. In fact, the film can be seen as the other side of "Vertigo" with its happy ending. Here, too, Novak undergoes transformation, in Vertigo essentially plays two women and here "transforms" from the witch into a deadly one. Stewart is again enchanted and for a moment tormented by love for her. In contrast to Vertigo, both meet in the "Bell Book and Candle", a perfect antidote to Hitcock's film. Again, the dynamics of love and attraction are explored, but in a completely different spirit. The cast is great. Lemmon is hilarious like the brother of the warlock Novak and Elsa Lancaster, giving a classic performance as aunt. Ernie Kovacs as a writer of alcoholic culture and of course Hermoine Gingold playing competitor of Novak are great. The scene with Stewart drinking the potion is the comedy at its best. Anyone who has seen Vertigo, and even if you should not see this memorable light comedy.
