It's about Mitzi. I loved her in it. And did not it look fantastic ?! I love those popcorn afternoon movies on Sunday. It is like one of those traitors in which they always advertise in the most annoying times. Richard's figure was completely terrifying. I used to meet such guys. Well, not exactly such a lol. I would like Zack not to die. He was cutie and very easy in the eyes. I love these stories of the type of persecutors. I always get up and make sure that my door is closed. My husband does not usually like this type of movie, but he actually sat with me the whole thing and I really enjoyed it. I can not wait to see what Mitzi is doing!
