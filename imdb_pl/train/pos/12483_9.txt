Although I was in the film as Sheriff Hodges, I still managed to jump into a few places and believe me that I'm not that easy. I can say that I am biased in this film and, OK, I am, but I did not see the finished product until 27.12.2006 and I was very pleased. I'm not a fan of horror movies, but I love the old movies "B" and black and white movies Sci Fi. This movie will make you "think" that you know when something will happen and then you will not. It will keep you completely in balance. I suggest you watch the movie first, then the director's notes and special functions. It is so well written, directed and filmed that I can personally say that working with this cast and crew was a real joy. I sincerely hope that I will be part of Brian and Laurence's future projects.
