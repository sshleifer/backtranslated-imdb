I got up to the bar, expecting it to be a hot beer on a hot day in Texas, but I was pleasantly surprised. After suffering from the "stupidity of Saturday night" I did not want to watch the alterations in a barn from southern Texas ... and I did not do it. John Revolta was good as a jealous redneck, Scott Glenn was well manned as an ex-con thuggie, and Debra Winger was always a joy. * I love this woman * Plus, the soundtrack was dynamite [and this comes from a guy who can not stand the sound of country music]. A movie full of fun.
