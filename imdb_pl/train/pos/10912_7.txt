"The Ex-Mrs. Bradford "(1936), starring Thin Man star William Powell (this movie was released in the same year as Thin Man's second film," After The Thin Man ", is very close to duplicating the fun and style of Thin Man movies, but still misses Despite this, it is a wonderfully funny, very funny secret murder in the same comic form. <br /> <br /> Did Myrna Loy miss you? Of course, let's not lie., It's hard to call me a better substitute than Jean Arthur, and chemistry between Arthur and co-author William Powell is real and is fun, romantic and engaging. <br /> <br /> The story and screenplay Anthonyu Vieller and partner of John Wyne's production company, James Edward Grant ("The Angel & The Bad Man") is close to being there with the effort of Thin Man, but he lacks a bit of proper joke and sizzle. <br /> <br /> Although he is not in the stratosphere of "The Thin Man" (what else?), "The Ex-Mrs. Bradford "is one of the most entertaining from dozens of mysterious comedy "who-done-its" from the 30's and 40's.
