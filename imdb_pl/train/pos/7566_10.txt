The young lady's name is Bonnie (Polay). She is attractive, apparently lives a decent life, but suddenly she is inexplicably torn out of her home and life by Evil Dude and Various and Unhappy Evil. Now he has no idea what the hell is going on, only that a group of people armed with teeth apparently wants to kill her ... and he will not even know why. <br /> <br /> God, I hear you whining all the time. Now that the content is so cheap in production and people can create their own movies / books / comics / internal organs, there will be nobody who would assure that there is a quality standard! We will be sinking in shit! The only people who think they are people who have not watched any movies or have recently read any books because we are already doing a float bomb. It's people like Ferrari and Rodriguez who lie to this ignorant tak-and-sos, throwing 8K $ on the table and doing ... well, what I would say is a better action than anything you've seen in cinemas. year ... but this year you did not see any action movies in the cinema. I saw the money. You stay away. You would do better if you caught a copy of it, spent twenty minutes playing and continued your life. <br /> <br /> It's pure entertainment. You enter, like Bonnie, with many questions, and where everything ends, it is foggy. All conceit has been done before in many ways, but not in such a compressed amount of time and without such a concentrated delicious shooting. You are there for atmosphere, mystery and weapons. That's all - all of this is what filmmakers promise and they deliver. <br /> <br /> He's heating black holes in my heart to think that it was for that budget. We get a lot of indie movies here, but we rarely see something as polished as this short one, and we've never seen any genre that looks so good. Hell, you could give these two guys MI: 3 and that could draw me to watch. Bond franchise. Shit, whatever. No, in fact even better: I'd like to see how these guys do things on their own and stay away from Hollywood. Whatever it is, killing the film industry is undoubtedly infectious. <br /> <br /> The best indie we've seen for some time, and the most effective indie we've seen. The DVD costs $ 20 and has bonus features in the ass. Go and get your budget for movie tickets and put it in it.
