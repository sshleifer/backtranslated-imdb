One of the best real crime movies ever made and very faithful to the book Truman Capote, who invented the genre of the crime novel. The haunting musical score of Quincy Jones and the wonderful performance of Scott Wilson and Robert Blake as assassins of Dick and Perry. Why Wilson did not become a big star after this movie is a mystery to me. <br /> <br /> The black and white photos and editing in this film are at the highest level. Reconstructing murders is terrifying and because it leaves real murders of your imagination, even more frightening than if they showed that the shotgun would turn off. The film was shot in the real home of Clutter, who was sold to another person after the murders. The film has a very documentary character - apart from the scenes from Clutter's real home, other scenes were shot at the gas stations and shops where the murderers were killed. The beloved horse Nancy Clutter, Babe, is even in the movie. Will Geer has a great opportunity as a prosecutor on a short trial stage, which is not only filmed in a real courtroom, but has several real jurors for the murder of clutter presenting themselves as the film's jury. <br /> <br /> This is a solid movie, terrifying every time you see it.
