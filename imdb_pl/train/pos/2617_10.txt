I've watched the Lion King more times than all my friends. Having a little sister ... you know how it is. So far I have remembered both the plot and the lines. After the appearance of the Lion King 2 it looked as good, let me see ... the other was much weaker ... then I saw the advertisement of the king of lions 1 and 1/2 ... I was ok, we are going again. After watching 1 1/2 I was like wow. All my expectations (regarding repeatability) have been broken. A really beautiful and original story makes you stick to sitting all the time. I noticed that the cartoon was filled with so many comical moments that ROFlmao would apply here 100%. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend watching the cartoon.
