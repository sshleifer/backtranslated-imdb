Hey, I can not say that I've seen all the films of Jesse (Jesus) Franco, and there are certainly many of them, but this is one of the better (and stranger) fate that I have seen. I would say that he was probably in a great situation in the late sixties / early seventies, and everything was a bit too strange for me lately, and it takes a long time to declare it. In any case, it is one big bad dream in which some of them seem to meet at different points. This woman is an actress or something like that, she performs in a Berlin theater where "false" torture is done for the audience that appreciates (?!) And it seems that she has this problem with sleeping. Hook for what is real and what is not in this movie, apparently it is sharp, and things about dreams do not. It seems to exist in deja vu state. I will not say it makes sense, but it's pretty wild and weird and fun. Shots in Berlin give the impression of a lonely and frightening place, which adds atmosphere. The ending, however, is very violent, the movie just ends, and the tape has turned black, unless you need to inform you that at the moment it's over. My copy came from the Anchor Bay Euro-Trash collection and I say, give me more Euro-Trash, I can not get enough of this shit. But it's GOOD shit.
