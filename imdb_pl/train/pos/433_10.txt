It's one of those rare films, beautiful and attractive, dignified and bizarre, a real gift. I consider this a necessary condition for any trip to Italy or any holiday, because it reminds you to open up to a wider experience (yes, find the magic). I especially liked Josie Lawrence as Lottie Wilkins, but every leader and supporting actor is impeccable in this film. In addition, the costumes, if you are attracted by fashion and costumes, are exceptionally well made. I would like them to be released on DVD because I have my tape version on it! <br /> <br /> Absolutely worth your time, just make sure you decide to watch it without any interruptions.
