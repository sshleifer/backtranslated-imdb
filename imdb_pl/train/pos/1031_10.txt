This series is set one year after the Abydos mission in the film Stargate. Explains many things that the movie forgot to mention. For example, how was the gate activated without a human computer? Where did Goa'uld (Ra race) come from? How many are there? <br /> <br /> The first episode has a retired Jack O'Neill (written by 2 Ls) dismissed for active service by General George Hammond due to the attack of the star gates from Apophis, a powerful Goa'uld who killed four men and he kidnapped one woman. We meet Samantha Carter, a brilliant scientist who claims she has gone through the Stargate for the first time and is determined to go now. We learn that Daniel got married to Abydos and that there are hundreds of gateway addresses that he can choose. Then Daniel's wife is captured by Apophis and becomes his new queen. <br /> <br /> He continues in the second episode, in which General Hammond announces the creation of the SGC, which includes nine teams in which Jack's team will be SG-1, which includes Jack, Samantha and Daniel. They go to Chulak, the native planet of the Goa'uld, to save Daniel's wife and the other captured in Abydos named Ska'ra. They are captured and, like Apophis, orders them to kill them and many other prisoners, Jaffa named Teal'c, the First Supreme Apophis, saves them and goes with them to Earth, where he is part of the SG-1. <br /> <br /> This was just the beginning of the adventure. During the show, they went into the past and the future, they were transferred to alternative realities, they exchanged bodies, they got old, they met foreign races, including the rebellious Goa'ulda alliance called Tok'ra, in which Samantha's dad became. member, Asgard, a beautiful little breed in which we usually see Thor (he's Jacek's friend) and avoid countless global catastrophy of the teeth. <br /> <br /> The show was recently canceled but lasted ten seasons. In the ninth season a new enemy called Ori appeared, raising new powers, new dangers and revealing new secrets surrounding the Gate and its creators, the Ancients. In the ninth and tenth seasons there were also two new characters, Ben Browder as Cameron Mitchell, new leader SG-1 and Claudia Black as Vala MalDoran, a woman from another world who brings a new band to play. <br /> <br /> Very well-made, interesting characters, fantastic special effects and a subtle love interest between Samantha and Jack, all of it has everything. Another way to travel around the galaxy and all sorts of adventures is one program you do not want to miss. Unlock the gate and go through. You will not regret!
