For fans of the 70's Hammer horror movies, this movie should be a feast. The only thing I did not like about the movie is that Peter Cushing was wasted on the worst episode. Generally, however, it is a solid, scary little movie. If this is not the best Amicus movie, it is certainly one of them. The best episode, rightly preserved at the end, is the one in which Jon Pertwee is an actor of horror - he is really perfect. As good as Pertwee was in this role, it's hard to believe that he did not do more of this type of film. In summary, it's a funny movie that scared me as a child, and which still gives me creep.
