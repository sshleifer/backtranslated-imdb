There is no way to confront Zabriskie Point from a rational point of view or attempt to describe it with words and conventions that you would use for other films. That's because it's not a movie. It's an idea and a feeling that the filmmakers have in some way turned into an object as mundane as a movie. What we see is not an expansion of the story, but a sequence of events that we do not see in the movies every day, but we imagine that it's like the background we deliver ourselves when we hear about the tragic news from friends. We see our imagination of people who are abstractions for us - nobody we know, but we certainly heard about them in a book, on TV or somewhere. So what do we see? Events. We see people arguing, leading and inevitably escaping. Only escape is something elusive - it's a collective situation and cruelty that a lot of civilization has allowed to exist, though laziness, or ... human nature. In the late 1960s, our players act against and inflict the misery of modern existence. These creatures are effectively empty tables that can display any feature we can imagine if we want to. Although the actions taken may be perceived as criminal or irresponsible, the characters are not themselves criminals. They are human beings seeking a return to a well-known, non-created existence that is beyond the normality they experience every day. Not because they are always happy or sad, but they achieve some kind of self-realization when they go beyond the suicide of modern life. They achieve real life only in the natural world, even though it is another sacrifice of modern existence. Finally, Zabriski Point is the praise of the humanities tied to the natural world. When even the most abandoned parts of the earth succumb to our ideas of progress, we lose our souls on the path to the death of the human spirit.
