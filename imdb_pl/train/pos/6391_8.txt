I caught this movie at the Arizona International Film Festival. I did not expect too much (although the festival director told me that this is one of the best submitted films). Five minutes later I was sold. Filmed in B & W on a modest budget, this movie is fun. Acting is solid, the script is solid, and the film's appearance is solid. Acting is probably the greatest revelation, because most movies shot on a low budget tends to be amateur or stage play. Not this one. It contains one of the most convincing, endearing and funny performances of a character with the Tourette Syndrome I have ever seen. The story is complex, not confusing and lewd, not being selfless. If you have a chance, check out this video. Film makers such as Majkowski (I hope I'm right) deserve a chance to pass on their stuff to a wider audience.
