Intriguing. Exciting. Dramatic. Explosive. Complex. Epic. Words that only touch the tip of the iceberg in terms of the great story LOST talks about. <br /> <br /> From acting to rare visual effects, LOST is an indispensable television program for science fans - fantasy, fantasy, action, adventure, and many and many secrets. <br /> <br /> Each member of the cast is so well chosen and so good in their roles that you either love them or hate them, or downright wish them death. <br /> <br /> Visual effects when used (which is rare), are actually quite well made, taking into account the usual production of shows. Whether it's a "smoke monster" for polar bears, LOST is credible in terms of sweetness. <br /> <br /> When it comes to history, nothing can match the enormous complexity that this show has made the viewers endure. Starting from the end, the continuity is practically perfect, the characters are developed, and the constantly evolving story slowly gives answers to her questions, she wants so much. <br /> <br /> In general, LOST has virtually no defect. It does for dramatic / science-fiction television, which Arrested Development did for comedy: set the bar. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend LOST to those who are patient, intellectual and love every moment of the ride, no matter how long it takes to get to the end. <br /> <br /> See this program.
