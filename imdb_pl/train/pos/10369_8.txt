"A Cry in the Dark" is a masterful piece of cinema, haunting and incredibly provocative. The true story of Linda Chamberland, who in 1980 witnessed a terrifying sight, seeing her three-month-old child being brutally taken from her family tent while camping in the Austrian seclusion. Azaria (the child) has never been seen again, and the result of her terrible disappearance has caused real life craze all over the world. Meryl Streep immaculately portrays Linda's role as always. But the only thing that helps "A Cry in the Dark" never falls flat is a brilliant direction. A truly inspired and accurate look at this problem, tears come to your eyes. The concept is no less than frightening, and then you are haunted, but also inspired.
