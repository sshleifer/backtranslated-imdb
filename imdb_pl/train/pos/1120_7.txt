Not to be confused with the British black comedy of the same title, which appeared in 1994. But this Shallow Grave is a worthy addition to the heyday of the '80s. <br /> <br /> The story goes hand-in-hand with the four girls from the brotherhood of the monastery planning a spring break in Florida, but they are suspended when one of them witnesses the murder of a local woman and when she realizes that she was seen, let's say it becomes a deadly game of cat and mouse, and the situation becomes even worse when it turns out that it is a local sheriff. <br /> <br /> Shallow Grave is, in my opinion, one of the nicer slashers that appeared in the 80's, especially the late '80s, when the slashers went a little down, it was one of the few that He did not do it and this movie should be more known, it's a pity that it is not. it's one movie that embarrasses stereotypes (try to guess who the last girl will be - I was completely wrong). The main cast is nice and this is one of those movies that they hope everyone will run away, which of course they will not. This, combined with the fluffiness of the first half-hourly film jars (in a good way) with a few flashes of real horror (the second murder provides a real shock) and unexpected confusion (even if it is not a high budget thriller I did not expect a topless scene in which the woman is strangled own bra (in the company of a hysterical radio program), in a movie from the late 80's. <br /> <br /> There are one or two bad things in this movie, not only bad, but also a sub-story with two teenage boys that is not going anywhere, and the ending which was stupid, plus the deprivation of inability to follow logic. SHALLOW GRAVE does not have any sharp tools, but at least in my opinion it is slasher flick. Scenes where girls are chased by the forest the sheriff's sheriff, they are tense and exciting. <br /> <br /> All in all a very pleasant and valuable slasher, with great performances memory of all four main girls and that psycho sheriff.
