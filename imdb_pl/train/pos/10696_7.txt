Every time I see Nicole, I like her more. I love such a movie. A woman you just do not give up, but she's still breaking your heart. The first movie I remember was like Of Human Bondage, Kim Novak - Laurence Harvey. Beef meat about the correctness of the Russian language used in this film is minute, it was good enough to deceive me or someone who can not speak Russian. Funny how people miss the point. The Russians, who were not good, were well manned. In the end I have to tilt my hat to Ben Chaplin, as someone else has noticed, he plays with juice with great dignity, and between him and Nicole definitely was a bit warm. Thinking, the guys get paid for it, stunning.
