Despite budget constraints, this is a great movie, proof that effort and imagination can overcome the lack of cash. The opening, in which cave images seem to show how at least some dinosaurs have survived to the age of human beings, is a nice red herring. Then the meteorite flows into the lake and causes heat, which in turn causes the dinosaur to hatch a frozen egg (perhaps cave paintings suggest that this is not the first time when something like this happened). When a prehistoric beast appears, it is a well-animated plesiosaur, which soon causes disappearances in the area. Okay, so this is not Jurassic Park, but it's still a real entertainment for fans of monstrous movies.
