A very stupid movie that begins with a soft porn sequence, sets off on a distant comedy in an art gallery, adds a shocking discovery in a hotel room, and then introduces accidental murder for no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> What follows is strange and surreal (in particular, the stopwatch is extremely unnecessary), ending with the revealing ending of the "turn", which is just as obvious as unfair to the viewer (see the trivia section, why is it it's deliberately unfair). <br /> <br /> The film does its best to be offensive to as many groups as possible - transsexuals, madmen and the wonderful racial stereotype of "Huggie Bear" in the subway - and patronize the viewer like an idiot in the final scenes, as the heroes endlessly explain to each other with great detail and over and over again what has just happened in the film. Although the background of the female characters of the restaurant scene at the end is a joy to watch. <br /> <br /> In fact, the whole movie is a joy to watch: Despite many, many disadvantages, the whole package only works well.
