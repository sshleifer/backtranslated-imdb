This film is about subtleties and difficulties in moving around the ever-changing limits of morals, racial relations and desires. It is true that this is not a movie for everyone. There are no car chases, buildings do not explode, no murders. The drama lies in the tension suggested by looks, minimal gestures, spatial boundaries, lighting and other things - sometimes very seemingly - unspeakable. It's about identity, memory, community, affiliation. Different parts of the film cooperate with each other to strengthen the motives of themselves and others, identity, desire, limitations and losses. It rewards the attentive and sensitive viewer. He will be unhappy with those whose palates require explosive, massive, sharp action. It's a beautifully made human story. That's all.
