This movie is fantastic because it explores stories and fantasies in the way the child does for adults. The idea that a child's drawings become a place that can physically visit and influence them is wonderful. At the same time, you could talk to a child psychologist and say that he is really testing his subconscious mind, just like we all in our dreams when we sleep. A piece that gives me goose bumps appears when her dad is in a paper house and chases her. The only thing I can not stand is that it has been sold as a horror movie ... it really is not. If you want to see something British with a lot of story that lets you guess without the usual cheap emotions that most movies have to use, check out Paperhouse.
