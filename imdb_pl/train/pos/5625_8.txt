Attractive Marjorie (Farrah Fawcett) lives in fear after being accosted by a lonely biker. She is mortally shocked by the fact that her attacker knows her address. As expected, Joe (James Russo), the attacker enters Marjorie's house and submits it to humiliating terror. Bruised and bloodied, Marjorie manages to gain an advantage over the assailant, throwing out live daylight from the jerk and makes him helpless by spraying a wasp in his eyes and throat. Hog bound and beaten, Joe tries to explain himself to Marjorie's roommates (Diana Scarwid and Alfrie Woodard) when they return home. There is almost a virtue of mercy, but it does not come from Marjorie. Should she continue the punishment? Violence, sexual abuse and harsh language make you get the grade R. Fawcett really moves away from the ditsy roles that would forever ruin her career. Recognition for director Robert M. Young.
