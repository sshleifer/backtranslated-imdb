Our song is a great example of passion, making movies at its best. In fact, it is a real miracle of the movie; a penetrating and insightful work of art that describes the lives of three young girls from the city center (Crown Heights, Brooklyn) during a specific summer in their lives, when the troubles with their approaching adulthood will force each of them to do many difficult, changing the choices that will probably change the definition of each of them, and the way they will relate to each other in the coming years. <br /> <br /> Writing / directing Jim McKay is graceful and clear. In this film there is neither sentimental, unjustified sentiment nor stereotypical solutions. What we see here sometimes seems to be a breakthrough. In our song there is naturalism - credibility, if you prefer - surpassing the nature of other giants of this genre, including American Graffiti and Cooley High. <br /> <br /> A lot of the merit for the spirit of the film goes to its main actors. The combined presence of Melissa Martinez (Maria), Kerry Washington (Lanish) and Anna Simpson (Joycelyn) is dazzlingly powerful. It would be easy - and obviously blatantly - to reject, as some have apparently, the performances of these three people as apathetic or without emotion. In fact, their silent charm, their instinctive sense of dignity and raw, sometimes unconventional intelligence, throughout the film, are absolutely riveting. One would have to be completely "without contact" with the behavior of teenagers or completely indifferent to this longing for what these three young women bring to the screen. Similarly, the supporting cast, especially Marlene Forte as the mother of Lanishy, ​​compliments the work of three girls and the general tone of the film. <br /> <br /> Our song is a film that nobody can miss - everyone of all ages.
