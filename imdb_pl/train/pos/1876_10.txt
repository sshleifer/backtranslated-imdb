Adaptation of the book Finding Fish. This story is about anxious young sailor Antwone Fisher (Derek Luke), who tells the painful story of his past to psychiatrist Jerome Davenport (Denzel Washington). Derek Luke's brilliant debut and always stunning Denzel Washington performance. <br /> <br /> This movie was amazing on many levels and I was disappointed that he did not win an Oscar, I think it was because he was released at the wrong time, which is why he was overlooked. I highly recommend this film to everyone, you will be moved by its history, and it really will make the audience empathic with this young man who is Antwone Fisher. <br /> <br /> If you like inspiring true stories, then look at Antwone Fisher. <br /> <br /> Thank you
