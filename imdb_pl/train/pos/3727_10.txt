Tigerland is one of the best films I have seen, and in my opinion it surpasses even a metal jacket of a similar character. Bozz is played exceptionally well by Farrell, and is a character that stays in your mind long after the movie ends. The ending is brilliantly cut by the schumacher - with a melodious singing of harmony and a slow crowd of soldiers preparing to leave. What a movie.
