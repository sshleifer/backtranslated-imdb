One of my favorite movies, which was overlooked by too many film viewers, which surprises me. Not only directed by acclaimed Ang Lee, he had many young actors who were to become the main stars, for example Tobey Maguire (before Spiderman), Skeet Ulrich (before Jericho), Jonathan Rhys Meyers (before Tudors), James Caviezel, Simon Baker, Mark Ruffalo, Jeffrey Wright, Tom Wilkinson and Jewel. All the acting was great, and each of the mentioned actors gave an unforgettable performance, especially Meyers, who played the evil villain who killed for the sake of killing. <br /> <br /> When the biographies and achievements of the director (even when he won the academy award) and the actors are listed, this film is usually overlooked in their previous performances. I discovered the movie by chance on DVD and became one of my most-watched films. However, this is rarely seen on the cable. I am looking forward to what others suggest, the reasons why this film is not well known.
