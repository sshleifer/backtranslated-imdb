Someone played a car from the windshield, someone plays someone else in their latest song, someone else did not react, according to the teacher. I'm just wondering how it happened. In this movie there were too many scenes in which I wondered where the camera came from. If the scenes shot in the place where the Warhols descended on the BJM post-party are real, it was an unforgivable exploitation to the maximum, if not, it was a total fabrication, anyhow I was uncomfortable, if that was the purpose? Throughout this movie, I was wondering how the film material was made. A decent portrait of a nice genius (tortured) in which we all believe.
