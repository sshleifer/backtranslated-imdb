I will not repeat everything that other viewers of the film have already said. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is an excellent movie, not only as a very human story about the growing relationship of the father with his adult son, but also a small window to the world of practicing Islam, for people like me who are not familiar with this religion. <br /> <br /> An important aspect of this story is the aspect of a young man's attitude to his father's beliefs and practices, and how his attitude towards religion seems to change in a subtle way as their journey progresses. <br /> <br /> A well-made movie that I recommend to everyone with the brain and heart.
