TAKE UP SPOILERS. This movie was fine. Goldie Hawn and Chris Sarandon were the best two. Okay, so this strange guy who (SPOILER HERE) trades with a biker because his clothes were funny. The guy's boss was good too. But the film really belonged to Sarandon and Hawna. These two people should have more time together on the screen. This chemistry was great. Bathroom scene WOW! Romantic, sweet, delicious. <br /> <br /> Hawn is a silly waitress who saves a strange man and goes to a white house in the middle of a plot because of the greed of politicians. Talking about Sarandon would consist of giving a lot. SPOILERS This is quite an unusual romantic / political comedy that satisfies both the political and the romantic side. It deals with political issues and barely skins in romantic areas. <br /> <br />
