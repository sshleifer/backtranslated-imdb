Remember these two stories fondly and in the first, embedded in the not too distant future, we see a young boy preparing for the examination day, state test i.q. The boy is a bit surprised about the anxiety of his parents, because some of his friends have already done so and will eventually take the test. Upon arrival he receives an injection and is curious why. The examiner smiles and tells him that he just makes sure that he is telling the truth. The boy asks, surprised why he does not? It is later and parents sit anxiously on the screen when a message appears and declares that the state is sorry, but the level i.q their son crossed the national quotient and would politely ask for a private burial. Corker final scene! A message from love was a heartfelt tale of a fictional relationship between a girl from the past and a guy from the present. Which goes into a strange story of accusations of witchcraft in the past and delving into the pages of history in the present. Nice story with a nice conclusion.
