While Rome is raging to celebrate Hitler's visit - uniforms, armbands, parades - two outsiders stay at home, in a large building and finish the meeting. She is Sofia Loren, who is the wife of a brutal civil servant and the mother of six children. He is Mastroianni, a radio speaker who has been dismissed because of his homosexuality. They both need companionship and understanding, they both are in each other. <br /> <br /> The movie covers several hours. The color is faded and everything is done using the soundtrack of military marches and hysterical radio announcers. Amazingly, the Nazi anthem - Horst-Wessel-Lied - becomes a romantic musical theme. <br /> <br /> A beautiful film, an excellent reconstruction of a special era in the history of Italy and a moving, sad story. Mastroianni is as good as we expected, and Sofia Loren does a great job, far from his usual pin-ups, Neapolitan fishwife personalities. Do not miss it.
