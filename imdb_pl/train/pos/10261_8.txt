First of all, it should not be a brilliant and provocative movie, just like many other reviewers seem to compare it. the first review says that something similar to the one who likes it knows nothing about the cinema of horror, apparently vice versa. If you look back after the movie, it really was not supposed to be convincing, it was a low budget and a good one. But it really meant what it was aiming at, aimed at shifting viewers away from pure shock value (and all the disadvantages that its visualizations were much less noticeable in the original versions of VHS). <br /> <br /> I gave this one a high score because it achieved its goal and although it was not even frightening (in the sense of no shock), it made me a little sick and completely paranoid / pessimistic (I did not do it) do not trust anyone for about a week because I did not want to wake up swayed and tortured)
