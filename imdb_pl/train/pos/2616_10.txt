The Lion King 1 1/2 is a very charming story that is to accompany the King of Lviv. In principle, he follows the original story of the Lion King, but with a few twists and turns. In the film, the holes are explained by the point of view of another character. This story is still an original story. <br /> <br /> When it comes to sequels, Disney is not very good at creating value. The one who is the third part of the Lion King (Simba's pride is the second one), He has in fact an original idea, and at the same time includes the fun of the first one. Timon and Pumba are traveling, looking for the perfect place to live. After a long search, they find the place "Hakuna Matata". Then they meet a small lion named Simba and go through many things that parents go through today. <br /> <br /> I think it's a very good movie and I'm happy that I can add it to my collection.
