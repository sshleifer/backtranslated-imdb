Thomas Ince has always had the talent to bring simple stories about family life with fullness and talent. "Italian" is a movie. Solid acting, in particular George Beban, father of the silent actor of children, George Beban, Jr., and wonderful sets convey a realistic impression of early immigrants in New York. This gives the film from 1915 the authenticity, which is unusual in the features of this year. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the present day, and the man (George Beban in modern clothes) reads the story of an Italian immigrant, and then we go to the story in which George plays an immigrant. He raises money to bring his fianc√©e from Italy to America, marry her and has a son with her. But times are difficult and the family is fighting for survival. I wondered why my mother did not breastfeed her child and avoid complications related to the dirty formula, but well, even the early Dream Factory pushed women in 1915. For correct political behavior! <br /> <br /> The best scene in the picture is a situation in which Beban has a chance to take revenge on the boss of the crime, who unintentionally put him in prison and decides on his planned action at the last moment. Very neat. I really liked the effect of the curtain. Great use of lighting in this movie. <br /> <br /> I give "Italy" 8 out of 10.
