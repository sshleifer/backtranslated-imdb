Since I'm not a fan of Snoop Dogg, as an actor, I wanted to check this movie even more. I remember that he gave an interview in the film "Jay Leno" and said he rejected the role in Adam Sandler's comedy "The Longest Courtyard" to play in the film. Of course, Snoop had a serious mission to prove he had actress chops. I am not going to overestimate Snoop for his performance in The Tenants. There are certainly better rappers / actors like Mos Def who could do more with their role. But the point is that Snoop did a "good job". It seems he can not shake off his characteristic body movements and vocal sounds, but even Jack Nicholson is a problem. The point is that I convinced him to the role, and the tension between him and Dylan McDermott captivated me. Incidentally, McDermott gives the best performance in the movie, although his subtle acting will probably be outweighed by not so subtle acting Snoop. Being a great reader and aspiring writer myself, I could not refrain from finding a form and story that was a bit fascinating. It made me worse when Snoop constantly asked McDermott to read his work and criticize him for criticizing. But you know what? I am sure that many writers are like that. His character was supposed to be defective, like McDermott, in his own way. My only mild criticism of the film will be its ending. For some reason it seemed too hasty, although the resolution certainly made sense and was motivated by the characters, not by the story.
