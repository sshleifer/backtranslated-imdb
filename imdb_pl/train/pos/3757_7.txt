As in the case of a group of boys in school, we have to give it a thumbs up. Even Grim Reaper made us smile. These two strange things made me laugh, Bill and Ted were the stupidest, but the funniest ones in the whole movie. This is much better than the first. And yet for some reason I feel that something is missing. Something big. Something important. I made a better home and girls. No, I would say that better villains. Use clones instead of robots. I gave it 7 out of 10 because of these two robots. <br /> <br /> Grim Ripper, do not be afraid that he is not mortally nice, he is funny. When he fell from the sky, I split the gut. Splat, I'm not sure about these aliens. What's up? Scientists? No way.
