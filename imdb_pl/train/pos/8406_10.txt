In 1979 I was a boy at the age of 12. My parents just got an office at home, which was quite new in our area. As a 12-year-old boy I saw tits on TV for the first time. I will never forget the joy of those times. Race cars, a total trip with the worst van, a waterbed, burning herbs, hot chicks from the '70s, love in my Chevy van song, all this was new to me. A complete movie with all the memories you can count on. I have it and I enjoy it once a year. When I watch this movie, I want to get skates, with 4 wheels, not in the strait, go to the park and hunt for chickens with feathery hair. really great memories of youth!
