What happens when someone has so much social unrest that they stop functioning? How can one man get in? When the mundane nonsense that we have to do to become part of society, become too big, what's going on? Frownland investigates these questions. Definitely the original surprising Bronstein debut. The tone is strange and claustrophobic when we enter the mind of a guy named Keith who is so embarrassed that it's difficult for him to create the right opinion. We follow him when he tries to get in touch with people and function day by day. Most of us know such people - people who say "sorry" too much or "I appreciate it" when there is nothing to appreciate. So we know there are such people, but why would anyone want to make a film about them? Well, because it's interesting, and Bronstein and the main actor Dore Mann do a great job. This movie is more or less as commercial as a movie. Several friends filmed it in a few years, saving money. It was shot at 16 mm, and the scratched film is beautifully low. Without a distributor it can be difficult to find, I think it was displayed randomly for the last year. I hope that at some point it will be on DVD. I saw it at the Silent Movie Theater in LA. There were 10 people in the audience, including Crispin Glover, if that tells you something about how strange the movie is. Highly recommended.
