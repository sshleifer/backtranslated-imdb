Old-fashioned! I love it! Corny - just like the TV show was about 40 years ago! Adam and Burt lit the same chemistry on a screen that never ended! They relive the old memories, and the actors who play them in the 1960s show some behind-the-scenes things that are quite interesting. Television from the 1960s was for many of us an eccentric escapism, and this DVD is no exception if you know the original TV program. A fight scene with written Boofs and Bams or whatever is fantastic !! The cinema scene shows clips of villains who have gone. At the end, Frank Gorshin appears. I believed that he died shortly after the DVD was made, so his great merit was that he came back to play the villain for Adam and Burt, just like Batman and Robin many years ago. He did not lose touch! Thanks to Julie Newmar for the re-experience of the role of the villain. In conclusion, I think that this DVD is for great memories and I would like to thank both Adam and Burt for returning and recreating these memories for those of us who remember the original - !!! Thanks boys!!!
