I think this movie is really funny because you have a young black comedian (Chris Rock) who dies and is sent back to earth in the white body of a man aged 50. He does not realize that his behavior should change and continue to function as before. Listens to rap music, sings and plays the stereotypical part of the urban black man. The real humor in this movie was to observe the troubles that this behavior drives him into the black community.
