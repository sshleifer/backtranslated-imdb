Summary: In the morning after his bachelor party, Paul is awakened by his future mother-in-law and discovers that there is a woman next to him. Unfortunately, he is a waitress from the bar, not his fianc√©e. And suddenly it appears everywhere ... a box with tolls on the highway and dinner of his parents-in-law. And it is difficult to keep a secret when her jealous former boyfriend told him to follow and photograph. It's not just about saving his wedding ... it's about survival. <br /> <br /> Comments: Actually much better than expected. It was not a sweet romantic comedy that I expected, but something much more fun, with a bit of an advantage. This movie was not afraid to make fun of it. And Jason Lee is doing a comedy now, especially when his character is half-panicked and in trouble because he's here. And he received nice support from beautiful ladies, Julia Stiles and Selma Blair. I actually thought that Lochlyn Munro was having fun as an ex. <br /> <br /> So more emphasis on comedy than romance, and the end result was good. I liked it very much. <br /> <br /> 7/10
