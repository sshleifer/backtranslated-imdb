I caught this movie late on a Saturday night / Sunday morning with my brother. We drank. This is one of the best burst movies I've ever seen. From the "luxury" ocean liner, which is a "rolling, rolling" ferry, with everything cast-iron to the door with self-adhesive stickers telling the staff, and then seeing the same door used for something else in another scene - this movie is rocking !! The continuity is so weak that you can not help her, but you will notice her, she hits you with holes. In the last scene, he jumps from the lifeboat ferry in the distance. Transfer to his son and a new girl (PR director of ships who knows kung fu and was on the police, but he was fired for doing things in his own way - right) on a ferry very quickly departing from the explosion. ...... Then my father hugs them. How???? Who cares, his magic. There is no one buy-back function in this video. The casino has the size of a large bedroom with one casino table. when you are pursued by villains, there is only one place to hide, you guessed it. Enter the villains who, instead of checking under one table, start shooting four fruit machines and a small corner bar (the bar in the corner of the casino - fantastic). They pass by the only hideout, allowing our Kacper to avoid them and "take them out". <br /> <br /> Bring some buddies, take a few drinks, put on this movie and howl.
