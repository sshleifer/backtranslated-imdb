After reading the review of the film, it is understandable that I began to observe him with a great doubt that it would indeed be good. However, this is one of the best films I have seen in a long time. Most of the reviews I've read said that the complicated plot made tracing too difficult. And although some parts make you confused, the ending involves so many loose ends that you feel like kicking because you lost so much. It's not "Lock, Stock ..." or "Snatch", in the sense that it's not so much fun (it's actually quite dark) and it's much more intelligent, the way you see parts of the scenes from different points of view (in one of the best scenes of the film, Jason Statham spends five minutes in the elevator with a quarrel with himself). The way it's similar to the two films I mentioned is full of unforgettable characters, especially Statham, who gives a fantastic performance as the host, and Ray Liotta, who spends most of the movie in Speedos, but still gives great performance. If you have time and you have time to think about the film and even watch it again, you really begin to see all the symbolism and clues that are shown in the movie. I think it's fantastic, and Guy Ritchie is the director at the top of his game.
