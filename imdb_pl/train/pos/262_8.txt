*** SPOILERY *** *** SPOILERY *** <br /> <br /> This movie "The Divers" is really interesting. I only knew that it was Nazi history, underwater scenes and everyone would speak Danish. But I decided to check it out for one reason, from the fact that history is developing around a sunken German submarine from World War II. I have a fetish for German submarines, especially wrecks where you can dive. So I was a bit skeptical about the Danish part, but I thought that the submarine could weigh this part. Knowing that the Nordic films are not always so good and there are some budget sizes, I was, to put it mildly, very skeptical. <br /> <br /> After watching I was ... surprised. <br /> <br /> I had some thoughts about the fact that actors are not enough to see how some of them are very young, especially the two main actors. It was not a problem, both work very well. Like other actors who mainly consist of people aged 50 and more. This creates interesting interactions between young and old, often invisible on the screen. In any case, it is not unique, but quite rare. And everything is fine. <br /> <br /> When it comes to Danish, it is almost impossible to understand. But it was not a problem, it had subtitles. <br /> <br /> Another issue was the submarine itself, I suspected that there would be internal and underwater shots underwater. Recognizing that their budget is small, I thought it might be appropriate at best, and at the same time terrible at the worst. Again I was surprised that the outer scenes of the wreck are beautiful and the interior scenes are very realistic. Having a fetish for German submarines, I knew what a submarine should look like, especially inside, and I was not disappointed. The team carried out serious research. Everything is fine. <br /> <br /> I suspect that more people than me will watch this movie just to see scenes from the wreck, so I feel that I have to issue a "warning". The submarine in the film is not a real model that existed during the war. It's a special goal. But to give you a hint as to what to expect, it is a cross between type VII, type IX and Japanese transport similar to I-52. It is a good god and a good wreck. <br /> <br /> The setting is on a Danish island or peninsula, I do not remember. It is summer and two brothers travel to their grandfather to celebrate the coming of summer, like every year. Their grandfather is a kind of sailor. The pictures are pretty nice, lots of beautiful summer scenes on the island's docks, some newly discovered teenage love, nice diving weather and a general sense of "perfection". Once again, everything is fine. <br /> <br /> The plot has many guests of a suspect type, a group of men employs one of the boats, an old trawler and his crew. One of the visitors, a man over fifty, has a tattooed eagle and a swastika on his back. Older inhabitants of the island remember that the German submarine was sunk at the end of World War II and since then have been rumored about Nazi gold in depth. Grandfather was one of the young men who were looking for a submerged submarine soon after German bodies began to sail ashore in 1945. A submarine was never found. <br /> <br /> WHAT TO EXPECT <br /> <br /> The key elements are Nazi experiments, Nazi history, treasure hunt, mystery, rivalry, teen love, conspiracy and ... surprise. <br /> <br /> *** WARNING - SPOILER *** <br /> <br /> I did not expect some supernatural elements to appear in this film and it surprised me. Not being a big fan of supernatural events, it nevertheless fits well into history and is not a problem. This is not "From Dusk to Dawn", where at the end everyone turns into vampires. This is a bit more subtle. <br /> <br /> GENERAL: A really good movie, I gave it to him 8. Some of the reason is that it's not a Hollywood movie with unlimited resources. Later I found out that he had a good budget and that some of the actors were experienced Danish veterans. But even if it was a Hollywood production, I would give it 7 or 8. It's definitely worth it. Yes, the story of the child in a certain way, but then again a mature story. It has a lot of tension and a wonderful aura of adventure, which was very attractive to me. And again, the pictures are really nice. <br /> <br /> / Medusa 2001 <br /> <br />
