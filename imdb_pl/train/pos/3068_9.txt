From the reading of previous comments, I know that this movie went straight to the cable. Well, I paid to see it in the theater and I'm glad I did it because it was visually an impressive film. Most of the settings seem to have originated in the early 1960s (with the exception of a psychiatrist's office that was dated otherwise), and if you leave the Neve Campbell sequence, the whole movie has a fuzzy mood in the early 1960s. And the use of restaurants in the film was fascinating. For the director for the first time, whose origin, I think, is in writing, has a big eye. In the first ten minutes I felt that the plot is not credible, so I willingly suspended my disbelief and went on a ride. When it comes to acting and the image of a father-son, mother-son, husband-wife, parent-child relationship, the film was hit. William H. Macy, a pleasure to watch, seems to fill the void left by the late Tony Perkins if Magnolia is any indication. Tracey Ullman as a neglected wife was quite moving for me. It was a three-dimensional image of a figure too often perceived by the society as two-dimensional. Of course Donald Sutherland can add this to his collection of unforgettable portraits. My parents' presentation (Bain / Sutherland) reminded me indirectly about BUFFALO '66 Vincent Gallo, though a bit subdued! I would definitely pay to see the director's second film. He has the self-discipline of a b-crimefil director from the 1950s (something P.T.Anderson will never have!), But he has a visual style and the way the actors draw attention.
