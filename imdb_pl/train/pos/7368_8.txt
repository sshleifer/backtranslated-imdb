I think that the band behind this movie did a very good job with the limitations they had. only 300,000 pounds and 7 weeks to write, film and edit the whole, which in my opinion is an achievement in itself. although this movie is not intended for the masses (as a young innocent teenager is killed and the story contains homo-eroticism), I think that this film is a tragic tragedy and you are deeply involved in the story of more sadness that you feel. more in relation to Heaton because of the love he feels, but he does not come back. <br /> <br /> is one of my favorite British movies that I liked a lot and I would watch it again. I think it's a pity that the film is not well heard.
