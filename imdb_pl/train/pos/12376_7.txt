"The Sentinel" (1977), with an all-star cast so impressive that it almost seems like "Mad Mad Mad World" horror movies, is still a very scary movie focusing on the relatively unknown actress Cristina Raines. In this one of them is a model game, Alison Parker, who moves to brownstone in Brooklyn Heights, i.e. (and I do not think I give too much at this late date) very close to the gates of hell. And as a tenant in this building, he suffers from much worse conditions than a leaky plumbing and sporadically a bedbug, to put it mildly! Indeed, the scene where Alison encounters a noisy neighbor upstairs is really frightening, and certainly should send ice water flowing along the backs of most spectators. Despite the complaints of many critics regarding Raines' acting abilities, I thought she was okay, more than she was skilfully sticking to her own scenes with Ava Gardner, Burgess Meredith, Arthur Kennedy, Chris Sarandon and Eli Wallach. The picture consists of a really amazing conclusion and although some of the feature lines are unexplained, I felt more than happy. As the book "DVD Delirium" says, "every movie with Beverly D'Angelo and Sylvia Miles as topless cannibal lesbians in leotards can not be all bad"! By the way, yesterday I went to 10 Montague Terrace in Brooklyn Heights to look at Sentinel House. Yes, he is still there, and although he is deprived of a heavy ivy coat and deprived of a blind priest / nun in a window on the top floor, he looks the same as in this picture. If this house really sits at the top of the entrance to hell, I understand that hell is ... Brooklyn Queens Expressway. But we New Yorkers know it for some time!
