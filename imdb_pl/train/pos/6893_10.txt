Gerard Phillipe is absolutely perfect in this movie, funny, affectionate, brave and lover. It gives a better dimension to the film, which is even a masterpiece, as well as other actors (Gina Lollobrigida: miaoooou !!), as well as the rhythm history. Never boring, always creating new emotions: for me the best French movie of all time.
