It was surprisingly intelligent for the TV movie and quite in line with my experience of bulimia. In fact, he was well researched and I can only assume he was written by someone who has had similar experience because he had all the little details. The characters were pretty well drawn, and the performances of Mare Winningham and Alison Lohman were great. I think I like it the most that they made it specific and intelligent, and there was no imagination of Beth's bulimia (it was not some "diet out of hand" caused by the pressure put on girls by the media, pressure, which we will not really address ... "). Her mother was not completely oblivious - all too often on TV, they take up a problem that EVERYONE is aware of and try to tell us that their heroes are the last people on earth who do not have ("Diabetes? What is this?" Oh, my world is all crooked, doctor, please, explain it to me as if I was a small child "etc.). It was brilliant that her mother was a psychologist and she did not even see the characters. And the scenes in which Beth was casting were not too melodramatic and sensational, and concentrated more on the need for bulimic secrecy and their lack of control. The scene in which Beth tells her mother that she is bulimic would make me cry if there were no other people in the room. <br /> <br /> Okay, so I liked these pieces. What did not work so well for me is the ending that came back to the area of ​​the TV movie that we know and do not love especially, but I think they had to end it. "You can also cure your child's eating disorder if you have lots and lots of money and live in America ..." <br /> <br /> And can I say again that I really like Mare Winningham. She's wonderful.
