It was released in France on DVD a few years ago - I would like it to be re-released with English subtitles. Do not confuse this with the remake of Penelope Cruz, who gets poor reviews. Gerard Phillippe is a peasant who tells the fairy that he will marry the king's daughter. He sets out to join the army and go to war. His love is, however, Gina Lollabrigida in the early film for her. I will not end it. Gerard Phillippe died a few years later, at a young age, a great loss for moviedom.
