I saw this movie in 2005 at the Palm Springs International Festival, and out of the 14 films that I saw there, I would include this # 4. The 900+ Theater was full and finally received a standing ovation. It was classic Peter Falk, if you're a fan of Falk and showed a lot of chemistry between the characters of Peter Falk and Paul Reiser. The title of the film seemed long and too strange. I am surprised that it did not happen at all. It was much better than most of the garbage that throws you at the largest studios. Maybe for the adult, because it was intended for baby boomers and older listeners. Many people can refer to the situation in this movie. You will probably like it for some time when people watch this movie and consider it a jewel. I would rate it 8.0 to 8.5 on a scale of 10 and definitely recommend it.
