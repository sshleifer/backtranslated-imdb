Two years ago, I watched "Matador" in the cinema and I loved everything in this film. Of course I was totally impressed by Pierce Brosan's great role. Yesterday I caught this movie again on TV, so I looked at it a bit deeper. Now I can say with certainty that this movie is not so special, but you just have to "love it because of one man. <br /> <br /> Brosnan raises my rating in the amazing performance of Julian Noble, a tired hit man who has no friends. Soon, Julian meets Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear) in Mexico City, a man who's unlucky: his son died in an accident, his job is not going well, and he is not sure he can stop Bean's wife (Hope Davis). br /> <br /> I have always liked such films; a crime film with a big accent of humor. Mostly, humor comes from Brosnan, who tells jokes about dwarfs with a great ... or one of my favorite poems in this movie: "I look like a hooker from Bangkok on a Sunday morning, after leaving the city by a jacket". Brosnan says it's his charm while he drinks his margarita as usual. I also like the typical American face of Greg, Kinnear, in the role of a loser who is very lively, because there are many people like Danny Wright. <br /> <br /> So I recommend that you watch the best Brosnan role ever. It will make you smile and admire at the same time. Great Brosnan in a not so great movie.
