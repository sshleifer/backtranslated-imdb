A film about Gandhi in India requires courage in which it is not shown as a man who can not do anything bad. This film shows how Mahatma was not a decent father (at least in the eyes of his son). <br /> <br /> The performances are great, fantastic photos, fantastic direction, but the film is dragging. If the intention was to make this movie without any cash expectations, which I think is in this case, it is a great test, but if the creators expected it to be a commercial success, the fate of the film was doomed on the day they chose this topic ... <br /> <br /> in 20 years, this movie will be remembered for the brilliant portrait of Harilala by Akshaye Khann. He deserves an Oscar nomination for this film. To be honest, his is not the only show worth applauding, Shefali Chhaya is also wonderful ... <br /> <br /> Watch the scene where Harilal hears about his father's death. No dialogues, no screams, but Khanna's dumbfounded shot. This is one of the greatest scenes in the history of Kino <br/> <br /> Gandhi, My Father is not at all an exciting cinema, but yes, his excellent cinema and you have to watch. Brilliant Attempt ..
