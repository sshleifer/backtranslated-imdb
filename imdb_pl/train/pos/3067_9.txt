What a surprising surprise in late TV. If I just read a short feature list on the TV list before watching the movie, I would pass it. The idea for a movie about hit-man-seeing-shrink-want-to-the-business-and-fall-in-love .... sounds banal. But the movie works. From the beginning of the film, it's clear that the man wears a burden on his shoulders before he even utters a word. The look and style of the film is perfect. dark, but not disgustingly so. <br /> <br /> In addition to the family aspect of the hit-man who provides a little surrealism, Macy's character struggles with his marriage and father's control. Macy is showing her suppressed sadness, and his bedtime talks with her young son are amazing. The young boy shows his acting skills much longer than his years, and the interaction between father and son is so natural, personal and loving. <br /> <br /> It's one of the best movies I've seen in a while, and I can not believe I came across it accidentally on TV late at night.
