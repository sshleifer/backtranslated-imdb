This movie was great. <br /> <br /> The plot was ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The action sequences have been invented. <br /> <br /> But as long as you can light up enough to laugh, it was a very exciting romp, connecting Keystone Cops and Lone Ranger. <br /> <br /> The bad guys were more stupid than the bad ones. Good guys were not very good. Black actors played normal characters, not black stereotypes. <br /> <br /> Turning on the child has added a good accent. Otherwise, the liking would be a bit difficult. <br /> <br /> I have to disagree about acting. Overall, he was very good. I really wanted to hit Judge Reinhold. <br /> <br /> And besides, is not this a sign of a really good movie that wants to hit Judge Reinhold?
