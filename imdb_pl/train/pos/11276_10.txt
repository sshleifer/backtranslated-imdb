It may be hard to believe, but this movie has been condemned as immoral from a larger number of pulpits than any other film made before the blues Hayes Code was imposed. Yes, the priests really told their flocks that anyone who went to see this movie commits a mortal sin. <br /> <br /> I do not invent it. They had several reasons: <br /> <br /> Article: Jane likes sex. It was shown that she and Tarzan were waking up one morning in a shelter at the tops of the trees. It stretches sensuously and with a coquettish look says "Tarzan, you were a bad boy!" So they not only have sex, but also have sex in sex! A few years later, according to the Hays Code, people (especially women) should not be portrayed as enjoying sex. <br /> <br /> Article: Jane prefers innocent, if wise and resourceful, savages (Tarzan) to a civilized, respectable man from nine to five (Holt). When Holt at first impresses her with a nice dress from London, she waves a little; when Holt tries to kill Tarzan, and Holt and Jane are convinced he is dead, he waves a lot. But when she realizes that her man is very alive, the attractions of civilization disappear for her. Why not? Tarzan's and Jane's relationship is egalitarian: he lacks "civilized" insecurity, which would force him to claim that he is "the head of his wife." To run it, he lacks many "civilized" suspensions, such as jealousy. When Holt and his buddy arrive, Tarzan greets them warmly, knowing full well that Holt is Jane's old flame. When Holt gets her in a London gown and dances slowly with her on a portable record player, Tarzan falls out of the tree and pulls out a knife. Jealous? No. He is only cautious about the strange musical machine, because he has never seen it before. After explaining it is cool. <br /> <br /> Article: Civilized Holt is dirty. Savage Tarzan is innocently sexy. As Jane slips into Holt's illuminated tent, Holt begins to observe her figure as she turns into a fancy dress. In contrast, after Tarzan jokingly removes the dress, digs her into a hole in the pool and dives behind her, follows the most delicious erotic scene nude in all movies: the couple spends five minutes in a charming ballet with water (the scene was filmed in three versions - dressed , topless and naked - the scene was cut before the movie was released, but the nude version was restored in the now available movie.) And when Jane emerges, and Cheetah the chimpanzee steals her dress just to tease, Jane explains that her irritation results only from the proximity of "civilized" people and their separation. Where is the "universal suffering" so dear to seminarians? Nowhere, where. Another reason why the movie was suspended was considered sinful. <br /> <br /> Article: The view that man is the crown of creation, and animals are here only for the use and convenience of man, he takes a hard beat. Holt and his friend want to be led to the "elephant cemetery" to get the ivory and take her home. They want Tarzan to lead them to the aforementioned cemetery. You, the reader, think "Fatty chance!" And you're right. He is in shock. He calls "Sleep the elephants!" Which explains everything to him. Jane explains the feelings of Tarzan, which the two "gentlemen" consider funny. <br /> <br /> Article: Jane, a civilized woman, is much more resourceful than the two civilized men she accompanies. Holt and a friend blow him up and are besieged by hostile tribes and wild animals. Jane is calm. While the boys panic, he takes over the command, barking at them and letting his rifles through. <br /> <br /> Subject: Jane's costume is a kind of poncho with nothing underneath. (The original idea was that it was supposed to be topless, with leaves artistically blocking the nipples, which happens in one short scene.) <br /> <br /> At the end, several men from the fabric complained because the film was called "Tarzan" and his friend "instead of" Tarzan and his wife ". No comment! <br /> <br /> Of course, Tarzan, who has been restored to health by his monkey friends, comes to the rescue, plays white hunters and urges elephants and African vectors to return ivory to the holy place where it came from. The End. <br /> <br /> So you have it. A completely subversive movie. Like all other films with complex and interesting women (see, for example, Opsessed with Rita Hayworth and Raymond Massey), which were such a fluid genre in the early 1930s and which were brought to such a violent end by the adoption of the Hays Code. <br /> <br /> The joy of life of this film is best reflected in the soprano version of the famous shout of Tarzan Jane. A nice touch, which unfortunately was abandoned in future productions. <br /> <br /> Let's hear it for artistic freedom, feminist Jane and sex.
