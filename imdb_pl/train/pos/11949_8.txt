Woody Allen's second film in London. The Tarot Card Murderer kills prostitutes in London. Aspiring journalist Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson) gets a tip that he can be Lord Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). He starts to romance him, but he falls in love quickly. Sid Waterman (Woody Allen) is a stage magician who does not like what he sees. <br /> <br /> I like it more than in the "Match Point" category from last year. It was shorter and moved much faster. The story is old, but I was funny and it supposed me to the end. It really is not a comedy, but a mystery with some very good comedy lines (everything from Allen, of course). This is not one of the best Allen, but he is much better than his worst. <br /> <br /> Acting is mostly very good. Allen is angry, but he played this character a million times before and is tiring. But Johansson and Jackman are simply great - they look fantastic and give two very attractive and reliable performances. Also Allen (surprisingly) is working on her sex appeal - there is a sequence in which both of them are in swimsuits to show off their pretty bodies. The only real burden is that Allen is still not sure how to shoot London. It's not as far away as it was in "Match Point" - it might just be better when it goes on. <br /> <br /> Worth to see. I give him 8.
