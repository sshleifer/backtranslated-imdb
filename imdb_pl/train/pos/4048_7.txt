Rohmer departs from the ordinary portraits of the French middle class to tell this costume drama about the aristocrat's difficulties during the French Revolution. What's more attractive in "La Anglaise ..." (in addition to the story itself), is the fabulous aesthetics Rohmer achieved. The paintings have also been digitally decorated, thanks to which they look like baroque pictures. At times, you can not really tell if you are watching a movie or a series of photos at the Louvre Musseum. Each shot is like a work of art. <br /> <br /> * My rating: 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> ---------------- <br /> <br /> --- ----------- - <br /> <br /> ------------ <br /> <br /> - --------- ---------
