If you are a fan of Airplane type movies, you must see! In the 1920s and 1930s, Johnny Dangerously has not only great actors, but also great lines. "Knock down the date wall, knock down the date wall and knock down dates # @ $% # @ $ wall". "You should not hang me on a johnny hook" or "Sounds like laying on Johnny." This is certainly a parody of James Cagney's old films and often refers to them. There is a great scene when Jhonnys goes on death row and has a priest ready to escape. Listen carefully to the readings of false priests, it's quite funny. Another great scene is when Dom Delauise plays the Pope. Observe his reaction to Johnny after tips on the Pope, many say without making a sound. I recommend this movie to all those who like to laugh or are lovers of old movies.
