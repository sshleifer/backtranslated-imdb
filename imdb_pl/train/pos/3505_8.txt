I have no idea how IMDb sorts reviews, but I know that, as is often the case at Amazon.com, there is a striking number of very negative reviews of the movie that repeat the same, somewhat obscure points of speaking, almost literally. Campaign? Only IMDb knows. <br /> <br /> When it comes to this movie: it's fine. It's a funny, charming and very simple movie. <br /> <br /> It's been over ten years since I worked in Brooklyn, I lived in Queens and I visited relatives in South Bronx. But I did not find anything inauthentic or exploitative in these children. Is grandma bizarre? Yes. Do they confirm and conspire this dialogue? Yes, thankfully, they do. Is it possible to make other films set in LES and containing Dominikanów / Portorykańczyków children? You. Does this film make a crime? as some comments (astroturf) suggest. Hardly. Let a thousand plastic flowers blossom. <br /> <br /> This is better than any episode of Degrassi JR. High or Degrassi High. Scoff's comparison, but we've never had it, and deep down I'm affected by the humbleness of this movie with a purpose and a tender spirit. <br /> <br /> I would say I would like to know the story behind this whole blow! :-RE
