In Panic In The Streets, Richard Widmark plays US Navy physician, whose week was brutally interrupted by a corpse containing plague. As policeman Paul Douglas actually indicates that the guy died of two bullets in his chest. This is not the point, they both become reluctant partners, trying to find assassins and all other vulnerable people. <br /> <br /> As any number of people have noticed, for some reason the director Elia Kazan did not bother to throw small parts with anyone who sounds like from Louisiana. Being in New Orleans, where history takes place, I can personally confirm it. Richard Widmark and his wife Barbara Bel Geddes can be justified, because as a navy physician he could be assigned there, but for those who are natives, it does not work. <br /> <br /> But with the scourge and news kept in secret, the PD of New Orleans launches the network of the underground world. The dead guy left the ship from Europe and had underground connections. The wise guy from New Orleans, played by Jack Palance, jumps over a whole bunch of erroneous conclusions and begins to harass the cousin of a deceased guy who begins to show signs of plague. Palance got enthusiastic reviews in the first film in which he received a notification. <br /> <br /> Personally, my favorite in this movie is Zero Mostel. It happened just before Mostel was blacklisted and more or less at that time made a specialization in games, they were tough guys who are really losers. He plays the same role in the movie Humphrey Bogart, The Enforcer. Unfortunately, I can identify with Mostel in this last scene of the chase, in which he and Palanka are hunted by Widmark, Douglas and half the police in New Orleans. Seeing that the challenge of Zero trying to keep up with Palance was something else, because I'm now in the Zero league in the heft section. <br /> <br /> Kazan continued the action in a good clip, there is very little downtime in this movie. If it was less, it would be Indiana Jones. Panic In The Streets won the Oscar for the best original script this year. <br /> <br /> Kazan also made good use of the New Orleans wharf and the French Quarter. Some of the same shots are later used in On the Waterfront. In fact, the panic in the streets is that people do not squeak when they really should in their own interest. Very similar to On the Waterfront. <br /> <br /> Panic on the streets makes everyone proud of what is associated with it. Why Elia Kazan would not have a decent New Orleans sounding in small roles.
