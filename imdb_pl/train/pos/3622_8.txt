I knew that I would see it when I saw the first preview. Dennis Quaid was one of the reasons, but the topic of sticking to your dreams appeals to me. People talk about it as a movie for children, but I think it's a movie for the baby boomers who will come to terms with aging, infirm parents, our own mortality, our children growing up and leaving us, and all the other things that they never we did not think it would happen to us. <br /> <br /> The film does not fall into the trap of tragedy; it's about what it means to live your dreams when you have a real life. <br /> <br /> Quaid is too small for a jug, but it makes it look good, and Rachel Griffiths does a small role as a wife in thoughtful, layered performance. Working with the camera is slow and sweet. When they combined this movie, they omitted everything that was not necessary. Very good.
