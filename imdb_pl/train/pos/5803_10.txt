Wow, I forgot how great the movie was until I stumbled across it in the garage. It's a kind of strange combination of biography of Michael Jackson, a collection of musical vignettes and stories of a superhero fighting to save small children. Vignettes are good (especially Speed ​​Demon), but the best part of this movie is the superhero segment, in which Michael Jackson turns into a car, a robot, and finally a spaceship (and just as strange as it seems). Joe Pesci is funny and has enough cool pictures and great music to play! <br /> <br /> The real gem, however, is the amazing movie "Smooth Criminal", which makes the movie worth the same!
