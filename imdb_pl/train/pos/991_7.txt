I'm really shocked to see the number of reviews that absorb this movie. This film was not supposed to be a "deeply thought out" movie, which seems to be the opinion of most reviewers. In fact, it seems that if ANY movie does not give you insight into your life and a deep, twisted, amazing storyline, you would rate it at 1 or 2. Do not destroy the movie because you do not like genre, people. <br /> <br /> This movie was an action / comedy movie and it was all meant to be. And in the case of action / comedy, it was very well done. I was rather surprised that I liked it as much as I did, I was never really a fan of Jamie Foxx and I had an abused storyline that she has. <br /> <br /> The plot was nothing spectacular, using a typical criminal to get out of prison and being thrown into a bad guy's conspiracy, trying to clean up his act (see Blue Streak, Hudson Hawk, 48 hours etc.), but he was heated with a touch of technological turn. Now "bad" is really "good", and the TRUE "bad guy" is uber-geek. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx is a convincingly humorous game, but at the same time he is quite intelligent and serious hero and did not try to overdo it with the humorous side of the film. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a deep storyline such as in "Matrix" or a drama like "Of Mice and Men" this movie is not for you. But if you like a harsh action, perfect filming at a fast pace and an occasional turn of humor, this movie will not let you down. Normally, I would rate it at around 8 (on the same level as Die Hard Trilogy), but instead give it 10 to try to get the result to what it SHOULD be. <br /> <br />
