Since the fourth year of my life I have been a lover of Hindi films, but I have never seen such a moving and impressive film in my life, especially as a Hindi movie. In the last few years I have stopped watching contemporary Hindi films and returned to watching the classics (Teesri Kasam, Mere Huzoor, Madhumati, Mother India, Sholay, etc.). But this movie changed everything. This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It turned out that I was not just moving, but it turned out to be very informative for someone who is the first-generation Indian growing up in America. It helped me to understand my own family history, which has always been something very abstract to me. But to "see" this, feel it and understand that it helped me to sympathize with the generations before me and the struggle that the Indians survived. The film helped me put many things in perspective, especially considering the current events in the world. I never thought that a movie could change the way I think that way before ... he did. The plot is fantastic, the game is excellent and the direction is impeccable. Two thumbs up!
