Director Edward Montagne does in just over an hour what he can not do to other, more expensive and more hypnotic films. Mr. Montagne shows us the police story written by Phillip H. Reisman Jr., although he is not the best in this genre, he keeps the viewer in everything that happens. <br /> <br /> This is clearly a type B movie. The best thing about "The Tattooed Stranger" is the opportunity to see how New York looked in those years. The crystal-clear cinematography of William O. Steiner has been preserved for years or has been beautifully restored. <br /> <br /> The opening sequence has great views of New York. Later, we take us to Brooklyn to the Dumbo section, and then we travel to Bronx and Gun Hill Road with many souvenir shops in the area. <br /> <br /> John Miles and Walter Kinsella did a great job of detective team. Patricia Barry is ideal as a plant expert from the Natural History Museum. Jack Lord, who in his career did more things, is seen in a non-speaking role. <br /> <br /> It was great to watch the city as it was because it does not exist.
