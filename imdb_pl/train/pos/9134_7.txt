"Purple Rain" has never been a critic's favorite, but is an iconic classic - and deserves it. If you're a Prince fan, this is for you. <br /> <br /> The main thread is Prince, seeing his abusive parents in and falling in love with her. Believe it or not, this movie is not just singing and dancing. There are many intense scenes and it is very sympathetic. Sometimes it's fun, but when it works, it really works. Very hit and miss. <br /> <br /> No one can really play in the movie. Each comes from one of Prince's actions, such as "The Time" and "Vanity 6". Still, it adds to the film's charm. When the prince is on the screen, he lights it and it's great to see him on his commercial top. <br /> <br /> In summary, go and see if you love a prince like me. If you're not a fan, you'll make one of you.
