This reproduction of the infamous 1959 murders in Kansas, based on the book Capote, was filmed by Brooks and the operator Hall in black and white, giving it a documentary character. There are good results from Blake and Wilson as killers, and Forsythe as a policeman who is pursuing them. Pre-murder scenes filmed in the real house where the crime took place, with the soundtrack of whistling winds, are quite intense and chilling in their veins. Brooks directs a lot of spirits and uses some interesting transitions between scenes. The only complaint is that it is a bit too long, with a long drawn out and slightly preaching.
