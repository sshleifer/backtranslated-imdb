Although most Americans have little knowledge of his work beyond Star Wars, Alec Guinness has created an amazing job - especially in the 1940s and 1950s - from dramas to bizarre comedies. I especially love his comedies because they are so well made and seem so natural and real on screen - they are very different from the usual Hollywood tariff. <br /> <br /> In saying this, it was a movie that aroused my interest in these films. His plot was so strange and charming that it is very unlikely that the film would be made anywhere - except for Ealing Studios - which he particularly liked "small" movies like this one. <br /> <br /> Guinness is a small scientist who works for a textile company. I want to experiment to create a synthetic fabric that is indestructible, although I do not work for the company as a researcher, but for cleaning work! So he has a tendency to sneak into laboratories (during the day if no one suspects or at night) and tries to reinvent himself. He gets caught many times (eg after blowing up a laboratory) and receives a shoe until one day he can do it! Then, despite the importance of the discovery, he launches a completely unexpected chain of events - and then the fun begins. <br /> <br /> The film is a wonderful satire that ridicules industry, trade unions, government and people in general.
