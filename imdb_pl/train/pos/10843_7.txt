What happens to the washed rock-n-roll stars in the late 90's? They start the return / exit route. At least that's what the members of Strange Fruit (fictional) rock group from the 70s do. <br /> <br /> Tony (Stephen Rea) has a license for vending machines selling condoms when he hits the son of the promoter of the famous music festival. It was at this festival in the seventies that Strange Fruit broke up. The seventies are "retro" and the time is suitable for a wide wave. He sets out to look for other band members. <br /> <br /> Part of this band was the death and replacement of Keith, the singer and genius songwriter. The band was known for their excessive lifestyle and now everyone is returning to the working class from which they came. Beano, the drummer, played by Timothy Spall (who was brilliant at Secrets and Lies) is a layman, the bassist is a roofer and their vocalist is still a rocker. Although he owns a huge estate, he was forced to sell it because his property did not survive. Brian, the lead guitarist, is dead, so the young guitarist is hired to replace him. <br /> <br /> A little reluctantly the team agrees to try again. Abandoning their daily work, they begin to practice and their manager approaches the label to release their albums. But he wants them to start touring first. And so they came to the club across Europe. The club scene is not good for those overweight, outdated, old rockers. <br /> <br /> It's on the road that the film really is growing. All old conflicts change, and the characters of Keith and Brian float in the air. Everyone stays together because everyone is looking for a second chance for the size that has escaped them earlier. And they rediscover the part of interpersonal chemistry that made playing together so pleasant. <br /> <br /> Still Crazy starts as Spinal Tap II, but gradually becomes a more dramatically concentrated movie, following the team members' relationships. Although it is still a very funny movie, evolving characters, fighting the death of Brian and Keith and their own personal demons, make the movie work.
