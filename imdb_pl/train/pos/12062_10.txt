This movie scares me from the first day I saw him. <br /> <br /> My mother watched him when she was on TV in '92. I remember waking up in the middle of the night through her tearful wanderings when my father helped her up the stairs. <br /> <br /> She said something like, "Do not let me take her" or something like that. I asked her what made her so upset and told me that she was watching "The Woman in Black." <br /> <br /> So of course I had to watch it and although I was only eleven years old, she let me. It frightened me. Ever since I watched this, I was immune to horror!
