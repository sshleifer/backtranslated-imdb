Watching this early work from DeMille, I was once again strengthened that the early DeMille is much better than the late DeMille. His attention to the use of light in scenes is extraordinary. Its stimulation is very good, which allows you to say a lot in about an hour. It is a pity he was not as intuitive in the style of his later sound films as he seemed to be in his silent movies. <br /> <br /> This was the first movie I saw Cleo Ridgely in. She was unusual, rather restrained, and yet she conveyed a wide spectrum of emotions. <br /> <br /> The ending is great.
