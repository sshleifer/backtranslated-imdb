This movie was very funny. The soundtrack (Bian Adams) is simply beautiful and inspiring. Even more impressive is that Brian Adams also does all the songs in French. The score is also uplifting and dramatic. <br /> <br /> The film was made from a combination of traditional animation combined with computer images. The result is really stunning. I watch this movie at least once a week with my children and never tire it. The story is fascinating and well told. <br /> <br /> I do not understand anyone who would rate the movie less than 7. Definitely the guardian in my home.
