On this day after a bike ride, lying on a lake in a nature reserve, spending half an hour feeding and talking to a donkey who lived in a beautiful field with small wood, this movie made absolutely sense to me. br /> <br /> The movie images were beautiful and that's all you need. Turn off the conscious control of the mind and the work done. <br /> <br /> I remembered Barak (1992), but with the lesson from the previous paragraph. <br /> <br /> This comment requires a minimum of ten lines, ten lines are a minimum of 9 lines, but ten. After completing the counting of all lines, you realize that there are less than ten, although less than ten lines are all that is needed for my comment.
