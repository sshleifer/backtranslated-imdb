Scott is right. The best 2-man sword duel ever made in the movie is in the middle of the movie. Sword fights with many fighters are not the best, though quite good. However, the fight inside is the best even compared to the Japanese samurai movies. Scenes with Chinese swords in my opinion have never surpassed the Japanese in terms of entertainment. Especially in scenes in which one guy has to fight a group of enemies, Japanese films stand out, eg Lone Wolf and Cub series. Although duels in the Japanese cinema last only seconds or at most a minute, the sheer intensity of these moments made them better. But this is one example in which Chinese fencing exceeds the Japanese. The scene in the middle of this movie was a five-minute fight with the most amazing choreography in history. Other fights in this movie are also good, but even if it sucks, it will get 7 for this one scene. If you have not seen it, you must. John Woo is a man.
