My love for Chris Rock differs depending on his films, I hated him after Lethal Weapon 4, but I hated everyone in the movie after him. I like him when he is himself and does not restrain himself, as in Dogma. Well, it's still his best, I did not expect it to be that good. Chris Rock delivers a sweet, wonderful story backed by the funniest comedy I've seen for a long time. I loved it.
