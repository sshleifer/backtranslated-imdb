I will be honest: this is not Sholay. But you can not get Sholay every week. In fact, in this movie you could see the clear signatures "not without my daughter" (Sally Field, 1991). However, like most inspired films, this one was inspired, well-prepared and well made. Nana Patekar, as usual, has a tendency to overdo it with hysteria, but everyone else is praiseworthy. Especially for Dipti Naval: I've seen her after a long time, but she has not lost any grace. In fact, it was much better than when I last saw it. Another of the Bollywood stars that seem to be more beautiful with age? <br /> <br /> In total, a nice watch.
