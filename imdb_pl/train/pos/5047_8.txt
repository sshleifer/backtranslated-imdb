Actor Paxton debuted as a director in this bloodcurdling, dark and competent thriller with a widowed mechanic (Paxton himself), who forces his two sons to participate in brutal murders in axes, claiming that the victims are not people at all, but "demons" and that they were chosen by God to destroy these "demons". All this was said in retrospection by one of the sons, now an adult (Matthew McConaughey) to the skeptical FBI agent (Powers Boothe). <br /> <br /> It's hard to forget this movie automatically; better than most serial killers, it's a winding and disturbing story told in a simple way with minimal amount of cinema tricks. Paxton, praised, barely shows any blood to the end. Well everyone, especially two actors (Jeremy Sumpter from the last "Peter Pan" and Matt O'Leary from "Spy Kids 2" and "Domestic Disturbance") behaved well. The only reason I took away points at all is because I understand that some people may have stomach problems. In any case, this is an unusual thriller with a decent script. <br /> <br /> 8/10
