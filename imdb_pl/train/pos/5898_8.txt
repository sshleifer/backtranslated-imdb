Penny Princess finds an American working girlfriend, Yolande Donlon, heiress of the small kingdom, which lies in this triangle where France, Italy and Switzerland meet with Lampidorra. It seems that Lampidorrans owes bills all over Europe, and the main occupation of the country is smuggling because of its geography. An American multimillionaire buys this place, but dies before he gets the title. His closest heir is Donlan. <br /> <br /> But of course, the estate must go through falls in America and what do Lampidorrans do? Especially that Donlan, who became a princess, forbade smuggling. <br /> <br /> Enter Dirka Bogarde, who travels to Switzerland to learn more about the cheese industry. It seems that Lampidorrans has a kind of cheese, which they jokingly call Schmeeze. With several strokes on the way, Schmeeze solves all financial, geopolitical and romantic problems between Donlan and Bogard. <br /> <br /> How Schmeeze works, well, this is a trick to the whole movie. But here's a hint. In Lover Come Back Jack Kruschen could get the Schmeeze secret when he was busy making VIPs for Rock Hudson and his advertising agency. <br /> <br /> Anyway Penny Princess is a charming blend of British farce and romantic comedy. Yolande Donlon once again plays a role in which Marilyn Monroe would be cast if the film was made on this side of the pond. Dirk Bogarde was well manned in a role that was at the beginning of his career as a romantic heartbeat before anyone else suspected he had the chops he had. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie was shown at three in the morning at TCM. But at least I found a reason to be grateful for insomnia.
