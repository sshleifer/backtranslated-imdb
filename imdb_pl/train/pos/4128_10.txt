With all the violence on TV and local news, the refreshing thing is that there is no violence or adult language, and yet it is fun. My children are waiting impatiently for us every week. Each of us has a favorite chef and favorite judges. We all like Elton Brown. We love learning the background of the main ingredient, unique vegetables and spices. We play together at home to guess who will be the winner. <br /> <br /> It's a great hour of entertainment as well as information. The best of all in our hussle, bussle life, is the time that the family spends together.
