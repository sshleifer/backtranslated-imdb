About 50 years have passed since the film about romance and mysticism was created. The only two movies I can come up with are Enchanted April (1992) and The Enchanted Cottage (1945). Both films used great actors, not stars. In both films, all actors gave their best romantic performances. <br /> <br /> "Enchanted April" is about four English women after the First World War who are dissatisfied with their lives and find happiness in Italy during the holidays. It is amazing "Enchanted April" was created in 1992. It stands out as a pleasant classic.
