Jim Carrey and Morgan Freeman together with Jennifer Aniston create one of the funniest films so far in the 2003 season (end of May) and refined the past, personally forgotten Carrey's roles in previous comedies. With Carrey's slightly subdued antics, but with the scent and the crackle of an old man, Carrey carries this movie with great force to the top of laughter, as well as some dramatic, tearful dark moments. The elements of Jim's real acting skills continue to appear in this film. This charming summer entertainment hits most of the buttons, including dramatic elements along with silly moments that perfectly match this script. He still lacks the perfectly crafted comedy / drama band, Bruce, Almightly deserves credit for being a great dating movie, as well as a solid message and a gentle spiritual cynicism and parody that retains its good-natured taste. Eight out of ten stars.
