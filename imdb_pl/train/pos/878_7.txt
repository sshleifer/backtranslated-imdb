Interesting characters, a lot of tension. So close to black and white, without being black and white. I was rejected by how the accidentally reputed main character of the mainstream, quiet, close to a deaf secretary, was able to turn to crimes to ruin colleagues, spoil people on her way and finally take part in the robbery, and put someone to strike go like a lure to her own exit. I am somewhat discouraged by the trend that high quality films depict criminals in a sympathetic manner, not referring to the damage they have done to others, rather than presenting their direct opponents as jerks. In this movie, we never know who the money really is, or what happens to an innocent wife whose sympathetic deaf secretary uses to set up a dingy bar owner to take down the missing loot. It is a pity that the film could have been great.
