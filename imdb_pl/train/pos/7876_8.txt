I did not like Chandni Bar from the same director. <br /> <br /> I have not watched his other films. They came and left. <br /> <br /> But Page-3 is nicely made. It seems real. Like Satya with RGV. <br /> <br /> The mental illness of the so-called higher society is a summary of the film. Among the whole disease, it is difficult to lead a normal life that the hero, Konkana Sen, does. A serious movie that can not be watched with children or pending wives. Party-3 newspapers is usually the place for reporting actions by rich and elite parties that devote a lot more dirt than what is reported. How this page-3 is also a business perspective is shown in the movie. Event management companies earn money by organizing receptions and make rich, but not famous people from day to day famous by clicking photos of stars invited to the party. <br /> <br /> Western culture has crept deep into the University of Mumbai. The film shows it bravely, without any obstacles. <br /> <br /> Madhur Bhandarkar is starting a new journey from here.
