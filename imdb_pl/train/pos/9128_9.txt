I must admit that Purple Rain is one of my deepest guilty pleasures. Purple Rain not only broke boundaries, established a decade, costumes, music, behavior and dance! To this day, my friends and I are still jamming on the Purple Rain soundtrack and pretending Prince and the revolution. <br /> <br /> Now the movie itself, I meant what I said in the title, because for the most part the film itself is created by music. Acting? Do not let me judge it because it is one of my favorite pleasures, because I know that it was not the Oscar's contribution in any way. But I think the duo that took the movie was Morris and Jarome, their slogan on slogans was just beyond fun. I just want to rate this movie in concert sequences, because I felt that it just made the movie. <br /> <br /> Prince is a musical genius and created beautiful music. While film and acting are very bad, this movie is still cool to watch it at night and even dance. This movie defined the 80's, so just have fun. Prince would like it in this way to have fun! Oh, boy, it sounded bad. <br /> <br /> 9/10
