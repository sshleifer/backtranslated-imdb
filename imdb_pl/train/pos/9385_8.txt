Red Rock West is a great example of how good a film can be without a budget. All you need is an intelligent script, good actors and lots of atmosphere. RRW delivers all this and much more. <br /> <br /> Nothing Cage plays a former naval soldier wounded in Lebanon who lost his last $ 5 after being denied a job in the oil field because of his bad knee. He plays Red Rock and the bartender Wayne (JT Walsh, who is not his most dangerous but bad) is confused by a Texas killer. <br /> <br /> He pays him for killing his wife and making it look like a burglary. Only when she gets there to check her out. He offers him a double killing Wayne. Cage just wants to leave town for free and leave sparring lovers. But a series of misfortunes and failures causes them to return to and from Red Rock, back and forth. Ultimately, this leads to a meeting with Lyle from Dallas (cheeky and somehow nice Dennis Hopper), a REAL geek from Texas who offers help, not knowing that it makes the story more complicated. <br /> <br /> RRW never had a large edition, so most of its recipients discovered it on video or on cable TV. Watching it in such a way can make it a TV movie, but it's bigger. A clever, slowly measured direction, a moody score and a howling windy wind would make a movie great in cinemas, but the best thing you can do in these days is to watch DVD on a large HD TV. <br /> <br /> The only weak point of the movie I think about is the boring femme fata Lara Flynn Boyle with a nasty hairstyle. I certainly would not have fallen for her, but if you assume that the character of Nic Cage belongs to the belligerent lesbians, you will accept her after all.
