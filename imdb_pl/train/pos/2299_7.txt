Whoever said that horror is not a kind of educational film, huh? Thanks to this amazing short Hammer movie, at least now I know I will NEVER offer a stranger visiting wine and slices of bread with salt in my home, because he can be just a hypnotist and this combination will give him control over my thoughts and mind forever! Thank you, Hammer! The tenth episode of the House of Horror series is another one I can not wait for, mainly because the guy in the director's chair was Don Sharp; one of the best British filmmakers, but unfortunately unfortunately unappreciated. Sharp was responsible for several very nice Hammer films, such as "Kiss of the Vampire" and "Rasputin: The Mad Monk", as well as several overlooked independent productions such as "Dark Places" and "Psychomania". His contribution to the House of Horror is certainly one of the best in this series, with a complex but fascinating plot of the story and revolving on delightful occult themes. The plot focuses on two antique dealers who come across a strange mirror-like object, but in reality it is an ancient observation device that can be used to summon Choronzhon; demonic guardian of the abyss. The mirror is very much sought after by the satanic cult, because they need it for their ceremonies, but Michael does not want to sell it until he knows the true value of the device. When he raises a clearly petrified girl who escapes from worship to avoid sacrifice, Michael is even more drawn into the occult conspiracy. Satanic cults and the carnal dedication of young women are typical British horror topics, but David Fischer's scenario is never boring and offers a lot of neat storylines, among which a very ingenious climax. There are also a lot of tensions to admire, the dialogues are witty, and the performances are great (especially John Carson as the leader of the cult is really amazing). Recommended!
