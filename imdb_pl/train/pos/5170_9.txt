I rented this movie when it appeared on the videotape and I really liked it. A few weeks ago I had the opportunity to buy it on a DVD and watched it several times. I would have to agree with others when they said Indian Summer is a nostalgic movie. When I watch it, I would like it to be 10-14 again. I think that's why we all like this movie to some extent. We all sometimes want us to live our lives as children with the wisdom / knowledge of adults. Would not it be nice if all your friends / parents were young again? So that you do not worry about your job, being a parent, etc ... ??? I know that I would like to jump into De Lorean and go back in time. Although I liked the movie very much, my favorite camp movie is Meatballs with Bill Murray. I regret that they can not create an Indian version of this summer.
