I just watched this movie at Showtime. Quite by accident. If I did not have only 6 hours of sleep for the last two days, I would not go home early. If I had not returned home, I would not see the movie. I would not know what I missed, but I would miss a lot. <br /> <br /> That's what this movie looks like. He almost plays the Kevin Bacon effect. This and causality (hence my word above). Each character is somehow intertwined. Operation, reaction, interaction, lack of interaction. This movie is simply great. I will have to find a copy to buy.
