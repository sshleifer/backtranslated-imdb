Ida Lupino was one of the few women who went through the director's Hollywood glass ceiling under a studio system. It is not surprising that she also touched upon proto-feminist themes, which, if touched, were treated with such caution that it was rarely clear what was being said. In the Outskirts, he treats rape and its consequences, and although in the entire short film it is called a "criminal offense," he for the first time leaves the doubt about what happened. <br /> <br /> Mala Powers (in her official debut) plays secretary-accountant in a large industrial plant; she lives with her parents, but is engaged to a beautiful guy (Robert Clarke), who just got a raise, and now earns 90 dollars a week. Leaving the plant after work late at night, she feels persecuted. On the next scene? best in the movie ?? he tries to escape the persecutor in the labyrinth of buildings and alleys, but he fails. <br /> <br /> When she comes back home, disheveled and shocked, the police can not get much out of her; she claims she never saw her attacker (who filled a truck with snacks outside the factory). Trying to pretend that nothing is happening, he returns to work, but falls apart, thinking that everyone is looking at her, judging her. He goes into a fugue, runs off a bus to Los Angeles, but stumbles on a stop. <br /> <br /> Waking up in a strange house at the ranch, she learns that she was saved by Tod Andrews, a young minister from a California farm town. He lies about his identity and deals in packing oranges. They are both in love, but it is clear to Andrews that Powers keeps secrets. When a company grabs a key and breaks the skull of Jerry Paris, who tried to steal a kiss, reveals the truth about her past .... <br /> <br /> It was a brave movie, which is expected to appear in 1950 and who can explain and justify some of his disadvantages. Lupino never regains the verve of the early attack scene, and the film goes into bucolic and sentimental, ending with a talkative and didactic. Yes, Lupino had important information to convey, but she did not trust that the narrative speaks for itself. Her cast, pleasant but lackluster and general, was not very helpful, returning to melodramatic positions or homespun sedation. But indignation was a breakthrough, paving the way for a later discourse on what the crime of rape really is and what it really means for its victims.
