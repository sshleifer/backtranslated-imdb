The National Gallery of Art has long since lost the original original version of this film on July 10, 2005. It restores important scenes cut by the censors after its release. The character of a shoemaker, moral kindness-goodness in the original censored edition of 1933. He is presented here as a devotee of the philosopher Nietsze and calls on her to use men to claw to the top. In addition, the exact completion of the original, which I assume in current versions of VHS, is eliminated and the ending is restored to its original form. A great movie of seduction and power. We hope that we will release this DVD again so that everyone will appreciate its great advantages. Look for it.
