A very different topic treated in this film. A simple and simple description of the local Chinese customs, through the daily operation of the public bathhouse run by the old owner and his retarded son, when the older son returns home, wrongly believing that his father died. Like every human in the city, he visits the chat every day, plays games, discusses personal matters and gives honest advice, in addition to the usual spa-like therapies. When the old man dies, strong and loyal family ties make the older son take control, so public baths are not disturbed. And finally, the coming of modernization to end this way of spending nice hours and getting along. The public bath must be torn down, creating a commercial complex.
