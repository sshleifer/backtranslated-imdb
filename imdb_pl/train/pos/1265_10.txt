hi .. I think Just Cause is one of my favorite Sean Connery movies, it's a tough psychological thriller with great performances from Cast, especially Connery ... he's also one of the best lines I've seen in movies, so the dialogue is Pretty Not bad at all .. It also has one of the best scenes in the movies, when Sean interviews Ed Harris in prison is just fantastic ... I loved it and I can not recommend it, I really do not miss this one! Do not pay attention to the negative reviews stating that the last 30 minutes of sucking was as intense as the rest of the movie, I really think that Just Cause is a very funny movie ..
