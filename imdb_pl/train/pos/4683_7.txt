(Question) What do you call 100 film critics buried in the neck? (Answer) A good start. Well, I do not know Peter Mattei from Adam, but if he is a novice author of his filmography, "Love in time of money" is a "good start". A classic shot with capricious music in the style of a music box, this movement looks at the chain of weak relationships as it passes from person A to person B to person C ... etc ... and again ends up with people A and B in the carousel. The film gently probes the unfortunate circumstances of nine people with beautifully rendered shadows, beginning and ending on a street whore and her client. The disadvantage of this movie is the lack of a story that may have something to do with the many critical slams he received. Last night I watched behemoth "Angels in America" ​​and I was bored at the end, while this little combination of studies on characters made me enchanted. Be careful. I can be the only person who really liked this movie. (B)
