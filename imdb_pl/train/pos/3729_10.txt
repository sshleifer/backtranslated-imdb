Although I suppose this movie may make the rap to be considered anti-Vietnamese, I did not feel it when I watched it, because the film was just an honest look at the perspective of young guys trained for war that society did not support ... showed their fear, their desperation, their drive ... all this, in the open, naked. As a soldier, many topics called me in my experience in the army - especially in the training camp. In general, this movie, despite being filmed in a very small budget, looks great, is very well compiled and offers excellent acting and directing. I highly recommend this film to anyone who is looking for another great Colin Farrell movie. 10/10
