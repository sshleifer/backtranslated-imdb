This episode of the Twilight Zone combines a quiet section (1890) with melodramatic acting gags and sight, a tribute to Buster Keaton's early films. A lot of slapstick: Buster falling on the bulkhead door, falling into a puddle, running without a shirt. The invention of a foolish scientist from time, reminiscent of Flash Gordon's idea of ​​the future. Cheap prices, like $ 1.95 for ladies' hats, or 17 cents for a pound of beef, seem outrageously high for Buster. Even the world of 1890 is too big for Buster / Mulligan. How shocking it was when he was misplaced to the "modern" world in 1960! Buster tried to step back! The "scientist" of those times wants to return to the calmer world that he studied and admired in 1890. They come back together, and Buster / Mulligan is happy now, and the "scientist" regrets that there are no electronic equipment, modern beds or an electric blanket. So Buster sends him back with a crazy helmet. <br /> <br /> This Twilight Zone has no hard news. Ever since Buster Keaton died in 1966, this is one of his last efforts. It's enough. <br /> <br /> Another sweet thing - long-term unused Maytag Man Jesse White is a mechanic who fixes Time Helmet - announcing the career of the washing machine.
