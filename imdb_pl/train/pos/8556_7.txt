This movie is just fun. I have nothing to do with the original America Pie, but it's great to watch it. <br /> <br /> Another attempt, but better than the Band camp and Naga mile, at least more fun. br /> <br /> Right after the first five minutes I laughed my ass, so I decided to call my friend and watch it together. We had a few beers and had a good time. <br /> <br /> You will not find any deep news in this video, but it's worth watching. <br /> <br /> So relax and enjoy yourself.
