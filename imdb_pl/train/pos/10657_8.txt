Jeopardy has the feeling of being a stock market movie - one of the films that the studios pumped out between large budgets / cash registers. It's only 70 minutes and there are not many sets, and the only star is Barbara Stanwyck. But what a star of course. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck is a tough lady once again when she runs into the escaping convict, seeking help for her imprisoned husband in the Mexican desert. Most of the film focuses on how it deals with its hijacker, who wants him to surrender to him in return for his help. A little psychological battle there. <br /> <br /> This is a surprisingly effective small movie - its short length makes it tight, and Stanwyck is great, it should be without any mention (but I will praise it each time).
