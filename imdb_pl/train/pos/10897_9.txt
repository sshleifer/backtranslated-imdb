What can you expect from the movie "Surviving Christmas" and present as "Christmas fun", something like Ghandi or English patient? There are many things that I love about this film, it's fun, it's very well-mannered and it's great written. I came to the film as a Kaplan / Elfort fan, but I doubted when I read the story, it sounded funny. But the film does not meet this way, because Affleck (as Drew Latham) perfectly plays his role, the minute of an adult child, the next mature man who realizes that he has gained everything in life, beyond what he really wants. In fact, we see that Latham is growing up in this film, when he encounters the problems of those who are jealous and realizes that their lives are not so good, he sees that his own part is not so bad. <br /> <br /> This movie has less faint or indistinct scenes than many other comedies I've seen. Comedy is much harder than any other kind of drama, it works or it does not, and very few comedy writers do it correctly. I especially liked the dramatic scene in which the family goes to read the parts written by Latham. Pleasure comes from the reaction of Tom Valco (James Gandolfini) and comments by Brian Valco (Josh Zuckerman). This is the dilemma of the greedy Tom Valco, who must bite his tongue, wear stupid hats or sing on the Christmas tree in order to win a cash prize that keeps the film moving. <br /> <br /> The addition of the daughter of Alicja (Christina Applegate) in the story brings a stunning romantic angle and why not in the Christmas movie? Of course, his banal and sophisticated; she is rich and handsome, she is beautiful and lonely, so inevitably she and Afflect end up falling together in the snow and are face to face. Great! One thing I would like to do is use more Christmas music to raise the atmosphere, but I can not really complain. I have what I wanted.
