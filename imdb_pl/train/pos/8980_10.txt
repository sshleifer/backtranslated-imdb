I should admit that I am a big fan of The Dandy Warhols and that's why I came to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> The uniqueness of this film, compared to other contemporary rock instruments, lies in the fact that it is not only about one side of the band's history (eg "I Am Trying To Break Your Heart", about Wilco), but rather covers the long period of the band's history. In this movie, the director / producer Ondi Timoner closely followed the friends / rivals of The Brian Jonestown Massacre (BJM) and The Dandy Warhols (DW) for over 8 years (1995 - 2003) and shot a huge 1500 hours of raw film clipped than 1:45 hours (The future DVD edition will contain much more material than the original movie). The result is amazing - there are no fillers - the film is 100% clean and authentic archival material, which gives the feeling that the film is growing, living with bands over the years. <br /> <br /> Both teams at the beginning of their career promised to "make a revolution" in creating music, and not sell their souls to the devil of the "music industry". However, their paths quickly diverged - The Dandy Warhols signed a contract with Capitol Records and became relatively popular (especially in Europe) after one album, while The Brian Jonestown Massacre (with the leader of self-destruction, Anton Newcombe) broke into oblivion (at least as this is shown in the movie). The film is a continuation of The Brian Jonestown's massacre, contrasted with the entrance to The Dandy Warhols. <br /> <br /> First of all, I was delighted with the film and his approach to telling the story of Anton Newcombe (for example, Courtney Taylor - leader of The Dandy Warhols - he says, but after some time I realized that something was wrong with this movie. <br /> <br /> First, he treats Anton Newcombe as a missing person, the project began in 1995. As a documentary about several promising emerging groups in which Anton Newcombe and Ondi Timoner were equal partners (for this reason all these years, Ondi Timoner had direct access to both teams.) It was Anton Newcombe who brought The Dandy Warhols to the project, he was finally completely ignored, as if he had been kicked out of the project. Everyone talks about BJM, but does not take part in the discussion. I am not even informed when the group started the last editing process. There are always two sides of history and here we have only one ... Of course, as you might expect, Anton does not accept the final result and sees the film as a betrayal of his former friends. br /> Second, the film is very Dandy Warhols-biased. Of course, the winner takes it all, but the fact that Courtney Taylor (the leader of DW) tells (though it seems a good choice - provides a feeling of seemingly closer involvement), and the late history of these teams is represented disproportionately (BJM is covered by 1997, a DW - until 2003, does not add objectivity to the film. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, the film is (somewhat) shallow What does it want to teach us? As one critic said: "... the film explores old questions : where does genius fit into the commodity world? No, I DO NOT EXAM THESE QUESTIONS! It simply presents a brilliant but unsuccessful music, told by a less brilliant but successful musician, who gives himself over to the self-confidence and eternal coldness of the ego bigger than the top. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie was cool - it's raw, fresh, stylish, it's just ... damn interesting, at least for DW or BJM fans. For the rest of the crowd - I do not know ...
