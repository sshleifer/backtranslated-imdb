This is one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. The film material is unusual, mesmerizing at times. He also received an Oscar for the best photography and deservedness. I have many movies in my movie collection and a few others that I've seen outside of them, and few of them are more beautiful or even as beautifully made as this one. <br /> <br /> It is a unique and great movie in general. The cast is great and it works great in the form of its characters. We devotedly follow their destiny and we are emotionally attached to them. On the way, we also learn things about ourselves and our lives. I think about this film a lot about what it represents and how it presents it. I would highly recommend
