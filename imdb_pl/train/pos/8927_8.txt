Clair Denis returns to the topic of indifferent fathers, men who follow their own bliss in a decisive way, regardless of the emotions of their family, but while Nénette and Boni from the previous movie live in the narrow world of Marseille, our study of Louis Trebor in The Intruder it takes us from a distant place along the Franco-Swiss border to the middle of the world, to Korea and Tahiti. Again, the movie begins in the middle of the stream, with Louis, who is sixty years old, dealing with a sick heart, trying to maintain a high level of fitness. We learn that Louis is not a stranger to violence, because his cabin is a place of regular smuggling and shooting. Louis sleeps with a large knife under a pillow with nearby rifles. Denis is in no hurry to move the action and we must patiently build our understanding of Louis from his daily activities and the few people he has to deal with on the border, including Sidney's son (Grégoire Colin, almost unrecognizable with long hair and strand of mustache) who rejects him as a "madman": shown as a devoted father of two children. There are many short scenes that, although seemingly unrelated, build the impression of Louis and his environment. The work of Mrs. Godard's camera is exciting here. The controlling metaphor is Louis' heart transplant, to which he goes to Korea, and then to Tahiti, to look for another son who has not been found, and where the new heart of Louis rejects him, as Sidney rejected the old ones. We are used to short scenes in Denis's film, which are inexplicable: Nénette straddles Boni, feeding with a spoon; passing through shooting Boni's father, and then the shortest picture of Boni with a gunshot wound in her head; Louis' stage in the morgue with the corpse with the graft scar, but with Sidney's body. The implication of the latter two is a rejection, real or imagined, by the father, he kills something indefinite in his son.
