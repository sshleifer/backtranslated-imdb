Listen, it's Eva Longoria and Paul Rudd in the movie about a dead girl haunting a new girl. This is Gabrielle from Desperate Housewives and a guy who wore the "sex Panther cologne" in Anchorman. If you expect a movie nominated for the Golden Globe, you need to think about how you watch movies. However, if you want to suspend reality for 90 minutes and want to watch a funny movie, you've come to the right place. All characters are funny. They work together very well. The real match is Paul Rudd and Lake Bell. He's as funny as he was at Friends, and she was funny and she looked good at the same time. I went with my wife, she and I liked it.
