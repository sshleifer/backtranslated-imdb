Actually, I thought it was a comedy and I was sitting watching how I was laughing. it soon became clear that it was not a comedy, at least not the comedy "Jim Carrey". what was watching us are the characters - the movie starts with a few grim, worried people, gathered together to try to fight one of their basic fears - fear of water, fear of swimming. we are beginning to gradually enter their lives, to observe their troubles, to think their thoughts. <br /> <br /> I actually made them look much darker than they really are, and besides, the chain of events soon brings some light and I hope for their lives. <br /> <br /> I probably would not watch the movie if I knew it was not a comedy, but rather a drama, but I had a good time, I liked the story and did not mind spending about 90 minutes with him. <br /> <br /> many films treat alienation between people in the western world, this movie shows how people can meet and help each other <br /> <br /> "and whether in the light of a dying day, you meet her, not let her go past and walk away, do not lose her, she is your darling from the sun ... "<br /> <br /> 9/10 <br /> <br /> calm and love
