If you're a Crispin Glover fan, you must see this. If you're a fan of Sean Penn, you must see this. If you're a movie fan, you must see it. If you have no idea who Crispin Glover is and you have no idea who Sean Penn is, this movie will probably have a lot of value, but the more work you've seen before with Crispin or Sean, the better. > <br /> This movie is so funny, but it is also a pure genius. Nothing I know of is reminiscent of this movie. This is his own species. I doubt that anything like that has ever been repeated. I can not say anything more about why without partial corruption, and some of the other reviews have already done a good job here. <br /> <br /> In response to any of the reviewers who gave him a bad review, please revisit the movie. In fact, there is no point in making this movie "boring". This is probably the funniest, most entertaining and least boring movie ever made. And with increasing age and repeated views it is getting better. A timeless classic that, unfortunately, very few will be able to say that it has seen. <br /> <br /> Beaver Trilogy is a brilliant work of director Trent Harris, also responsible for the amazing Rubin and Ed, whose Crispin Glover also stars in. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, copies of this film are rare and hard to find find. I managed to find the VHS version after a careful search, and there are several ways to find it, which I know. But I really want someone to put it on DVD.
