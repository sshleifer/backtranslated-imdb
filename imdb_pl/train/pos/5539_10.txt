When I watched the movie for the first time, it was a recorded song, and the title was / is Caged Terror. I still have the tape and I admit that I watched it more than once from the beginning to the end! The film is extremely low budget and the dialogue is often involuntarily funny! I have a few of my friends who watched this, and we had a great laugh from the terrible script. The film is about a couple, (remember it's like the early '70s, so they're just too fashionable!), Who are going on a weekend trip to what I think was supposed to be in the north of New York. They run a funny dialogue after catching and eating a fish, and the girl mourns the death of a fish and ate it! The guy comes back with something stupid about how they ate fish, and now he was part of it, and he goes; "And this is a beautiful man!" A heavy man, really heavy! LOL! In any case, along with a pair of Vietnamese vets, one of whom plays the flute, I believe. (In any case, they are musical companions!) The guys are clearly interested in the girl, and when the couple turns out to be unfriendly, they finally terrorize them at night. The guy ends up in a cage in a hen house and has to watch his friend be delighted by two guys. Actually, at the end of the night, she seems to be pretty, and when the morning comes, the guys leave, and the girl and the guy can leave. Apparently the guy learned how to treat people and the girl has a smile on her face! :) In any case, I recommend this movie to all who are looking for a damn good laugh! And it does not amuse me anyway! If I could find it on DVD and replace my old copy of the tape, I'd buy it again, it's a classic camp! You must adore it!
