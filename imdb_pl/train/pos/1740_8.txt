This movie was not promoted here so much in Greece, although it had good actors, a great script and a pretty good picture was not so-called "hit" movie in my country. The film itself is very powerful, it concerns the difficult time that the novice had to go when he returns to his village after being released from prison at the age of 5 (drugs) The end is rather sad ... Mourikis tries to keep up with him and deals with that's pretty good ... Lambropoulou is great and very sexy in a strange way, and of course Hatzisavvas is once again close to your excellency ... 7 out of 10, because very few Greek movies make such an impression!
