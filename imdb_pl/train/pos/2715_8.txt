which was to show was a great TV series and really was one of the few things to plan! I suspect that in this TIVO era and recording devices it would be much better than in 1982. I am looking forward to its availability on DVD! <br /> <br /> While it's true that it has something to do with other TV shows like The Wild, Wild West, The Bearcats and The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr., of which I'm a big fan, QED had much better intellectual quality. However, it did not suffer - the dialogue was witty and the action was high. The concert was held in the UK as Mastermind and had something of the BBC but with better production values ​​than the BBC in that era. <br /> <br /> I was a nineteen-year-old boy when this series was initially conducted and had too much to do in life to make time for television. I remember, however, my mother, who called me to remind me that Q.E.D. he was on and sat on the phone and we watched him together. Wonderful memories. <br /> <br /> Really, Q.E.D. it is a sad loss, and if it could be done with the same quality and values ​​today, I would like it to happen again.
