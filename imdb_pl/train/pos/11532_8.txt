Well, it was one of those movies that I caught on a chance, and it was good enough for me to record when it comes next time ... If, like me, you like a lot of horror movies from the 80's, that have a little branching out from the norm (ie not just another redundant genre sequence), but I think you can enjoy it. When the bad guy finally appears in person, he definitely was not what I expected to see! In conclusion, I will not get out of the way for this, but if you like this species, look at it if it appears and you have an hour and a half to kill, I think. I would give him 6.5 out of 10.
