A lot is happening at The College Girl Murders. Crazy scientist creates almost undetectable poisonous gas. Before he can enjoy the benefits of his discovery, the scientist is killed by a hooded monk with a whip. After the gas is killed in the church, Scotland Yard is called to investigate, but the killing continues. Who can stop this crazy killer who seems to be able to come and go as he pleases and leave school? <br /> <br /> What works: <br /> <br /> - The Killer. What not to like in an assassin who sneaks in a bright red outfit that looks like KKK, complete with red gloves. The white whip that she wears and uses very effectively, stands out nicely on a bright red dress. Although the idea of ​​an assassin in a burning red pointy outfit sneaking up after school, the girl is quite stretched, one of the more ominous costumes I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> - Groovy 60s Music. I would really like to find the title music for The College Girl Murders. It has a jazz, fashionable 60s that I just loved. <br /> <br /> - Strange accents. In addition to the red dress and hood of the killer, the film features a sliding fireplace, down alligators with a cage with an overhead inscription, bible spraying poison, strategically placed mannequin, mini skirts, go-go shoes and hair on a mile. I would describe it as the intersection of the Batman television series from the 1960s and the Italian Giallo. College Girl Murders is a real feast for the eye. <br /> <br /> - The End. Let's say there are more twists and turns than the mountain road. Just when you think the killer was discovered, is the turn coming? ... and another ... and another ... and another one. <br /> <br /> What does not work: <br /> <br /> - Chief Inspector Sir John. I know the guy was supposed to be a comic relief, but his puffy character has far too much time on the screen. <br /> <br /> - Why alligators? Earlier, I mentioned alligators down below. And although they are a nice touch, they serve very little. Why go through all the trouble and not use them? <br /> <br /> - Plodding Plot. Some of The College Girl Murders have no flow or rhythm. There are too many moments in the whole film in which inaccurately there is a high-pitched stop. Better stimulation would make the movie much more pleasant. <br /> <br /> I have not seen many of these German krimis, but of the few that I have seen (The Phantom of Soho, the Darkroom of the Castle of Blackmoor, Dead Eyes of London) may be my favorite. This one has a really cool character that I really get into. If the story went a little better, I could easily give The College Girl Murders 7/10.
