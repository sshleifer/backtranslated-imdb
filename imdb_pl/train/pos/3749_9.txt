I used to laugh a lot while watching this. It is a funny short film with a funny musical act and a lot of crazy. The characters are simple, but their simplicity adds to the stylization of humor. The dialog is fun and often unexpected, and everything from the first to the last line simply flows great. There is Max, who apparently led a terrible life. And there is Edward, who is not sure what life he wants to lead. My favorite character was Tom, the crazy boss of Edward. Tom has a short but memorable role. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes stupid humor. And now you can find it online, which is a bonus! I am a fan of all Jason's cartoons and I can not wait to see what will happen next.
