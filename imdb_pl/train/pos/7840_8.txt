BORN TO BOOGIE is a real "find" - although he's a rock fan for almost thirty years, I first saw this movie a few days ago and I count him to the best rock movies of all time; great music (cream T. Rex) and visuals invariably exciting and unusual, leaving this viewer wishing for further directing efforts of Ringo Starr, who did a great job here. If you love music, you'll be in T. Rextasy all the time because Marc Bolan is really the star of the song, front and center. Even the fact that some of the songs are repeated does not really matter: different places, costumes, musical arrangements and bizarre visual concepts are used to give different textures and great humor to what could only end as a "concert movie in other hands. The film is as rich and full as BORN TO BOOGIE, but the film lasts only an hour, but what is there is completely satisfying. This is my only criticism - the video package is about 71 minutes long, and at least one internet source claims that the film lasts 67 minutes, but apparently it is 61 minutes of rocking fun.
