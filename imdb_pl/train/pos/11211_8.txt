I enjoyed the innocence of this film and how the heroes had to deal with the reality of having a powerful animal among them. The gorilla looks just great, and the eyes were particularly realistic. Sometimes it is even a bit scary and children should be a bit scared, without going out. Rene Russo plays her wonderfully feminine role. Typically, this type of Hollywood movies that take place in the past feel the need to create a wicked villain, but the only opponent is a gorilla. It's an interesting look at how close some animals are to people, how they feel the same emotions, and yet how we can not really treat them like people because they are not. Few movies will take a chance on this territory and it's worth seeing if you want to contemplate the similarity between human and animal.
