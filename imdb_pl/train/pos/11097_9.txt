Spoilers! <br /> <br /> From the moment I saw a local film critic who had cleaned this film in a review of 10:00 am, I wanted to see it. I do not remember who it was, nor which Omaha local informer did the review, but the critic strongly insisted that this film was too dingy for the average church Nebraskan. They showed a passage from the scene in which John Glover intends to kidnap Ann-Margret while swimming in the pool. Glover's character praises her for how nice her body is and so on, using many words that the local station deemed necessary for editing. I was addicted. There was one problem though. I was only 13 years old then and I had to wait a year for the cable to come. Let's say it was worth the wait! <br /> <br /> If it was ever my fault, this movie is like that. To call this movie obsolete would be a great understatement. The film focuses on a successful entrepreneur who is being blackmailed by three small scum after a love affair with a young woman. Roy Scheider, who is as effective as ever, plays the poor guy who wanted to throw a little, and now he is at the mercy of three horrible villains. The figure of John Glover is one of the most memorable scum of all time. He is insane, sometimes funny and always on the verge of doing something crazy. Then there is the character Leo, who is clearly above his head in this scheme of blackmail. He is a whining, sweaty, coward who runs a peep show with live naked models. Then you have Clarence Williams III as Bobby Shy, a deliberate sociopath who everyone is afraid of for an important reason. Who can forget the wake-up that Vanity gives with a giant teddy bear? <br /> <br /> After dealing with the initial shock of realizing what he's up to, Scheider changes tables on those sneaking up and takes control of the situation until Glover goes to get his wife! The conflict is brutal, practically the whole cast is shot, raped or blown up. <br /> <br /> I do not know why I love this movie so much. It really should scare me, but it is not. Maybe because all these characters are interesting, and history has many opportunities that most of today's films would never try. It is frightening to think that the adult film industry probably has more than a few characters, such as Glover, which runs in L.A. I am looking for trouble. Just think about his voice to giggle me. "Hej, sport, mi≈Çego dnia!" <br /> <br /> This movie has a lot of shootings, cool cars, great dialogue (as in my opening speech) and decent acting. Plenty of scenes by real porn stars. Look for Ron Jeremy, playing in the tub with two chicks on the party scene at Glover. <br /> <br /> Another thing I have to add: How hot are the women in this movie ??? Wow! Travolta did well, marrying Kelly Preston. Yummy! We also see Vanity naked in time before she became a born-again Christian. And Ann-Margret. What else can you say about it, except that it is the quintessence of American beauty. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> Then tell Hound. <br /> <br /> Added on February 14, 2008: RIP Roy Scheider!
