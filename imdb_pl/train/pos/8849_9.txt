Brothers Hanson - Andy (apparently has a joint deed) and Hank (apparently they do not have one in common) need money. Andy invents a plan to get a cake that will have consequences for the whole Hanson family. <br /> <br /> This movie provides. It is a layered, full-blooded roller-coaster ride that knows exactly what it is doing. As a drama / thriller I would love to compare it to "No Country For Old Men". While both films have a large amount of dramatic character and emotion, "The Devil" is more on the side of the thriller because of its fast pace. "No Country" is a cooler and more gloomy movie that you can really admire while "Devil" is a bit more enjoyable. In "Diable" there is definitely less violence than "Without country". Acting also provides. Ethan Hawke, sometimes wooden in the past, makes you dizzy, sweating and looking deer in the headlights of the besieged Hank. Philip Seymour Hoffman, as Andy, has the toughest scene in the movie and quickly becomes an actor who, you believe, can do anything. <br /> <br /> There is nothing wrong with this movie. He jumps back and forth without confusing. Events are out of control, but the movie never works - writing (from the first timer of Kelly Masterson), directed (veteran Sidney Lumet) and editing remain as strained as the drum. In many categories, it is an award-winning material, although perhaps films such as "The Departed" and "No Country" squeeze this film out of the spotlight. If you like these, you'll like it.
