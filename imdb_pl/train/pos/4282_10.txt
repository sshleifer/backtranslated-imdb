Superbly developed characters in many funny situations full of spirit, absurdity and Serbian mentality. The film is a great comedy, pleasant, interesting, unpredictable. The best point in the film: characters, then humor, history and dialogues. Humor has "internal development", rare in Serbian films. So it is a consequence of characterization, it is well-motivated, spontaneous and convincing. It is also sharp, intelligent and clear. Most of the films, unfortunately, built humor (invented a joke and put it in the mouth of the character) or ordinary situation comedy, burlesque, farce. Some of the "immortality of art" have been included in this film. A small masterpiece, hard to reach.
