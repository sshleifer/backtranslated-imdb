I saw this pilot when he was shown for the first time, and I am sure that countless fans of the "Spirit" hate him because, like Batman, the Green Hornet, etc., he took the figure towards the "camp". But apparently I never had enough of Batman, because I thought it was fun, in some of the same ways as this show. There are two parts that stay with me. First, when Denny's partner was mortally wounded, he makes a dramatic speech about how he always defended the law and followed his letter exactly. Then he says something like, "Boy, I was stupid!" This is his way of telling Denny to become a guard who does it (though like a Batman TV). Then there is a scene in which he tries to seduce blackness to let him go, kissing her, but she is not cheated because he is too honest to kiss her convincingly! It was a great example of the "camp", which was also "underrated" by the actor and actress.
