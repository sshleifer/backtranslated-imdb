I was addicted from beginning to end. The great horror comes from disturbing images and organic shocks that arise not to jump, but to leave "What did I see f * ck?" All the other commentators gave short summaries of what the film is about, so I will not change what's already there they told. I told other people about the movie a few days after I saw him because he still haunted me. After watching it, I even had a bad dream and I am a real fan of horror, which is not easily terrified by flak such as "The Grudge" or even "Silent Hill". What gave me bad dreams is the anxiety I felt about what I would do if I was in this cell with these guys. What would be my personal horror? my subconscious took me there and it was not pleasant. That my friends are for you what a good horror! The best part of this movie is that it is subtle. It's not about Bogeymen who jumps on you, about alien invasions or tons of gore. The opposite is true. Horror that you create in your mind. The irony for the four heroes is that the horror does not come from external force, which ensures that there is strength over them. Just men ask about one thing they want and get it ... but not in the way they imagined. On the one hand, they get what they want from an occult book, but ultimately they can wish it. Sometimes closing in a prison cell is the best place!
