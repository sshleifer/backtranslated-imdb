This heartfelt comedy confronts a few bizarre characters. Especially, of course, the two main characters. Jack Lemmon plays Felix, the hypochondriac, whose wife lost him because she could no longer withstand his attacks of cleaning and cooking. So he tries to kill himself, but every attempt fails. Walter Matthau plays Oscar, his friend, an untidy, unreliable sports reporter who lives in a divorce with his ex-wife in a studio apartment. He offers his distraught friend Felix a new home in his apartment. And soon the trouble starts, because two such opposite characters can not live together for a long time. Felix transforms the chaotic Oscar apartment into a clean exhibition flat. She cleans and cooks all the time. After a short moment Oscar feels the persecution of mania ... Filmed in a theatrical way and perfectly played. First of all, the art of Jacek Lemmon is great. He is a great clown. He makes us laugh, but in a tragicomic way. Look at the wonderful scene when both men invite two friends for dinner, because Oscar must touch something softer than a bowling ball. While preparing drinks, Felix sits with two young ladies in the living room. To get out of this embarrassing situation, he starts talking about the weather. A minute later he changes the subject and talks about his ex-wife and children. Suddenly he begins to cry and when Oscar returns with drinks, there are three crying people in the living room. The film is full of such funny and touching scenes. An intelligent, fun comedy with a big heart. 10 out of 10!
