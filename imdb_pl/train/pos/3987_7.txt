The mother is one of those movies that you know is good, maybe even great, but it's like eating vegetables or doing math lessons for a child - too much work and a lot of pain to invest. <br /> <br /> The story is potentially distasteful in many ways: the death of the character in the first half hour, the December-May romance, the idea of ​​a man betraying his wife, and then betraying a mistress with his mother, a collection of weak and rather unpleasant thirty-something characters, apparent indifference of adults towards children in their lives. This film was made in 2002 or 2003, but is a return to the collection of British films (usually made for television) from the late 1980s - it has a moral austerity that never disappears, which causes pulsing anger. <br /> <br /> The mother is impeccable, but this is partly a problem; if a film dealing with so many sensitive issues has some drawbacks - scenario inconsistencies, some smaller actors - this puts aside, but if such a film is so perfect, the experience of watching is harsh and painful. Even the technical properties - lighting, editing, etc. - make the viewer hurt; London in this film is bright and open, filled with sharp, cutting light. <br /> <br /> If you are tough as nails or you are one of those very sensitive people who like to torture you with the help of jerking off sad movies or novels, then you will enjoy your mother. Let anyone who is inside miss it or be prepared for a sprain. And warn: as difficult as a movie from the beginning to the end, the worst is coming. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, the mother asks her daughter what she can do for this (for sleeping with her boyfriend), and her daughter calmly says that she thought about it and would like to hit her. Mother agrees that they both get up and - instead of a well-primed slap - the daughter clenches her fist and performs a boxer's punch. Argh !!!
