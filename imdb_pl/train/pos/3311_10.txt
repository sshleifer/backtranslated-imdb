The common thread in the films consists of the main characters who leave the noise of the city behind them and find themselves in the peace of nature. In the province of Kangwon Province, two stories of people who do just that, trying to find a trip to popular Korean parks in the mountains of Kangwon province are shown. However, instead of epiphanal moments, we have two characters whose journey into nature was simply another form of escape. <br /> <br /> The pace of this movie is slow, contemplative. In the end, we find out what really led everyone to the Kangwon Province and we learn how they are connected. For those who want Hollywood Glam and the movie to give them a definitive answer, this movie will not satisfy. But for those who want a movie that leaves their thinking, wondering, affecting their years after, this movie will be more than satisfy the longing.
