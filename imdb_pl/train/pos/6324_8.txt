These guys are not just ordinary suspects! They are a bunch of friendly freaks who you want to get away with, but they are so unhappy that there is a very small chance for it. No one is better than William H Macy in depicting a man with a big heart, but down to his luck. This is probably his best performance since Fargo. Rockwell himself played the meat boxer perfectly, and the rest of the gang was just as good. His episode scene at the end was absolutely hilarious. <br /> <br /> The direction was also noticeable by the Russo brothers. For sure, the film had the feeling of brothers Coen and it will be interesting. See how it will develop your career. They have a long way to go to match Coen, but it's a great start and I'm waiting for another celluloid trip. ....... "Yo mutha is a slut"!
