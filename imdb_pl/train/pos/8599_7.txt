It's been 19 years since Gordon Gekko used "Wall Street" to let us know that greed is good. Now Michael Douglas takes the personality of GG and transforms it into a Secret Service agent, Pete Garrison. Guess what? It works! It's a solid political thriller that guessed me. Intriguing is also the detailed work showing the security measures taken by the SS on behalf of the President and the First Lady. All the hints were pretty good, but try as much as I could, I could not accept Eva Longoria as a Secret Service agent. While Jodie Foster has just made you hang your belief and you really think she was an FBI Agent in "Silence of the Lambs", you do not feel the same with Longoria. Nevertheless, it is a funny movie, escapist entertainment from Beltway as a backdrop.
