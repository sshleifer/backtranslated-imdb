I came across this movie accidentally, listing all the movies that I wanted to record for my sister when I was on vacation and I'm happy that I put this movie. He deals with problems that most directors avoid, my only problem with this movie is that it was created for television, so I could not buy copies for my friend! <br /> <br /> This is a moving story about how people with eating disorders do not necessarily run away from everyone and how many losers there really are. I noticed that although bulimics can maintain a fairly stable weight, it has more serious health consequences that many people do not know about.
