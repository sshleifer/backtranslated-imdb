This film is a strong commentary on the then Italians. The use of mirrors to improve the apparitions of the characters is beautiful and I can not fail to mention the beauty and splendor of Sophia Loren and Mastroianni. I love them both. Their way of interacting is so beautiful and natural that you can wonder if the camera really is there. The husband, in his short role, is also well portrayed as a fascist Italian who commands his wife and children but in his own way a loving father. The initial scenes with Hitler in Piazza Venezia with all of Italy are amazing and really put the film on a historical basis. I loved this movie and I agree that it's funny that it's not more familiar.
