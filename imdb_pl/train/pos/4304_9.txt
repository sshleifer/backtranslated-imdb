I remember seeing this movie when I was 7 years old; and then it shocked me. I've seen a brutal movie before, but I've never seen a movie with the consequences and reality of violence. This film not only shows this, but also shows how people can change their lives and choose happiness. What the film did and could not do was the truth. Crash tried to show how racism was bad (and Crash actually had built-in anti-Asian prejudices) and come to him from a morally higher position. The Grand Canyon came to things from such a harsh and real perspective that it actually goes to a higher level than a collision. Especially when comparing the ends. The end of the catastrophe is supposedly a neat little end that binds everything. While the Grand Canyon just ends with a calm note, where you know that nothing will change in the life of the hero, but this is because life is also going on, there is no adequate ending. No matter how good ... you are angry. There is no end to the chapter to start another one.
