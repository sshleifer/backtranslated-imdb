I watched the first 17 episodes and this series is simply amazing! I was not interested in the anime series from Neon Genesis Evangelion. This series is actually based on the game h-game, which I'm not sure whether it was done before or not, I did not play this game, but from what I heard, it goes very well. <br /> I give this series 10/10. It has a great story, interesting characters and some of the best animations I've seen. It also has great Japanese music in it! <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this series yet, check it out. You can find subtle episodes on some anime sites, straight from Japan.
