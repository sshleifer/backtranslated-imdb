A great movie that requires the acquired taste. If you're in action, movies about bam and hatred for serious love stories, it's not for you. Otherwise, if you like to sit in front of a good smart movie from time to time, I recommend it very highly. Easy the best movie produced in Bollywood this century. <br /> <br /> The only other Indian movie that I would like to give 10/10 is Dil Wale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge. Even then, it ranks second in this masterpiece.
