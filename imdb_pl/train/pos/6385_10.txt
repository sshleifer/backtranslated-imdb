This movie was great! It was a perfect interpretation of the ancient myth. The animation was a bit strange, but nothing new from Disney. It was definitely better than expected in the Disney movie without singing. <br /> <br /> Background animation was magical. It was a different level of work for Disney people. Some of the characters were a little box-shaped, but they were made up with the beauty and exuberance of the scenery. The music was largely instrumental, but it was perfect for the film. Certainly it was not a movie that required the characters to fall into a song. <br /> <br /> Perfect. 10 out of 10.
