Radiofreccia is a film about us all, about our dreams, our friends, our obsessions, our addictions, our fears. It is a brilliant film in which a group of friends, like all of us, live in the hardships of growing up in a small town in one of the most important decades of the last century. The film does not accept a happy or sad approach to things, it simply tells us a story that we could all experience. One of happiness and excitement, sadness and sadness. The strength of this story lies in the fact that we love our heroes more and more, it is one of those films that you will watch over and over again, closer to the small town in Emilia Romagna, where it takes place. Hoping that one day he will finally be able to walk through the streets of Freccia and his friends, listening to music that changed the world through the crack of an old radio playing Radio Raptus International, playing their dreams, our dreams. Radiofreccia will make you laugh, sometimes you will cry, shock and comfort you, give you and take from you. Personally, I think that he played an important role in my life and life of my friends and I suggest that you all watch and let it become a part of yours.
