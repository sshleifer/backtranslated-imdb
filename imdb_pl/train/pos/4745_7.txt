I can not understand why they decided to release this film to introduce the dynamo of Jet Li to the American audience. Fist of Legend would be a much better choice. In any case, the Black Mask is not terrible, but it is certainly not great either. The final sequence of the fight is well organized by Yuen Woo Ping, who coordinated the Matrix. But the English version suffers from severe editing and dubbing. (I'm begging Hollywood studios to release these movies without subtitles.) Jet Li shows her characteristic charisma in the title role, and Francoise Yip has a nice but short role as a woman 701. <br /> <br /> The black mask has a strange gothic style, which adds some interest, but is overloaded with battles and explosions. More attention was devoted to the fantastic skills of Li. Black Mask is a decent movie, but do yourself a favor and pick up Fist of Legend if you want to see a huge movie that really shows Li's skills.
