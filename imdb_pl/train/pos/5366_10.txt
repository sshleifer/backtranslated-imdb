I am sitting here in November 2006. I still can not resist admiring the film. Arnold's best films lasted about 4-5 years. Running Man, Predator and Total Recall (1990). All three are amazing. The tacky Arnold liner in this movie will make you laugh at more than one occasion. Operation in this film is surprisingly good, as in the case of Predator and Totall Recall. They did a great job trying to make the scene futuristic, as it is in 2017, but you can not help but giggle on 80s style hairstyles for men and women in the crowd and ordinary TV Studio monitors The man we all know here in 2006 is on the right track with the appearance of flat panels and HD TVs. Also the computer graphics intro from the game show "The Running Man" would not look like this in 2017. Nevertheless, the plot is absolutely fantastic. More than once during this movie I wanted to get up and not care about the ending, which I often do with today's film. I really think Arnold's acting is much better than what he admits. Now I would not choose him for the governor, but it's California for you. Buzzsaw, Dynamo, Fireball, SubZero are also fantastic "stalkers" and I think that the producers are not trying to overdo the battle scenes. When the persecutor is dead ... he is dead. It does not work for 20 minutes. Scenes of persecutors are fast and fun, but they do not try to beat them. I give this film 10/10, and it comes from someone who currently does not like many movies. If you get the right actors and the right story, the futuristic graphic displays you'll see in 2006 are not important or necessary.
