<br /> <br /> The old man works as a caretaker in a psychiatric hospital to be close to his wife who is a patient there and try to get her out. <br /> <br /> It is certainly one of the most forgotten masterpieces of the silent era and peculiarities in the history of Japanese cinema. I thought for a long time that in the 1970s a print was found and a soundtrack was added to it that perfectly fits the images. It could have influenced Dr. Caligar's office (director Kinugasa claimed he had never seen a German movie). However, it exceeds in its style and more convincingly (and coldly) depicts the internal psychological state of prisoners in asylum. To achieve this, the film uses every film technique available at any given time: multiple irradiation and subjective point of view, slanted camera angles, fast and slow motion, expressionistic lighting and superpositions. It is also a very complicated movie because it has no subtitles. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the installation of heavy rain falling on the windows of the hospital, the wind of a trembling tree and thunder. Disturbing weather is metaphorizing the mental state of patients and presenting one of them: a former dancer. The combination of sounds produced by rain, wind and thunder serves as a music that encourages the dancer to a crazy, almost hypnotic dance. In another sequence involving the same patient involved in another insane dance, it is observed by other prisoners. A multiple exposure of a dancer represents the patients' point of view and their confused "view" of the world. <br /> <br /> These are just two examples of this awesome movie trying to present the subconscious of patients and the view of a "reasonable" world. <br /> <br /> In three words A MUST SEE.
