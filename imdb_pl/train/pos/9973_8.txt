I really liked this version of "Vanishing Point" as opposed to the 1971 version. The version from 1971 was quite boring. If I can get up in the middle a few times (as in the 1971 version), This is not so great for me. Of course, this could be due to the fact that I was only nine years old when the 1971 release was released. I saw, however, many alterations, in which I liked the original and older ones more. I discovered that the storyline of the 1997 version was more understandable and essentially remained true to the original, not undermining the meaning of the 1971 version. In my opinion, I felt that the 1997 version was more exciting and was not such a "blase". (Boring)
