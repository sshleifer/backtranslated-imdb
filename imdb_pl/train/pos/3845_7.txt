An unusual, slow, funny erotic thriller with many graphic and "blasphemous" scenes that will undoubtedly disturb viewers. However, it will be difficult for them to appreciate some of the ingenious sequences that this movie contains, or to ignore the first-class performance of Krabbe. Verhoeven retains an intriguing ambivalence throughout the film, playing with the meaning of the vision-heroes. Unfortunately, in the last 5 minutes everything turns into a blur, and the unsatisfactory ending is certainly not as good as the rest of the movie. (***)
