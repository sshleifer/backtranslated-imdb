An excellent film depicting cross-currents in the life of a multi-ethnic mix of not-so-ordinary people in the rural Northwest Pacific. Solid direction and writing along with great acting, especially performances by Kwami Taha and Dana Stowe. Interestingly, this movie was made in the same year as the very successful "Crash", written and directed by Paul Haggis. The pace of the action may not be as crazy as in urban Los Angeles, and the characters may seem to be better acquainted with each other in "Apart From That", but the personal relationships of the heroes are just as flawed and problematic, and their stories as resonant as those of " crash ". For viewers who appreciated "Crash", this is a movie that must be seen. Also, fans of Jim Jarmusch and John Cassavetes will like this movie.
