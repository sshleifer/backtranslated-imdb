Maybe it's because I have a strong fear of hospitals and medical equipment, but this one got under my skin (sorry pun). This song is bold, it is not afraid to go up and it is as satisfying as it is in the case of revenge movies. Not only did I feel a lot of wringing hatred and much sympathy for "screwee", but I felt that I feel embarrassed and feel disgusted at times, which is really a rare and delightful thing for a somewhat weary viewer of the horror of myself. Some parts are very similar to "Hellraiser", but they are rather a tribute than an imitation. This is a difficult song that does not give the viewer much to consider, but I like to be attacked once by a movie. This piece brings it and does not apologize. I liked it very much. DO NOT watch while eating pudding.
