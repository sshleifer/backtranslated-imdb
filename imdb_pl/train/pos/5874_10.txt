this move was friggin funny !!! the most funny thing I've seen for some time, akshay and john kick their ass as always, and the chicks are hot too. the story is amazing, lots of great jokes, and whoever has seen it before is an idiot. I say for him that you're not from the Indians, so you would not understand humor on a moron. Do not judge movies you do not understand. what did you watch, the version with subtitles, in which most jokes were lost in translation? That's what I was thinking about Jackassie. <br /> <br /> akshay kumar is the best actor in history and once again proves his versatility, he can do not only action, but also comedy and he is great at it. John also proved that it was his first comedic role and he was great at it.
