I really liked BATMAN: DEAD END, I thought it had a theatrical impression and it gave Collor a chance to make a great movie. This trailer did not give me the same impression. The plot or the potential plot was quite good, but due to the acting and special effects I felt like it was a good TV movie or TV program. <br /> <br /> First of all, Michael O'Hearn is not that good Superman. Actually, I thought that in his short speech he did a decent Clark Kent. I'm sorry, I just do not think about SuperMan as a buff. The suit Kent wore masked his size. Batman can have a bodybuilder body, but not Superman. Supes is undoubtedly subdued, but not loose. In any case, I did not care about his entire pose, and his transformation from Kent to Superman was sober. Now this may not be just O'Hearn's fault, Collor may have to take some credit for bad writing and direction. <br /> <br /> Secondly, special effects for flying were cheeses. Superman flies across the sky. If it was obvious that this Superman was flying close to the ground, with telephone cables and buildings visible above him. I do not think there are any Superman shots flying around the body. Apparently O'Hearn's harness and rigging had to be on his lower torso. <br /> <br /> In total, it was a good trailer. I would probably pay for watching the movie, if at all, and I would definitely catch it on TV. The plot, the alliance between Lexcorp and Wayne Industries, Superman jealous of Lois' attractiveness to Wayne, Lex and Twoface, who are fighting Superman and joining forces between Batman and Superman, is good. I'm sure that thanks to the larger budget and the approval of Collor's and the company's full film, even O'Hearn can provide a decent movie. Certainly one better than most of the cartoon comic books that have recently come from Hollywood.
