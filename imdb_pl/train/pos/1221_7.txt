I liked this movie the longest than the original Care Bears movie. I saw them together well last summer and found out I was wrong. The first is a better video of Care Bears (as you can guess if you read my review). This movie is not a BAD movie, just ... VERY TIRED. <br /> <br /> Well, first of all, as several people have mentioned, it completely denies any knowledge about the first film. I can not come up with another follow-up that denies originality so blatantly (especially when it comes to the gender of some characters and how everyone met). When I was little and watched it, I was a little confused and distraught. I felt the same when watching him as an adult! <br /> <br /> For reasons why the movie is really pretty good (IF you've disconnected it from the first movie). I can not come up with another movie for young children with DEMON like in a village! Now I am not suggesting for a moment that the evil demons who want to steal the souls of campers and Care Bears are good, I just think it's cool that in the film for young children is THE HIGHEST EVIL! It's like this bizarre movie "Santa Clause Vs. Satan "from Mexico, which you sometimes hear about. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the name of the demon is Darkheart and he wants this chick to help him get the Caregivers in exchange for his special powers. Very dark for a kiddy eh movie? Did I mention that Darkheart appears to the girl most often as a BLUE VOTED 10-YEAR BOY ??? Freaky! Meanwhile, other children are in Care-a-Lot looking after BABY CARE BEARS! Oh, old man! Demons and babies Bears in the same movie !!!!! <br /> <br /> Needless to say, everything will finally clear up (but not before we see how Darkheart catches the souls of Care Bears in this frightening chandelier in one [surprisingly] deeply troubling scene. But I still have a question whether this the film has found a cult audience that it deserves so much for. I can just watch it again.
