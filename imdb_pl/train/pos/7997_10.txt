This is definitely one of the better films and I was not disappointed at all. The soundtrack along with a precisely made handheld camera was excellent. There is always a chance that the film will not contain such beliefs as others, but I felt the rhythm of this picture and the time was perfect. Dakota Fanning is quickly becoming a basic movie that requires a child with an old soul personality and has never let me down with his talent. As for Mr. Washington and, of course, Christopher Walken, they both exceed the challenge of showing the darkest parts of humanity trying to go to light.
