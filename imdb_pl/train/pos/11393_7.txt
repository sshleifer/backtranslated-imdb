Uggh! I really was not impressed with this movie, although I must admit that it is technically well done. It receives 7 for very high production values, but when it comes to entertainment values, it is rather poor. In fact, I consider it to be one of the most overrated films of the 1950s. He won an Oscar for the best film, but the movie is simply boring because of so many dances, dances and dances. This is because, unlike some musicals that have a reasonable number of songs along with strong history and acting (like MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS), this film almost all sings and dances. In fact, this movie is about the longest song and dance number in history, and if you do not do it, the movie quickly bores you. Give me more stories! As a result, with overgrown production numbers and poor history, this movie is like a permanent meringue diet - it just does not settle in the long run. <br /> <br /> To think ... this is the movie that beat "Tram called lust" and "Place in the sun" for the best picture! What's worse, "The African Queen" and "Ace in the Hole" were not even nominated in this category! Even more amazing for me is that "Ace in the Hole" lost for the best script, the script for the movie - although "An American in Paris" had almost no story to tell and was mainly driven by dance and song.
