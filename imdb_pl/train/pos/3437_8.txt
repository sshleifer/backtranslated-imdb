Some genre films must be disguised. This was the exception. This is a dressed version of a horror movie. Thanks to the minimal special effects, it succeeds in your psychological study with a simple but existential motive - who gets hit by a bus and why? This is not a great movie, but because it's not much imagined, history works. Subtle and everything about the heroes' interactions. Actually, there is one idea in the opening scenes, but it could have been placed there to simply set a tone for what is to come. I really appreciate the balance of male and female energy, and I do not recommend this story to those who are more interested than people who respond to physical and psychological challenges. You will enjoy the movie, if you have some empathy, you appreciate the need for a bit of adventure in your life and wonder "What would I do in this situation?"
