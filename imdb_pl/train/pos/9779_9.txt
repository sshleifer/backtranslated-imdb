Three horrors based on members of transgressive Hindu worship that return home but have somehow changed. In the first story, our former cult member is now in a mad center and is visited by someone who wants to learn what happened in this cult. A little slow run of the story in flashbacks, while both are sitting on chairs and facing each other. The reporter is particularly interested in what leads to the death of the participants. What seemed rather boring suddenly becomes very exciting with a surprising twist. Things get pretty bloody. <br /> <br /> The second story has a brutal young criminal visiting a psychiatrist for compulsory therapy. The patient seems to have some kind of program, but the psychiatrist is able to do the job. Again, things slow down a little and become weird. Then there is a strange phrase in history that is very well written and surprising. <br /> <br /> The final story is about a spiritual healer who claims to be able to remove his hand illness. One of the patients is a former member of worship, so successful healing becomes more complicated. Again we are surprised by the return of the action. He has a pretty, bloody scene there. <br /> <br /> For some reason, there is a bit of a pretty, naked woman, and a man full of nakedness. The stories were very well written, and the director manages to completely create each story with its surprising turn of events and bloody repercussions. <br /> <br /> Note: a review of the German DVD.
