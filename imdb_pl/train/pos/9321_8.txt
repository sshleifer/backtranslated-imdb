As a romantic comedy, it was lovely and won. I thought writing might be stronger to build a final connection a bit better, but it's not a huge trigger point. But Amanda Detmer and Scott Wolf are good performers and are as charming as ever. These are my two favorite actors and I was happy to see their cast as romantic heroes. I hope to see them soon in future projects. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie will not change your life, but it's sweet, warm and winning. It's not bad at all.
