this film is not pornography, it was not supposed to be pornography, and if my uncle does not run for president of the world, he should never be considered pornography. <br /> <br /> now that the problem has been solved, I can say I highly recommend this movie because its problems are still widely available. It's fun, acting is great and it raises serious (interesting) questions. <br /> <br /> I can not fully understand why this movie was so badly treated, probably because I plan to never visit us. Lena is a true pioneer of the modern movement of riots, confusion, curiosity and wit, which are her main attributes, sometimes it is bad, but is not everyone?
