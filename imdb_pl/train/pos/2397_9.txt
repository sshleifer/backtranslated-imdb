After watching and adoring the newest movie, Greg Lombardo, "Knots" (co-author and director of this film also) I decided to check his earlier work, and this movie was worth the effort and loan. Macbeth in Manhattan is a slap, an excellent look at Shakespeare's favorite, an update and a transfer to New York. I was impressed with the basic wit and intelligence of the script and I was delighted with the way in which the plot of the movie in the film reflects the plot of the play itself - and very cleverly. Trials and torments associated with life in Manhattan many pieces of Shakespeare and Central Park were rarely better used than the forests around Macbeth's castle. Mr. Lombardo obviously has a place in the heart of New York and New York stories (Knots is a fun and hot sex comedy about six thirty-something New Yorkers taking place primarily in a charming district of Brooklyn, with offices in Manhattan and a loft in the center for good) and spent a lot of time around Shakespeare pieces. The film is very dynamic and the story reflects a deep understanding of the basic drama at the foundation of Macbeth. I remembered "Looking at Richard" Al Pacino - another great "game in the movie Shakespeare". I highly recommend checking Macbeth in Manhattan.
