The visual artistry of Tsui Hark is in sight in this film. Unfortunately, the terrible acting of Ekin Cheng, especially Cecilia Cheung (I felt the need to strangle her while watching this, it's so bad :) hindered watching at times. <br /> <br /> This film is a real breakthrough in the visual department. When I first saw it, my jaw dropped many times and I thought I had never seen anything like it, but it should be done to fully reflect the mythical world of Chinese historical kung fu novels! No doubt, this is one of the best-looking Chinese kung-fu epics ever made. <br /> <br /> But unfortunately, Tsui Hark has not improved too much in the writing department, and the story and dialogue are rather underage (his apparent obsession with stupid and too long depiction of bad guys also did not help). What's worse, this movie is very poorly manned. They decided to use the "hot" popular idols from Hong Kong as leading heroes, but unfortunately Ekin Cheng, and especially Cecilia Cheung, are completely unsuitable for historical kung fu dramas because they lack the nobility and mystique that these characters are supposed to personify. Adam Cheng Siu-Chow and Brigitte Lin in the 1983 version are infinitely better. <br /> <br /> I want one day, Zhang Yi-Mou and Tsui Hark to join forces and produce a film that has Tsui's visual artistry, but with Zhang's maturity and story ...
