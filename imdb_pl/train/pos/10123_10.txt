Shinjuku Triad Society: Chinese Mafia Wars is unlikely to get distribution in the West outside film festivals. Why? Could your censors be able to stand a movie in which the police rape suspect men and women to make them talk (and the victims like it) or does the old lady have a ripped eye from the skull? These are just some of the shocks that can befall the viewers of this amazing tale of cops and gangsters. This makes Clockwork Orange, which has been banned for years in the United Kingdom, looks like a Disney cartoon. <br /> <br /> Should you see this movie? YES It's fantastic and necessary watching for fans of Asian cinema. The shocking moments are intended to illustrate what is happening in the world of these characters. If you like it, make sure you catch Dead or Alive, which is very similar (except for the crazy ending in DOA of course). Great for Japan, they have talent, such as Miike, working at the same time as Takeshi Kitano. The best chance to watch this movie outside the retrospective of Takashi Miike at the film festival is on DVD. If I do not move you, try to hunt for the Hong Kong version on the Internet because I am sure it will appear in this country.
