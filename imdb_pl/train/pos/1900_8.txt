The late Dudley Moore had the most famous role in his too short career at ARTHUR in 1981, a noisy funny and alternating moving story that generates warm smiles, big belly laughs and an occasional tear if you have the right mood. Moore received an Oscar nomination for Best Actor for the role of Arthur Bach, a drunken playboy who "chases cars, plays tennis, caresses a woman, but has weekends and is his own boss." Arthur is to inherit $ 750 million when he marries a slutty girl named Susan Johnston (Jill Eikenberry), who is the wrong daughter of a secret gangster. Things become sticky when Arthur meets Linda Morola (Liza Minnelli), a waitress / fighting actress from Queens who steals her ties for her father's birthday. Moore lights up the screen in one of the funniest performances of the last 50 years. The late Sir John Gielgud won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for the flawless rotation of the butler and best friend Arthur, Hobson, whose outward contempt for Arthur's behavior includes more paternal feelings. There are other funny comments from Barney Martin as Linda's father. Stephen Elliott as father of Susan and Geraldine Fitzgerald as Artur's mad grandmother. The film was directed for the comedy by the first director Steve Gordon, who unfortunately died next year. A few years later, there was also an undeniable continuation, but you can not miss this immediate classic.
