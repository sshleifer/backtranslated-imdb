To dig! I would tell anyone, even if you do not like Metallica, to see "some monster", it is a "lumbar puncture" document about one of the largest teams in the world behaving like mental children during a kind of breakdown. It's fun and fascinating. The excavation comes from the same lines! The film about "The Dandy Warhol's" and "the Brian Jonestown massacre" two Portland bands, which start a peculiar musical scene in their hometown just to make one of the bands huge and one fall to the margins of the musical history of the book. From the very beginning, two teams go in opposite directions only to their ability to make decisions, whether good or bad. Filmed for seven years, and sometimes painful to see, we see the dandy's rapid rise to fame (thanks to this vodaphone ad!) And groundbreaking Jonestown falls from the initiators of the scene to quarrelsome naive. As teams become more and more chaotic, friendships are strained, and quarrels and even fights occur on several points. All this is half-funny and half-tragic, and I believe it or not, is perversely observed. As I said at the beginning, you can watch the Metallica movie, even if you're not interested in the band. To dig! on the other hand it's a bit different and it's much nicer and much easier to watch if you're interested in any band. Still a good movie, and more of a will to not be in a team than to encourage him as a career path. To dig! It is a crazy ride on the tail of the rock and roll coat and a great example of traps and pleasures of being or a desire to be famous.
