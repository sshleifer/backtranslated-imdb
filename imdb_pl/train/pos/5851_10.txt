* SPOILERY * <br /> <br /> This is only the second pay-per-view, which I gave perfectly 10, the first is the Royal Rumble from 1991. It was full of exciting matches that were unforgettable, just a one-time fun. And that's why I love it. <br /> <br /> The opening match between Razor and DiBiase, as well as Ludvig Borga vs. Marty Jannetty were the only low points. These were good matches, but DiBiase deserved a better result in the last match. Nowadays, a match like this would have a course and a bigger climax for Razor's first big thrust. And Jannetty, fresh from the Intercontinental title, could better fit Borga. But I do not think anyone really cares about that. They just needed a BGA TV on pay per view. <br /> <br /> IRS and The Kid were great, just like Michaels and Perfect. I would like Perfect to win, but Michaels does not put himself on anyone. Notice how he immediately left WWF so he would not have to work at Razor. Bret Hart had two great fights with Doink (notice how best each match against Hit-man), and then Lawler. Their competition was classical; that's why this year's Feud of the Year was obvious. How often do you see two legends winning Feud of the Year so late in their career? <br /> <br /> The Steiners-Heavenly Bodies match was one of the best this year. Who knew that Bodies could fight against one of the best teams? <br /> <br /> Many say the Undertaker-Giant Gonzalez match was a waste of time. But I loved it. Remember what made the old WWF (just like before the war) great, it was a combination of athletics and quirks. Is there any soul who did not like Ake? <br /> <br /> The main event was not bad, although it was nowhere near the status of the year. They put Lex Lug well, but they made a wise choice for Yokozuna to keep his belt. He was the first heel since Superstar Graham kept his belt for over two months. Currently, heels are masters all the time. But from the beginning of WWWF by WWF of the 90s, if you blinked, you missed control of the heel. <br /> <br /> As a fan of old wrestling, this and SummerSlam '88 are my favorites.
