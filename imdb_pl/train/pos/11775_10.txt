This, along with "Hare Tonic", counts among the best Bugs comics, and is even one of the best mistakes in history. There are a few comments about how the errors in these cartoons are "basic", which I think is not yet fully developed. Actually, I prefer this "basic" version from the mid-40s (Chuck Jones "was the best version"), which is more of a rabbit size and much more fun than the final legged version that loomed over Yosemite Sam and Daffy Duck. Bugs in the last days proved to be too polite and sophisticated for my taste. Also check "Hair Raising Hare" (1946) and "Rabbit Punch" (1948) to see great examples of classic bugs and classic Chuck Jones.
