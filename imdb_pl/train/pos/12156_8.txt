Some details of this story are based, very, very loosely, on the real events of the era in which it was placed. The story combines some details of the famous case of Leopold and Loeb with a touch of Aimee Semple McPherson. <br /> <br /> The story begins when two mothers (Shelley Winters and Debbie Reynolds) are prosecuted when they leave the courtroom. The crowd seems most likely to be hurting them because their sons have been convicted of a shameful crime. One person in the crowd apparently cuts Winters' hand as they approach the waiting car. <br /> <br /> Soon after arriving at home, dangerous phone calls begin to appear, so Reynolds suggests that they both move to the West. Build together and open a dance school. The dance school is a success and satisfies extremely unpalatable parents who think their child is the next Shirley temple. One of the parents of these spoiled children is a multimillionaire who is very happy with Reynolds and are starting to meet. Life seems very good. But when the threatening telephone conversations start again, Winters reacts by turning around - acting as if the psychotic break is approaching, and she is retreating more and more deeply into religion - listening to the radio "Sister Alma" almost constantly. Time after time, you see Winters on the edge, and that eventually ends in very bad things !! I will not say more, because it can spoil this tense and interesting movie. <br /> <br /> In many respects, this movie is similar to the horrors of Bette Davis and Joan Crawford from the 1960s, such as "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? "," Straight-Jacket "and" The Nanny ". Although none of them is exactly an intellectual tariff, at the level of kitsch they are extremely funny and fun. Writing is very good, and at the end there are a few nice phrases that make everything very exciting. Winters is great as a fragile and mad woman, and Reynolds plays one of the sexiest 39-year-olds I've ever seen - and besides, she can really, really dance. <br /> <br /> My only concern is all that some might consider Winters' hyperreligiousness in the film a bit tacky - like a cheap attack on Christianity. At first I felt this way, but when you meet Sister Alma it seems sincere and is not ridiculed, so I took Winters' religious zeal as a sign of madness - which I think is all that was intended. /> <br /> By the way, this movie is packed with "Whoever Slew Auntie Roo?" - the next horror film by Shelley Winters in 1971. Both are great fun ... and quite exaggerated!
