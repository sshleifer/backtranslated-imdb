I saw this movie when it was released when I was 17 years old and in classic rock (I'm still) ... <br /> <br /> I never liked opera before, because I hate soprano voices, but he changed it all. He was charming in the movie and had such an amazing voice. <br /> <br /> I heard on CNN that he died tonight at home for pancreatic cancer, he would miss him, and he definitely left his mark on this world. <br /> <br /> I hope I will buy a movie if I can find it, watch it and enjoy it. * smile * Maybe I should go to Amazon.com and have a look before it is sold out.
