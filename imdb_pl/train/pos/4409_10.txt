This film is one of the foundations of all time. I gave him a grade 10. The story tells the story of the famous Bushwhackers of Missouri, who fought on the side of the South during the war between states. The clothes they wore were authentic, the story and why they fought, they are very accurate and well researched. There was one battle that did not take place as presented ... but it was not bad for Hollywood. The actors were well manned and were either the most brilliant actors, or the director really knew how to get the best from them. I suspect that it was a combination of great direction, great cast, to find the right people and excellent performance by the actors. Not just one or two ... this movie really went crazy! It has action, romance, tension, good guys and bad guys (sometimes depending on the individual perspective) and story in one movie. He even has the future of Spiderman and Jewel. And she is good!
