This movie is a great entertainment to watch with my wife or girlfriend. There is a lot of laughter and a few very interesting stories for nudists. All the actresses are very interesting and definitely worth seeing in their natural beauty. Life on the beach in Maslin is full of various nudists and personality types. The Australian coastline scenery is simply great to see. What a place to visit, to put it mildly, and one day it can become my hiding place. I really like this movie and every time I watch it, I'm happy about it. I would like to see more of these characters and I always wonder what happened to them. Although the plot is a bit soft, this movie is of course a great excuse to just sit on the couch and enjoy the wonderful and famous Maslin beach with these wonderful nudists and their personal stories.
