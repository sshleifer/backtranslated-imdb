"Stairway to Heaven" is a unique invention of making movies, probably never reproduced. I rate him as the "Wizard of Oz" and the "African Queen", although it is a completely different kind of film than the "African Queen". "Stairway to Heaven" is a psycho-drama using performance concepts and technical effects that to my knowledge are completely unique. <br /> <br /> For example, there is a combination of black and white and color material - as in "Oz", but the meaning of contrast goes far beyond the simple - but beautiful - effect achieved in "Oz". In "Stairway" the goal and contrast effect can only be described as powerful. <br /> <br /> Another brilliant aspect of "Stairs" is the concept of "time" and the way it is used. How could anyone have come up with a better way to keep the time in place? literally? And then Stairway itself! <br /> <br /> If you have any imagination at all, you will agree with me. "Stairway to Heaven" is a real gem.
