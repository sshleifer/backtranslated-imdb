In the light of bad reviews - or car accidents - I feel possessed to get to the run and perform a transmission to give credit if necessary and perform the service. I'm not sure if people have a license to say that it was so bad, almost automatically. <br /> <br /> It is rare for a movie to have SUSPENSE. This movie kept the tension for the whole length, for me, despite all the flaws that may be. How many movies can it say? Not even many big ones. Due to a simple premise, you do not know if people will come out of a life-threatening situation that lasts the entire movie. Yes, the suspension was tight, and after a few shocks, the shocks did their job. It's not just a TV movie, but an action movie; it does not make sense to stop, turn back or become talkative. It would be difficult to make a movie, always on the road. I only remember the Duel or Speed. The best thing about them was also constant tension. <br /> <br /> ACTION is not bad: The judge is as good as always, and others are. <br /> <br /> SCRIPT is good. But the jury says if it can sometimes be - or it seems to be a bit awkward. What seems unrealistic is not necessarily that. Your first judgments are not always right, but I think the main actor was right in this movie. <br /> <br /> POINTS are usually great, especially in the case of a TV movie. Their only drawback can be noticeable and again visible, slow speed. But we all know how deceptively free Grand Prix cars can look like. <br /> <br /> I liked that THE BEGINNING said "inspired by real history". So you're not going to go, how is the truth? You know the basis is. Normal "based on real history" makes me think that it should be first and foremost true. But maybe it's my mistake. <br /> <br /> HOW TO SAVE US: A good reviewer's idea to suggest a truck to raise the rear wheels. A few inches would be enough. A stunt driver can do this at 100 miles per hour. Strange that they did not call a car expert - not a car electrician or mechanic - to see if there was a way. <br /> <br /> I hope this review has reversed the fact that this movie is a disaster. Or at least neutral. And help him become an unquestionable success. <br /> <br /> The picture quality is a bit soft like on a DVD. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: They would have been drawn after the child was, but strangely the idea of ​​saving life was cleverly resolved in some joking conversations to extinguish it. I think we know why. End of the movie. Suspension disbelief came out of the upper window with the child.
