A great movie and a great example of how scary a movie can be without showing the viewer anything. It is a collection of four stories that revolve around the tenants of a charmingly old-fashioned home and their terrifying and terrifying fates. All this is related to the story about Scotland Yard inspector looking for a missing horror movie star. It starts with a story about a mysterious writer whose main character becomes a little too realistic, followed by a story about two old romantic rivals who are obsessed with a wax figure in the museum, and then stories about a sweet angelic little child who is anything but closing the story of what happened to the lost movie star and what he does to the inspector. It's a great print that really lets you appreciate Duffel's work and what he was able to achieve with a very small budget. Add to this the acting talents of Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Denholm Elliott, Joss Ackland, Ingrid Pitt and Jon Pertwee, and you'll get a movie that you can watch many times. Just do not answer the phone, if any of the conversations from Stoker Real Estate offer you a market for a beautiful house in the English countryside?
