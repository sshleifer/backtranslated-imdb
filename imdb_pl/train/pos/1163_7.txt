This movie was released by Roger Corman, so you know that the filmmakers did not have much money to work. <br /> <br /> Although some viewers may miss the subtleties of this movie because of the very typical "obsessive" killer marketing approach, there are unique differences in this video. <br /> <br /> AMANDA, played by obviously talented Justine Priestley, has a complex character. Some people like these movies precisely because violence may seem accidental, but here the consequences of past abuses (considered in a realistic, but tasteful way) are what shapes AMANDA's psychosis. Surprisingly, Amanda finally buys out the act of love, in which most of these films turn into a typical battle for life and death, and the bad character eventually dies as badly as at the beginning. <br /> <br /> Rough edges in this photo, but I have to give it 7 out of 10 stars based on its thought and yes, the originality in comparison with the usual - especially in the case of the budget.
