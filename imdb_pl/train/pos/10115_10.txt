The film tells of the cruelty in Derry 30 years ago, which is commonly known as Bloody Sunday. <br /> <br /> The film is well researched, played and directed. It is so close to the truth that we will receive until the completion of Saville's investigation. The film puts cruelty in the context of time. It also shows the ferocity of soldiers on the day of cruelty. Disgraceful white washing, which was Widgera Tribunal, is also treated. <br /> <br /> In general, this is an excellent drama that moves and shocks. When the Saville report appears, watch this video again to see how close the truth is.
