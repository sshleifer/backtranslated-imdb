Believe it or not, the last case of Inspector Gadget's made me interested in the whole gadget. <br /> <br /> My name is Miriam and I'm twelve, so obviously I was not around when Inspector Gadget was at the top of his career. Sure, I heard about him, but I did not really know him. <br /> <br /> While reading, notice that I HAVE NEVER SEEN ORIGINAL SERIES (I'd like it to happen!). It's the only thing I've ever seen (although I'm obsessed now) and I will focus on what I like because everyone else is so negative. For all of you, pessimists, I have some drawbacks. = P First, for a childish sense of humor, you can consider this movie quite funny. I thought it was, so sue me. I also thought that animations and character designs are good, and I'm happy that there are more gadgets in them, because it is my favorite character. (I do not like Penny.) Then he was Claw (though his voice was horrible) and Madcat; I thought they are quite good too. The gadget's idiot seemed pretty good, if not a bit exaggerated (ie sucking a thumb for a hand with a hat.) However, he would make a good screen shot. = P) Oh, and I liked the song that was in the credits. Yes, I'm strange. <br /> <br /> And, like all movies, there are some negatives. <br /> <br /> Talking cars? What is going on? You can say that it was aimed at younger boys. It would not bother me so much if it were not for the fact that the cars essentially saved the day. I'd rather have Penny and Brain take their place. And apparently Gadget loved his car more than you would call it natural. A bit strange, to say the least. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the boss was mean to the gadget. I mean, sheesh, yes, he was not always the most cheerful of people, but he did not hate the gadget from what I read. Like the Inspector, his personality was exaggerated. <br /> <br /> Well, that's all I have to say about this movie. I thought the animation made up the plot focused on the car and that it was pretty decent; more than movies with live gadgets (massacred, massacred, BUTCHERED!). Maybe I'm just biased, because that's what prompted me to Gadget at first, or maybe my mind is twisted, or maybe just strange, but I really liked this movie, even if I'm the oldest, it's recommended for.
