A really sweet movie that has some similarities to the hit "My Sassy Girl" from 2001, but it can rave about most of the time. The biggest applause should concern two leads. Ha-Neul Kim is both sweet and bizarre, Sang-woo Kwon is both attractive and rebellious. The chemistry between them is very good. <br /> <br /> Director Kyeong-hyeong Kim uses some CG cartridges to improve visual effects, and offers impressive battle scenes in which Sang-woo Kwon can shine. I liked it here much better than in the overrated "Volcano High". And this boy has a future - these looks, these fighting techniques and a romantic trail. Not bad. <br /> <br /> Well, I can shorten it: a nice movie. My rating: 7/10
