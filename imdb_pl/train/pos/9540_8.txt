Most of the feedback I've heard about the Meatball Machine was quite mixed up. The couple even say they think it "sucked". Well, for those people I'm talking about, get some f @ ckin imagination and go alone. It was a very funny movie. <br /> <br /> The story begins with this mechanical error that attacks and somehow transforms its hosts into costume costumes, called the Necroborgs. In the end you find out that these mechanical errors also attach to you a small parasite, which then is able to control your actions due to the hot wiring of your nervous system. Unfortunately for two lonely young adults looking for love, they happen to cross with a mechanical error and before you know it, there are changes and the blood spatter. Is there a way to stop the transformation? Maybe a way to stop the risk of mechanical error? Why are Necroborgs fighting each other? Can two desperate singles express their feelings for themselves and do nasty things? Only one way to find out. <br /> <br /> Entering the Meatball Machine I was a bit cautious due to the mixed reactions, but it turned out to be a big surprise. A few unanswered questions, sometimes average acting and a slightly confusing ending are the only weak points I can think of. From anime to parasites, who themselves become small characters, and even to a low budget, this film hits the right mark much more than it misses. With a constantly evolving story that is interesting enough to ask questions all the time mixed with cool make-up and blood spatter effects, this is one move that bizarro / horror / Tetsuo / splatter fans should check. 8 outta 10
