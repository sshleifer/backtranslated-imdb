I really enjoyed watching this movie about the sisters of Delany. I knew about them, but that's all. This film opened my eyes to their bravado and courage. What a couple. What sacrifices have they made to live on their own terms. This is not just a movie for African Americans, but for all Americans. This is a kind of history and documentary lesson combined with a fun film biography. The actors were better than everyone, and we really see the difficulties these two sisters have had over the years. Both sisters are very different. They come from a very loving and very strict family with high, maybe even impossible standards of excellence. Sadly, Sadie's father did not let his daughter still see her boyfriend because of a possible misunderstanding. I totally recommend this movie and I'm glad I caught him on TV one day.
