What can you say about the show of this size? "The Sopranos" has literally redefined television as we know it. He broke all the rules and set new standards for television excellence. Everything is impeccable, writing, directing, and above all acting. By watching this program, you will find that these characters are NOT real. The actor is trying to convince you that there is a real Tony Soprano or any character. This program is also very versatile. Some people do not watch the show because it's brutal, it's not just about violence, it's about business, family and many deeper things that depend on what you see as a fan. I do not like for me when people refer to the show, the mafia show. For me, it's a show about the family. A family that is out of the crowd from generation to generation. In general, it is a masterpiece of the show. That's how television should be. Here. Complex characters from stunning acting, great stories of brilliant writing and what do you get when you mix these ingredients together? A show that defines perfection and dares to be different.
