When I heard that this movie comes out the night before Halloween, I was very excited. When I found out that it was a book written in 1978, I had to read it before watching the movie. I'm sure the movie would be completely different to me if I did not read the book. The writers have indeed done a good job, remaining loyal to the main topics of the book, of course with few differences. I think the most disappointing is that in the film Boyle played the role of a colonel. I am not a big fan of Boyle and it seems that regardless of the mood during the movie, she always tries to use her - stuffed lips and dark-eyed eyes, to look super sexy. Indeed, I think that the film was faithful to the real horror of the house. My favorite thread was the Sheehan family (which is so strange that the son was killed in Iraq, and in the current events is Casey Sheehan, whose mother set out on a great tirade against Iraq). In the book, of course, the war was not Iraq, but rather Vietnam, and when the house turns on the video showing the son in the helicopter, I was really scared. In general, I was impressed by the film because it followed the book very well.
