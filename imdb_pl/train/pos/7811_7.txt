Steve Biko was a black activist who tried to resist the white minority of the ruling South African in the same way that Gandhi tried to resist the colonialism of the British Empire in India. The film by Richard Attenborough Cry Freedom does not apply to Biko or Apartheid as much as to Donald Woods, a white liberal newspaper publisher who risked his life trying to tell the story of Biko. The film has a horrifying view after Biko dies in prison because of the twisting behavior of the South African "police". Woods, played by Kevin Kline, must decide whether to do the right thing and run away from the country to publish books about Biko or let his wife, Penelope Wilton, press him to forget about the books. In this case, Biko dies in vain. What begins with the life-changing friendship between Biko and Woods is turning into a norm, because numbers flee over border yarn after Biko's death. Oscar-nominated Denzel Washington is good only in his fourth film as Biko, but something is wrong in the film, which tries to present Apartheid's struggles, focusing more on the rehearsals of the white family for more than half of the film. Attenborough would have served him better, focusing on Biko's promotion, instead of starting where Biko made friends with Woods. Perhaps the black actor in the leading role in the film lasting 2 1/2 hours did not favor too much movie casinos, but the film was still a huge flop. Apart from film policy, the film still plays and sends a message, though it is cleaned up in PG. *** 4 stars.
