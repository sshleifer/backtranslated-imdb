After watching the TV show Next Action Star, I was happy to see the winners' movie right away. I was wary of such a presentation of new talents, but I was pleasantly surprised and delighted. Billy Zane was, of course, his usual great self, but Corinne and Sean clung to him. It was also nice to see Jared and Jeanne (also from the competition) in their episodic roles. The character of Sean, not Billy, is hunting, and his frustration with discovering new rules in the game is well done. Corinne goes well along the lines between his character who likes Sean and only in him for money. I loved how the game was played until the last second. And then on! This is not a great movie, but a fun and great presentation for two for the first time outside the gate.
