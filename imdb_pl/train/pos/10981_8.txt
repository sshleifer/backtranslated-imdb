Hey, now really, TheaterX, he found it at the flea market in the almost new state, and while reading from the back of the box, I saw that it was a "cult hit", so of course he came home from me. <br /> <br /> What a strange movie. Auntie and cousin of former first lady Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis lives in this decaying home with 28 rooms on Long Island (Suffolk Co.) and shares the house with raccoons, cats, fleas (see!) And who knows what else. At some point, Suffolk Co. it was behind them, because it lived in dirt, and Jackie herself came to fix everything. Anyway, it's one strange couple, Big Edie and Little Edie ... Edie (daughter) always wears something on the head and dances, sings and gives little to the camera, which rarely makes sense. Big Edie (mother aged 79) apparently likes to run naked, and while we get tips on what may look fortunate, it was tasteful (?) Done to the point where we are pitying from it. These women talk, talk and talk, mainly about the past, and it does not make much sense except for them. They live in absolute dirt, cats do their business anywhere ("Look, this cat goes to the bathroom behind my portrait!"), And one bedroom seems to be their operational center. If I close my eyes and listen to Big Edie's voice, it reminds me very much of my aunt who came from this country and had an accent Lawn Guyland. In one of the scenes Little Edie dressed up in a deterrent, beautifully, you can see all the cats scratching all the time, so the place had to be attacked. The box refers to these two women as "eccentric" and I have to say that in this case it's just a euphemism for "zipped out," but this movie is not devoid of moments when you really feel something for themselves. This is equal parts terrifying, sad and disgusting, but I could not stop watching when I started. This is not my "normal" type of filming, but it turned out to be a bit fascinating. However, this will not be guaranteed for everyone.
