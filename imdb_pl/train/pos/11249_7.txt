I just watched the entire 6 episodes on DVD. The whole is excellent - no doubt. I must say that there was not enough action for me. No real tension as such, just a lot of first-class character development. Nothing like Tinker Tailor in terms of "whodunnit". If you prefer a good story and are told to you, it is for you. Peter Egan as the host Magnus Pym is perfect. <br /> <br /> The film showed the traitor's life. A man who should be a loyal member of the British Intelligence Service, but who has been so mentally damaged by his unhappy childhood that fraud has become his way of life in all matters. As a child, he adored his father, but his father was exposed as a cheater and cheater for a long time. Pym did not betray ideology or money, but because he had to deceive his family (wife, son, mentor). Pym is deadly damaged by his father's influence - he devoured his moral fiber. There is no real love or loyalty in it. <br /> <br /> Heavy psychological things and few light moments in the 6-hour series. Very well done.
