I must say that the worst part of the movie was the first half hour. I really was confused by who is who. For example, Bill Paxson's character had long hair and was wearing a jacket. Then, when all the males reached the camp, it turned out that there was a character who looked like Bill Paxson, but she was not. I said where is Bill Paxson? Then there was a guy with his girlfriend. He said he was 21 years old. It was supposed to be a 20-year meeting of the most memorable director of the camp (Alan Arkin). Later the same girl contacted and talked about her experiences from the camp. This did not make sense. She would have one year. Nevertheless, the film turned out to be quite good. Kevin Pollak was a nice guy who was always teased. One guy was a complete narcissist and eventually lost his beautiful girlfriend. Alan Arkin was interesting as an old style camp director who admits that he lost contact with modern youth. The best was that none of the adults were successful in life. None of them had great careers. It seemed very real. The film was compared to The Big Chill. In a sense, it was not as exciting as Big Chill, but it was much more realistic. So, although the beginning is not promising, the movie has changed quite well.
