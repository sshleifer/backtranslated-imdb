Legend of Zu is probably the most exciting movie I've seen in recent years. It goes beyond all expectations and is really a work of art. With unparalleled visual scenery and a story of divine proportions, Legend of Zu passes over his audience with his majesty. This movie is wonderfully made thanks to the use of advanced cgi technologies that allow fans of the fantasy genre to see how their visions come alive. Acting is great for this type of movie; if you were immortal with supernatural powers, I would think that you would keep more for yourself. <br /> <br /> Unlike many comments, the plot is quite EASY to follow, keeping up the fast pace that adds an urgent sense. Anyone who can not follow different characters simply does not have to pay attention or is accustomed to levels of sophistication like titans. The plot is addictive and layered with themes so epic that it will leave you breathless. Legend of Zu is so high that perhaps many people are discouraged by its size. Let yourself be completely absorbed by the fantastic vision and you will love this movie.
