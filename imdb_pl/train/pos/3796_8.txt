Jim McKay made one of the best movies you'll see all year round. The silent simplicity of this film attracts you from the initial shot and never lets go. There is no one false note in the whole film. Not everything. Everything works. The handheld camera never gets distracted and always where it should be. Three young ladies whose lives we follow are always true. There is not a single rhythm in which the audience is reminded that we are looking at acting actresses. just real girls are trying to find. There is no political, hidden or other agenda. This is the cinema in the simplest edition, and although it will probably be viewed by only a handful of viewers, it deserves a much wider edition. special hats for Hugh Hefner for providing the filmmakers with the subsidies needed to make this important movie. I can not wait to see what Mr. McKay is doing.
