I've only seen it recently, but I've been aware of it for many years and have always been intrigued by its title. Now it belongs to me as one of my favorite movies. It is difficult to describe the amazing subject that Maysles discovered, but everything works great in it. It has so many unforgettable images and moments in which you feel that you are entering a very private world. I fell in love with this film and the characters it contains. It's as if the creators cast the charm of the audience and dragged us into the strange world of eccentric Beales, a real aristocratic family. It has a tangible atmosphere and I regret that I can not be away from it all by boiling corn on my bedside table. There is sadness in the air. A fall from the size of this once-respected family. The money disappeared, but their air and favors remained, just like their beauty. It drew me from the first frame and I thought about their fate long after the movie was over. Wondering if, if I went for a walk along East Hampton beach, I could hear Old Edie's voice at night and see the silhouette of Little Edie dancing in the window behind the thick hanging vines. Unforgettable.
