I recently rented an animated version of "The Lord of the Rings" on the video after watching the movie "FANTASTIC 2001". The trilogy of Lord of the Rings directed by Peter Jackson will undoubtedly be much better than the trilogy of George Lucas's "Prequel" "Star Wars" (Episodes 1-3), which is a real fantasy series of the 21st century! > <br /> I remember that I saw an animated version as a child and did not fully understand the depth of the film at that time. Now that I've read the books, I understand what's going on in the story. Of course, some characters are quite stupid (Samwise Gangee is particularly annoying, almost the same as Jar Jar Binks in Star Wars Episode One, (AWFUL!)), But I must say that he follows the book quite close, and goes to part two of the book " Two towers". The good thing is that the action is quite interesting, and some of the animation is quite unusual for its time. The worst thing is that it ends abruptly in the middle of the Two Towers without a result that Frodo wanted to destroy with one ring, and the animation looks quite outdated compared to today's standards. <br /> <br /> In general, not as bad as many say. BUT, version from 2001. Live is a new feature of the Lord of the Rings! At least Ralph Bakshi took the script seriously! Peter Jackson said the animated version inspired him to read books, which in turn made him one of the greatest fantasy series in history, so we can at least thank Ralph Bakshi for that! I will take the animated version of The Lord of the Rings over the live version of Harry Potter! <br /> <br /> 7 from a scale of 1 to 10, MUCH much more violent than the 2001 version. Live, but not so good! For die-hard fans of books and film versions of The Lord of the Rings.
