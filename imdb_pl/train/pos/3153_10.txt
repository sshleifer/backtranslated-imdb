I will make it short and sweet, because I do not think that you can really tell someone about this concert, who has never seen it differently than its fun and unique, for me this is probably the funniest performance in history. <br /> <br /> You must really look to understand his humor and take a few episodes to really take care of him, but once you're there, there is no way out. For example, the way Hydesa always wants to see his friends get into trouble, the more it happens, the more fun he gets. <br /> <br /> It's a whole classic classic, I mean cast, writers, director, it's just a recipe for success. One of the actors who seems to always be hard is Ashton Kutcher, but I mean, he's great on the show. I do not think Kelso's character could be played by someone else. stupid. All the main characters are great and it would not be worth the assessment, if I did not mention the stone, cold fox Mila Kunis, now it is a spicy meeting with the ball, which jokes, just in case.
