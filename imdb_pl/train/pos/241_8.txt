I'm tired of people rating films based on their "historical accuracy." IT'S THE PEOPLE OF THE FILM !! Writers and directors should make their own contribution to history! There are many movies that are not entirely consistent with the story ... Braveheart, Wyatt Earp, Gangs from New York, Geronimo: An American Legend, The Last of the Mohicans .... all fantastic movies that are historically gentle. If you want to see some great actors who do what they do best, I suggest you see this movie and not worry about the accuracy of the facts. Just enjoy the quality of the film, the story and one of the greatest actors of our time.
