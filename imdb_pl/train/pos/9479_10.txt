The Tian remake is not good at all. I click on his documentary remake to see Wei Wei, the original actress from the classic 1948 movie, which speaks a few words to the crew. On Sunday (28/03/2010) we will meet with Wei Wei after the show Xiao Cheng Zhi Chun in Hong Kong Film Archiev. Wei Wei is almost 90 years old in silver hair, her performance in Hong Kong films is always a surprise for fans. During this year's Hong Kong Film Festival, a special program devoted to Fei Mu, the director of this epic movie and still watched in the film Wei Wei in Hong Kong. My son, who is 21 this year, is surprised that Wei Wei was so beautiful at the time.
