Imagine putting out the lights on a remote farm on a cold night and then going to bed. There is no need to block the door. The only sound is the wind whistling through the trees. Some time after midnight a car with lights on in the driveway. A moment later the intruder drops the flashlight into the darkened living room. <br /> <br /> What makes this picture so frightening is the setting: a distant farm ... at night. Based on the bestseller book Truman Capote and black and white lighting comparable to the best 40's noir movies. In Cold Blood depicts a horrifying story, especially in this first act, because the story takes place mainly at night and on a rain-drenched country road. This is a nightmare nightmare. But this is not a dream. The events really happened in 1959. <br /> <br /> Two enemies with heads full of illusions kill the entire Kansas family, looking for a cash supply that does not exist. Director Richard Brooks has used the real places where real events took place, even the farmhouse ... and its interior! This makes the film unforgettable and haunted. <br /> <br /> Both main actors are very similar to two real killers. Robert Blake is more than convincing, like Perry Smith, short and stocky, with legs in his buttocks who dreams of finding the hidden treasure of Cortez. Scott Wilson is almost as good as Dick Hickock, a smoothly talking artist with an American smile. <br /> <br /> The duo goes to Mexico. Things go wrong, so they come back to the United States, steal cars, hitchhike, and generally are unhappy when they are wandering from place to place. But this fool's life and both outlaws soon regret their actions. The last twenty minutes of the movie are mesmerizing when it rains, the rope tightens, and all we hear is the beat of the beating heart. <br /> <br /> Even with the somewhat mundane, medium act, "In Cold Blood", the stages of riveting describe a true story that is still hypnotizing, almost half a century later. It does this setting. Do you suppose that people in rural Kansas still leave the door open ... at night?
