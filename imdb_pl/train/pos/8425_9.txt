In the end, I watched these episodes in 2008 and had to keep coming back and checking when they were made. They are absolutely terrifying because they have made room for fun from the future. Either Parker and Stone lived in Texas and witnessed Gov Bush's idiocy, or those weird, amazing people who pay attention to things. Boo, scary! Brothers of the Bush brothers invading the White House dressed as Arab with rifles? Bush accidentally killed someone? (No, wait, he did it like a gov.) It may seem a failure as a sitcom at the time, but now it must be considered a genius, if it's awful, prescience.
