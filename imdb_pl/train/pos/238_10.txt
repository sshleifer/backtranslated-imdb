It's hard to imagine a better movie than it <br /> <br /> Hey, before you all go to me, "Chick Flick". I am a very big Strong & Masculine, Macho Man, who seems to think that it was one of the better films of the last 20 years. <br /> <br /> Acting was great and the story was wonderful. It is a wonderful remedy for the heart and soul. Acting could not be better or better planted. <br /> <br /> I know that Mercedes Ruehl, Holly Hunter, Joan Plowright, Dame Edith Evans, Sissy Spacek, Judi Dench are among the greatest actresses ever to appear in the film. And of course, Cloris Leachman (also in this film) in my opinion can actually exceed all of them in the sheared magnum of her talent and the various roles in which she has performed for years. In any case, it was an amazing cast. This movie was like a book you can not put down, and when you reach the last page, you wish more ... more. I can not understand all the time why this movie here on IMDb only evaluates at 3.9 <br /> <br /> This rating is amazing for me. Maybe not. Perhaps I really understand it so well and it makes me very sad. It makes me so sad that films such as "American Beauty" "Leaving Las Vegas" "Sexy Beast" and "Fight Club" gain popularity on the charts, when in reality, at least in this opinion viewers should receive "R "Rating ... R, which means" trash ". Hey, okay, I realize there are many different stories in this world for a lot of different audiences, but it's a sad commentary when this charming, powerful ... incredibly, directed, acting and film seems to be overgrown. <br /> <br /> Of course, it was also in the Oscars .... How sad. And as predictable. In summary, if you want to see a powerful, happy, sad, beautiful story? watch ...... it's best to own this movie ...
