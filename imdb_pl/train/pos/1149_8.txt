A quick and funny satire about the original "reality TV", a soap opera. The screenplay by Robert Harling is full of lines and funny situations. The best of these is the culmination, live transmission, which is rapidly deteriorating to poor improvisation and brain transplantation. Keven Kline's killing his line, because of not wearing glasses, is fun. "Her brain explores laterally in the next few houses." The brilliant cast is on the same page as Kline. Sally Field, Elizabeth Shue, Cathy Moriarty, Robert Downey Jr., Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher, Garry Marshall and Kathy Najimy are perfect. It's a real treat to see how the click is cast like in this movie. It's a classic that somehow slipped through cracks. <br /> <br /> P.S. The result of Alan Silvestri is an extra bonus. Fits the soap opera with its extravagant and melodramatic air.
