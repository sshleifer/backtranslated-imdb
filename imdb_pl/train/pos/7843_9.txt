I can not believe they took it off the air. Especially when they have only a few episodes left. My daughter, sister and some of my friends loved watching this program. We were so upset when they stopped showing it because of the so-called ratings. It is not fair to people who have watched this program from the beginning. We had the right to see the end. I would like them to take a general voice from all people with the voting system 3 times a year. They can send documents by post, and we, as viewers, can cast a general voice on all the programs we watch or hear about. It can also help in the promotion of the new program. People saw it and wondered what it was. Not only can you see what viewers are watching, but also use it as a tool for free TV and cable advertising. We want to see other episodes. Bring it back !!
