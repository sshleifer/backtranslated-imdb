I saw Walking Tall movies for the first time when I was about 8 years old and I thought that both Joe Don Baker and Bo Svenson did a great job, they have to have it anyway, because from watching movies I tried to learn so much about the real Sheriff Buford Pusser, like I can. All three parts of the movie gave me shivers, and Buford Pusser was a real hero, I just want him to live today and that there were more people like him. I would like to thank him for getting rid of all the crimes and being so brave. I am very sorry that his family had to go through such horror and pain. My heart comes to meet them. So, from the 30-year-old fan of Sheriff Pusser and the three-part Walking Tall movies and the actors who introduced him, please do not be negative about these movies and actors, just try to let us know what a great man Buford Pusser was and what a wonderful family he had. And for all young people who have not heard much about Buford, I suggest you watch Walking Tall movies and learn more about him.
