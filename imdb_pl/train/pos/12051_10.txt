This movie has been giving me nightmares for months and I'm 17 years old. This is the scariest movie ever made! It's not an exaggeration !! I saw this film at school in English lessons and no one else was afraid, which surprised me. After reading the other reviews, I'm happy that I'm not the only person who found it terrible !!
