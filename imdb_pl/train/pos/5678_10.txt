We could still use Black Adder even today. Imagine that Rowan Atkinson returns to the role of assistant prime minister played by the wonderful Hugh Laurie. Hugh is sensational as a stupid prince George and Edmund as his brilliant assistant. I love the episode where Kenneth Connor plays as the British thespian. Every time Edmund tells Macbeth. Two servants make a stupid act to drive away evil spirits. These are the funniest things you will see. Of course, none of this brilliant genius and comedy genius could be done without Ben Elton and Richard Curtis, who are also behind the films "Love in Reality", "Thin Blue Line", "Four Weddings and a Funeral." Black Adder is funny and almost too good for television. Humor can be smart, sexy and funny. I was hoping that last night on Saturday Night Live, Hugh Laurie would pay tribute to his origins in British humor. If the SNL gang had done some research, they'd know what a treasure it would be if Hugh Laurie loved their scene.
