The simple creation of movies can be powerful and captivating. This film tells a story with everyday scenes that can delight in the emotions hidden in them. It is true, as others have said, how this film really makes it blatantly obvious how lost Hollywood is in its special effects, overly emotional and over the top of the climate and forget about the essence of a significant story told with simple realism. Much of what these characters are going through is rather a scene rather than a clear dialogue. One of the aspects that I really liked in the film was the contrast of two brothers, one so expressive in a childish manner, and the other completely stoic, but both able to evoke deep emotions. The older brother had to say little, as he usually did, it was all in this mortal face! Beautiful photos, great acting, great direction! It can not be missed!
