I just watched it because it played Josie Lawrence, who I knew <br /> <br /> from Whose Line is it Anyway ?, a crazy British improvised <br /> <br /> comedy. I was very pleasantly surprised by this magic gem. It is uplifting, moving and romantic, without being affectionate and sentimental. The protagonists are <br /> <br /> all real people, with real weaknesses, fears and needs. Look at this.!
