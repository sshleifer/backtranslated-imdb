I watched this movie many years ago and I have been looking for it since then, although in my opinion very strict is very educational, when it comes to what the future might bring, I liked the movie and I highly apologize to this day all those who disagree but the film should always be evaluated at its own discretion, and in my opinion it is a great way to do what is happening today with children with cloning and test tubes, which we have to evaluate in this film, it can be a dramatic event of what is to become, but you are there. All the horrors of today are so far advanced that I even laugh, but that makes me wonder and frighten me like my mother, if I was desperate, after watching this movie I would think twice, but I love this movie. do not watch the movie - just get to know the story and ask yourself, how far would you go for a child?
