I loved this movie, watched this evening on the big cinema screen! The audience laughed loudly about very interesting things, and the fast pace was the most enjoyable. <br /> <br /> I, as a singer and music director, question one part of Roby Keeler's vocal in "By a Waterfall. "The key was modulating, and she suddenly sang much lower, in a very gentle voice that was not similar to the tin-like twitter, which she used in all other vocals. was it exaggerated by another singer? It sounds to me. I would like to know. <br /> <br /> Thank you very much.
