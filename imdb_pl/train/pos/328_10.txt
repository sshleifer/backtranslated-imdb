Fascinating, I approached I Am Curious (Yellow) and his companion with great anxiety. I have read numerous reports on her widely advertised controversy and explicit sex. I did not get this, but a completely provocative and immersive cinema experience, unlike any other. I honestly believe that most commentators who felt the movie was "lame" or "boring" came up to the movie as if it were pornography. Perhaps it is pornography, assuming that pornography is something that is supposed to fuel the senses, but is deliberately non-erotic. Lena, the heroine, pushes everything into her performance, giving it a realistic and human character that is simply convincing and lasting. Her breasts may be saggy, her nipples extremely large, her thighs thick, her face plump. But at the end of the film, the audience identifies with her and accepts her mistakes as human. This touch gives it even more credibility when it is necessary. If the director threw the bomb Briget Bardot, the effect would be annulled. I can not recommend this inspirational passage more highly. Be prepared to invest a lot of thought in this purposely targeted movie. The patient and humble viewer will be fully rewarded in the way most other films can dream of.
