This beautiful story about an older son who comes home and learns to love and be part of all the things he left at home to escape, is moving and moving. It shows a society that may be strange to us in the Western world, with the sense of the family we have lost. The story is beautiful, sad and sometimes funny and comic. It has a sense of realism that we can no longer see in our western films. <br /> <br /> Acting is extraordinary, because along with the progress of the film almost gives the impression that it is not acting, but a document of ordinary people. This is brilliant directing and film making. <br /> <br /> I would like to see more of the director's films.
