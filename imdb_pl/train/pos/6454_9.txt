I saw this movie at the Palm Springs International Film Festival in 2005, and from the 14 films that I saw there, I would include this movie for my third film. I was initially interested in the fact that it is a Swedish origin with many of my ancestors from the Norrland region of Sweden, where they were filmed. I also grew up in the rural forests of North America, where many small towns were very similar to this movie. It's nice to see more films using rural locations such as SÃ¥ som and himmelen. It was a very good movie and I'm sure a very difficult movie to do with his cast of a great band, but director Kay Pollock really did it after almost two decades of director's absence. Helen Sjoholm in her debut movie as an actress was fantastic and I could not wait for her more on the big screen. I liked Michael Nyqvist at the head of this well-rounded cast. I highly recommend this film and rate it at 9.0 on a scale of 10.
