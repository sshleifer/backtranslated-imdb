This film has not only one of the best film titles, but also the third group of children's actors from the 70s Ike Eissenman and Kim Richards. I think I remember the movie that was broadcast on Halloween in 1978, when he appeared in our house against Linda Blair in Stranger. I missed the first time choosing a different movie. Later, repeating, I saw that I made the right choice. The film is not really bad, but it really does not have chills and surprises. Nevertheless, I liked the scene where Richard Crenna shoots the family dog ​​unsuccessfully.
