This group of English professionals is pleased to watch. The supporting staff could create their own series. This is the tiangle seen before the love between the head of surgery, his wife and a nice new boy, an operator. Only the excellent acting skills of Francesca Annis, Michael Kitchen and sexy Robson Greene raise this from the category of rubbish to a very pleasant "romp". The only controversy is that it is difficult to accept that smoldering Francesca Annis will fall in love and marry Michael Kitchen who, like me, is not an international or even British sex symbol. You can easily understand why Robson Green would light her fire by apologizing for the "Door". The guy who almost steals the show with a great "laid back" performance is Owen's father, David Bradley. Watch it in "The Way We Live Now", in a completely different performance to get to know its range. Daniela Nardini as Kitchen secretary, once an erotic toy, it's hard to forget as a rejected lady who makes Kitchen apologize that he ever looked at her big body. Conor Mullen and Julian Rhind-Tutt, as surgeons to Green's surgeons, as I said, may have their own series. They are so good. The whole is great fun, and I heartily recommend it and I thank you for letting the paying customers pay a statement in this fascinating place.
