Critics did not like this movie. He bombed in the States, resulting in only a limited show in Britain. It was a great shame because it represents British rather than American humor and should be shown in the UK first. <br /> <br /> Nicole Kidman looks stunning and is a totally convincing Russian. Ben Chaplin is the character of Dustin Hoffman from "The Graduate", and "Birthday Girl" has at least 4 scenes that remind the viewer of the classics of the 60s (although it is a completely different story!). <br /> <br /> Bright changes the tack many times, from comedy to black comedy, to thriller and adventure - but it is unforgettable, moving and a breath of fresh air compared to the average megabudget hit. <br /> <br /> See it with an open mind!
