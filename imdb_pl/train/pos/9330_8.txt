"Dangerous criminal" is the story of a seemingly anti-social girl and how it came about. It's based on a true story, and although I was irritated by the monorail image, i.e. Ever-darkened, title hero and hard-to-believe dedication of her lawyer, I am forced to accept that life imitates art and that there are people like that. <br /> <br /> The movie goes well for me, because although the attitude of the title character is slightly relaxed, until the end, it gradually goes into compassion for her because the film shows how she reached her current state - what turns out be self-destructive and not anti-social. <br /> <br /> A really moving movie that will bring you your throat when you think about it - which will happen often. <br /> <br /> Despite many disadvantages (including hard to watch, sometimes due to body function and suicide attempts) is another production that I am proud to call a Canadian.
