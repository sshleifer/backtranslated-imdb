The short film that begins this movie is a real movie material named Gary, apparently taken randomly to a television station parking where Gary works in the city of Beaver. Gary is a bit "different"; he is a performer and drives an old Chevy named Farrah (after Fawcett). Lo and here the filmmaker gets a letter from Gary some time later, inviting him to return to Beaver to get material from the local talent competition he created, including Gary's stunning performance as Olivia Newton Dawn. Oh my. Two shorts is Gary's story, the same you've only witnessed - Sean Penn and the other - Glover's The Orkly Kid. If you're in the mood for joking someone, this is definitely a movie to watch. Most of the time I was excited about laughing, especially the performance of Crispins, who could certainly be in himself. When it was over, I had to rewind the film to see the real Gary again and his shiny idiocy. Although the main goal was Olivia, I would like to see one of the "fictional" shorts that will challenge the personification of Barry Manilow Gary, who was equally ridiculous.
