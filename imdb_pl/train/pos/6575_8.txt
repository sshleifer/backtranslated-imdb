"Arms and the Man" is one of the funniest Shaw games if it's properly supported, and the production is good enough. Helena Bonham-Carter, the movie star, is Raina, the daughter of a military family who has a peacock fianc√© (Patrick Ryecart), and who protects the soldier against the enemy (Pip Torrens) during a raid on the city. <br /> <br /> Full of color and energy this production tears at a good pace, and if Bonham-Carter and Patsy Kensit as a maid are a bit eclipsed by the rest of the cast, they are still clinging to the ground. Kika Markham and Dinsdale Landen as parents are delighted, and the whole game is generally happy. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it.
