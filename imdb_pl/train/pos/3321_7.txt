By accident I saw something like "Fever Pitch"; he played on a plane going to Europe. Actually, it was not half bad. Ben (Jimmy Fallon) is the world's first Red Sox fan, but his relationship with Lindsay Meeks (Drew Barrymore) can put a strain on that. The film is quite an interesting look at how events around the world can affect interpersonal relationships. This is especially eye-opening now that Red Sox has finished its run of losing after 80 odd years. I think that these kinds of things happen all the time and we just do not notice them. Not bad. <br /> <br /> Another film showing an unusual relationship with baseball is the "Frequency" of 2000. Check them both.
