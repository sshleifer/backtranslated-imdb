Okay, so the first few seasons took some time to go to special effects, but from the very beginning Hidden Frontier consistently gave good stories and performances and was always willing to make mistakes. They advise people to see newer episodes first so that they can see how good the program is and understand how much has changed since the first episodes. The cast has fantastic comradeship and shows up on the screen. <br /> <br /> The influx of hospitable actors who stand out in the exhibition and with the fans also testifies to the performance, because the plot changes in strength. The show pushed the barriers with different plot lines - depression, drug addiction and mainstream homosexuality - and they could have rubbed off some people in the wrong way, but this is Star Trek. He presents these threads in an intelligent and emotional way, dealing with them subtly and fluently. <br /> <br /> Yes, they used some of the characters from Trek's history, but they did it fairly - characters like Shelby, Lefler and Necheyev, very unused in the show, were reborn in New Frontier books, but after a while they lost sizzle, when Peter David was more prone to wild fantasy than serious science fiction, and HF shows these characters in a completely different light, which better serves them. <br /> <br /> The site also allows fans to interact with chat rooms and forums, and they can get to know the people involved. They spend spells on each episode, so fans can see how they laugh, because they are people doing it in their free time, with a dedication that will make many professional actors get shocked! <br /> <br /> What this series, now approaching the end after 7 years, has achieved on such a limited amount of resources, is nothing short of amazing - bringing people together, inspiring others to do the same. HF will live for a long time after its completion, as long as people continue to enjoy the reason why it began in the first place.
