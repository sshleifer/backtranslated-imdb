no, this is not meant to be a brilliant budget, but it is brilliant in itself. you need to look at what it is, a low-budget masterpiece with a zombie rapist wielding a 12-inch love rod that sticks to the side. Those who came to give this film a low review, probably looked for the next cult classic or hidden "gem" as they say, and just did not come to that. I love it, as everyone points to obvious observations, such as "a 5-cent child attached to a fishing rod" hahaha, yeah. I do not think a film with such a budget could afford "good" actors or effects, so they worked with what they had. guts and entrails were very convincing. the movie was somewhat uncertain, going from sequence to sequence, but overall, it's one of the better movies I've seen lately that does not follow any trend or predictability. very good for laughter.
