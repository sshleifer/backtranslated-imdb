Eddie Murphy really made me laugh in this HBO comedy series. I love his impressions of Mr. T, Ed Norton and Ralph Cramden from The Honeymooners, Elvis Presley and Michael Jackson. Ice Cream Man, Goony Goo Goo, is also fun. I saw it for the first time when it came out in 1984. I was laughing so much that I almost fell off the chair. I still think it's very funny. <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy, when he played in "Saturday Night Live", made me laugh so much that he is one of the best people who will come out of "Saturday Night Live". "Eddie Murphy Delirious" is his best performing next to "Eddie Murphy Raw". <br /> <br /> I give "Eddie Murphy Delirious" 2 thumbs and 10/10 stars.
