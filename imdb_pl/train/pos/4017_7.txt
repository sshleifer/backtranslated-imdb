It's a very memorable spaghetti western. He has a great story, interesting characters and very good acting, especially with Rosalba Neri. Her role as evil in this film is really classic. He steals every scene he finds himself in and expresses his face and eyes so much even when he does not speak. Her performance is very credible. She manages to become quite hypnotized without being over the top (it's not that something is wrong with being above the top). Mark Damon is also surprisingly good in this film. <br /> <br /> The musical result is perfect, and the theme song is one that will play in your head for days after watching the movie, whether you like it or not. There are several parts that are very funny. I especially like the part where Rosalba Neri undresses before the parrot. There is also a lot of fun game that is very well made. <br /> <br /> I would probably give this film 8 or 9 stars if it were not for two things. The first one is a stupid brawl in the bar, which lasts about 25 minutes in the film. This is one of the most funny fights I've ever seen in a movie. It is very poorly choreographed and looks more like a dance number from bad music than any real fight. You would have missed this if it was the comedy Terence Hill / Bud Spencer, but it is a more serious western, and the brawl really had to be more realistic. Another thing that annoyed me in this movie was the cowardly Mexican midfielder Yuma. I think it was supposed to be comical or something like that, but the character was just stupid and unnecessary in that movie, and he was not funny at all. All I can say is where is Tuco when you need him? <br /> <br /> Everything I've said, I assure everyone that Johnny Yuma is a classic western spaghetti despite the mistakes I mentioned, and all fans of the genre have to see this movie.
