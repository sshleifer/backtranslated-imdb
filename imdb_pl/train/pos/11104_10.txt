Because the godfather's saga was the mafia's view of the executive suite, this series is a complex mafia story from the point of view of a working man. If you have never watched this program, you will have a long feast. Yes, there is violence and nudity, but it is never free and is needed to contrast Tony Tony Soprano, a gang of a thinking man, with the reality of life he was born to, and to be honest, he would never even know how so many of his co-workers finished. Tony Soprano can talk about Sun Tzu with his therapist, and then defeat a man to death a frying pan in panic, and while dismembering and getting rid of his nephew, take a break, sit down and watch TV while eating peanut butter from the jar and give the nephew advice about the upcoming marriage, as if they had just finished their Sunday afternoon watching the NFL football. Even Carmella, his wife, when he has a chance to go out, discovers that he really prefers life from Tony and the benefits that accompany him, and looks the other way to his indiscretion versus life on his own. If you've followed the whole thing, you know how it ends. If not, trust me that you've never seen the end of a TV show like this.
