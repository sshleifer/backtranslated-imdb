I saw this movie at the International Film Festival in Rotterdam. You can challenge some of the creator's decisions - like choosing a mockumentary for such a sensitive and awful topic - but this movie will probably hit you. Especially the last scenes were almost painful to watch. I hope that he will get the distribution he deserves.
