Love is overwhelming ... In all its manifestations ... Wonderful, absolutely great ... Tudor Chirila, Maria Popistasu and Ioana Barbu, one truly dramatic story about love in all its shapes, a story about illegible ways of young hearts, about life and lost innocence, all directed by the skilful eye of Tudor Giurgiu. Thanks to the great soundtrack with the participation of Faultline, Chris Martin and Vama, Veche surprises in every respect, leaving behind the sour taste of incomprehensible love ... Really amazing ... Is it me, or Romanian cinematography slowly but surely growing and gaining respect? It's a genius movie ... Two thumbs up to everyone involved.
