Ahh, Talespin! What can I say that has not yet been said about this amazing show? Nothing! This is undoubtedly one of the best-written programs I've ever encountered, live action or animation. Newer things are too muffled due to my preferences, and some of the "ripe" things that I have to move children out of the room. But not Talespin. <br /> <br /> Stories are immersive and very reliable. Some of them can even be stretched for an hour or two for a movie. Episodes such as Stormy Weather and Her Chance to Dream are very dramatic and at the same time are pleasant for children and adults. There are also episodes from the comedy, such as Bluest of Baloo Bloods and Stuck on you, where the emphasis is on merriment. I can laugh at tears in a few selected ones. <br /> <br /> The drama currently lacks most of the concerts (at least those that are not specifically geared to it), especially in cartoons. For example, in the Stormy Weather Kit episode, Cloudkicker decides to join the air circus, but Baloo thinks it would be too dangerous. In the biggest fight of the episode, Baloo yells at Kit to stay out of the bold Dan, to which Kit shouts: "NO! You can not tell me what to do! YOUR * NO * * MY * * DAD *! "And burying the face in the pillow. The next day he goes to the air circus. This kind of drama is rare in the cartoon and would be welcomed in those that arise today. <br /> <br /> Characters have a lot of depth for them. Baloo is almost the same as in the Book of the Jungle, plus or minus a few degrees of laziness. Rebecca is a cunning business woman whose ideas for getting money, although theoretically good, are rarely good in practice. Molly is a lovely little girl, but you can not let her cheat you. Sometimes it can be a real monstrosity. The Cloudkicker Kit has a darker character than the rest. He does not trust adults very much, unless they speak to him, and he has a tendency to break the relationship. Watch his expression in Plunder and Lightning when he grabs a grappling hook: it looks like he is prepared to go through a pirate. <br /> <br /> After all, it's a drama combined with real chemistry between the characters that make this show # 1 in my book. The relationship between Baloo and Kitem is very real, almost father and son. You can see it well in the Big Whale, which ends the whale when Baloo takes the word Kit for Seymour abusing the animals in his tank instead of being on the side of other adults. Baloo and Becky's relationships are also realistic, because Baloo's motivation to work is due to the desire to buy back the giant Sea Duck, not necessarily to help Rebecca. But something tells me that if he regained Duck, he would still deal with Rebecca. <br /> <br /> Sea Duck, not to mention all the other planes in this series, is quite realistically designed. The functions of the aircraft do not change once in the whole series (such continuity is difficult to get too), and unlike most other "super-planes" of other cartoons, there is no one weapon on board (unless you count mango!) And relies on clever pilot skills to get out of trouble. It is difficult to imagine a hero vehicle that does not have a weapon, a laser gun or even a gun on board. And the fact that they use their heads to get out of trouble is so difficult to find in the cartoon. Plus it's just such a damn cool project! <br /> <br /> It's definitely the best cartoon. Always. Dot. Definitely worth all ten stars!
