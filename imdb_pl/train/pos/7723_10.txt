Many factors make it easier for me to say that I still think that this is the most important science fiction film ever made, despite some of the acting, obsolete dialogues, etc. <br /> <br /> First, there is the scale of imagination in describing Krell, the humanoid race straight from the planet, now all dead, who were a million years more advanced than people of Earth (us) and their technologies, especially machines with a length of 8,000 cubic miles. <br /> <br /> Secondly, there is music and sound effects that are inseparable from each other. It creates an amazing, unearthly atmosphere, in contrast to "2001", which had traditional classical music. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, her "monster" is not only the most powerful and deadly one ever anticipated, but also based on real science and does not break the laws of physics and biology. <br /> <br /> Finally, and most importantly, Forbidden Planet is the only film ever made and which, unbelievable, manages to create an honest, intelligent and merciless logical statement about the limits or ceiling of human development (or any another biological entity), regardless of how long we survive as a species. <br /> <br /> In other words, it predicts our inevitable destiny.
