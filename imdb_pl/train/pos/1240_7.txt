Eddie Murphy plays Chandler Jarrell, a man who devotes his time to finding lost children. When beautiful Kee Nang (Charlotte Lewis) enters his life, he tells him that he is chosen and must find the Golden Child. Skeptical and directed only by lust and intrigue, Jarrell engages, not realizing that he is going to embark on a fantastic journey that is associated with the danger and the worst of all, the demon Sardo Numspa. <br /> <br /> Is the Golden Child the product of his time? does it mean that Eddie Murphy and The Golden Child were only popular in the late 1980s? I remember how much this movie entertained the people in that decade, its money was 79 817 937 dollars, making it the eighth earliest earner in 1986, But since the 1980s it disappeared from memory it became a thing to deny Eddie Murphy's photos comedy awards that once were. The Golden Child is not as well accepted Murphy's paintings from the 80s as Trading Places and Beverly Hills Cop, but after revisiting the movie, I personally report that it contains Murphy in his wisdom, quipping and charming the best! seriously!. <Br /> <br /> Using the fantasy action formula that was revived and fueled by Raiders Of The Lost Ark in 1981, The Golden Child hits all the required genre buttons. Pretty girl, bold reluctant heroine with a joke in his armory, brilliant villain {Charles Dance so English that I could kiss him alone}, wonderful color and sweet kid with mystical powers, the movie asks only to engage in the fun, not analyze and digress her values ​​as a fantasy image of a skull. Yes, the CGI demon now looks squeaky and yes, this genre had much better pictures in the 80s, 90s and later, but really, if you agree with the shameful rating of 5 here on this site, you can just take this genre too a bit seriously, seriously. 7/10
