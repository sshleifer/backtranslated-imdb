I love that movie. This is a great movie that combines English and Indian culture with feminist-type problems, such as girls who want to play sports previously reserved for men. It shows the struggles of both an Indian person who wants to break down their cultural barriers, as well as women who would like to go beyond the sexual limitations found in sport, especially in England at the time. I feel that cultural struggles are more emphasized than other issues. <br /> <br /> Unlike the second comment, I do not think this movie is something like Dirty Dancing or any other chick. This movement is loved by many people, both men and women, both young and old.
