Fidois is a very strange movie. And in many ways, very good. <br /> <br /> My first thought after seeing was, how the hell are going to put it on the market? If Shaun of the Dead is a romantic comedy with zombies, Fido is a boy, and his story with the dog mixes with a fifties zombie comedy from the 1950s. He does not stumble over his tongue. <br /> <br /> Fido has little of Shaun's carnage, laughter and laughter from his stomach. It's a completely different beast (forgive the pun). <br /> <br /> Fido launches a black and white information film that explains the story - people won the war against zombies, developing a control collar that suppresses meat eaters in stupid servants. <br /> <br /> At first I thought that we were paranoid parody of the cold war parade in the fifties, but soon we are thrown into the world of bright primary colors and the fifties in the middle of class nostalgia. <br /> <br /> Young Timmy Robinon is a lonely kid who does not fit into school. His mother is an elderly social climber, and his father is nervous and detached. <br /> <br /> Aiming to keep up with Joneses, mum (Carry-Anne Moss) won the zombies. Jimmy is not interested at first, but "Fido" (Billy Conelley) soon turns out to be a great friend for Jimmy. Until his collar is blinking ... <br /> <br /> Fido is NOT a horror movie, but my problem with film is to understand exactly what he is. <br /> <br /> A significant part of humor is a light family variant, and sometimes the plot is too dependent on the boy and his dog / family. <br /> <br /> The movie is full of wonderfully dark, really funny moments, which is welcome, will provide an R rating for what for a long time is a family comedy. <br /> <br /> The film looks great and is performed excellently by everyone involved. <br /> <br /> Despite her difficult tonal problems, I hope this movie will find a niche, because it is a small jewel in this year's flood of cinematic nonsense.
