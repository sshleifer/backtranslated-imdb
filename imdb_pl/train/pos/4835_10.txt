This is a story about the inhabitants of the Siberian village from the beginning of the 20th century to the 1960s. It's about passion and feelings, about the Russian soul and very romantic. This film is NOT full of action, it flows slowly. In the second part you can find great songs - Russian romances. It's much better than Doctor Zhivago. The director of this film moved to America and did, for example, Runaway Train.
