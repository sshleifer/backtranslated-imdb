On October 24, 1955, the hard-working geologist Hadley Oil Company, Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson), meets executive secretary Lucy Moore (Lauren Bacall) in the office of his boss Bill Ryan in New York and invites her to a conference with alcohol playboy and son of the potentate Kyle Hadley (Robert Stack). On the way to the meeting, he confesses that they traveled from Houston to New York to satisfy the wish of reckless Kyle, who is his best friend from childhood, eating a sandwich from club 21, and the meeting was just a pretext for Kyle's father, Jasper Hadley ( Robert Keith). Mitch and Kyle fall in love with Lucy immediately, and Kyle uses his money ineffectual to impress Lucy; then he opens his heart and suggests Lucy. They got married and travel to Acapulco, and the uncertain Kyle stops drinking. Meanwhile, Kyle's sister, Marylee (Dorothy Malone), is an easy woman and does not correspond by correspondence to Mitch who sees her as a sister. A year later Kyle discovers he has a problem and can be sterile and starts drinking again. Jealous jealous Marylee Kyle says his wife and Mitch are having an affair. When Lucy discovers she is pregnant, Kyle thinks the child belongs to Mitch, and his distrust leads to a tragedy. <br /> <br /> "Written on the Wind" is an overrated melodramatic soap opera with artificial figures and situations. There are at least two great movies with drinking characters: "The Lost Weekend" (1945) with the stunning performance of Ray Milland and "Days of Wine and Roses" (1962) with the amazing performance of Jack Lemmon. Robert Stack has a sensible performance, and his drinking motifs are shallow and clich√©. Ultimately, the forgotten "Written on the Wind" is fun and never nominated for an Oscar. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Palavras ao Vento" ("Words in the Wind")
