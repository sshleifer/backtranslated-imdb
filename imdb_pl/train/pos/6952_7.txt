After meeting her colleague and friend Hanna Lewis (Anna Faris), she needs Jenny jealous, controls and manipulates, and Matt follows the advice of her best friend Vaughna Haige (Rainn Wilson) and throws her by breaking her heart. Jenny turns Matt's life into a hell while he's having an affair with Hannah. However, the enemy of G-Girl and former high schoolboy Jenny, Professor Bedlam (Eddie Izzard), offers Matt to lure Jenny to deprive her of superpowers. <br /> <br /> "My super ex-girlfriend" is delightfully silly and fun. This romantic comedy-adventure has many fun moments. Luke Wilson is great in the role of an idiot, Anna Farris is incredibly sexy as usual, and Uma Thurman is great as a mad neurotic superhero who recalls Glenna Close in "Fatal Attraction" or Evelyn Draper in "Play Misty For Me" "My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Minha Super Ex-Namorada" ("My Super Ex-Girlfriend")
