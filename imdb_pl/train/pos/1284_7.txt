I watched The Babysitter as part of BCI Eclipse 'Drive-in Cult Classics (with editions of Crown International Pictures) on DVD. I think it's a very good movie. <br /> <br /> This movie has many stories in a very short time. You have hippies, rock music, bikers, lesbians, sexual improprieties, blackmail and murder, all in one place! <br /> <br /> The main actors perform reliable work. And I think that the intricately woven plot is credible and interesting. <br /> <br /> However, the supporting staff, primarily motorcyclists, provides high performance, especially when asked to provide a line with more than a few words. Perhaps they used real cyclists, not actors. In particular, several characters were exceptionally reliable. <br /> <br /> The music notation is absolutely punctual, on time, pace and for moving the story forward. I considered the music a real feast. In the first words I noticed that the film included "The Food" music, I searched them in search engines; but I could not find anything ... <br /> <br /> In any case, George E. Carey, who wrote, produced and played in this film, liked the idea so much (an unpredictable married man brought to redemption through trials and torments) and also a little help - of course, that he wrote, produced and played in "Weekend with a babysitter".
