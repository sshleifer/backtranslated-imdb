The best film about martial arts. This one movie is better than anything Bruce Lee ever did. A classic with an extremely entertaining and brutal culmination. Jackie Chan is the king of films about martial arts and the real king of kung fu. It's a pity that although Bruce Lee was so overrated, Jackie Chan needed eternity to become popular in Europe and America. Jackie rules !!!!
