In the case of comedy, it has a decent and ingenious story, and the comic time of Trey Parker and Matt Stone is perfect. There are dozens of funny moments in this fantastic film. I especially like the multitude of colors and the way of collision in the sports arena. Robert Stacks Unsolved Mysteries parody is also very funny.
