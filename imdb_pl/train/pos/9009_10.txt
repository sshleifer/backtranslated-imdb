This film really captures the feeling of freedom ....... and what is the freedom of your honesty ... in the most delightful, carefree way. Not a serious but fun adventure. <br /> <br /> The story reflects life. We do not always get what we want right away, but we find out that we have what we need to understand why we did not get what we wanted ... which causes us to get more than we thought we would get! You will receive this after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> And this movie is really about finding love and knowing that someone found it and that it completely changed his life. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorite times ... .. not easy to find, but it's worth hunting ......... I guarantee you'll watch it more than once!
