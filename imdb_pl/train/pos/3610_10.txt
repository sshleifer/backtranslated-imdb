Girlfight is a story about an anxious teenager named Diana Guzman (Michelle Rodriguez). Diana is burdened with mother suicide and a sexist father living in a sexist community. A short temperament and a lot of things that can cause a fire will soon be thrown out of school to fight. Her brother, Tiny (Ray Santiago), trains with Hektor (Jaime Tirelli) in boxing. Papa, Sandro (Paul Calderon), informs Diana that she will pay Tina's training this week. While Diana goes through the gym, she realizes what she wants to do. She wants to box. Diana asks her father for money for training, but she refuses because she is a girl and should do more "girly" things. Everything Diana wants is to be treated like any other guy. I did not look down because she is a woman. He steals money from his father to start training. <br /> <br /> A great movie. Genius, pure "effective" genius. I recommend it to anyone who needs a good clean movie without "monkey activity".
