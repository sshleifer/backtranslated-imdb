The presentation of Lily Mars could have provided Judy Garland with one of the easier roles she had at MGM, because Lily Mars is definitely a character she could identify with. A young girl with enough talent for ten years knows she has what it takes to do it in the theater, regardless of how much the producer Van Heflin from her hometown discourages her. <br /> <br /> I really liked Judy in this one as a girl determined to do it in the theater. Because it's Judy Garland with Judy Garland's talent, viewers know that he has the right things, even if Van Heflin needs almost the whole movie to be convinced. <br /> <br /> Both Judy and Heflin come from the same town, Heflin's dad was the town doctor who provided it and Heflin, while he could move out and become a big producer on Broadway, their respective mothers, Fay Bainter and Spring Byington kept in touch. This is her entr√©e, but Heflin is constantly driven into scary children, but he never reminds anyone of Lily Mars. <br /> <br /> No real hits came from Presenting Lily Mars for Garland, although he sings all his numbers. The best film is the revival of chestnut from the age, every small movement has its meaning. Judy sings with Connie Gilchrist playing the cleaner at the Broadway theater, where Heflin's production is produced. Gilchrist was a star in the time of FloraDor girls, and she and Judy deliver a song in a big way with Connie. This is the best scene in the movie because Gilchrist encourages Judy to take care of it. Composer Karl Hoschna died a long time ago, but the author of the lyrics Otto Harbach was still alive and I bet that he liked what he heard. <br /> <br /> The European music star Marta Eggerth presents Lily Mars as the star of the series who is initially bewildered, then angry and finally understanding Garland and Heflin. She made several films from MGM and then returned to Europe to get more work on the continent. I bet that MGM did not know exactly what to do with her and her thick Hungarian accent, although Louis B. Mayer never met a soprano he did not like. <br /> <br /> Van Heflin is doing well with a patient manufacturer who can take a lot of care from Garland and Eggerth. Heflin just finished his Oscar for Johnny Eager last year, and he and Garland do not seem to be the perfect screen band, but they are not angry together. <br /> <br /> Presentation of Lily Mars is a fine presentation of talents by Judy Garland. And she did not have to share the screen in another movie behind the scenes with Mickey Rooney.
