The film was perfect, except for some scenes from Esposito. I liked how all the detectives on the show got together, and I finished a few threads that were never resolved during the series (thanks to NBC ...). It was great to see Pembleton and Bayliss together in their most human and basic people. Braugher and Secor did a great job, but they will usually be overlooked. It hurt that it was the end of the homicide department. Memories, tapes and replays in CourtTV are not the same as watching them every Friday. But the movie did his job and he did it very well, presenting a great picture of life after retiring Al and family relationships that existed between the individual. I liked it very much.
