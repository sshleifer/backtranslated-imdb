I have to be honest and say that I have not seen many independent films, but I thought that this movie was very well done. Direction and pictures spun around without distractions. The angles, settings and lighting used successfully created a nightmarish world in which the main character was imprisoned. Many disturbing and memorable images from the movie are in your mind for a long time after its completion (it is always a sign of a good director).
