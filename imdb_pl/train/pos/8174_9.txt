I love that movie. As a child, it was one of the first films that I saw that flinched me. Sure, he's gentle now, but he was amazing in those days. Dentists are one of many things that people are afraid of, so why not make a movie about deadly dentists? It's cheesy, cool, sometimes scary, but it's amazing. And I've always loved medical horror. And Corbin Bernsen is a great game. Feinstone, no one could do it better. And for low-budget horror, effects and such are quite good. I also love thematic music, it fits well with the movie. Ken Foree (Dawn of the Dead) also plays the nosy policeman and does a great job. There is a lot of blood and really cool torture / death scenes. Check it out!
