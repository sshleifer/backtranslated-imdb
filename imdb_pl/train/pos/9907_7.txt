"High Slaughter" is perhaps the most underestimated wave of the hand in the 80's. This is one of the few films in this genre that is fascinating. That said, it also relies heavily on the standard slass formula: a group of young men and women are killed one by one fine until the final game. <br /> <br /> The reason why "Slaughter High" stands above the films in its genre are more popular. Marty, the killer, has a good reason to blame his former classmates. They electrocuted him when he was naked in the shower of the girl's locker room, stabbed the javelin in his crotch, and in addition faked an experiment in a science lab so that he could marvel him. <br /> <br /> So, the victims in this movie are just as unlike each other as you can. When you meet after years - during the exit from the high school prepared by Marty himself - you realize that they did not mature so much. They are a group of sociopaths. <br /> <br /> It's amazing why they would not wonder why only they appeared at the meeting, which, incidentally, takes place in the school from then on fell into disrepair. Who would have thought it was a good idea to drink beer and alcohol found in an abandoned building in a room where old cabinets - and Marty's - are on display? There are many leaps of faith that the viewer has to take to enjoy this movie. The ending has little or no sense. And the screenwriters have a strange understanding of how April Fool's Day works: the movie claims that the pranks are no longer allowed in the afternoon. <br /> <br /> In total, the movie is one of the best examples of the slasher genre, despite all its drawbacks. It's hard to understand why it has not hit DVD yet, when so many other popular slash videos are decorated with special editions.
