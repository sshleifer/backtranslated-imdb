Ever since I saw this film as a child, more than 30 years ago, I've been watching it tirelessly. From the initial scenes at the corner factory, to the car engine running from the back of the car, to Ollie picking up the phone and accidentally pushed out of the window by Stan, I think it was probably their best movie on the last day. Then they moved to 20th Century Fox, and although these movies were not terrible, they missed the comic time of the movie. Jimmy Finnlayson, their long film, in their last appearance with boys, appearing as Doctor is great! quote: "I told goat milk" his answer to Stan's question, how do you drink a ghost! Charlie Hall and even Ben Turpin appear! I would say everything in one of my favorite comedy L & H.
