Marjorie (a great and thrilling performance by Farrah Fawcett) narrowly avoids the attack in his car by a malicious serial rapper Joe (superbly played with the frightening conviction and intensity of James Russo). However, Joe steals her wallet and finds out where Marjorie lives. She is paying her a visit for one fatal day. After Marjorie's abundance of degradation and psychological abuse, Marjorie manages to turn Joe and close him in the fireplace. What will Marjorie do with Joe? Director Robert M. Young and scriptwriter William Mastrosimone invent a harsh, rough and often disturbing tale of morality, which penetrates insight into violent brutality and painful humiliation of rape, and shows how each person pushed to extremes is able to shock acts of violence and inhumanity. Joe sees women only as objects, while Marjorie sees only Joe as an "animal". However, this film for admirable credit does not make Joe just a wicked creeper; instead, he is a frighteningly real and ultimately pathetic human monster with his wife and child (especially Joe's climactic confession is really poignant). Fawcett and Russo are outstanding in running; they receive support from Diana Scarwid as passive Terry, Alfre Woodard as a sensible Patricia and Sandy Martin as a nice policewoman in Sudow. Both agile photos of Curtis Clark and J.A.C. Redford's shivering, creeping effect of the skin greatly increases the claustrophobic tension. The real driving force.
