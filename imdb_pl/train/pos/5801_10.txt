This movie is exciting, bold and the music is very good. The Moonwalker movie was to coincide with the album Bad (1987). I have Bad.It excellent (*****). The film begins with the Michael Jackson performance "Man In The Mirror" on stage. Then he shows Michael's story, from early days in Jackson 5 to the era. Oh, and Badder is good too (Badder is a parody of the music video for the single Bad). Then shows the Speed ​​Demon video. The song and the movie are very, very good. then the Moonwalker movie appears. after a few minutes he plays a smooth criminal in a club called 30s. how he does it, when he does lean.anyway, nice to see you.
