Wow honey, this is a really great Asian horror / gore and crazy bizarre movie. This Japanese game, which reminded me a little about Tetsuo, except for this blood and guts, is a strange love story. It is hard to imagine how they even invented this visually stunning movie, with a few unique alien creatures that infect humans as parasites, turning them into a partial machine or perhaps cyborgs. The only thing that is wrong with these creatures after they take over a man is whether they have to kill and eat the other. hmmm, yum yum. It would probably be called industrial splattering or something like that, with a great soundtrack that adds all the fun. The film also borrows some of Carpenter's "Things" in the design and effects of creation. I would put it in the category of gorehounds, because there is no continuous slaughter and a very good gore. And must-have for stoners, because you do not even have to read the subtitles, the visual images themselves are enough for a mental journey. The design of small creatures inhabiting the human body as a fetus reminded me a bit about the films of Frank Henenlotter, which is another tribute to excellent films with a sense of humor. "Meatball Machine" is great fun for gorehounds, there is no doubt about it, and I just loved it.
