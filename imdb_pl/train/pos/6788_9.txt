History and characters were some of the best I've seen. the graphics were good for PS, and the cut scenes and voices were amazing. I defeated the game at least 3 times and loved every second of it.

If you convert it to ps3, I would buy a system only for this game, or maybe mgs4 its amazing is also the idea and implementation of the dragoon system to guarantee the loan, and additionally an ingenious advertisement, sometimes cheating the wand) adding battle system and the plot makes This game is definitely a purchase.
