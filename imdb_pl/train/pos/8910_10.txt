Most of the films about the atomic monsters that I saw on TV as a child - and some of them, including BLOB, scared me to the light. Films such as INVADERS FROM MARS have made too bright "little fry" for us that children could not be trusted when things like things that attacked the Homeworld World happened; THE BLOB has just repeated this fact. I remember the affectionate, late evenings spent on inspection, when body hijackers and Martian invaders and bubbles penetrate into unsuspecting society. It was summer, in the early eighties, when the local science museum (in Richmond, Virginia) carried out the classics of the Atomic Age every weekend. These were 16 mm films, and most were black and white (and the projector was noisy), and the "colorful" BLOB imprint became a pale pink - but, man, it was fun. I pulled my mother and liked her as much as I did. It was there, in this science museum, that I really fell in love with BLOB. The filmmaker's intention, of course, was to earn money - but the honesty of all involved, from filmmakers to "talent" (players), made me fall in love with this film. Old-fashioned? You bet. Cheesy? They do not get any tacky. But, man, what a movie!
