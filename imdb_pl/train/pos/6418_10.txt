I loved this movie. This is definitely an inspiring movie. It fills you with pride. This movie is worth a loan or is worth buying. He should be in every home. The best movie I've seen in a long time. He'll make you crazy because everybody is so mean to Carla Brashear, but it's getting better. It is a story about romance, drama, action and many funny lines so that you can tune in. I use them all the time. They help me in what I want to do. It shows that everyone can fulfill their dreams, all they have to do is work for him. It's a long movie, but every time I watch it, I never notice it is as long as it is. It absorbs me so much that it goes so fast. I love that movie. I watch it whenever I can.
