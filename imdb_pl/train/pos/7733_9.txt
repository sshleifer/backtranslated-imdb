The quality of Foley's noir in this saturated and intense film of pulp seems to fit perfectly. The film, edited by the editing, takes place around an alarmed boxer who discovers his own goal (or lack thereof). Other comments on this topic may indicate a lack of interest in pulp, but personally I think it is a perfectly composed movie song!
