Everyone in the cast, from Sugiyama to Aoki and Toyoko is someone we know in everyday life. They were so natural, and Sugiyama's transformation is incredibly credible. The score is so moving that it led me to tears. The choreography was beautiful, not looking athletic. Graceful dance and charm of Mai gave me goose bumps. Tamako is a wonderful miracle. You can almost see a charming student on her face when she remembers the view of "King and me." Aoki's character is both amusing and pathetic. Masako is as natural as her stunned wife, you almost want to hug her, to ensure her will be all right. <br /> <br /> This movie is really a guardian.
