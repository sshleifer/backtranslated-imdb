In contrast to the summaries of some people, the women depicted in the film are not geisha. They are oirans (prostitutes) living outside the most-known districts of pleasure, and their lives and experiences represent the lives of many women from the Tokugawa era. I can not say that the stories were particularly informative, but their charm lies in how typical they are. Themes are universal and everyday: love, friendship and dedication. <br /> <br /> I really liked the direction of art and acting. I felt like I could see the time and place where I can never look. The actors, especially the 4 women who played on the main oirana, were excited. I recommend this movie only to people who want to taste Japanese culture, or those who like quiet and emotional stories. It's a great example of both.
