Based on the actual mining disaster, this early German talkie (with English subtitles) remains one of the most effective documentary dramas ever filmed. "Kameradschaft", with the participation of many unprofessional actors, gives a bloodcurdling view of friendship, which binds the workers of the mine, regardless of which side of the Franco-German border they can come from. A fatal accident brings out the best of everyone, canceling the orders of the superiors. The other miner, who is in need, will receive help from his companions, even if he is in great danger of losing his life. <br /> <br /> This movie reminds you of the sacrificial heroism that NYFD showed after the September 11 attacks. Putting aside all formal rules and regulations, these men and women in uniform knew only one reason: save life and find their fire companions. - Over 70 years later "Kameradschaft" still has a strong and timeless message: a friend in need is a friend in action.
