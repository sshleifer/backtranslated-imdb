As probably one of the few Canadians who did not read a book in high school, I thought I would add my comments. Watching a movie without first getting to know the story in no way diminished the movie. The heroes have so many complexities that everyone can refer to them in their own way. The brilliance of adaptation lies in the fact that everyone is allowed to design their own perception of the characters' lives, instead of giving opinion on spoons. You can love or dislike them and continue to feel the emotional impact of the movie. Great performances by Ellen Burstyn and Christine Horne really bring the characters to life. I would highly recommend.
