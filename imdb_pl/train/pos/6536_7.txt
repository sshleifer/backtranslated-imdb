Let's face it; Nancy Drew has never been great literature. It is in the same category as the babysitter club, magic tree house, goose bumps, secrets ABC. In fact, it was one of the original history of the formula. Nancy is perfect, pretty, thoughtful, "nice", no internal conflicts! and it never changes. Ned is almost the same. The film was in line with this style and I must say that I liked it. It will never be a great movie, but it has the same nostalgic taste as books. For my children, she had the right amount of tension (8 and 10 years). There was almost no offensive language. I liked the pursuit of a more conservative outfit. <br /> <br /> Corky was a bit annoying. He was a bit out of place on the high school campus. I never understood why he was there.
