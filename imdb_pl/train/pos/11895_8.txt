Tea Leoni plays Nora Wilde, a serious photographer who goes through a divorce. He wants his freedom, but it costs money. She wants to legally photograph, but is employed to work in tabloids as a paparazzi. Her boss plays wonderful and divine Holland Taylor. The concert was well-written most of the time. Nora from TEa began to develop into a pretty memorable figure, but the network just did not support the comedy and it still does not exist. Even when they brought George Wendt from Cheers, they made unnecessary changes to the cast and characters. The concert at the beginning was fine, and the audience got used to it, but then the network poisons it like a bad plastic surgery.
