There were many sci-fi movies from the 1950s. These were big draws for the drive-in cinemas. Many of them were ugly at the time. This movie and "The Day the Earth Stood Still" stand out and both have aged in their own way. From the beginning, with its amazing musical part of the tammin (which still sounds strange, because you rarely use tammins) Forbidden Planet takes you where no one has gone before. Speaking of Star Trek, in this movie there are so many materials that went to Star Trek TOS, like a pilot for the series; from an interactive captain / first officer / doctor, crazy scientist, alien beings, baby in a short skirt, computer intelligence; it's all de rigeur now, but it was the first of its kind. In addition, he has good acting and well-made works of art, which even today arouse some admiration for paintings. Consider how the enormous Krell machine is successfully presented with a certain depth. I saw it as a child (in drive-in: 0), when it was a new movie and it scared me. Of course, every movie that was even a bit scary did it then, but I remember that I was really worried about an invisible monster. Forbidden Planet is a movie that science fiction fans can watch several times and find something new every time they watch.
