The words are not serious enough to convey the emotional power of the film; this is one of the most troublesome you will ever see, but the ending is one of the most loving, tender and emotionally fulfilled expectations. Every actor in each role is great, especially the wise and underestimated Jamie Lee Curtis, the heavily wounded and tormented Ray Liotta, and the moving phrase from Tom Hulce, who should have earned him every prize in the book. (He is number one in the Best Actor category in 1988 in Danny Peary's "Alternative Oscars".) The last half hour borders on melodrama, but the movie earns every tear - and if you're not out of a stone, there will be a lot of them .
