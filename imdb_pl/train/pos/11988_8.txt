I watched this program when I was a little girl. When I think about it, I remember it only vaguely. If you ask me, it was a good performance. The two things I remember are the opening sequence and the theme song. Besides, everyone was perfectly manned. Besides, writing was very strong. The performances were also top-notch. I hope that some network will restore it so that I can see every episode. Before I discuss this, I would like to say that I will always remember this program in my memory forever, although I do not think I have seen every episode. In conclusion, if a network ever brings it back, I hope you catch it one day before it disappears.
