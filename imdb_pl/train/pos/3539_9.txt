Good: engaging in fire fighting fights, great presentation, the vehicles are really cool to drive, quite attractive for many players, faithful to the film, and the list is long. <br /> <br /> Wrong: the main missions are a bit short. <Br /> <br /> This game determines what a "good" third person shooter is (not necessarily a spy game). Wonderful firefights continue the story and make you want to complete EVERY single mission and unlock all the real bonuses that the game has to offer. The noise of this game has been fulfilled and I personally think that you should buy it and connect with a few friends and play this one. Lots of fun. <br /> <br /> The sound in this game is an achievement from several previous games, and shooting with a weapon really gives the impression of firing a weapon. This is related to the fact that you are a deadly dangerous and ruthless spy. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this game makes you excited and satisfied after passing through you, and some multiplayer games can compete with the standards of the insidious game of James Bond "Nightfire" on the gamecube.
