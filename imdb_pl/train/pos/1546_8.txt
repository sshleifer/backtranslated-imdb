I saw this movie once a year or close to its premiere 36 years ago (1969). Although I remember his fragments now, I want to see him again. The parts I remember, rightly or wrongly, include mustard gas in the trenches and Suzie Kendall as a German spy, offering some sexual pleas at the back of a closed truck to get military information from him. The musical score was particularly memorable and exciting in the Gone With The Wind league and I would like to hear it again. There must be a commercial reason or copyright, why this movie is not available. Does anyone know why? I doubt it would have something to do with a lack of quality or interest.
