Along with "Brothers & Sisters", "Six Degrees" was one of my favorite new dramas of autumn 2006. <br /> <br /> A great cast, but I really enjoyed the work of Campbell Scott (photo story) and Hope Davis (recently widow of a journalist killed in Iraq). <br /> <br /> In addition to acting, writing was fresh and wonderful. The show was also shot in New York, a real city, not in Warner Bros. or in another studio, adding an additional layer or realism. <br /> <br /> I think people are more interested in the latest "Survivor" and other trash from reality. It is a pity that it did not last.
