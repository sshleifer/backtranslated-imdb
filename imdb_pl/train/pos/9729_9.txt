Poor start, solid measure, fantastic finish. Anyway, I have such an impression on this film. I liked Simon Pegg in two movies where I saw him --- Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead. However, his role has taken a completely different turn. He shows his range as an actor, but nevertheless I really did not like this character, as he was presented at the beginning. <br /> <br /> There is a kind of humor that I call a "frustration comedy". His alleged "jokes" and jokes are nothing more than painful and awkward moments. Like the character of Bean Rowan Atkinmson. There are many other comedy actors who also present similar characters. I'm not going to figure it out here, so it will not be. <br /> <br /> But be warned that if you are like me and you do not like smarmy and crazy idiots, Pegg only shows such features for the first third of the movie. However, it gets better. <br /> <br /> I read somewhere that it is based on a real story. Hmmm. Maybe. The story of the film ceased to be annoying and became a kind of triumph for the "little guy" in the last third. I do not need all the films to be sugar and light - but by accident, because the film has improved, he began to be more and more happy. <br /> <br /> It was also a pleasure to see the old favorite, Jeff Bridges, play so masterfully. I liked "Iron Man", but it saddened me that Bridges was a villain. Purely personal taste, of course, because his acting was great. Even so, he was a miracle as a man of the "Greater than Life" vision, the publisher of Sharps. It was nice to see him in a role that I could really enjoy. <br /> <br /> In total, I liked it! I would just be 40 minutes late and missed the beginning.
