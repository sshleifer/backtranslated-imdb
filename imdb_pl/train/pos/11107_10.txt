Sopran√≥w (currently preparing for the end) is the peak of television and drama for adults. When The Sopranos hit the mark, it really hits the nail on the head.

At the head of the cast is James Gandolfini, who for all intense purposes is Tony Soprano and Edie Falco, who certainly has its own. The series can also boast a great collection of regular visitors to push the story in any way (usually violence and vulgar language). Tony Sirico, Michael Imperioli and Steve Van Zandt are great supporting characters that make each episode more interesting. You should also pay attention to seasonal additions, such as Steve Buscemi (great!), Joe Pantoliano (great!), David Proval (good), Robert Patrick, Robert Loggia and Frank Vincent. <br /> <br /> Sopranos are a great family drama and a realistic interpretation of modern mafia societies, which despite rare rare stories manage to be a unique television.
