Corbin Bernsen sent letters to four of the criminal collaborators he had worked with in the past, and this is a real intergenerational mix with Fred Gwynne, Lou Diamond Phillips, William Russes and Ruben Blades. They're supposed to meet him in this dark city of Montana, and he does not explain why he was taken by the New Jersey state police to order. <br /> <br /> Everyone knows Bernsen from the gathered criminal group, but they do not know each other. Many comedies concern their mutual feeling. Like the oldest Gwynne, although he denies, in a sense he takes control over others who are losing but going further. Especially when they discover what Bernsen meant. <br /> <br /> As for Bernsen, he's lucky to be picked up by a couple of bumblers at Ed O'Neill and Daniel Roebuck. He falls on O'Neill and runs away. <br /> <br /> Then the four criminals try to finish what Bernsen started, and Bernsen escapes the police. In an intricately plotted scenario, it is fascinating how the two fictional lines intertwine with each other. Hoyt Axton, as a local sheriff, looks with amazement at what is happening in his city. <br /> <br /> Disorganized Crime is a fabulously funny caper movie by many players who seem to be on TV or soon. I can not say that someone stood out in the cast and it seems that they are so good together. <br /> <br /> Ironically, none of these people is a comedian per se, but all show a slight comic touch that was brought by a good director. <br /> <br /> Disorganized Crime is a very funny caper movie, a kind of film that would be written by a well-known pessimist, Mr. Murphy.
