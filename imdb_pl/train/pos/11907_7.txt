Hitchcock was of the opinion that the audience is not really interested in what exposes the characters to danger - only that they are in danger and must escape. <br /> <br /> This movie proves that Hitchcock was not 100% correct. The police believe that Jean Simmons is guilty of crime when she is gone. Trevor Howard decides that their best course of action is to escape. And yes, the body of the film has our charismatic pair avoiding trains, buses and coaches - jumping on the rocks at the top of the waterfall - breaking through the rooftops of the shipyard. <br /> <br /> All good exciting things - but I could not stop thinking that all this was unnecessary. They should have stayed. <br /> <br /> In other words, MacGuffin was not strong enough.
