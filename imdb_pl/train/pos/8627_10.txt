My God ! The Buttgereit masterpiece is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Closer to the films of Peter Greenaway and Jean-Luc Godard this film is really disturbing, but not macabre like the Necromantic. All small stories have a deep philosophical interest, and the direction is completely ingenious, despite the lack of money (see sketch "bridge"). I would highly recommend!
