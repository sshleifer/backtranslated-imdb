The wonderful Vincent Price has made many fantastic Horror movies, some of which are among the greatest jewels of all time. His greatest achievements were undoubtedly his films from the 1960s, with films such as the brilliant series of Poe Roger Corman (still the largest cycle of horrors of all time), Michael Reeves' Witchfinder General (1968) and 'Last man Ubaldo Ragony' on Earth. (1964) sets out the most important events in the career of this genius man. The films that made man famous, and thus made him an immortal Horror icon, however, come from the 50s, when "House of Wax" (1953) became a star. "Mad Magician" from 1954. He follows a plot very similar to the one that his predecessor had. This does not mean, however, that this film is not an original, charmingly macabre and absolutely wonderful jewel. As the above poems might suggest, Vincent Price is my favorite actor, and although I personally would not allow myself to miss anything that a man was in, none of my fellow man's fans can not miss this little gem. <br /> <br /> Price is valued as Don Galico (aka Galico the Great), an underrated master of magicians and inventor of magical devices whose boss, a poor businessman, stole his wife (Eva Gabor). When the boss takes one of Galico's genius inventions and passes it on to his rival, The Great Rinaldi (John Emery), Galico snaps and the murderous revenge rage begins ... <br /> <br /> You do not love Vincent Price when he is revenge? Some of his most famous and biggest films, such as "The Abominable Dr. Phibes "(1971) or" Theater of Blood "(1973), concerned absurd and charming macabre murders of revenge, and this earlier film in Horror's career is another proof that no one takes revenge, as Vincent Price does. This movie is a wonderful eccentric leading role of Price, which as always ensures excellent performance and guarantees 70 minutes of incredibly funny and gruesome fun for every fan of Horror. Another must-see for my price fans.
