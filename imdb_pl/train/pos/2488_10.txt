For me, the last scene in which Harris answers the press question is worth seeing this intelligent and timeless part of the policy (especially the campaign phase). If only the "real life" policemen reacted in an intelligent, articulated way, just like Mr. Harris, then arrogant, selfish press members might think twice before there is an insignificant confrontational "junk" that absolutely has to do with the candidates for effective dealing with the office challenges for which he / she wants.
