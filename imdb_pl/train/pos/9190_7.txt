Because of the seriously wounded Tony in the induced coma, there are two things: Tony imagines that he is leading the life of a salesman participating in a business convention, while his family and friends are going through hell trying to cope with the possible loss of a big man. Dream sequences come from the former TWILIGHT ZONE episode, because Tony becomes an average Joe, trying to cope with the missing wallet and mixed up identities during a business trip. His intonation as a shoemaker wearing a jacket and khaki is more mid-American, and less so than an Italian bandit with Noo Joisey. A nice touch. Shockingly long-haired, hippie AJ ​​(whom Paulie at one point calls "Van Helsing") has a nice scene with her sleeping old man. The best moment is that the big boys are trying to talk about life without Tony, which immediately falls into a territorial dispute. Vito realizes that the new dead Gene was probably a cabinet case, which is interesting in light of what we will soon learn about Vito.
