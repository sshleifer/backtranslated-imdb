Let me start by saying that "War, Inc." is not a cup of tea for everyone. However, it is very pleasant (and gives you food for thought - "Oh, shit"). This comedy is not at all obvious - it is quite subtle (Tamerlane tanks, dry cleaning, etc.) And it changes with the twists and turns of the story. <br /> <br /> I can only be one, but I do not compare it with "Grosse Point Blank" because it's different. John Cusack - I would not say he was "amazing" or "brilliant" - but he was good. On the other hand, his sister (Joan Cusack) was amazing in delivering a line and comedy timing - even though she was not in the movie (I would say the same about Ben Kingsley). <br /> <br /> Marisa Tomei plays a convincing reporter and manages to distract him. Hilary Duff is very praised for the role of pop star in Central Asia, Yoniki Babyyeah. Duff's development as an actress is very noticeable in the film, and she does a very good job (even if her accent is a bit unrealistic). <br /> <br /> In general, I would call the film "funny". There is no specific plot and sometimes it is stupid, but it has a subtle message. I would say that it is worth watching.
