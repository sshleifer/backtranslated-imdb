The matter of life and death, what you can really say to properly reflect the genius and beauty of this film. Visual imagination of Powell and Pressburger knows no boundaries, each frame is filled with fantastically bold compositions. Switching between the bold colors of the "real world" and the raw black and white of the sky is ingenious, showing us visually how life is alive. The final judicial scene is also fantastic because the judge and jury are going down the stairs to heaven to stop the court of Peter's operation (David Niven). <br /> <br /> All performances are spot (Roger Livesey is outstanding), and the romantic energy of the film is beautiful, there has never been a movie more romantic than this (if I have 'seen' this). The matter of life and death consists in the power of love and in the importance of life. And the pictures of Jack Cardiff are enough to watch the film itself, the way it illuminates Kim Hunter's face, make her even more beautiful, what a genius, she can do simple things like playing table tennis, she looks exciting. And the sound design is also impeccable; the way the sound calms down in life points was a decision ahead of its time <br /> <br /> This is a real classic that can restore someone's faith in cinema, underestimated on the first release and by today's audience, but one of my favorites that's why I'm giving this movie 10/10, in a word - Beautiful.
