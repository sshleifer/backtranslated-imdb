For people of a certain age, W.W. It was a time of their lives, and whatever happened was never equal. When the movie opens, she was recently widowed, but the still alive woman (Judi Dench) hears street music who tries to play the classic song "Stardust". <br /> <br /> It reminds her of her memories when she played in a band of almost all girls who played between bombing during the war. Drummer Patrick (Ian Holm) happily avoided the project and enjoyed the ladies. <br /> <br /> Patrick and Dench meet the heroes and decide to reconnect the band, which takes them to a series of mini-adventures. Despite the ups and downs, the band meets again and makes a successful reappearance. <br /> <br /> The film is superbly written and understated, with great performances from all involved. The heroes are well developed and all who have not stopped living, despite the years. And there is all this great old swing music! <br /> <br /> This is not the pontificate of Steven Spielberg, but a serious movie. The war has touched everyone and this lesson has not been forgotten in a film that is not afraid to play, as it teaches.
