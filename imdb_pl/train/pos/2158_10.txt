I do not like "grade inflation", but I just had to give it 10. I can not come up with anything that I do not like. I saw it last night and woke up today thinking about it. I'm sure the Hollywood remake that someone told me with J Lo and Richard Gear will be perfect, but this original Japanese version from 1996 was so emotional and provocative for me that it's hard for me to think of any way you can improve or change its setting to a different culture. <br /> <br /> A story that I thought was worth watching, and about scenes of fighting fists or gunshots or something like that! Imagine this! <br /> <br /> All characters seemed well-developed, ... even non-basic characters had a good character development and pleasant acting, and the casting seemed very appropriate. <br /> <br /> It's always hard to find a good movie musical in our time and maybe it's not quite qualified (there's a lot of dance lessons but no singing), but I really think that Gene Kelly and the others who defended places to dance in our lives, would rate this film and the role of dance so much, helping to tell a story of a middle-aged man, successful in a family in Japan, looking for something ... he does not know exactly what. <br /> <br /> A team of people from Japan who contributed to the creation of this film, thank you for creating and doing it.
