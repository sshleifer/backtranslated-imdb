* !! - SPOILERS - !! * <br /> <br /> Before I start, let me say that I had both the advantages of watching this movie on the big screen and watching the "Authorized Version" of this movie, transformed by Stephen King himself in 1997. <br /> <br /> Both advantages have made me appreciate this version of "The Shining", all the more. <br /> <br /> Let me say that I was reading the book Mr. Kinga "The Shining" for many years and although I love this book and I am a big fan of his work, the repetition of this story by Stanley Kubrick is much more fascinating ... and SCARY. <br /> <br /> Kubrick really knows how to convey the terror of the psyche straight to the movie. In the direction of the film and the script himself, he acquired the title "Magus" without a doubt. Kubrick's genius is like magic. The movie world lost its great director when he died in 1999. Among his other outstanding achievements are: Eyes Wide Shut, 1999; Full Metal Jacket, 1987; Barry Lyndon, 1975; Clockwork orange, 1971; 2001: A Space Odyssey, 1968; Spartacus, 1960 and many more. <br /> <br /> Torrences (Jack, Wendy, his wife and Danny, their son) live in the Overlook Hotel for the winter; Jack was hired as a caretaker. His job is to oversee the hotel's maintenance during a few months of hard snow until spring, when Overlook opens its doors again. It seems that there are many rich and jaded tourists who will come to the Colorado Mountains for a snowy summer getaway. <br /> <br /> The hotel was an impressive work of architecture and staging. It suited the atmosphere thanks to the dark, yet "friendly" atmosphere. Furniture and furniture were throughout the period (late 70's and early 80's), and the landscape filmography approaching the hotel on the opening stage is brilliant. This not only allows you to enjoy the approach to Overlook, but also fixes in your mind how deserted and isolated the hotel from the rest of the world. <br /> <br /> The introduction of Wendy and Danny was a stroke of genius. You get the whole story of your past, Danny's "imaginary friend" Tony, as well as Jacek's alcoholism story - all in this nice, shapely introducing scenery. There was no need to drag past history for two hours of film; of course, Kubrick saw it from the very beginning. <br /> <br /> Closing day. Again, scenic mountain rides to the hotel (this time with family), the interaction between Jack and Danny was hilarious, and at the same time it presented a very disturbing exchange. <br /> <br /> The first route through Overlook is breathtaking, even when the "staff" moves things, you have the chance to see the majestic fireplaces, high ceilings of the cathedral and expensive furniture, dormant and crown moldings in architecture. "They did a good job! Pink and gold are my favorite colors. " (Wendy Torrence) Even the "wing of the staff" is well designed and beautifully constructed. <br /> <br /> The labyrinth was a great accent reminiscent of the Labyrinth in which the Minotaur of Crete was a Warden. When Jack Nicholson stands at the scaled maze model and stares at the center, seeing Wendy and Danny enter, is a magical moment; one that immediately tells you that there are heavy energies in this house; there is something seriously wrong, it is already beginning. "I would not go there unless I had at least an hour to find a way out." (Hotel manager) <br /> <br /> Scatman Cruthers, as Dick Halloran, was honest and open in his performance. His smiles were natural and his performance was great. You could really believe that you were at the hotel, visiting the kitchen with Wendy and "Doc". The explanation of "lighting" to Danny was very well done, as was his conversation with the child about Tony and the hotel. It was reliable and sincere. <br /> <br /> A cut and scanned image of the hotel itself, with mountains looming behind it, cold rotating air, fog coming out of the warm roof of the hotel with snow, adds so much to the atmosphere of the film. It also means a "half-way to hell" point, so to speak; turning point in the film. <br /> <br /> The portrait of Wendy Torrence by Shelley Duvall was masterful. (So ​​what if she played Olive Oyl ?! It just shows her a wonderful variety!) Honestly, before I saw the big screen movie in 1980, I said, "What? Olive Oyl? * Lol * (Popeye was also released in 1980.) But I took it back as soon as the movie started, she's genius In the devil's opinion, this is her best performance so far (though I loved her in "Roxanne" Steve 'a Martina, 1987). br /> <br /> Once Kubrick has established pearly fragments of information that you, the viewer, must own: Torrence's past, Danny's broken arm, Tony, the story of the hotel itself, the fact that Danny is not "mental", but rather, the clairvoyant, as well as the general layout of the hotel; all this in the first 3 sequences; the film never stops to scare you. <br /> <br /> Two slaughtered daughters, the previous caretaker, Delbert Grady (the girls appeared to Danny several times, first to Tony in the apartment before the family left for h otel) were icons that Danny could identify and which he was afraid at the same time. They were persecuted (and haunted) by themselves and showed Danny how and where they were killed in a fairly graphic and material way. <br /> <br /> Tony Kubrick was written as a spirit accompanying a spiritual guide, which he acquired as a result of almost tearing his arm out of his body by his own father. He was ... "a little boy who lives in my mouth". He manifested himself at the end of Danny's finger and physically spoke through Danny to talk to Danny. Just like in the book, I realize that Stephen King was going to be projecting Danny as an older boy trying to save his father. Kubrick skipped this little twist and somehow frightened him when Tony "took ... Danny ... over". The idea that the elder Danny himself would return to his younger self is not ... terrifying. <br /> <br /> Scene "Woman in the shower", made by Lia Beldan (about which I can not find other credits) for doing anything before or since) as a younger woman and Billie Gibson (who ALSO seems to be suffering due to the lack of loans for work before or after), she was seductively unpleasant and completely disgusting. It was dramatic and terrifying. Odd and frightening. When Nicholson looks in the mirror and sees him spreading the body under his hands; the look of terror itself on his face was so complete and REAL. <br /> <br /> Jack quickly sets off on his journey from the "jonesing" of an alcoholic to a crazy person. The degradation of the mental state of his character is carefully and accurately documented by Kubrick. Jack's immediate friendship with Lloyd Bartender (just as alcoholics, potential mental patients and addicts do) presents his urgent need for the atmosphere that Lloyd is using; namely alcohol ... "the dog's hair that bit me". (Jack Torrence) In Jack's case, it's bourbon on rocks, with no charges for Jack. "Orders from home". (Lloyd the Bartender) A cool word game. <br /> <br /> When the scenario of Jacek Wendy find is nothing more than a page on the same line inscribed in a circle, though in 8 or 9 different creative styles. .. when he asks from the shadow: "How do you like it?" and Wendy whirls and screams with a baseball bat in her hand ... it's so poignant. This is the point where he realizes how much the whole situation is wrong ... how furious Jack is. It is very scary, dramatic and provides a strong presence. This, combined with Danny's visions in the hotel lobby filled with blood, imposed on the stage between Jack and Wendy, as well as the confrontational ending of this scene, make it probably the strongest movie scene. The "REDRUM" scene. Wow. What should I say Which mother would not be completely afraid of awakening to find their young, worried son standing over them with a huge knife, talking in this queer little voice calling "REDRUM" over and over again? Even if it did not matter, it would still be as frightening as the seventh level of HELL. It was something that everyone could (and had) remember (ed.). Speaking of memorable scenes ... <br /> <br /> Nicholson's final assault on his family's ax was probably one of the scariest scenes in film history. His advertising line "Heeeeere's Johnny!" Was brilliant and is one of the most memorable scenes in the history of horror. This also goes in the history of horror movies. <br /> <br /> Ending ..? Kubrick's ending was perfection. I felt that it was beautiful. No smarm, mindless groaning, no tears of that idiot's ending. Simply the personification of perfection. That's all I will say about the ending. <br /> <br /> Who cares what has been removed ?! See what Kubrick put in IN. Rent him, look, BUY. It's a classic in horror and for a reason. IT RAWKS !! <br /> <br /> * Me being Me * ... Take this movie and watch it in your Stephen King collection and get the "Authorized" version from 1997 made by King and put it in the kids section. That's where it belongs. .: This movie rating 9.98 on Fiend :.
