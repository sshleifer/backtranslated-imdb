I watched the film twice in one week, both at the cinema in Orpington, Kent, and the United Kingdom. The place was full of both people and people. From the beginning of the movie, in which Henry Winkler is "wounded" on the pitch, the entire audience was moved by laughter, a laugh that lasted until the subtitles. <br /> <br /> For those who love American stocks, this movie is Necessity, but be ready to see Henry Winkler like you've never seen him before. Also watch out for a very well-known actor whose wrestling movement is a hallmark! <br /> <br /> If you have a chance, watch this movie and this is the best family comedy!
