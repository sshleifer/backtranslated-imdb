The biggest games Kasparowa or Fischer can be a mess for the novice. It's a great movie. There is no special agency in the story. This is a tip! It is a private plot, built as a private enterprise. It is a self-destructive and self-organizing plot. In conclusion, the script describes the perfect professional story: private, organized, self-destructive, without a trace at the end. Behind the plot can be anyone: a wise "director" with money. Everything can be done only by delegation. The "director" must be just a trigger. If an ordinary viewer can not see the essence of the story in the clear sequences of the movie, the real plot has less chance of discovery. All the performances of the actors are well done, with a special mention for Gene Hackman and Mickey Rooney.
