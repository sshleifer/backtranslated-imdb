I just can not understand the negative comments about this movie. Yes, it's a typical affair with a boy and a girl, but it's done with such talent and Polishness that time just flies. Henstridge (talk about winning a lottery with a gene pool!) Is just as magnetic and attractive as ever (who says the golden age of cinema is dead?), And Vartan has his own. two wires; the movie is the most alive when it shares the stage - a lot! It's getting so good that you feel willing to meet ... <br /> <br /> Ignore negative comments - if you feel a little blue, watch this movie, you will feel much better. If you're happy, you'll be euphoric. <br /> <br /> (PS: I am 33 years old, a man from Great Britain and a hopeless romantic who is still looking for her princess ...)
