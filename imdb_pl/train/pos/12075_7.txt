Nina Foch claims that "My Name is Julia Ross" in the noir movie of 1945 starring Dame May Witty and George Macready. It's short, and because it does, the movie suffers. It could have been a good fifteen minutes to half an hour longer. <br /> <br /> When I was growing up, Foch was a regular element on television, playing a neurotic woman, wife with a cheater, nervous wreck. She became one of the best acting teachers in Los Angeles. Here she is a pretty young woman playing the title role. Julia answers the secretary's announcement and is immediately hired by Mrs. Hughes and her son Ralph. Not much knows - although we find out right away - that the job broker is the front, prepared to get the right woman for this task, a woman without a family and without a boyfriend. <br /> <br /> This is live - in a situation; when Julia reaches home, she is under the influence of drugs, and when she wakes up, she says she is Mrs. Hughes and she is not allowed to leave. <br /> <br /> Acting is very good. Low budget, but still entertaining - some things, especially at the end, happen too quickly, which is why I said that the movie is too short. Nevertheless, I recommend it.
