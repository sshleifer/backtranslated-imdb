It was my favorite movie as a child and I was a few times in stage production, so it will always remain my favorite music and I doubt that anyone could ever repeat the story of Oliver Twist on the screen better than this one. He did. <br /> <br /> My favorite "bad guy" must be Oliver Reed as Bill Sikes. He not only frightened my life when I watched him as a 6-year-old, but now as a woman, I can better empathize with Nancys, a bar maid / prostitute who helps Oliver get the life he deserves. > <br /> Jack Wilde as a clever dodger was fantastic and I do not think anyone could defeat him as a pocket picker and Fagin's best friend. The music is fantastic, especially the Fagin numbers, I'm also very grateful that they did not give Bill Sikes a music number, it would not be so sinister with him. <br /> <br /> I think Carol Reed did a great job with the sticky tip of Nancy, keeping her in the G movie, hiding the beating, but giving enough to show violence against Bill. <br /> <br /> This film is both charming and charismatic as a musical song, and it is a moving drama that follows a young boy when he tries to find a place where he belongs to life.
