"Tenant" is the largest film by Roman Polanski IMO. And I love "Chinatown", but this one is much more original, unconventional and even frightening. It's also a great black comedy. Some people I showed this movie to * were very worried *, so I warn him that it's affecting some people in this way. Pola≈Ñski is doing great, playing the main role in "Tenants", as well as directing.
