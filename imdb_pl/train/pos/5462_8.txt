First of all, if you plan to watch it, make sure you watch the UNCUT version (although it is very interesting to step back and then watch the scenes that were violated due to censorship), this is a huge difference. This film is about a young woman played by Barbara Stanwyck, who from the age of 14 was forced to prostitute by her own father. When her father suddenly passes away, she can go out into the world by herself. After reading about Nietzsche's philosophies about life, he uses his sexuality to manipulate people to give her what she wants and leave them in ruins and desperately want love. Throughout the film, it becomes more and more materialistic and manipulative, and the audience begins to wonder if it has any sense of morality at all. In general, Baby Face is a very shocking movie with glaring sexuality scenes that most people would not expect to see in a black and white film. Although no sexual acts are clearly shown on the screen, it is very obvious what is happening outside of the camera. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed watching this movie and I believe that most of today's viewers will get at least some fun if, especially with the value of the movie shock. Looking at this, I thought that the pace seems a bit slow in part, but I think that for the majority of films, he sees it for the first time. Actually, I think that almost all the movies I saw from the early 30's had some minor stimulation problems or some parts just did not flow. It was probably just a movie craft that was not completely improved yet? it would take only a few years. Compare the movie from 1939 and compare it with the film from the early 30s and I think you will see what I mean. <br /> <br /> Once again, I'm glad that I could see the original piece; it really makes a big difference. Also all fans of John Wayne will be surprised to see him in this movie before he was famous in an unusual role.
