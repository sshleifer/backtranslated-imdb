PERHAPS, trying to find another "Hot Property" for adaptation, Brothers Fleischer returned to his successful journey into the world of the pop-comic comic book POPEYE THE SAILOR from 1933 (Fleischer Studios / Paramount). Although she was part of the BETTY BOOP series, Miss B. appeared briefly; leaving the rest as a pilot episode for the possible appearance of a full-sized series. <br /> <br /> AS is now a common knowledge, rough, squinting eyes, brawlin 'sailor has probably become the most successful cartoon series in history; survival and literally survival Fleischers and their Studio, lasting until today. <br /> <br /> RETURNING to King Features for another try of luck was undoubtedly the reason for trying out the very popular character of the HENRY Comic Strip in BETTA. A tour of BOOP; the goal is to look for another series. Reasoning seemed certainly reasonable. HENRY was the most popular film in the composition of Hearst Papers; appearing both as Daily and Sunday Color Comics Supplement, PUCK, THE COMICS WEEKLY. You know, "What fools are these mortals!" Do you remember that, Schultz? In watching the plump, small, bald boy Comic Strip 'Hero' and his pranks on the screen, both solo and in hand with Miss Betty; we were pleasantly surprised to see how well the character was dealt with. History and director Dave Fleischer provided plenty of comic situations reminiscent of stripes and gags that seemed the most appropriate for the character of little Henry. These mostly quiet vignettes were very important for the animated film because they were faithful to the printed page; as the HENRY Feature was made mainly in a 4-color "mime". <br /> <br /> In the cartoon titled BETTY BOOP WITH HENRY: THE MOST LIVE American (Fleischer Studios / Paramount Pictures Corporation, 1935), we see what is; it is essentially a situational exercise; it is interrupted by the usual set of quick fire Dave Fleischer, gags similar to machine guns. In short, Henry spots a puppy in the Betty Boop Pet Shop window. It's a kind of love at first sight, when Henry tries to buy a small puppy with the only money he had, the coins in his pocket. It is founded by Miss Boop to acquire money for $ 2.00 in the age of depression. Tears appear when the little guy moves away with disapproval. <br /> <br /> BUT a pardon appears on the horizon when Betty asks the boy to pay attention to the store while she is leaving for urgent matters. In exchange for her services, Miss Betty promises him a small dog. Of course they have a deal and Betty leaves. <br /> <br /> BEGINNING work on cleaning cages and feeding livestock gives Fleischer the opportunity to light a new range of gags; this time with bird seed, Henry's bald pate and broomsticks. (But of course not right away, Schultz!) Henry's enthusiasm for mass feeding the avian population of the store by literally blasting his head soon leads to the massive departure of birds; outside the store on an open street in a mass prison break. <br /> <br /> BETTY returns to this view and expresses his disappointment and anger at Henry's temporary care. All bets were off, no doggie for Henry. He begins to go out; depressed; but soon convinces the owner to give him another chance to settle the matter. His head is covered with bird's seed, he manages to seize all the small feathered creatures; returning them to their pet store. Fortunately, small leaves; but this time he has his loving little face lollipop. <br /> <br /> NON-COMPLETE it was a winning combination. We have a carefree, full of energy, free rocking of the boy, Betty's goodness and emotions related to the situation and dubious results of the situation of "boy and his dog". Max and Dave Fleischer gave us something like a small mini-masterpiece of surreal comedy. <br /> <br /> It surprised us that there is no HENRA series. Judging by the fairly faithful treatment of the character, it could certainly have been maintained for some time. In any case, this teamwork was in many respects the best of Betty Boop's photos. Although the first, POPEYE THE SAILOR (Fleischer / Paramount, 1933) was the most successful (and barely had Betty Boop, except the episode as a carnival dancer hula); HENRY Short was much better than the two following King's: tryouts, BETTY BOOP AND LITTLE KING, BETTY BOOP AND LITTLE JIMMY, both from 1936. <br /> <br /> POODLE SCHNITZ !!
