And Christmas Together really came before my time, but I was brought up on John Denver, and songs from this unique song were always my family Christmas music. Over the years, we had a cassette with a crackling record that meant it was Christmas. A few years ago I finally managed to track down the video on Ebay, so after listening to all the music for about 21 years, I saw John and Muppet in action for myself. If you ever get a chance, it's a lot of fun - great music, cordial and cheesy. It is also interesting to see the version of Muppets from the 70s and compare them with newer versions. I think Denver actually took a bit of heat for making such a show - I think that the performers normally do not compromise their photos by playing songs with Muppetami, but I'm glad he did. Even if you can not track down the movie, the soundtrack is also worth it. It has several traditional Muppified favorites, but also some original Denver melodies.
