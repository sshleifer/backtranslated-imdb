Anyone who does not laugh at the movie has been embalmed. I watched it at least twenty times and I still have tears in my eyes in many scenes. Sally Field is absolutely perfect as Celest Talbert, a vanishing soap star whose supporting cast tries to replace her in the hope that their own star will grow. Fields, at the age of 45, still has a wonderful and beautiful quality pixie and a perfect figure that contradicts her three children. I'm biased, I'm in love with her. <br /> <br /> The "Soapdish" cast is filled with stars that perfectly fulfill their roles. Kevin Kline is flawless, like Robert Downey Jr., inguenue Elizabeth Shue, Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher in one of her early roles, Carrie Fisher as an oversexial casting director who interrogates the actor as a small waitress on. Kathy Najimy is wonderful as an unfortunate costume designer, and most importantly, Cathy Moriarty as Nurse Nan, who leads the story to remove Fields from the show, is hilarious. <br /> <br /> This film should have won Oscars for the best comedy, best lady in comedy, best comedy hero and countless top achievements, including writing, directing and supporting actors and actresses. Download a DVD to watch it for the next twenty-five years. You will still laugh at it when the disc is worn out.
