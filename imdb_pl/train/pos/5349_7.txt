Running Man is one of those movies that, if they are transplanted, will become boring and depressing even. <br /> <br /> My advice is to watch it maybe once or twice a year with a few buddies and a few drinks. br /> <br /> In today's climate of TV Media's dominance and capitalist mode in society, it really works as a revisionist social commentary, after the boom of the 80s. Forget about it! There are other great and better reasons to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Schwarzenegger is on top as Ben "The Butcher of Bakersfield" Richards, and the inclusion of one of the Bond-belting liners was completely inspired - these are truly leg-end-gifts (with his rim to Killian by the camera main entertainment). <br /> <br /> The design of the stalkers is genuinely American and reflects the characteristics of the TV program "Gladiators" and WWE. The terrifying end of Buzz-sawa will freeze every viewer to the core (as a footnote, why does his death stand out as particularly disturbing in something that is a seemingly optimistic activist with a bitter sense of humor?) Jesse Venturer and Sven Ole Thorssen they are great as helpers (and they are Arnies donuts in real life), and even have Mick Fleetwood in them! What more can you want? <br /> <br /> I highly recommend Running a Man if you're looking for a great entertainment action, with a shiny finish and great characters. Just do not expect education from her (at least on the basis of the surface value). <br /> <br /> Quality, I really love it. You will also, unless you are thesp. 7/10
