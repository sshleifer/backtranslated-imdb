Was Morgan Freeman as unusual as God than George Burns? This film was certainly better than the one that "O God" wore. I was completely absorbed and LMAO all the way. Carrey was perfect as an absent anonymous presenter, and Aniston played her role as a frustrated girl in her usual well-performed performance. For example, I do not consider her ugly or unjustified. I think my favorite scene was Carrey opening file cabinets, thinking he would never keep his life history. See if you can see the file in the cabinet where events from his bathroom humor are stored: I turned the file over. This well written and even better played comedy will be one of the best toys of this type.
