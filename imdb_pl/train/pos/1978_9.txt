This Oliver's production is masterful in showing the layers of evil in the human soul. What makes this story extraordinary is the brilliantly bright Invisible Figure that pierces this darkness, guiding the innocent boy through the most serious dangers safely into the hands of his own relative. Yes, though Oliver goes through the valley of the shadow of death, he is not afraid of evil. The staff and chick are there to comfort him. In the end, he is saved from humanity. At the bottom is Fagin, the most villainous of the whole party. Fagin considers the repentance of his roads not once, but twice, but refuses because he does not want to pay the price. Fagin is worse than Bill Sikes because he brings up small pickpockets who become murderers. Oliver is inside. His innocence is undefiled, but also unused. Nancy is the best. Without judgment, he ignores the brutal nature of Bill Sikes from her deep need for love. But unlike Fagin, at the likely cost of his own life, he regrets his sins by saving Oliver from Bill. Things are not what they seem. In my opinion, this quality makes art worthwhile - unpredictability. I would give this film "10", but the soundtrack and atmosphere of the 70s were distracting. In general, a great parable and a perfectly adequate story for all audiences.
