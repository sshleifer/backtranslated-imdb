If you like Sci-Fi, Monsters and Ancient Legends, you'll love this movie !! <br /> <br /> The special effects are definitely the best I've seen since Juarassic Park hit the big screen many years ago. While acting could have been a bit less desirable, the plot and effects compensated it accordingly. <br /> <br /> I would like you to see it already on the movies on the theater screen instead of the 42-inch screen TV. <br /> <br /> If you like non-stop action, amazing visuals and taste myths and knowledge ... you must see this movie !!
