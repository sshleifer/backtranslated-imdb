In 1954, Marlon Brando was a hot actor after performing at Streetcar Named Desire and On The Waterfront. Frank Sinatra has not invented himself on the silver screen yet. But the image of Sinatra as former Nathan Detroit helped restore Sinatra with his fans. <br /> <br /> This is a great version of a great game screen, and the choices of leads and supporting players are great. Imagine a movie where Brando sings? It was his only vocal role in the role of Sky Masterson. In addition, the female lead, Jean Simmons and Vivian Blaine (recreating her stage role as a long suffering Nathan girl, Adelade), making the highest effort. Particularly noteworthy is the great Stubby Kaye (as Nicely Nicely) and with all due respect to Eric Clapton, no one in the Rockin 'The Boat version even approaches Stubby. Sheldon Leonard, who would gain fame as a TV producer on such shows as The Danny Thomas Show and The Dick Van Dyke Show, wonders about "Harry The Horse". and even Regis Toomey offers his perfection as "Brother Arvide". <br /> <br /> This is one of the interesting musicals to watch, a good comedy, and you get Sinatra and Brando. Soooooo "Luck Be A Lady Tonight" and brother ... "it's your bones"
