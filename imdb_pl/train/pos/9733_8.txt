"How to Lose Friends and Separate People" is a funny, if not loose, adaptation of memories of Toby Young with the same name. It's also a great title that helps you fill the line requirements in IMDb reviews! The basic essence is the same as a book with some dramatic events, but a romantic story is added, and the ending is certainly Hollywood. Simon Pegg, despite the fact that he is basically an annoying person, is his usual nice and funny "me" and almost carries a movie. It's strange that a few years ago he thought he was just a guy from the TV series, and now he's scratching Hollywood names. It's a good cast and it's a fun, easy watch - a kind of male Ugly Betty, but more fun.
