There are many details in "A Bug's Life". Everything is covered. The movie looks great and the animation sometimes stuns. The film is not very scary orignal, it's basically a modern shot of Seven Samurai Kurosawa, only with errors. However, I liked the interaction of the character, and the bad guys in this movie seemed really angry. It seems that Disney usually makes their villains cut out copies. Grasshoppers are dangerous, and Hopper, the main evil man, was a brilliant creature. Check it out.
