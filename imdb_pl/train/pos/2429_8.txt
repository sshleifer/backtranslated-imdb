If you loved Deep Cover, you can like this movie. Many of the poetic interludes that Fishburne recites in Deep Cover come from the lyrical scenario "Once In the Life", an adaptation of the art screen written by Fishburne. If you love Larry as much as I do, you'll love this movie, which is all Larry, all hot, and all modeled. Of course, there is a game of weapons and illegal use of substances, after all it is a gangster movie, but the script is beautiful and the story is moving, even a little on the side of the hatchling. <br /> <br /> AMAZING movie ... dark, scary, sexy and exciting. If you ever sneak out at night or spend time in the club, you get the right impact of tight sets (metaphorical echo, trapped in life). Full of clever announcements and complex relationships, this film is tense ... every sentiment is reflected in a set of clothes and camera shots. GOOD JOB!
