Wow! All I can say is that if Elizabeth Montgomery is the enemy (he speaks Russian), he is giving up now. She is a real child in her short skirt, high boots and a clear bust line, even if her eye shadows look like zombies. This 30 minutes is undoubtedly the sexiest series. Look out for a realistic and revealing wrestling match with Bronson until he ruthlessly hits her chin, ruining all the fun. Okay, I should probably give up my hormonal reaction. <br /> <br /> It's a very well-produced half-hour through this underestimated strength behind the success of the series, Buck Houghton. Naturally, the producers want to bring out the third season with an above-average result. This is the nuclear America (we know because it is part of the invaders' strength) and only American Bronson and Soviet Montgomery stay with about 20 tons of realistic wrecks. They roam through the destruction in alternating moods, and we wonder how long it will take before biology breeds politics, which of course will eventually happen (luck Bronson). And that's all. No real conversation, except what Bronson has to say, which is quite exaggerated. Nevertheless, the script is still fun and quite bold for its time, even suggesting that not all Russians looked like truck drivers (a popular Cold War stereotype). <br /> <br /> By the way - it is rather interesting that a very Slavic Bronson (Buchinsky) would be cast as an American, and a glittering Montgomery as a Slav. It looks the opposite. My guess is that the producers did not want to throw the Americans into the physically weaker role of a woman, regardless of the appearance. However, it may happen that there is not much fear of TZ or atmosphere, but the episode remains very, very possible to watch 30 minutes.
