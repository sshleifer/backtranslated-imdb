Especially at a time when too many science fiction movies were not filmed (1973), this is a great vision of the future in which everything went wrong. Too many people and nothing works. The only people who can live in comfort are rich. The action takes place in New York in 2022 (I think so) and reminds you of your worst vision of Calcutta. <br /> <br /> I appreciate Charlton Heston's acting after seeing him in the movie Orson Welles' Touch of Evil. He was (perhaps) capable of presenting a series of heroic or half heroic people. Here he is torn between being a policeman who is a bit corrupt (taking rare delicacies from the rich), and being completely corrupt (actively supporting evil). <br /> <br /> Everything seems to take place at night, and sweat trickles down from everyone, except for one of the rare air-conditioned apartments. Although I have not seen it before, I knew the famous ending (which will not be revealed here), but the ending is certainly announced. <br /> <br /> Great scenes with Edward G. Robinson: going to the council (consisting of older Jews with heavy accents, it seems), where the truth is revealed. And then we're going to Thanatopsis to find out. <br /> <br /> Gritty, a dystopian science fiction from Star Wars.
