"Mother" is an extraordinary piece of filming - it makes you think it does not hit - and eventually leaves you thinking. Very open to the fate of the main character. Anne Reid (whom I knew only briefly from her performances in some projects led by Victoria Wood and I thought she was a good comedian) is really great. Not a stereotypical widowed housewife who was perfect at all in marriage and motherhood. And that's not all, at first glance free and full of adventures. She plays her character only with the right note that rings real (well, I succeeded). Powerful cast. Great script. Really a renaissance of European cinema;)
