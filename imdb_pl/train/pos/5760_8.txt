My friend from the room ordered this on the web some time ago, and I finally watched him. This is disgusting. This is cheezy. This is quite stupid ... but it's also great fun. It was the coolest game we've seen since the days of "City Of The Walking Dead" centuries ago. It was like being back in the old Drive-In theater! You can tell the guy who made the movie all the horrible dubbed zombie movies. This one has all the clich√©s and tricks of these movies in one and it's cool because it's just to be like that. The daze factor is high, it's flowing, and the laughter spins! The effects change from careless to good, the one in which the guy is torn in half, and the one in which the guy pushes his heart to his chest is perfect! Acting turns from horrible to quite good. There is not much story, just a lot and a lot of gore. This one is modeled on zombie movies from Italy and Spain, I think, because they stay forever in big stages like this movie. If you like Troma movies, class B cheeses, you can not do anything watching this movie. A nice way to waste a Friday night!
