Once again, Madhur Bhandarkar will take you on a wild side trip. And it is extraordinary, literally and figuratively. <br /> <br /> Mumbai hi-society - stars and stars, glam dolls and witches, business tycoons and types of brokers, so all smelly fate - are in focus here. In a typical tabloid style, their worlds are developing, and each colorful story is a clever sub-story in itself. <br /> <br /> Struggling with a star thrown out by the manufacturer after becoming pregnant, a stewardess and her loud pedophile husband, businessman and his neurotic wife, reporters and police captain; all shades on the exhibition and innumerable shades between them. <br /> <br /> Bhandarkar is doing a massive job digging up dirt on kings of drama, dancing queens and living corpses. Atul Kulkarni has a blow, like Boman Irani and Sandhya Mrudul. Konkona Sen Sharma is effective as a reporter for a former criminal, but she could be a little bit embellished due to the change of position and the arrangement of parties. <br /> <br /> Focused (140 minutes) and a refreshingly different movie, worth the money.
