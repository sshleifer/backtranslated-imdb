Things that come, it's a rare rarity, a movie about ideas. Many films present a vision of the future, but there are few attempts to show us how the future came. The first part of the film, when the war goes on in Everytown, is short but powerful. (Ironically, the movie audience laughed in the release year that the enemy planes were attacking England - the oppression was high.) Wells' predictions appeared too early.) The endless war that takes place while the sub-model destroyed by the sub is the most effective. The explanatory titles are very similar to the German expressionistic graphic design. The artistic director was the great William Cameron Menzies, and his sets of ruins Everytown belong to his best works. Margaretta Scott is very seductive as a boss lover. Everytown of the 21st century is an equally impressive project. Acting in the history of the 21st century is not convincing - perhaps it was an unsuccessful attempt to contrast the technocratic rationality of this time with the 1970 barbarism. Unfortunately, the model work, representing the angry crowds rushing up the pavements, is ridiculously bad and it was possible to do much better, even with 30s technology. This is especially annoying because the giant plane scenes are very convincing. This was accomplished by Raymond Massey's wonderful speech, which ends the film - rarely the ideal of scientific progress was so well expressed. Massey's last question is now more relevant than ever, in an era of severely limited manned flights. The stage is supported by the moving music of Sir Arthur Bliss, whose name I am proud to share. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the VHS versions of this movie are absolutely horrible, with serious technical problems. Most versions have published quite interesting assembly of futuristic workers and machines, which takes us from 1970 to 2038. I hope there is a good DVD of the whole movie.
