Simon Pegg plays the role of Sidney Young, a young entertainment writer who began writing a career for a grass-roots magazine that specializes in insulting the shallow and superficiality of the rich and famous. He makes a career out of lampoon celebrities, although he desperately wants to be famous. The film is based on the very bizarre career of Toby Young, who also ran a small magazine in the UK called Modern Review, which offered virulent criticism of almost everything you can imagine until he closed the magazine in a barrage of verbal missiles with his co-worker and then he went to the spectacularly unsuccessful career of a writer for Vanity Fair, which is largely part of his life told in this film. <br /> <br /> At first he is delighted that he can start working on a large publication (known in the film as Sharp magazine) and despite active nerves he is positively glowing on the first day. He meets with the editor-in-chief Clayton Harding (played by Jeff Bridges) who is as hard as nails, but who is also exactly the editor he needs to goof-off, like Young, to keep his job in the warehouse. It offers little in the form of Young's immediate acceptance, but it also has what can only be described as the liberal tolerance of Young's youthful aberrations and inappropriate behaviors. <br /> <br /> A significant part of the comedy in the film comes from Young's misunderstanding or indifference towards the generally accepted code of public behavior and a special label on dealing with rich and famous people. But Sidney's reasons to act in such a strange way and give out offensive interviews is because he thinks he hates the whole culture of celebrities and seems to believe in this eternal saying? "If you can not defeat them, join them and THEN defeat them." <br /> <br /> Complicating matters are two very different women. Olsen (Kirsten Dunst), who is initially terrified by Sidney's obvious arrogance and feminine ways, and the stunning Sophie (Megan Fox) model, which represents the culture of celebrities. Needless to say, Sidney's never-ending attack of superficiality and fame is a superficial desire for Sophie, the one with the appearance of a star. <br /> <br /> Sophie is stunningly beautiful, it's true, but it also turns out that there is not one thought in her that shakes in her head. not very interesting or attractive, but Dunst's performance makes him a real person. A relationship with her would have the whole reality of a Britney Spears marriage, and yet the movie retains a certain level of credibility, because despite how obvious it is, we feel Sidney's pain in not pursuing her (and that's how I felt). <br /> <br /> H ow To Lose Friends and Alienate People has a pretty interesting assumption and is full of honest, satisfying performances, and although it changes in a bit of the standard romantic comedy of the third act, it has many well-developed and interesting characters. Danny Huston, for example, gives us a great performance as another love interest for Alison, who pays tribute to The Big Lebowski (including Bridges) with his always present white Russian, one of my favorite drinks. Buying Absolute and Kahlua here in China costs the equivalent of about $ 350, but my kitchen is never without them. <br /> <br /> I am looking forward to the day when Simon Pegg splits up a bit, because I love his films, but I'm not entirely sure of his range. He played a serious character in Hot Fuzz, but he was serious about the madness that surrounded him, and eventually returned to being himself, which was in Shaun of the Dead, Run, Fat Boy, Run, and now How to Lose Friends. He is a rising star, it will be interesting to see what else he can do.
