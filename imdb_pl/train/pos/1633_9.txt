I loved this movie when it appeared in the 80's and it's still there! I still quote classic lines like "say it again" and "you said you would shed my eggs from you". Ron Leibman was hot and very funny! Although underestimated and rejected by MAD, I must say that this little gem will always be my treasure and film that I would take with me if it was sent to an abandoned island! I just want someone to release a DVD because my VHS tape is already worn! If you like an exquisite comedy, this is definitely for you and should be considered an iconic classic! Military humor is the best and worse! Rent if you can not have it!
