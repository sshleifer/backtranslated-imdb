Does anyone know where and how can I get a copy of this movie? !! I have been looking for too long, someone is helping! In 1997, my friends and I were addons in this movie on Long Island and we never really saw him. :( <br /> <br /> I was hoping I could find a copy somehow, so I can finally check it out and share it with the girls! Is there anyone who knows where to get a copy from so I can stop being angry ( no matter if it's in VHS format, I'm still in the ice age.) If you or someone you know has a copy of this movie, help me, I'd be willing to pay for a good copy of it!
