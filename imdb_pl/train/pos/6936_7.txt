Winchester 73 receives the recognition of many critics for the restoration of the western post-World War II. Director Anthony Mann must earn a lot of merit for a great direction. Jimmy Stewart does a great job, but I think Stephen McNalley and John McIntire are stealing the movie, presenting two bad guys involved in the high stakes game, and the precious Winchester 73 goes to the winner. This is a good scenario with several stories happening at the same time. Look for the first Rock Hudson performance as Young Bull. Thank God, in a few years, we'll start allowing the Indians to play in Western movies. The film is black and white and was filmed in Tucson Arizona. I would not put Winchester 73 in Stagecoach, High Noon or Shane, but I received an above-average recommendation from me. <br /> <br />.
