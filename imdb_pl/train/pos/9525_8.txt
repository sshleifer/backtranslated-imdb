ROAD TO PERDITION can be summed up with the score of Thomas Newman. It is persecuting and beautiful, but you realize that this music is similar to another Newman's work and when you listen to the soundtrack, you recall SCENT OF A WOMAN, MEETING JOE BLACK and THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, which you recall other movies as the story unfolds on the screen. When Sullivans drive around America, trying to escape the psychotic man you're thinking about THE GETAWAY, Irish gangsters are MILLER'S CROSSING, while the subtext of guilt and redemption can be summed up by the gangster epopos Coppola and Leone. Although I have seen it before, this should not be taken as a heavy critic of Sam Mendes's film, which I repeat, is haunting and beautiful, and the only drawbacks that work against it, is very slow opening twenty minutes and I was a bit confused, events, which made Michael Sullivan betrayed. But if you stop thinking about how much of a sentimental mess Spielberg could have done with a story that revolves around his father and his twelve-year-old son running behind their lives, you can not stop thinking what a great director Mendes <br /> <br /> ROAD TO PERDITION is a movie in which the entire cast gives excellent performances. I've never been so interested in Tom Hanks, but he's just as good as him because he played the main role, probably better. Paul Newman plays a character with an Irish accent, but at no point did I believe that I watch an American legend on the screen imposing a false accent - Newman's performance works thanks to the subtle body language, his character is torn by guilt, but Newman is never milk it or goes up. While he never supported Newman, who gives the best results in the film, the two British supporting actors, Craig and Law, are also very memorable as American gangsters and while Law will still have a long career as a leading actor, he wonders how Daniel Craig could have Advance character actor if he did not decide to become James Bond, the role that heralds the end of actors' career
