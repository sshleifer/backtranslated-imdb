I watched it with subtitles in Russian, but I really liked it. The main character Sasha was born cursed, with a deadly weapon as an extension of his body. His whole life was unhappy because he was different and because his anger caused him to do deadly things. <br /> <br /> When Sasha finally found love in a young woman named Katya, everyone tried to take her away from him, ending a deadly battle. There were a lot of gore, but not too much for the weak who stayed. <br /> <br /> Not for people who like the usual old Hollywood movie, but for those who like independent films. Kinda has the impression of an Asian fantasy film.
