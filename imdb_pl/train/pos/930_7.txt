I am sure that most people already know this story - stingy Ebenezer Scrooge visits three ghosts (Christmas Spirits of the past, present and coming), which emphasize parts of his life in the hope of saving his soul and changing his path. Dickens' classic tale in one form or another has stood the test of time to become the favorite favorite of the holidays. <br /> <br /> When I was growing up watching the 1951 version of Alastair Sims, I believe he is the ultimate Scrooge, I was impressed by the version that was released when I was in high school. George C. Scott plays the convincing and mean Ebenezer Scrooge, and the actors who play ghosts are rather frightening and threatening. David Warner is also a good Bob Cratchit. <br /> <br /> This version is beautifully filmed and uses more modern filming styles (80s) that make it more delicious for my children than the black and white version from 1951. <br /> <br /> It is a dignified adaptation of a story that I watch almost every year during a certain Christmas season.
