The Canadian director Mary Harron is a cultural gadget whose previous films showed the artistic excess of the sixties and empty greedy eighties. In The Notorious Bettie Page, he points out his unwavering eye to America in the 1950s, an epoch hidden in Joe McCarthy's moral righteousness, experiencing the beginnings of a sexual awakening that would lead to free love in the next decade. Harron and her co-author Guinevere Turner are not clearly interested in the standard biographical sex symbol. It is a film about the underground icon of the era and how its pure, shameless sexuality has revealed both predatory instincts and unclean thoughts of culture untouched by the beauty of a naked body. If the details of Bettie's life were about the whole movie, then why finish it before its most tragic period began. Apparently, Harron is more interested in America's attitudes towards sexual imaginations now and then. Along with the intrepid management of Gretchen Mol and the stunningly atmospheric photographs of W. Mott Huppel III, he perfectly fulfills this aim by maintaining a mirror in the past, at the same time making the audience examine their own "enlightened" 21st century attitudes towards pornography. When America suffocates under new conservatism, it is a movie that is needed more than ever.
