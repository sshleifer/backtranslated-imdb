This movie contains one ingredient that should have all revenge movies, and that's real emotions. Sadness, love, laughter, anger. There are so many emotions in the film. From the beginning to the end, this movie is extremely captivating. The plot on paper sounds like garbage, which is usually thrown on the faces of the audience, but do not be mistaken, this movie is powerful. Washington always puts on a great performance. <br /> <br /> The plot in short: a man suffers from depression, a young girl brings life to him, the children are kidnapped, the man wants revenge. It does not sound like anything special, but it is much better than any other similar movie. For now, TAKEN is a similar movie, but when you compare them, MAN ON FIRE wins. The characters are captivating and everyone is doing great, and the directing is great. The city of Mexico lives, looks like the city of Mexico, it smells like a city of Mexico. Everything is well presented. the style of targeting was something that I liked and brought the best from Mexico City. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that you will release once a year to watch them again or a movie that you will be begging family and friends to watch . From the beginning to the end you cheer for the main character, which makes him a rollercoaster trip. There's enough action to make you happy, enough character development to please you, and then there's Washington, who will make you smile on your face. Watch this movie, you will not be disappointed
