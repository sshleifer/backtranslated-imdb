Fortunately for us, McCoy's true fans (most likely all Baby Boomers who grew up in the late 1950s and 1960s), three adult actors / actresses appeared when they performed at the show in 2000. Tony Martinez and Richard Crenna would die shortly thereafter. It was nice to see Luke, Sugar-Babe and Pepino together, was it just as mysterious about the total absence of any mention of Lydia Reed and Michael Winkleman? I understand that Little Luke died in 1999, but I'm not sure how to do it. There is no information on Hassie that I can find on the Internet. Very curious why did not even mention them? It was so clear that their absence at the Reunion show that I suspect that the family of Michael and Lydia alone (if she is still alive) 1) asked them to leave them out of discussion and therefore their desire was granted, or 2) TNN could not find any trace Michael and Lydia (like the rest of us) seemed to have disappeared. Therefore, the safest strategy would be to leave them outside the conversation. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, Walter Brengen's retrospection has been wonderfully done. They did not make any bones out of it ... then my grandfather succeeded in the exhibition. I remember being a child imitating my grandfather's struggling with his grandfather and laughing at my parents (as surely millions of other children did). One of the annoyances that worried me a bit was Richard Crenna's inclination to dominate the discussion ... sometimes interrupting Tony and Kathleen to make a point. In fact, although Tony Martinez seemed perfectly capable of taking part in the conversation, he was not allowed to speak and speak too much during the Reunion show. Unfortunate because I wanted to hear from all three, equally. The Reunion Show was a real feast for me. I watched it on DVD a few times and liked it every time. <br /> <br /> Dodgerdude
