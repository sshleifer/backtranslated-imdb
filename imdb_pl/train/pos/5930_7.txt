The monstrous duo-son-mother (Alice Krige and Brian Krause) sucks the life of virgins, and their latest goal is the pretty but lonely Tanya (Madchen Amick). However, these monsters are allergic to cat scratches ... I have never been a fan of poor, overrated bestsellers such as King, Koontz or Barker, but this B movie, written by Mr. Dung himself, is not really as bad as it could be . Yes, sometimes it is stunningly horrible, but in reality there are surprisingly impressive accents: a good old-fashioned cemetery, an amazing soundtrack and a gothic-style home scene, a mirror showing the monstrous form of villains, etc. Of course, the film is contaminated with Mr. Dung's night dialogue and obsessing with the point of the toilet tactics to denigrate the fat people, leading to a completely pointless plot of the rapist, but among the manure there are roses.
