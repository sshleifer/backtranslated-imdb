Genteel, the soft-spoken drama of Steven Spielberg was his first real venture in this genre. The departure from his normal adventure / fantasy has paved the way for his success in 1993, the Schindler's List. <br /> <br /> Based on the novel by Alice Walder, awarded the Pulitzer Prize, the story relates to the arranged marriage of a young girl to a brutal, furious farmer and her painful separation from her beloved younger sister Nettie. Although the story - about compassion, abuse and the power of love to heal all wounds - is often powerful and moving, it loses its way because of the continuity and scenario of mixing Menno Meyjes. "Violet" is sometimes difficult to follow, and on one or several occasions it seems to be slightly irregular with respect to the time interval. This break in writing cost the viewer the depth and detail that apparently appears in the novel Miss Walker. The real shame is that Maestro Spielberg was unable to pick out and fix these problems, because most of the show is a great example of his skill as a director. <br /> <br /> The performances are strong all the time, with Whoopi Goldberg making a debut - which he never disagrees when it comes to acting - his heart broke Celie who wants to be loved. Danny Glover gives solid support, although his "Moj≈ºe" was a better breakthrough for him in "Places in the Heart". The distinguished show comes from undefined Oprah Winfrey as Miss Sophia, a lonely, fighting black woman whose spirit is crushed by a terrible incident involving a condescending white woman from a higher class. Good support from Margaret Avery, Adolph Caesar and Rae Dawn Chong. <br /> <br /> Quincy Jones (co-producer with Spielberg, Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall) wrote a beautifully melodious result and also provided the original blues for the occasion. The edition from Michael Kahn sounds as always, while the director of photography Allen Daviau shows the perfect ability to capture the great southern scenery. <br /> <br /> This real heart thing will surely bring a tear to your eye, it's just that we unfortunately have so many unanswered questions. <br /> <br /> Wednesday, January 15, 1997 - video
