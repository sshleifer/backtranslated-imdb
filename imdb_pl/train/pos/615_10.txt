This is the epitome of a fairy tale! The villains are completely evil, and the heroes are refreshingly clean. The Danes, Deniro and Pfieffer are wonderful, as well as a new actor who plays the role of Tristan. Excellent performances, delightful magic, fun and dramatic and the perfect ending of the fairy tale make this film absolutely fantastic! I'm not sure if all the content is suitable for younger children, but there are plenty of funny subtleties for older audiences! Announcements do not do this justice movie! My fiance and I were quite skeptical, but we were so excited that we took a chance in this movie that I can only hope that I will provide everyone on the fence with this movie to try!
