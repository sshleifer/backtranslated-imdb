"Xizao" is a story about the clash of modern life and ancient traditions and its impact on the family in China. Da Ming (Quanxiu Pu) is a businessman who returns home when a letter sent by his brother Er Ming (Wu Jiang) makes him believe that his father Liu (Xu Zhu) died. He stated that his father was still alive, just like his old district and old father's business, a public bathroom. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on the Da Ming family and how it must learn the importance of his father's work, something that he always considered an old tradition that would soon have to die. The film also investigates his relationship with Er Ming, who is mentally retarded, and the problems of a small community and how the bathroom is a place that cleanses not only your body but also your soul. <br /> <br /> The two main themes of the film, family and progress problems are extremely well served, and the movie never loses the point that it is trying to do, both themes are very well developed and we see Chinese society and customs. <br /> <br /> The director, Yang Zhang, tells his story in a simple way, allowing the character's characters to do the task. It's a very simple approach, but it fits the movie perfectly and I doubt very much that the other style would fit the movie so well. Zhang has great potential because he can tell a story without the help of a visual flare or camera tricks. <br /> <br /> Acting is outstanding in its naturalistic approach, everyone works in a very natural way and looks almost like if they were real people filmed. The three first characters give unusual performances, and Wu Jiang as Er Ming is sure to steal the program. <br /> <br /> Even if the film could be maintained with the condescending message "old times were much better", instead of an attitude of balance, like saying that progress is good, we must go on, but we must not forget, where we come from, and maintain the balance between modern life and the traditions of the old. <br /> <br /> An amazing and moving movie. 8/10
