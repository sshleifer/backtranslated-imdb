Actually, this movie was not so bad. Includes action, comedy and emotions. There are good actors in the film, like Doug Hutchison (Percy from "Green Mile") who plays in Bristol. Another well-known actor is Jamie Kennedy from "Scream" and "Three Kings." The main characters are Jamie Foxx, as Alvin, who was pretty good and funny, but the one that surprised me most was David Morse as Edgar Clenteen. Playing a different character than usual, because in other films such as "Green Miles", "Indian Runner", "Negocjator" or "The Langoliers", he plays a very nice person, and in "Bait" plays almost the opposite, a man without emotions, which was nice to see. The only really negative thing about this movie are a few photos of the World Trade Center, which make this movie a bit outdated. In general, I thought it was a pretty good movie!
