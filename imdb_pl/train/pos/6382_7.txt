Definitely a very good idea, the scenario was just OK. It could be better, the positives are that it does not bore you if you're a lover of adventure, a new idea about the lost world of Atlantis. Nuts, which personally feel that this idea had a lot more potential than this one. They should have ended up with a better adventure than this one. It was not bad at all, but it would have been much better if there was a little more time. Say it was boring or it was not good. Good for people who like adventure animations such as Sindbad, like Droga do el Dorado. This film is also recommended for people looking for a nice little adventure with a very nice happy ending.
