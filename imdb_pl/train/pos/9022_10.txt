Well, Tenko is without a doubt the best British TV series in history, performances, directing, casting, tension, drama ... everything is fantastic. <br /> <br /> Although the show fell a bit later, in the last season, this ending movie nicely picked up the threads and created a great story for fans of the show and beginners. I can not recommend this movie anymore, find it and watch it. But I advise you to watch the series first, because the first two seasons are even better than this fantastic movie. <br /> <br /> Obvious (10/10)
