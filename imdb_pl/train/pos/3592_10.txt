Another powerful chick. This time it revolves around Diana Gusman, who always fights at school. Instead of being expelled, he takes his anger elsewhere in the ring. He trains to become a boxer, and there he meets Adrian in a featherweight and begins to fall in love with him. This movie has a powerful message that you take your dreams and go with them, even if someone does not believe in you (in this case her dad does not believe in her). Only this makes the film worth its price. Enjoy
