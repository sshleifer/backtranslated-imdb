Once upon a time in the castle ...... Two little girls are playing in the castle in the garden. They are sisters. Blonde (Kitty) and brunette (Evelyn). Evelyn steals a Kitty doll. Kitty aspires to Evelyn. Running through long corridors, they reach a room in which their grandfather, sitting in an armchair, reads a newspaper. Kitty complains about Evelyn, while Evelyn looks with interest at the picture hanging on the wall. Evelyn begins to repeat: "I am a red lady and Kitty is a black lady". Suddenly Evelyn grabs the dagger lying next to her and stabs Kitty's doll, then cuts her head (dolls). There is a fight. And Evelyn almost uses a dagger against Kitty. Grandfather intervenes, and the worst is avoided. <br /> <br /> Later, their grandfather tells them the legend associated with the picture hanging on the wall in front of them, in which a woman dressed in black stabs a woman dressed in red: <br /> <br /> "Long time ago in the same castle a red lady and a black lady lived. They were sisters and they hated each other. the room of the red lady and stabbed her seven times, a year later the red lady left the grave, killed six innocent people, the seventh victim was a black lady, once a hundred years the events are repeated in this castle and the red lady kills six innocent victims before she kills the black lady . <br /> <br /> Grandfather finishes his story saying that according to legend in sixteen years, the red queen should return and kill seven times. But he assures them that this is just an old legend. <br /> <br /> It passes sixteen years ..... <br /> <br /> This is the beginning of the movie. There are many twists and turns in the film. It is better to forget about logic (if you really analyze it, the story does not make sense) and just follow the movie with great colors, wonderful women, clothes, tasteful decor, light effects and beautiful soundtracks. <br /> <br /> Enjoy Barbara Bouchet, Sybil Danning, Marina Malfatti, Pia Giancaro, among other goddesses. She is naked Sybil Danning lying on the couch to dream about. And do not forget: Lady in red kills seven times! <br /> <br /> If you like "La Dama Rossa ...", check out "La Notte che Evelyn usc√¨ dalla Tomba".
