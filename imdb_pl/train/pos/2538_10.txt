There are many good things to say about this "B" movie. <br /> <br /> "B" can be in calls, but not in commissions. It's the best thing I've ever seen in my genre. A class effort by Universal. The script is well made, ingenious and faultless. Subtitles: Howard Higgin's original story and the story of Douglas Hodges, John Colton (screenplay). Director Lambert Hillyer coped well with complex history and location roles. No jumps on plenty of extras and locations. I loved Beulah Bondy (mother of Jimmy Stewarts in "It's A Wonderful Life." The leading woman, Frances Drake, was beautiful and coped with the grace and pathos of her husband Karloff, and Lugosi was actually undervalued, I think it's the best part I remember As I said, there were so many good things: the African discovery of the X radium, the melting of stone statues ((somewhat reminiscent of the Ten Small Indians, and then there was no one (Agatha Christie) (Barry Fitzgerald's version)), Karl's glow in the dark, Karloff's mother played by Violet Kemble Cooper with elegance, and because of all these virtues, I believed in the science he represented.
