Because this movie is the only movie of Dirty Harry, in which Clint Eastwood not only plays, but also produces and directs, you know that it must be good. Although some say that the Enforcer is the best in the series, I totally disagree. In my opinion, in addition to the original Dirty Harry, Sudden Impact and Magnum Force are the only two worth being in the series. Although The Enforcer is a good movie with some good action sequences, it's not as dirty and rough as the other three films. This movie captures all the emotions that make Clint Eastwood's movie good, and it has quotes that make Dirty Harry's film good. At Diry, Harry is "... Why, punk?"; in Magnum Force "Man must know his limitations"; in this is "Go ahead. Make my day. " Also in this movie it's nice to see the scenery change, because you're getting tired of seeing the same old streets of San Francisco in other movies in this series. Thanks to the great acting of Clint Eastwood and starred Sandra Locke and good director Clint, this is in my opinion the best sequel to Dirty Harry.
