Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer give solid performances in this beautiful but empty movie. The irony is that Dietrich plays a woman with a beautiful but empty life. The truly great cinematography and sets, as well as rainless baggage of Dietrich's clothes is also fantastic. It looks great; Boyer looks young and handsome. <br /> <br /> The story of a woman looking for meaning and a former priest seeking life seems quite out of date, but despite such unreal scenes and heavens, he somehow works, taking into account two stars, a great score from Max Steiner and a good cast. The film lasts 76 minutes and seems to be poorly edited, and some characters simply appear or disappear. <br /> <br /> Joseph Schildkraut is funny as an Arabic guide, C. Aubrey Smith is an old priest, Lucile Watson the mother superior, Tilly Losch, dancer, John Carradine, fortune teller and Basil Rathbone, they play ... well, I'm not sure. He just rides from the desert and spoils everything! As others noted, John Gilbert was to play with Dietrich. I can not help but think it would be great. The role of Boris's weary world would fit well with the great Gilbert. And after the success of Queen Christina (with Garbo) his career has returned to the path. <br /> <br /> I can not think about any other movie from the 30's that Dietrich made in color. It looks great and wears great clothes. My favorite outfit is the Valentino outfit as The Shiek, who wears by the pool. <br /> <br /> Certainly it's worth looking for lush sets and colors and two great stars.
