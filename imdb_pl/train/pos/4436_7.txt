The Tattooed Stranger was another of the rare B films that the BBC2 showed during the Christmas / New Year 2005-2006. See also "Live at night" and "Strangler with Brighton". <br /> <br /> In this, a man walking a dog in Central Park hits an abandoned car and discovers a dead woman inside. She was shot and the police tried to identify her only as a tattoo. Once identified, the murderer is discovered and killed in the shooting at the end. <br /> <br /> Most of this movie has been shot in New York and the surrounding area, so we can see some parts of the city normally we do not see, especially on the back streets. <br /> <br /> The cast has mainly unknowns, and John Miles gets the best bills. <br /> <br /> The tattooed Stranger is worth looking for. Excellent, but rather unclear. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
