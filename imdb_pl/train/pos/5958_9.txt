Unlike some comments, mine is positive. This film wraps around the table with a group of friends, some like it, others do not. A few are related - mother, daughter, son. Their stories are not smooth, satisfied with everyone and everything, kind of life - just like in real life. Some stories do not evolve, they just happen. But like real families and good friends, they stick together. Eager parents who buy a child are such holes! You are happy for the ending. Poor Delmar got stuck between the rock and the boulder, taking care of himself, his mother, son and trying to keep his whole life together. It does not end at sunset, walking around the house in homes, and everyone lives in the world of dreams, but it is a very real representation of people living day after day, month after month. Overall, this is a good story and a great movie !!
