A great movie to watch with amazing scenes and talented actors such as Misa Shimizu and Nagiko Tono. After 15 minutes of watching, your eyes are blocked on the screen and you do nothing but breath in the atmosphere of the movie, waiting for what fate will bring heroes. This movie makes you leave your position as an ordinary audience, takes you, makes you become part of the story ... Costumes and settings are brilliant; especially the okiyas district is skillfully built. It is definitely not Akira Kurosawa, but he still gets a lot from the master, especially the stylistic narrative tells us that we are in a great land that is quite far from the Hollywood extravagance.
