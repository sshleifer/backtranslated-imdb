The sword fight was beyond this world, the fighting scenes were spectacular without the techniques of flying on the wire (until the end), which are too common today. The scene with Chan and Pray was probably the main attraction of the movie. Characters in the attack on the mansion of bad guys were trivial, but the movie is convenient. An injection of humor from Woo. <br /> <br /> The storyline with its twists and turns was unpredictable and exciting, and it was impossible to say who was good or bad, or on which side they were. <br /> <br /> A good sense of surprises and uncertainties. The depth of the story is quite intense in the case of a movie film of this genre and it reaches you in the way most kung fu movies do not.
