A previous reviewer said that exactly. I saw it once, I was charmed, I saw it a second time when it was re-given within a week or two of the first weathering. I still remember some of the scenes. The opening is the beginning of the twentieth century, the war referred to in the title is the first world war. One of the scenes was set in the part intended only for women in public, which was an interesting historical note. The moment when one of the women touches the other is one of my great movie moments. I do not consider it a "gay movie", it is an interesting and delicate love story in which two directors are women. I would like to see this movie again; I would buy this one if it ever appeared on DVD.
