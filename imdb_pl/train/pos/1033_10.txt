Say what you want about the szmaltz. One of the advantages of this movie is that it is not pro-American. It is a morality about the fact that some Americans are called to high goals and how they are fit for it. It is inspiring because it concerns people with a noble purpose. <br /> <br /> For me, the most interesting part of the film is Fanny and David Farrelly (mother and brother Bette Davis). As Fanny says: "We have been shaken with magnolia." In today's political climate, where the president, who shamelessly lied to us and used September 11th to bring out the absolute worst, we characterized the human being, we drowned on at the level of September 11 murderers seeking bloodthirsty vengeance. You can not blame Mr Bush - we finally let him lead us in this direction and even re-elect him after revealing his lies. Now, with complete justification, we Americans are insulted all over the world. <br /> <br /> Today we are watching this film with new awareness: that the Nazis' rise to power in Germany was not caused by the defect of the German character, but by the flaw of people that allows us to rationalize everything that justifies our immoral and shameful acts. I do not compare George Bush to Adolf Hitler. But I pay attention to how a leader can lead us to a frenzy of terror, hatred and hypernationalism to do wicked things. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, a blackmailer who will do whatever is necessary for his own publicity, no matter how immoral, is the most like the leaders of our country, those who support them, and those who support them they buried their heads so deep in the sand that they can not even be disturbed in voting. br /> <br /> A movie like "Watch on the Rhine" reminds us of what we once wanted to be - a force for improving humanity - and that we have it in us to once again aspire to lofty goals. <br /> <br /> Geoff
