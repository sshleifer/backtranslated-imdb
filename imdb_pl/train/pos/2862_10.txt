My comment is generally limited to the first season of 1959-60. <br /> <br /> This great series was one of the first to be broadcast in color, and had a huge impact on convincing Americans that they had to buy a color TV set, which in 1959 was about $ 800, which is now the equivalent over 3,000 USD. How many of us would pay so much for the privilege of watching a program broadcast by a kinescope on a 17-inch screen? I was eleven when the series started and I watched it from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Watching her now, 50 years later, a few things come to my mind. First of all, many feature lines refer to Loch Comstock and the flourishing of silver mining, which dates back to 1859. In 1859, weapons and clothing are mostly inauthentic. (Reductions are not included in the discussion.) It's basically nonsense. <br /> <br /> And it would not be possible for Ben to come to the Lake Tahoe area in 1839 and gather a 100-square mile ranch over the next twenty years. The pioneers were still trying to solve the Sierra Nevada problem in 1847, and the gold rush did not even begin two years later. <br /> <br /> Indians are not played by actors from North America. John Ford used American actors in the 1920s. Bonanza producers could easily do it thirty years later. This is a serious mistake for me. <br /> <br /> There are other problems with the time line. Mark Twain appears in Season 1 and he is portrayed as a middle-aged man. Mark Twain was 24 years old in 1859. Stories also fluctuate in the years 1859-1860 (before the Civil War) and were more appropriate for the timeframe of 1880. Problems with continuity still appear. <br /> <br /> It is also a bit off-putting that in the first season there is so much killing. Over time, killing has been reduced. <br /> <br /> Many episodes take on a socially liberal character, which is hard to believe, considering the timeline, but give the authors recognition for predicting seismic changes in the attitudes of the nation beginning in the 1960s. <br /> <br /> Having said all this, acting is good and I have come to the conclusion that in recent years, Adam's character has been drawn better than any other. I do not think Pernell Roberts ever got the merit he deserved. Also season 1 reinforces the fact that Dan Blocker (Hoss) was a good actor. <br /> <br /> Many stories follow real historical events. The guest stars were interesting. <br /> <br /> It was great entertainment for the whole family, and the series stands out very well in every respect.
