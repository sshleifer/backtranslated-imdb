The film begins with a group of Dead Men Walking peeps sitting in individual cells, waiting for the inevitable encounter with death depicted by an electric chair. <br /> <br /> Then our "hero", called Tenshu, is taken to a chair, and he ... and still ... is "Alive". AHA! It gives him a choice from some terrifying military people who look really cool: Or we'll throw you until we're sure you're really dead, or you can go through that door and take the destiny that might be in front of you. he says yes to option 2, and then the real story begins. <br /> <br /> He wakes up in another cell (very technologically advanced and very large), where he finds another partner from the cell who also managed to survive the electric boogie-ride. The voice in the speakers tells them that they can do whatever they want, as long as it happens in this room. It sounds a bit suspicious, but the two men accept: What else can they do? <br /> <br /> What these two men do not know is that they have been tied together, so they can wake up the inner urge to kill in them. until they decide they should kill each other. Sounds weird? Indeed, but it is a bigger goal for all this. it will not be disclosed, so it will remain undisclosed. <br /> <br /> But do not be afraid, the unknown attracts the viewer to see more of this pseudo-action, because he has a completely different approach to the question: how long can you stand with a man who is SOB and if you kill him to get freedom? <br /> <br /> The first hour basically tries to wake up your interest, it slips away without your knowledge. Then it becomes a roller coaster ride with WILD Matrix fight scenes with a touch of individuality to honor the comic strip that the movie is based on. <br /> <br /> The movie is really special, so special that normal cinemas will not be watching it under normal circumstances. However, the story is fascinating, the music is fantastic, and the actors are doing their (a bit more than others) to make the movie really special. <br /> <br /> If you should be lucky that your movie or movie shop has it, watch it and enjoy the fact that not everyone is trying to make videos from the mainstream to earn huge money. <br /> <br />
