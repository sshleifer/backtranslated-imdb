The performance of every actor and actress (in the film) is perfectly NATURAL, which should be a film action; and the ability to direct is so well served in every detail that I'm never tired of seeing it over and over again. I am surprised, however, that this film is not part of some of the actors and the director, which is a mystery to Attenborough: are they not proud to say that they have made such a perfect, lasting movie for the public? I hope that I will get some answers to my puzzles from someone (probably one of the "competent" film staff).
