I'm talking about it now. Finally, a low-budget horror movie that uses its limitations to its advantage. WENDIGO, although sometimes defective, is the triumph of the imagination. It is really hard to move the EVIL DEAD camera because of its moods, but it is still damn better than 99% directly on the video. <br /> <br /> The story is quite simple: the family has holidays in a distant cabin and is threatened by one particularly clumsy hunter. But director Larry Fessenden really knows how to build up tension and add layers of disturbing creep through the use of the mythical Wendigo. Is this real? Is this all in the boy's imagination? Is it the externalization of the child's emotional state? <br /> <br /> Some say that the movie is unsatisfactory because you decide. Do not be discouraged by such petty nonsense. A movie that makes you think you should not be avoided. It's to be happy.
