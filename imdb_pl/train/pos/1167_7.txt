Alain Delon visits a quick, sure vengeance against a ruthless criminal family who employed him as a hit man in the thriller Duccio Tessari "Big Guns" after accidentally murdered his wife and child. Tessari and scriptwriters Roberto Gandus, Ugo Liberatore from "A Minute to Pray, and Second to Die" and Franco Verucci from "Ring of Death" take this actor for a gunman's career for the mob. Indeed, "Big Guns" is rather predictable, but it still qualifies as solid entertainment with lots of wild and often sudden killings. Alain Delon of "The Godson" is appropriately laconic because he methodically gives death to the mafia family heads who refuse to retire, so that he can enjoy life with his young son and daughter. Richard Conte from "The Godfather" plays a Sicilian criminal boss who wants to bury an ax with the character of Delon, but the rest of his hard-headed companions want the killer to be killed. Like most of the criminal thrillers in the 1960s and 1970s, Big Guns are subordinated to film morality that is not paid for by crime. Interestingly, the only man who has nothing to do with the murder of the hero's wife and son survives, while the other reveals the hero with great prejudice. Tessari does not waste a second in this 90-minute shootout. In addition to the mother and son dying in a car bomb destined for the father, the worst thing that takes place is in the composition of car scrap, when the hero's co-worker is crushed in a broken car. Seemingly, "Big Guns" is a bloodless alternative, but has a large number of bodies to the gangster melodrama of 1973. Only at the last moment does our protagonist free himself, so the imaginary morality of the eye remains intact. Tessari presents a few decent car chases, and don's death in a train riding a railway tunnel is as bloody as this violent yarn. Photography and compositions are excellent.
