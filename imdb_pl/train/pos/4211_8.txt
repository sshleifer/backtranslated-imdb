I watched the last night on television (HBO). I must admit that the tension in this film was unsurpassed by most of the other films from the FN era. I loved the way Chip would be calm in an instant and then TREASURY in the next moment. It was classic. Ahh yes. Dames, villians, cigars and bandits! He has it all. This movie has provided me with all the goods. I especially liked the way in which communism with a story mixes, very common in the movie era. In those days, the popularity of the black list was also very bold. I rate this movie as one of the best I've seen in the FN genre!
