The perfect example of "cowboy noir", as it was called, in which unemployed Michael (Nicolas Cage) loses his job because he insists on being honest (he has a bum leg). He can not really do anything else, he decides that he is lying. When he enters the bar, and the owner Wayne (late, great JT Walsh) makes the mistake of the man whom Wayne hired in his sexy young wife Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle in good shape), Michael plays together and accepts Waynes' money. * Then * goes to Suzanne and informs her about the intentions of her husbands and accepts * her * money to get rid of Wayne! If this does not complicate matters, the real hit "Lyle of Dallas" appears (Dennis Hopper, in a great role), and Michael has even more trouble than before. <br /> <br /> "Red Rock West" comes out of places very often. Director John Dahl, who co-wrote the script with his brother Rick, was clever in realizing the potential of a story set in a truly isolated small town that could see better days and where the people could be involved in any way. It is also a funny idea of ​​the problems that an honest person can face if they decide to abandon their rules and give in to any temptation. It's quite a dark and bustling story with many of the main characters who, if they are not corrupt, at least have been morally affected, like Michael. Lighting by Marc Reshovsky is great in the mood; even the climax established in the cemetery gives this whole morbid quality. Even if writing is not particularly "logical or reliable", the movie has a nice way of intriguing the viewer and simply pulling it directly in. <br /> <br /> Cage does a good job at the helm, but his co-authors have a great old time sinking teeth in their fleshy and motivated greediness. Hopper, Boyle and Walsh have a great time watching these parts. Timothy Carhart and Dan Shor are good as Walsh's deputies (in one particularly good act, Walsh is also a local sheriff), and the role of bimonthly and dwight, Dwight Yoakama, is also fun and also enjoys the final tune. <br /> <br /> It's a pretty good movie worth checking. It moves forward at an impressive pace and if nothing else is ever boring. <br /> <br /> 8/10
