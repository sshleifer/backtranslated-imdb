This film is a classic in every sense of the word. This is very funny and very disturbing. Acting in this movie is well done. The story itself is reliable, full of tension and thoughtful. Character development is also well done, the audience can clearly see how each character is emotionally tested in this movie. The villains in this film are very dangerous, from the first moment viewers see that they are plotting something. This film shows how a man, taken from civilization and in the middle of a forest, in the face of a life situation or death, can slowly become almost as wild and wild as the animals that inhabit him. Not everyone will like this movie, there are many disturbing content that can make some viewers uncomfortable. It is definitely worth to watch. This film is a masterpiece.
