The Straight Story is a story about an old man who decides to visit his sick brother who lives behind the state line. He decides to go on a mower because he can not ride and wants to do the ripping himself. The film beautifully depicts his journey and the life he touches along the way. <br /> <br /> Richard Farnsworth performs a beautiful performance, like the rest of the cast, especially Sissy Spacek in a captivating performance as his daughter, and Harry Dean Stanton in a small but infinitely key role. <br /> <br /> At first I felt that the story of an old trip around the area would be boring, but soon I discovered that Lynch with all the insights about human life makes this film recommend to everyone.
