The film was very outstanding despite the NC-17 rating and disturbing scenes. In fact, such things happen and that's why this movie shows many of them. It all starts with Maya (Rosario Dawson in excellent performance), who recently started going to college, everything goes well. He meets Jared (Chad Faust in an amazing performance) at a frat party that turns out to be a real gentleman and sweet. Invites her for dinner. They look at the stars from the bridge and end up in their apartment. They talk and take her to the basement when they become flirtatious. He tries to put it down, but he rapes her. This incident is scarring her. He goes to a club where he meets a barman / DJ Adrian (wonderfully played by Marcus Patrick), who sees that he gets drunk and helps before he goes far. They take friendship. He also has drugs and Maya also starts using. In other words, he introduces her to another world. He begins to go back to school and work as a TA (Teaching Assistant) and meets Jared as one of the students. While students take a semester, they catch Jared's fraud. Jared tries to smooth the conversation with Maya, but still has the advantage, decides to invite him to his place. Will history repeat itself? Will Maya be surprised by Jared? You are watching a movie. Excellent A. Rosario Dawson presents the role with emphasis and endurance. Chad Faust does not like being a rapist, but he does a great job as Jared. Marcus Patrick is a very brilliant man who saves Maya and trains her in the new world. This movie deserves a reward.
