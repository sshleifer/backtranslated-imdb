One of my favorite films has been "Last Action Hero" for many years; unfortunately, Arnold Schwarznegger decided to spoil my play, becoming a corrupt politician; so now I can not stand any movie he could have a hand in. <br /> <br /> The adventures of Jake Speed ​​are actually toys with motifs similar to those in Last ... Hero; so I was happy to find it on DVD, so I could watch how these things are going so well. <br /> <br /> Despite the "plot in the story" that includes white slavery during the civil war in an African country, this is not an action movie. The plot in which the storyline in the plot is actually related to the question that the movie is not about to solve: Is Jake Speed ​​a real person who helps the heroine save his sister from the slave trader. ; Is it actually a fictional character (which means that the heroine somehow entered the universe, which really only exists in a series of cellulose novels)? I suggest that this is not all clearly stated in the film and that Wayne Crawford and Andrew Lane are well aware of this. The film thus becomes a presentation of what viewers can want from such a fictional universe of "adventure". It is a really rich subject whose potential heaviness is mitigated by the friendly and camp sense of humor of the film. <br /> <br /> There are weaknesses in the film - mainly cinematography, which makes the film look like a TV show. And stimulation sometimes slows down. <br /> <br /> But I really like these characters and I like the adventure they live in, however stupid. And I'm just fascinated by the idea that this adventure really takes place in the novel. <br /> <br /> Maintains many reviews - a good show!
