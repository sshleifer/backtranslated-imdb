Cusack plays his best David Niven, although I do not know if anyone noticed me. <br /> <br /> Seeing this with it in mind, its wonderfully supersaturated "wants to be taken more seriously than Austin's power, but still be fun" to transform an underestimated classic comedy. <br /> <br /> Hillary Duff is doing an over-sex version of Mata Bond with Britney Spears dancing. The writers built a bit of a reverse Oedipus turn into a story - an interesting choice. <br /> <br /> I never knew how reassuring Montel's voice was to this movie ... I think he found a new vocation to make voice navigation!
