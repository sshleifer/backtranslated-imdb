I think this movie was one of Kurt Russell's good films. Kurt Russel is my favorite actor, so I think he is a good actor in every role he plays. But this movie had a lot of action and I know it should be more than 5.6 by 10 meters, but many people did not like this movie. Well, I thought it was good, so I think everyone should see this movie. If you see this movie and like it, I think you should see Back Draft also with Kurt Russell. I give Soldier *** 1/2 with *****
