My friend recommended this film, quoting my vocal and inflectional similarities with Des Howl, the main character of the film. I think I can see this to some extent and maybe a little more, I'm not sure if it's a flattering performance. <br /> <br /> This is a very special work, the only movie that can have something more than just resemblance to a Real Romance, not the content or style of filming or the pace of dialogue (Whale music is just much more, well, relaxed). <br /> <br /> Generally I am a huge fan of Canadian films about music and musicians (for example, I highly recommend Hard Core Logo), especially this movie. He has innocent charm, Des is not always the most-liked guy, but there is something in him which evokes extraordinary empathy.
