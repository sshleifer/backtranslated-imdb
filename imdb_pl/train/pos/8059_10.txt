I just saw this movie at Turner Classic Movies last night and was delighted with the performance of Victor McLaglen: In every sense of the word "tour de force". The atmosphere of Dublin from 1922. It evoked cinematography and production of truly announced techniques used in the best films of the 40's and early 50's. Gaelic. The result of Max Steiner is unforgettable. Like in later films, such as GWTW from 1939, he appropriated folk ballads to give the local color and sense of place and time. John Ford: already in 1935, a movie giant!
