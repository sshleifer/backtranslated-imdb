As someone who has seen and followed Hartley's public work for several years, I think that much of what was once a fiction narrated by real stories has been elevated to obscure philosophical mind games. <br /> <br /> While playing, Fay Grim is another step into Henry Fool's line of thinking, where the film reflects the quality of the object in the film itself. In Henry Fool, the subject is the memories ... In Fay Grim the object is an encrypted memory - which itself is stolen, faked and mutated into something so vague that it can not make any sense - i.e. Script process writing and making movies in the modern era - where most of the hit movies are not much more than combining the past. In the philosophical sense, the point is what Fay Grim is all about. Perhaps the subject of the tragedy is that the shock is now trivial and boring (as indicated in the initial scenes in the publishers' office). <br /> <br /> Given this, many of the best films are lost if I do not understand Henry's character and the meaning of the memories he sought. Henry is a weakly hidden devil, first visiting Simon as a modern Faust etc. Without understanding how tragic Henry's character is, most of the quality of the plot and history of Fay Grim is lost. <br /> <br /> And there are not enough "details" of verbal flashbacks - knowing that the plot of Henry Fool can not match the "feeling" of the characters' quality as in Henry Fool's, I think that for someone who enters this movie is about 10 minutes "so what" answers the highly structured dialog box, and then that's it. <br /> <br /> However, Henry Fool was also my least favorite Hartley's movie until I realized he was angry - rotting and stunned - precisely because Henry Fool's confession was bad ... not just lewd or dirty but inevitably broken. Henry can not even be the righteous villain - and maybe a tragic flaw that makes him the most endearing ... like Gollum in Tolkien's work, Henry is pathetic. <br /> <br /> This does not happen in Fay Gloomy, although Henry's dialogue is perfect. We encounter the fact that the entire movie is constructed as an encryption - a kind of forming a different thread around what ends with another bad story that can be added to Henry's confessions. This is an interesting twist, but one that can not be digested without watching the first movie. Perhaps showing more of Henry would be better than describing the first story's basic story by the publisher - although this plot is not really the first movie - unless someone is an accidental observer. <br /> <br /> Part of the encryption? It's hard to say ... a little disappointed with sexual tricks. Cheesy.
