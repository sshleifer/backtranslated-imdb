I just saw ICE AGE, a very funny and especially good-looking movie. The story is simple but effective, the characters are nice and nicely polished, but what really shines is a digital set design. <br /> <br /> More inspired by traditional animated films than reality, projects give a really, really nice looking world in the amazing use of color. Sometimes the accents of reality break through (especially the water was impressive), but nevertheless it is a fantasy world based on reality. Consideration of a lot of huge landscapes especially helps to minimize the cost of rendering. <br /> <br /> Pixar films shine with technical glare, this shines with the effective use of technical knowledge. <br /> <br /> Enough technical mumble, the movie is fun, family friendly and sometimes just fun.
