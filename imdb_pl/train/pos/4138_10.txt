Another reason to watch this wonderful movie is Florence Rice. Florence who? This was my first reaction when the opening credits appeared on the screen. I soon found out who Florence Rice is, a real beauty who performs a wonderful performance. Like everyone in this catchy team. Since 1939, this is a different time, but this is the charm. It moves you to another world. It starts out as a light comedy, but then it becomes very serious. Florence Rice runs a range from comedy to heroine. She is absolutely delightful, and at the same time strong, defenseless, she evolves from girl to woman. Watch her facial expressions at the end of the movie. She made over forty movies and I'm going to look for the other thirty-nine. Alan Marshal is in Flynn / Gable mode and fits perfectly with Florence. Buddy Ebsen and Una Merkel provide great comic moments, but the real star is Florence Rice. Fans of 30s / 40s movies. Do not miss this!
