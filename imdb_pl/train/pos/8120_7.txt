Things to come is an early sci-fi film that shows the imaginary world or "Everytown" for 100 years. You can divide it into around 4 different scenes or parts. The film stretches from 1940 to 2036 and mainly concerns how the ruler or "Boss" wanted to be able to fly by air after Everytown was bombed and war broke out. <br /> <br /> Only this video has about three errors: its sound is muddy, and the video is bizarre, the characters are not deep at all, and the overall plot is not completely solid. The story lacks something that I can not resist ... it seems a bit "fluffy". But if you love science fiction and you're interested in what H.G. Wells can happen over the next hundred years, this is a must see. It is worth seeing only to find out what everyone feared: a long, protracted war, because they were about to set out on a war with Germany and there was a threat of biological weapons and everything. <br /> <br /> Things to come is a pretty good movie that most people have to see once.
