Spoilery ..... <br /> <br /> I saw the original on TV some time ago and I remembered this production as less engaging than most Beeb costumes. This week I have recorded on DVD again and I still have the same impression. At the beginning it is a good story, but it weakens when the heroine becomes so brave and noble, and when she is ill, she returns to her vile husband, and I am so irritated by her sanctity. I suppose it was the "right thing" when the story was written, and it contributed to the fear, and the woman found it difficult to be independent of her husband because the marriage only made her his property, let alone continue with the lover's scandal, because I expect that many modern viewers would like to see it. However, it is difficult today to get drowsy, especially when this heroine had a strong, courageous devotee ready to defend her against everyone and everyone. As in the movie I am ambiguous. It's well done for a novel, but a bit annoying for today's life. <br /> <br /> The steadfast hero Gilbert was certainly a saint who endured the changing and often mysterious behavior of his ladylove and stubborn self-denial and be so consistently supportive. So I felt very embarrassed that when Helen was finally free to be with him, the script would not allow him more than one minute to fall on himself to quickly hug himself before the appearance of the titles. It was totally funny when we waited all this time for this dripping fondness for an undeserved husband for a decent piece of dialogue and a good hug between the hero and the heroine. Instead, the end was like the creators of the movie ran out of time or finances or simply could not worry about it. "You are here - one minute, do what you can in it, and then cut off when the director wants to go home now ...". I felt completely dissatisfied. <br /> <br /> However, very highly praise for actor Toby Stephens, a perfect and very handsome hero, and Rupert Graves is extremely nasty and self-pitying villain. Tara Fitzgerald was satisfactory as part of a scenario that forced her to be a depressive and rather sacred victim for such a long time. <br /> <br /> He said that I love these classic dramas and virtually all of them are better than most of the modern drama on TV. So 7 stars, because despite the irritation it is still a good watch.
