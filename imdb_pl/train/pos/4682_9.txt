This movie sat on my Tivo for a few weeks before I watched it. I was afraid of indulging yuppie flick with bad relations. I was wrong; it was a fascinating trip to the broken New Yorker libidos. <br /> <br /> The format is the same as Max Ophuls' La Ronde, based on the art of Arthur Schnitzler, who was given a loan inspired by art. It starts with one person, a prostitute, standing at the corner of a street in Brooklyn. She is picked up by a home contractor who has sex with her on the hood of the car, but can not come. He refuses her payment. When he pees, he picks up the cell and receives the message. He runs away with his keys. <br /> <br /> Then the story changes into a performer who pays a professional conversation with a rich, bored New York woman who plays with him until he is aroused and then leaves. He tells him how desperate and unhappy she is; tells her how beautiful she is and is lucky. When he leaves, he asks if he has sex with her. He sits on it, bounces up and down. This time he comes, he goes out. <br /> <br /> A woman and her husband are having a party for their fashionable friends. Hubby (Robert) talks about business, his wife (Ellen) is bored and changes the subject to sex, and how often men and women think about it. The husband changes the conversation to the desert. Later, when the guests leave, Ellen tries to persuade Robert to have sex. Robert does not want this and he records a jazz disc. Ellen turns on the radio; Robert turns on the music; Ellen turns on the television; Robert turns on another TV. Cacophony follows. Ellen goes to the roof, Robert joins her. Ellen says he has to experience more men than men. Robert says he too must experience people. <br /> <br /> Then we follow Robert, who visits artist Martin, played by Steve Buscemi. I would like Buscemi to have more roles in which he is a sexy, wise, completely desirable guy. Robert praises Martin's work, much more than he deserves, he promises to introduce her to the show. Martin is excited, until it turns out that Robert speaks from his groin, it's all a mating dance. Robert tries to kiss Martin on the lips, and Martin pulls away, saying he is not gay. Robert says he's not gay too, sneers Martin. They both admit that the works are bad. Robert will be out soon when Martin lets Robert kiss him. They look around, and Robert goes to Martin. <br /> <br /> Then we follow Martin, who is preparing for the art show in the gallery in Manhattan. He is charmed by the receptionist Anna, played by Rosario Dawson. (I had to cut some of this review to keep it below 1000 words) ... and love each other. <br /> <br /> Then we follow Anna, who is sitting at the booth with dinner. Her boyfriend, Nick (Adrian Grenier), comes in with flowers. He is cold with him; trying to find out why. He tells her that she had sex with someone when he was in San Francisco. He urges him to stay with his ex-gf while in San Francisco and have sex with her. This last revelation turns out to be a lie. They both meet at lunch, but she decides they must break up. Nick is broken. <br /> <br /> And we follow Nick, who confesses his troubles to an elderly woman she meets on a park bench, Joey (Carol Kane). Joey is a bit weird and childish, but he's a good audience for Nick who needs a nice ear. They both walk at Coney Island at night and look at the stars. Nick is subject to Joey's charm, despite the difference in age between them. They return to Joey's apartment, and Nick gradually realizes that he is going to have sex with a crazy old woman. He is above him, he does not want to let him go. But he manages to escape. <br /> <br /> (Incidentally, it's Carol Kane's best role since she played Latke's wife in a taxi). Joey's phone rings, and this man is called Psychic Friends Network, and Joey is one of psychic friends. Although it still hurts from Nick, it gradually falls into her psychic muzzle. The man is in his office late at night and wants to have sex with her on the phone. Although this is not Joey's case, Joey goes on and urges the man to come. I want to keep talking, although the man wants to hang up and he finds out that he has betrayed a lot of money to his company and he will find out about it tomorrow. His life is ruined. Joey realizes that the man intends to commit suicide, and she tries to convince him that he is his friend, that he cares for him. And he cares about him. <br /> <br /> But a man packs a gun into his briefcase and goes looking for a prostitute on the Brooklyn wharf, and we're going back to the beginning to the same prostitute who started La Ronde. He wants to give him $ 75,000 in cash if he kills him. He tried to kill himself, but he could not do it. The prostitute does not want to do this, but he insists, holding her hand, holding the gun in his mouth, telling her where to aim. In the end, the gun fires and we see a prostitute walking down the street and reaching the corner where he normally conducts business. The performer who did not pay her earlier in the film, approaches, turns the window over. They look at each other. END.
