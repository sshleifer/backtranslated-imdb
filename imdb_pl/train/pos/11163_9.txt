I love this free movie! Walsh is a true master of film form, his film was sometimes, in my opinion, overlooked. But this movie is my favorite because it really gives you a sense of time when the movie has been set. <br /> <br /> All the wonderful characters, lifestyle, dressing style, the way they said, OK, they can be exaggerated, but it's good to know that it happened that two men tried to outdo the crazy acrobatics. <br /> <br /> I just felt that every story should be stunned by many people and appreciated because of it. <br /> <br /> Can I get it somewhere on DVD? I only saw it on television. But for anyone who wants a piece of film about life in this period, it's the perfect movie.
