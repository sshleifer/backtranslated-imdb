Michelle Rodriguez is a well-built high school student who discovers he has a powerful blow and starts an amateur gym training in Brooklyn. Santiago Douglas is a handsome young man, barely older than her, who also trains there. They meet after classes, so to speak, and feel attracted to themselves. No sex. Santiago was instructed to save him for the next attack. <br /> <br /> Both of them are participants of the "sex-oriented" sports program, which does not distinguish between men and women, an incorrect attempt to level the sports court. <br /> <br /> He recently announced a conservative radio commentator - and I swear I will not come up with it - "Let's face it, the president is black." I am here to make an equally penetrating observation - "Men and women are different." Now in 99 cases out of 100 this does not have to have any effect on physical performance. But in the top ten - trained athletes whose skills have been perfected - men usually have an advantage. With narrow hips they can run faster. And they have more muscle mass and higher torso strength. These differences in body composition allow women to give birth and raise children, and to men to catch and kill food. This sexual fork is the result of a completely normal process of natural selection. Without him, there would be no people at all. And this, boys and girls, is the reason why they organize men's and women's events at the Olympic Games. I speak to you as your anthropologist. It will be ten cents, PayPal preferred. <br /> <br /> That's why I called this program "blind because of sex" wrong. As a talented boxer as Rodrigues, when he approaches the zenith of the game, he will eventually lose to a man. <br /> <br /> This is the complication in this video. Rodrigues is eventually matched to his boyfriend, Douglas. None of them wants to lose their anger on the other hand, not to mention the rights of the round table, but the pride of both is at stake, and pride is both personal and gender. Douglas refuses to fight the woman in the ring. And Rodriguez is offended by what he sees as his condescending attitude. It ends happily. <br /> <br /> I did not expect much after the film. I thought it would be a rip off of Clint Eastwood's "Milion Dollar Baby" until I discovered that it was released many years earlier. And I have never heard about the director or any of the performers. This kind of ambiguity generally water bad - television cries created for television and so on. <br /> <br /> But I was surprised how elegantly it is combined. The total lack of bath made me open my mouth. Same as minimal use of boxing stereotypes - frayed ropes, blood, cut eye swelling, battered faces after attack, fat and sweaty observer shouting "Kill him!", Slow glove nose landing, trickle of sweat from broken head, heroic music signaling the long-awaited apotheosis of the winner. Nothing here - well, almost none. The entire story can be considered as formal. A difficult child finds an outlet on the ring, etc. <br /> <br /> It remains that this is probably what these amateur jobs are. It differs from the ones we see on television and ordinary movies. For example, the bell does not ring. Instead, he dances and the observant judge yells "Stop!". And "Box!" The players wear headgear. The gym is not filled with the crowd of cheering spectators, but only a handful of people who are particularly interested in these events. This is a clean film, despite the rather bleak surroundings and unhappy dynamics of the family. <br /> <br /> Michelle Rodriguez may look pretty good, what about her muscular mass and eyes glowing under her lowered forehead, but when you get used to the idea that she is a girl who can beat you to the pulp at any time, and when you hear the feminine contours of her supersegment, she is not angry. (The scene in which he fights his father on the floor is exaggerated.) It was a little difficult to understand Douglas's restraint when Rodriguez crawls around him in bed. The director, Karyn Kusama, carefully chose her talent. <br /> <br /> Shows what you can do with some talent, imagination and a little bit of money. There should be more such films. Take one of those multi-billion cinema hits, full of dinosaurs or spacecraft, and spread out some generosity.
