This is one of those films that are difficult to browse without giving out the story. Suffice it to say that there are strange things and unexpected twists of action that go beyond the initial superficial "Tom Cruise wanders with many women" plot. <br /> <br /> The quality of the cast raises the film above the norm and the entire cast fits well with their parts: Cruise as an annoyingly happy playboy who has it all - and then loses everything, Diaz as attractive, but somewhat demented, abandoned lover, Cruz as an exotic new girl on stage and Russell as a paternal psychologist. The story contains elements of romance, morality, murder-mystery, tension and sci-fi, and is generally a fun tour. <br /> <br /> I should add that photography is also uniformly perfect and contains various visual metaphors that are beautiful when you realize what is happening. <br /> <br /> If you like well-recorded videos with swirls and tension and you're ready to accept some fantastic resolution in the style of Philip K Dick, this is a must-have. <br /> <br /> 9/10
