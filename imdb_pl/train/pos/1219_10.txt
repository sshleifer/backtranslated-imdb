The second Care Bears movie is much better than its predecessor. It has a deeper storyline, better character development, and melodies (especially the closing song) are both catchy and warm. Sure, the movie has a tendency to experience stress, but continue, this is the movie "Care Bears". This movie is a great photo to show to children because it emphasizes friendship, love and care once more. Not to mention carers that are simply too cute!
