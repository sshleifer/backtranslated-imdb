Even if you know absolutely nothing about Ireland, you must love "My Left Foot" (especially the performance of Daniel Day-Lewis). Game Christy Brown, suffering from cerebral palsy. For this reason, he spent most of his life in a state of foreclosure. Even trying to warn people about something, they just laugh at him. The light in the darkness is such for him that he has control over one part of his body: his left foot. He uses this additive to paint and write poetry, leading him to rank. <br /> <br /> Daniel Day-Lewis and director Jim Sheridan did a great job in this cooperation, as well as in the subsequent cooperation: Father "(but" Boxer "was unnecessary). "My left foot" can make you feel in many ways: sad, hopeful or something else. But in any case, Daniel Day-Lewis gave a presentation of his life here. Great movie in every respect.
