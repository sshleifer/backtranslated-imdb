Shintarô Katsu, best known from the films of Zatôichi, re-appears in the third and final film in Kenji Misumi (known mainly from "Lone Wolf and Cub"), directed by Hanzo "The Razor" Itami with a huge dicked ninja fighting, throwing "ghosts" "And discovering suspicious events in the Shogunate vault. Hanzo's "story" became a bit musty and repetitive. What was once a novel in the first film was gone. Fortunately, this one was better than the other thanks to more humor. I'm glad that they decided to stay on one trilogy (I look at YOU Lucas) <br /> <br /> My Grade: B <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Normal trailers for all 3 films. Hanzo the Razor <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Aoi Nakajima releases both tits, Mako Midori only her left
