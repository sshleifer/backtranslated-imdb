Last night I went to sleep with gf, and when I was brushing my teeth, I turned the canals until I came across this Chinese movie called The Mask King. At first I thought it would be a Kung Fu movie, so I started to watch it, and then it immediately caught me and I had to finish it. <br /> <br /> The girl in the movie was absolutely adorble. She was such a great actor that she was so small. Maybe the fact that he was in Chinese, so English was named, which made it difficult for me to speak ... but she really seemed to be perfectly in character. I felt so bad for the girl that she tried to please her "boss", but everything turned out to be rotten. lol. Even when he brings him another grandson, so that he can hand over his art ... it turns out that the kid has been kidnapped, so he is arrested and has 5 days of life. lol ... whatever he touches, trying to be nice to his grandfather, he just turns around. <br /> <br /> In the end, he sees how much love he has in her and teaches her the art of masks, which is just so warm after all the tricks in the movie. <br /> <br /> Definitely a jewel and completely original. <br /> <br /> Scott
