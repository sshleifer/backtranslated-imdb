I only had to be 11 when Mr. Peepers started. It was a necessity for the whole family, I believe in the Sun. nights. Repeated gags were Rob opening the locker (he had to use a ruler or indicator to check the right place on another cabinet and do a few other things, eventually kicking the door where he would open) and pulling out the pins from the new shirt at the beginning of the episode opened the package with a new shirt and for the rest of the show he found one pin for the other he missed to unwrap his shirt, the timing was everything, and the pins had lots of laughter.) I remember the aunt who ran Rio like Jack Benny and always wanted Sonny to say something scientific. He would think and invent a "semipermeable membrane" or osmosis that would make her say how brilliant he was. (you had to be there). Marion Lorne stole the program every time she was on the screen. Why did not they continue the series with her POV, when Wally gave up (he was afraid he was the type, but by then it was too late) I will never know. I saw somewhere that the first TV wedding (anyway big) is Tiny Tim in the TV series Carson. Horsehead. It's Rob and Nancy (have I ever had a hot one for her) and I remember they made the TV Guide cover and got the press in all newspapers and major magazines. The trip to the Museum of Broadcasting in New York many years ago was disappointing because they had very few episodes then, and they may not be anymore. I still remember it as wonderful and I would like to be a little older.
