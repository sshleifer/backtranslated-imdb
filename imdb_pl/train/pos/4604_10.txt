This movie is no doubt an excellent 10/10 .. for all people who rate this movie at a low level because there is no "good story" or anything like that, it's ridiculous to say that Jackie Chan's movie is bad because of his The plot is like saying that the porn movie is bad because there is no story! you watch Jackie Chan ON FIGHT, because the action focuses not so much on a good story, or something like that, if you look at how it creates movies and compares them with other American films from that era, and even later you will realize that films by Jackie Chan they had the best fighting scenes and not very good intrigue, while American movies had good storylines, but shitty action scenes compared to what Jackie Chan was doing at the time. Pornography is watched for porn, Jackie Chan is watched for ACTION, I think people judge it wrong because there is no plot, because you think a wise movie critic will judge a good movie, but the way I see it is a good movie is a movie who can entertain me. Sure, the middle of the movie was boring, VERY EXCESSIVE, but put it in such a way that the rest, which is all action scenes and acrobatics, pays for it very much. It changed the way the American action movies were created, they even have scenes from this movie. If you want a real man, a real artist, then watch this movie and many more of Jackie Chan's works, it's clean. It literally makes American movies look like a walk through the park and even in today's movies. American films rely so much on special effects and safety cables as well as double stunts and many more. Police Story and many other Jackie Chan movies are works of a real artist who just goes out and is very talented in what he can do. masterpiece
