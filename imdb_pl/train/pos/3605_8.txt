girlfight uses a well-known formula, as someone noticed, but I have seen many movies that do not do it so well or which are not so reliable. I believe that in the end it's easier for a woman to get into a character and to feel more affected by the movie. <br /> <br /> the film is encouraging both mentally and physically, even if your life and surroundings were completely different and I think that the viewer can still gain a lot by seeing this. although starting boxing and sports took me 5 years, this is the movie that gave me a spark. <br /> <br /> so the plot is familiar / shared. the actors are good. but thoughts that can spark a spark are, in my opinion, above average. it made a big impression on me and I know I'm not the only one.
