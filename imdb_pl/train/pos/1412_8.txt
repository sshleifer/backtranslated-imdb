Why the hell is it worth exploring the hypnotizing nature document "Earth"? How much time do you have on earth, so I can explain it to you? OK, I will not extend my exploration of "Earth" to infinity, but I have to rely on why it is "must see". In the documentary, natural migrations are carried out in three animal families: a polar bear and her puppies with a story of a father's bear's life, who dared to hunt for food on an isolated path, a whale mum's whale takes a whale from a prey trip, and a mother of an elephant with your small (maybe not as small as elephants) offspring migrating in Africa. Directors Alastair Forthegill and Mark Linfield did the work "off the ground", also gaining the ability to survive many other species of animals in addition to the magnetic shots of our three protagonists from the animal family. Richard Brooks film team Burton, Mike Holding, Adam Ravetch and Andrew Shillabeer are skilled cinematographers in the camera capturing the wonderful places of nature and animal instinctive behavior; not to mention that slo-mo animal shots were obtained. "Earth" is also a lesson for the student about the impact of global warming on animals; The polar bear dad in the doctor is a poster boy with this consequence. So colleagues of landowners, it's time to make a documentary trip and visit "Earth" today! **** Good
