In Christian Duguay's film "Hitler: The Rise of Evil" Hitler's early years of life and politics are successfully shown, with a few minor historical errors and a certain exaggeration. It is quite natural that a Hollywood movie contains such things because the main goal of production is the income they will receive from the movie. Although such errors may disappoint some audiences who think that everything should be done through the book, I think that most of them fit well with the rest of the movie, which makes it more interesting. We should not forget that this film is not a document. Who cares how his dog died anyway. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, Hitler is depicted as a mentally unstable character who very easily gets angry and is very passionate about his ideals. But he was not portrayed as a super-villain, but more as an ambitious politician. I think it is a nice prospect because the film is not polluted by a lot of negative emotions, and this makes the film somewhat objective. Yes, he was a bit angry, and his methods were rough, but he was still a man, not a completely crazy character depicted in the Inglorious Bastards. I believe that thanks to this the film has become more realistic, even with some inaccuracies in historical facts. <br /> <br /> The flow of history is nicely reflected by the viewers. Although the film focused on Hitler, we also had the opportunity to see what is happening in this country as a result of these activities through newspapers, discussions of people and songs in the Jewish cabaret. Also, the public reaction was reflected in the film, but it was very limited. The fights of journalist Fritz Gerlich and the ironic plays played in the cabaret were fun and interesting, but that's all. Mostly we saw only his followers raging in the streets and cheering. <br /> <br /> Another thing that was lacking in the movie is information about the origin of his hatred of Jews. At the beginning of the movie some ideas are given, but they were quite superficial. Suddenly, he was a politician who made speeches about the necessity of exterminating Jews. <br /> <br /> In summary, Hitler: The Rise of Evil can not be considered an excellent movie that will appeal to everyone, but it is not unsatisfactory. If you can take the lead of directors who change their history for cash, it is an interesting film that reflects Hitler's personality in a successful way.
