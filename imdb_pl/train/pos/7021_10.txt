I had the pleasure to participate in the The Pacific and Eddy show last weekend at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. This movie caught my attention a moment ago when I came across an article about it in the Jalouse magazine. It seemed interesting then but nothing exciting. In any case, I saw it in the festival program and decided to check it out. All I can say is that I was speechless when the loans started to end. This is one of the most beautiful and refreshing films I have seen for some time. Photography, art direction, acting, and especially directing, were fluid and impeccable. In this movie, nothing is "written out" for you and actually makes you think. Something that most of today's movies do exactly the opposite. Dialogue is carefully refined and although this script is not talkative, the characters' words are very thoughtful and meaningful. <br /> <br /> It's definitely one of those movies that deserve the second watch and the more you see, the more things you notice. It's a very layered and intelligent movie. I'm not sure when and where to play again, but for movie enthusiasts, they have to decide.
