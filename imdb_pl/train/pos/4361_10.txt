It was probably one of the best-made films of the 1940s - Warner Bros. at the very top of your style. Sol Polito's photo is probably his best achievement - great compositions and lighting with delicate shading. Max Steiner brings one of her most complex and beautiful scores - the epitome of the classic method of the theme. Music adds excitement and thrill to the plot and is unique and unforgettable. It is interesting that the same production team that made the film began to produce "Now, Voyager" in the same year - a great movie that won prizes and awards and was considered a historical favorite, because it played Bette Davis . In my opinion, "The Gay Sisters" is a much better film - better made in all departments and more interesting, complex and pleasant. The most unusual film that entertains those who take it for what it is, and does not design its own modern creative experience or their advanced and demanding standards of hypercritical perfection. Every thing must be judged on the basis of its own time references and what it tries to achieve on its own terms. Most of the complaints I have read in these reviews are so childish and completely overlooked. If you're hungry for a perfect filet mignon, do not go to the bakery counter and start moaning and complaining about the down cake. The art of film criticism is really lost in a large part of the population. I'm sorry - maybe if this movie had a Rolling Stones score and hundreds of intricate and complicated threads, you would all be satisfied. I will take an old film without modern intellectual claims for the day of the week!
