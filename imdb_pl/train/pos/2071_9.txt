For those of us, Baby Boomers who came too late to the stage to appreciate James Dean et. al., Martin Sheen showed us The Way in this great feature. <br /> <br /> The assumption is quite simple: a nice hood meets the sheriff from a small town, and All-Hell arises, but the quarrels of this movie delight the car in all of us. <br /> <br /> No, this is not Casablanca, not great literature, but it's a serious movie about cars, rebellion and genius like Martin Sheen. <br /> <br /> Enjoy it and appreciate it for what Martin is and what he will become. I loved this movie to grow up as a teenager in the '70s and you too.
