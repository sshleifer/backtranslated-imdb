I know it's primitive and I know it's not on PC at all, but it's so funny. If you can look at it from the 80's perspective and bring with you all the stereotypes from that time - and the movie still makes you almost laugh - it's really a good comedy. Continuing the tradition of comedy for thousands of years, the subject matter of this film is exaggerated. If you can suspend your political correctness for an hour and a half, just to laugh completely, then please look at it. <br /> <br /> P.S. If anyone could put it on a DVD, it's so hard to find it on VHS.
