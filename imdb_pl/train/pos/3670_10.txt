I rented this movie on DVD, not knowing what to expect - and because I'm going to learn to film all places in Canada, I'm sure I'll talk about it in class. <br /> <br /> A story centered around probably the most unlucky movie team in the history of the film itself, it is wonderfully written, and very talented actors are able to deliver every pun on time. <br /> <br /> If you just can not laugh at "Hollywood North" I suggest you visit a psychiatrist right away - you can have serious problems. <br /> <br /> In addition to the great screenplay, I also noticed great chemistry between actors Deborah Kara Unger and Matthew Modine - where do they really just play? Jennifer Tilly (playing a fun bad actress) and Martin Landau also released a very sharp but entertaining performance. <br /> <br /> A great movie, an even better cast.
