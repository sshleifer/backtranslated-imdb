A great movie, full of great, subtle game and sharp, intelligent dialogue. What really sets this film apart, however, is the current of sadness. History is accentuated by matters, loneliness, suicide, disappointment, fear of losing a job in a world that had catastrophic consequences. First of all, he was placed in a world that no longer existed, it was torn apart at the beginning of the Second World War. In fact, the film is not a comedy at all, if you compare the percentage of serious scenes with comic scenes. It's funny, though, - listen to Jimmy Stewart's disregard for Margaret Sullivan and watch his painful expression, replying that her comments were an unusual mix of "poetry and meanness." It's funny, pointed and sad at once. An amazing achievement and one of the top ten comedies on the screen.
