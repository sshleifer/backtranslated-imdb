Simple comment ... <br /> <br /> What can I say ... is a great movie that I can watch over and over again. This is definitely one of the top ten comedies. With a great cast, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, who wrote the perfect script by Neil Simon, based on his art. <br /> <br /> This is a real life situation made perfectly. If you have a digital cable, you will get a menu at the bottom of the screen to give what is included. It usually gives this movie ***% of stars, but in fact it deserves **** stars. If you really watch this movie, you can say that in one hundred years it will be so fun and fresh.
