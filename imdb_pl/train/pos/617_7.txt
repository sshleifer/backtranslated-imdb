Greetings from the dark again. This one will be compared to "The Princess Bride" and although it does not fit this classic, it is extremely funny and well made. The plot is a bit strange, and the whole thing with the wall is never really explained, but the performance is okay, even reinforcing the strong tension. <br /> <br /> Charlie Cox plays Tristan, who falls in love with the wrong girl (Sienna Miller) and agrees to bring her a fallen star ... which by chance is played by the dazzling Claire Danes. Not much tension on what is happening with these two, but the tense part comes with the wicked witch played by Michelle Pfeiffer and the son of King Peter O'Toole, who want to get back the ruby ​​necklace that our "star" is wearing. Many bad pursuits for good. <br /> <br /> On the way, meet the most bizarre pirate you'll see (including each of the Caribbean). Robert Deniro plays Captain Shakespeare - it's hard inside and we'll tell him in touch with his feminine side. The next meeting concerns the genius Ricky Gervais as a fast talking entrepreneur and it is good for a few laughter. <br /> <br /> Not a typical chase, adulthood or fantasy film, but director Matthew Vaughn's ("Layer Cake") effort deserves to be an audience. Unfortunately, a poor marketing campaign will probably prevent her from earning money. My guess is that it will be a great success on video.
