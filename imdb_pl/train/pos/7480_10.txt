This film is one of Tom Cruise's best films. He captures the imagination of the audience with his role of David Aames. His character may somehow refer to us all. The plot is very clever and keeps the audience on the edge of the whole movie. I've never really watched Cruise movies before, but after watching this shows me my real talent. My favorite part of the movie is the end, in which everything ends with a great discovery and discovers the truth. If you have not seen it yet, you should definitely try it. This is one of those movies that you just need to see until the end when you start watching, or you will think and regret it. In my opinion, you should just buy and risk what I've done and become one of my favorite movies of all time. This is A * 10/10 I promise you that when you look at it, it will keep you and you will like it.
