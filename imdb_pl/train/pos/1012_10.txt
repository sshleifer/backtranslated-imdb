Stargate SG-1 is a kind of spinning from the movie "Stargate" from 1994. I am very happy that they decided to develop the topic. The show begins to roll from the first episode, retired Jack O'Neill must go through the gate again to meet his old companion, dr. Daniel Jackson. In the first two episodes, we meet Samantha Carter, a very intelligent person who does not allow anyone to walk on her, and there is Teal'c, a calm, compassionate warrior who opposes his false god and joins the team. <br /> <br /> The main bad guys are called Goualds, they are parasites who can get into the brain, controlling them and doing bad deeds. Every Gouald who has a huge amount of power is often considered a "System Lord." The warriors behind Gouald are called the Jaffa who hold the parasitic Gouald in their bodies until Gouald is put in the brain of the person. <br /> <br /> Throughout these episodes, we mostly meet SG-1, an exploration team made up of Jack / Daniela / Teal'ca / and Sam, passing through a wormhole that immediately transfers them to other planets (this device is called Stellar Gates) and encounter new cultures or bad people. Some episodes are in the world, which means that they do not go through the Stargate once in an episode, but rather deal with burning problems on Earth. <br /> <br /> During all these years, the SG-1 team's fall begins to notice as a close connection and more story-building characters. This in turn means even more episodes in the world, which is perfectly understandable. <br /> <br /> My Rating: 8.75 / 10 ---- While most of this program is good, there are some examples of history that are not always packed and put less emphasis on the journey through the gates in the last few years. But still the highest-class science fiction!
