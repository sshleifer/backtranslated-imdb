It could not be rewarded at the academy and it's pretty bad, but it's just great fun! Nothing makes me smile like Bill and Ted. Beloved, optimistic and funny, Bill and Ted are a great way to relax. <br /> <br /> Although I love the perfect adventure, Bogus Journey is more fun to me. Death is fun, and Bill and Ted are even more engaging. People give me sadness about the love of this movie, but only truly pretentious movie watchers will say that it is not even a bit funny. If you like it, you'll probably also be a fan of Wayne's World, Dude Where's My Car and Dumb and Dumber. Admit it, though stupid, make you smile and twist your inbox. So watch them only for kicks and giggles !!
