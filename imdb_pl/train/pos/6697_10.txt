I remember seeing Sabrina for the first time when she came to UK television on ITV1 when I was 13/14. I am 24 now and I still love her now as when I first saw her. I get a small baton from my friends for still watching the "kids show", but I do not care! lol Caroline Rhea as "Hilda" is my personal favorite character, and Later on Morgan has also become my favorite character. I remember that I spent so much time watching various special events honoring Sabrina at the Nickeleoden UK TV station. I love Mellissa Joan-Hart, she was great at Clarrissa Explains All, but much better at it. I was gutted when they decided to finish it! I hope that soon it will be released on DVD here in Great Britain - I will be the first in the queue! lol x
