A long time ago I watched the film from the inside on the cable. Then I fell in love with Mary Moronov. I saw her again at Eating Raoul. I was convinced that she was the hottest woman on the screen. <br /> <br /> I may have avoided this movie. 9 from 10. <br /> <br /> This is the only movie I have on the original tape.
