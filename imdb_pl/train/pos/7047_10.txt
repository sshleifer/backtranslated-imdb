this movie must be seen. the truest picture of what is happening in the world that I have seen since Darmin's Nightmare. Go see him! And if you're lucky to open them in your city, check them out on the big screen instead of on a DVD. Writing is sharp and the direction is good enough for ideas to appear, although they are not perfect. Joan Cusack is amazing, and the rest of the cast is good too. The inspiration is that John Cusack made the film and I think he had to use his own money for that. It's a crazy, absurd ride, of course made without the resources she needed, but it still works. Jon Stewart, Steven Colbert, SNL, even Bill Maher did not show the courage to say what the movie is saying.
