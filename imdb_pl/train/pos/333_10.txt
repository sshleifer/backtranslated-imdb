Honestly, this series is just as classical (like television), as the original poem for world literature. Far from being brazen exploitation, it is a beautiful and respectful message of one of the texts defining Western culture. <br /> <br /> I was moved by the difficult situation of Odysseus and his supporters; moved with the tragedy of the fall of Troy (which was felt but invisible); intrigued by the way the gods enjoyed the fate of mortals. (It should be mentioned that the gods appearing here are not funny CGI creatures flying on the wings of the ankles or poorly planted bikini models. Like Homer's work, they act through mortal agents or, rarely, are represented by classic statues). <br /> <br /> It is a pity that it is not available on DVD, especially considering the much worse and poor Odyssey adaptations that can be found in video stores.
