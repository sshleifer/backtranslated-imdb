In fact, the film has a fairly good history, but it gets stuck in a few key places. It's almost as if the director threw the film together, without spending time making major changes to the film. Dennis Quaid does quite a decent job in his role ... but something is clearly lacking in a few key scenes. <br /> <br /> This 2.5-hour movie could be reduced to about a 2-hour movie. And it would probably be a much better movie if he did not feel like he was thrown together. <br /> <br />
