This one stood out with its originality. I am seriously tired of watching Hindi movies that are the real work of a whole range of Hollywood and British movies. Some disadvantages were inevitable, but this film is mandatory. Surya's presentation of a clean, conscientious policeman (in contrast to those who do not have too much money, hungry that we normally see) was amazing. He has come a long way from his work at Nerukku Ner. I liked the film so much that I had to own it. Usually I do not deal with films about thoughtless violence, I felt really real for every character and that's why I can not call it "mindless" violence. I do not appreciate the excessive melodrama and sentimental scenes that go hand in hand with most Hindi and Tamil films. I really liked this movie because it is not the same. ACP Anbuselvan's reaction to the loss of his wife is not exaggerated, it is painful and makes me want to scream. There are times when I watch a movie when I want to press the FF button. Many times I wanted to do it in the cinema room. I never wanted to do this while watching this movie. I really hope that Ghajini will be released soon.
