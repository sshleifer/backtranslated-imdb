Honestly, I was surprised when I read some of the comments on this work. Some were looking for a story ?? OK, when this movie was released over ten years ago, I watched it as a collection of music videos. This is not a movie. There is no plot or central plot. It is rather an artistic anthology of films mostly of a long form, all of which are quite elegantly or creatively made. Michael Jackson may be considered a weirdo nowadays, but in the end he was the man who gave us Thriller (considered by many to be the greatest music video of all time) and set trends with Billie Jean and Beat It. Together with Moonwalker, he and the filmmakers and artists who collaborated with him once again set out for music and dance movements to create vivid, fun things, including claymation, special effects, live material, and even auto-parody ( "Badder" sequence). And for those who are wondering what Joe Pesci was doing there, this movie appeared a little before it became a home name, and was one of his most memorable performances in the movie. And, IMHO, I think the Smooth Criminal sequence (choreography section) beats everything that Michael Jackson has done so far!
