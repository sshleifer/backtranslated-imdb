I've seen this movie on several different occasions. I think that one of the funniest things to do is simply watching the reactions of different types of people who want to see it. <br /> <br /> Type 1: OLD PEOPLE. Many old Japanese men and women are choosing this film because they think it will be a film of honest samurai with lots of fencing and medieval Japanese dialogue. As soon as the two heroes start debating horror stories, while in their sentences they put in curses, the old people leave, usually disgusted. <br /> <br /> Type 2: SNOBS FILM. These people think that just because the film bears the label "Independent", it will automatically be a load of hard to follow, overly emotional nonsense that may or may not be in English. However, they still see it in order to sing about it later, so that people will think that they are intelligent and cultured. They are really surprised when they see this movie. As soon as the blood begins to exaggerate from the inspired anime battles with a sword or an unholy black dog, nonchalantly immobilizes the dog with a crossbow during a telephone conversation, these people will be so scared that they will leave. A few will remain just to see "how bad it will be", and later they will be amazed at how awful the movie was for their friends. <br /> <br /> Type 3: PEOPLE EXPECTING LIVE VIEW OR SPECIAL EFFECTS OR MATRIX-LIKE. Unfortunately, martial arts are quite solid in the film, but director Yamasato really has no budget for this kind of thing. <br /> <br /> Type 4: PEOPLE WITHOUT WASTING. These are people who really like this movie. Regardless of whether they only heard about Blood of the Samurai, they chose him accidentally, or they came across the wrong theater in the alcohol fog, they are people who will laugh at all the jokes and appreciate the film, which ultimately is: ENTERTAINMENT. This film was not created to enlighten or provoke a deep spiritual thought, that is (if I can borrow a dialogue line from the movie) to "really kick the ass". And that's what he does. <br /> <br /> So depending on the type of person, you may or may not enjoy this movie; However, if you value a movie for what it is and you can enjoy excess blood and acting, go to this movie and take your friends with you.
