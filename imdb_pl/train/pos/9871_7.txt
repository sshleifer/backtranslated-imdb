Return To the Lost World was filmed back in The Lost World version of 1992. <br /> <br /> In this continuation, the same five people, led by Challenger, return to the plateau, where the group began drilling for oil, which threatens to destroy the earth. Gomez has something to do with this. They manage to overcome the drills, and the plateau is saved, to the delight of the natives. <br /> <br /> As in The Lost World, every few dinosaurs we see are made of rubber, including T-Rex and Ankylosaurus. <br /> <br /> John Ryhs-Davies and David Warner are again playing the roles of Challenger and Summerlee, and three other actors are also back. <br /> <br /> Despite reading a few bad opinions on this subject and those cheap, rubber-looking dinosaurs, I liked Return to the Lost World. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
