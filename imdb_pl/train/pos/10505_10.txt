Yes it's true. I strongly believe that the N64 and the strange-looking controller have been designed to create this game. It was amazing the first time I saw him, with his huge environments and colorful characters, and he is amazing now. Game control is perfect, the graphics are beautiful and have the charm of Nintendo, which is always so elusive, but undeniably. It must exist for every N64 owner and reason to get N64 for everyone else.
