I must admit that I went to Fever Pitch with low expectations. It is not a big revelation for me to say that Jimmy Fallon's (Taxi) last movie was bad Catwomanly, and Fever Pitch trailers were okay, but they did not hypnotize me. I've prepared a few bad baseball puns for my review ... <br /> <br /> "I like Jimmy Fallon, but Taxi attacked him in his film career. Well, now we have steeeeee-riiiiiike twoooooooo! One more blow and came back to SNL! or "Buy yourself peanuts and crackers, but do not buy tickets for Fever Pitch. You will leave the theater and you will never come back! "Then the movie had to be more entertaining than I expected. But hey, I could not let my puns be wasted, right? Another reason I thought I did not care about the movie is that I hate Boston Red Sox. My whole family hates them. Just mentioning Pedro Martinez's name makes me run to the bathroom. Oh my, wait ... <br /> <br /> ... All right, I'm back. Anyway, my mother who is a fan of St. Louis Cardinals, still believes that the World Series was faked last year. He does not want to believe that Sox won it legally. But I'm enough of a man to admit that Fever Pitch made me sympathize, albeit only slightly, with the fate of Red Sox fans. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has a passion for sports will be able to refer to this film on a certain level. If you do not have a favorite sports team, you can not fully understand the extreme ups and downs that a fan like Fallon's Ben can go through. There is nothing as fresh as the smell of the new season and nothing as smooth as a clean slate. Well, figuratively speaking. It is the joy of being a sports fan. "Wait until next year", becomes your mantra, your motto, your prayer - and Fever Pitch effectively reflects this essence. <br /> <br /> I love the fact that the movie has a storyline and throws it against the real life of the unbelievable World Series Run last year. I do not love it so much that I want to marry it, but you know what I mean. I expected it to be treated in a rather shoddy way, and though a bit of humor is a bit stupid, it is quite realistic. <br /> <br /> You see, Uncle Ben took him on his first Red Sox game when he was 7 years old, and when he died, he left Ben with two season tickets. Ben has not missed the match for 23 years. At the beginning of each season he has a working day in which he and his friends meet to find out who can go with him. He makes everyone dance in the Yankees games, and when someone complains, he threatens them with tickets to the Royals games (sorry Mr. Shade) and Devil Rays. It's a very good scene that works so well because I know people who are making an "admission ticket". I must admit that I can refer to this when Ben goes to dinner with Lindsey and her parents. The Red Sox play a road game, but instead of watching it live on TV, Ben decides to record it. One of the most dangerous things in life is to record the game, and then publicly share and try to avoid the result. I was there. It is a very tense and frightening situation. Weeeeeell, Ben enters the danger zone when a guy appears in the restaurant and remembers watching the game. Ben immediately covers his ears and starts yelling like a banshee, not to hear the result. Lindsey is embarrassed and her parents do not know what to think. Yes, sports fans can be weird, I do not deny. But this is real. <br /> <br /> Now, if you're expecting the crude, harsh things the Farrelly brothers are known for, you may be disappointed. But they have their moments, like when Ben says he likes, as Lindsey sometimes says on the side of the mouth "like a charming victim of a stroke", but overall it is definitely a softer, romantic side that the bros set. <br /> <br /> I do not mean that the movie never gets too unhappy. Fortunately, when the juice starts to pour a little, Farrellys know when to retreat. A romantic moment with Lindsey jumping in the field and running up to Ben to declare her immortal love for him, turns into Ben sincerely answering: "You must tell me about the field. Is it spongy? "Jimmy Fallon proves that thanks to the right material he can do well on the big screen, and Drew Barrymore remains the constant source of romantic comedies. Fever Pitch is just good, solid entertainment, which looks a bit fresh in the genre of romantic comedy. This is a film that boys and girls can relate to. Especially the guys who at some point practice sports fanaticism and ladies who have to deal with them. <br /> <br /> Now, if Red Sox fans could close on the subject of "Curse of the Bambino" And I would be grateful. My Memphis Tigers have NEVER won the NCAA basketball championship, so I officially declare my situation bigger than yours. <br /> <br /> GIST Fans of Jimmy Fallon, Drew Barrymore, romantic comedy, Red Sox, baseball or sports fanaticism should consider Fever Pitch at all. I would not go out of my way to hurry and see him in the first available time, but he will do great matin√©e. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3,25 (out of 5)
