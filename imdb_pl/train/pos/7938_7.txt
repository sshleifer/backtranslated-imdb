Rob Estes, Josie Bisset and a lot of kids who do not look like any of them. <br /> <br /> Basically Rob and Josie have a wedding with a rifle on a drunken night while on holiday in Vegas. Each of them returns home to see that their children are already married because of tabloid non-forage. They, Rob and Josie, take them and their eight children to one or the other home. <br /> <br /> Rob, I think, is building furniture that is close enough to the construction work of Frank Lambert (Patrick Duffy), very similar step by step to guarantee eternal mockery. <br /> <br /> Josie is a kind of queen making cookies, though she does not seem to make cookies. Not close enough to Hairdressing Carol Foster (Suzanne Somers) to guarantee ridicule of similarity, but ridiculously ridiculous to guarantee cruelty. the names of someone else, or at least those that assume that if they are serious enough in a relationship to make a joint journey. <br /> <br /> Either way, there are eight children; Moira, Sandy, Jeff, Lily, Daisy, Nathan, Andrew L. and Andrew B. Personally, I think they should just call the younger Andrew 'Andy'. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of placement products, especially for soups at hand (which is disgusting) and Listerine pocket packages. There are also some stupid, senseless moments. This is also not a great movie promoting happy families. <br /> <br /> But, hey! Rob Estes! This ends my review of 'Step By Step ... on some really bad drugs'. Watch him for Rob Estes and his beautiful eyes! There are some great nice photos!
