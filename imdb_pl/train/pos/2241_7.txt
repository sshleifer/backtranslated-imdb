Another comedy about a plucked small country fighting through the jungle of the modern (in the 1940s) global world with the only native joke and a jerk to lead them is a great entrance to the Ealing cannon. Terry-Thomas shines as usual at the head, as the clumsy man in the service led to the edge of the catastrophe, when the nation who is supposedly responsible for the start attracts interest in the world, Ian Bannen makes a great romantic role, Peter Sellers introduces one of his quieter performances as corrupt politico and uber-kind John Le Mesurier plays against the type as a rugged revolutionary leader. Everyone has fun, especially the viewer; perhaps not at the very top of the Ealing classics, but quite high.
