Story intelligence is more or less as light as a feather. But the advantage is the classic refusal of a boy and a girl whom we get used to in "The Gay Divorcee" and "Top Hat" is now absent. Instead of a typical accidental acquaintance, the dancing duo are former lovers Bake Baker and Sherry Martin, who are still in love since the dance. <br /> <br /> Of course, being the music of the 30s, there are problems misunderstood romance, classic courtship and a slight irritation of the sabotaged interrogation with bicarbonate soda cost Ginger something special. And then, in the great tradition of dwindling finances, there is nothing better for the best Hollywood artists than putting on a show. <br /> <br /> Great numbers from Irving Berlin are sprinkled throughout the show. The best hats and evening dresses are saved to the very end, which remains a refreshing change. Fred and Ginger set off again to charm the world ... and charm the jacket. Everyone and everything once again is so nice. <br /> <br /> Pure classic stupidity at its best. But with Astaire and Rogers, we only know that it works. <br /> <br /> Score: 8.25 / 10
