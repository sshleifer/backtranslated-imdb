I thought it was a very funny movie. I love movies with dogs and comedy movies, so they were twice as good together. K-9, k-911 and k-9 PI are my favorite movies. Jim Belushi is hysterical, and Jerry Lee is cheerful and charming, they make a great team. The only downside is that I really did not understand how Doole's wife died. She died before this movie, but how? If they said it, I had to miss it. In addition, I lift two thumbs / tails! These dogs (Jerry Lee and Zeus) had to have a lot of training. They were so funny and all the sounds that Jerry Lee made when Dooley talked to him were so funny. My favorite was when Jerry Lee sang and when he bitten serial people to get the information very funny lol
