I watched the first series with enthusiasm, but I wondered if I would come back after a long break. However, I tuned in to the first episode in the series 2 and got hooked again. It's really great television; groundbreaking things, such as Mission: Impossible in the 1960s. The characters are well rounded and develop at the end of the series, they change when they adapt - some easier than others - to a new environment, but they are deftly in character, yet it is more than possible to feel sorry for someone you would not think about that you may feel sorry when something really crushing happens to them. I hope there will be many years of "Lost" that we are waiting for - and I really do not mind if I never get an answer to all the secrets!
