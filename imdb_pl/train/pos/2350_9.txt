I certainly shamelessly enjoyed every episode of Pushing Daisies this season and I hope that the writers' strike will not end brutally the beginning of a very good show. Ned is a confectioner who owns a restaurant in the middle of the city and has a secret talent. Emmerson is a private detective with his own unique idiosyncrasies, such as his love of knitting. Charlotte (Chuck) is once a dead but no longer a childhood friend and a sunny place of Ned's life. Olive is a jealous but good-natured waitress. Oh, and add a dog. Jim Dale brings all the characters along with his wonderful narration of the show. Chuck, Ned and Emmerson along with Olive, and from time to time, the dog solves many murder mysteries with the help of Ned's special gift of bringing the dead back to life. The play is fun, clean and romantic in a very sweet and good way, and I recommend it to everyone.
