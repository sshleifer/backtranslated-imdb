It takes a while to get used to the nebraska location of Nick Nolte before we can easily accept him as a famous intercontinental playwright. When you pass the bar, it becomes a fascinating story of a man who loses everything, trying it well. <br /> <br /> Nolte, an American, moves to Germany, marries a famous actress and is a satisfying success in every respect until the war breaks out. He is visited by the cheerful American John Goodman, who persuades him to accept the position of an anti-Semitic radio broadcaster for the Nazis. Nolte has no policy, but he thinks the challenge is to write a role that is almost impossible and then play it. Another American secret agent will modify Nolte's radio scripts - inserting a cough, sneezing - that will serve as a code for transmitting intelligence to the Allies. But there is a catch. No one will know about the true role of Nolte as an American agent except Goodman, Donovan and Roosevelt himself. If he is ever discovered, the Americans will refuse him recognition. <br /> <br /> Nolte is moving forward, and his malicious transmissions are very popular in Germany. His beloved wife, Sheryl Lee, does not know anything about what is happening, nor does she care. Nolte and Lee live in what he repeatedly called "the nation of two." The war is over and trouble begins. He was captured by Americans who are bitter about his betrayal. They beat him and left him in the mud. He was rescued by Goodman, his "wizard godmother," who sends him to an anonymous existence in Greenwich Village and sends him some cash from time to time. <br /> <br /> By 1960, he manages to maintain friendship with his neighbor, painter Alan Arkin, who also lost his family and claims that they now belong to the secret brotherhood. But its location and identity somehow leak and is more or less adopted by a group of ancient Aryan racists - led by a dentist and priest. His house front and mailbox are painted with swastikas and accusations. He was defeated by the former GI. But - miraculously - his beloved wife was returned to him by the ancient Aryans. Another catch: it turns out later that it is not his wife, but rather her younger sister who loved him from his teenage years. <br /> <br /> It ends when he wrote his memoirs in an Israeli prison in 1967 before the trial of crimes against humanity. This is not a happy ending. <br /> <br /> Nolte can talk to the resident of the cell above his prison. It's Adolf Eichmann. Eichmann seems nice enough. He advises Nolte to write for fifteen straight hours. "It is important to relax. You must learn to relax. " Nolte laughs loudly and yells: "That's how I got here." The film is full of such ironies. At some point in their free conversations Arkin tells him that "after all, I still think that people are good in the heart." I do not know if the movie was a commercial success, but if it is not, then there is something that could have torpedoed it for the younger audience who have never heard of Anne Frank, let alone the supposedly final statement in his diary. <br /> <br /> The fact is that it is a film for adult and adult patients. History is moving slowly, there is very little violence, there are no car chases, there are no shootings and people do not seem to be subjected to manic speech pressure. Many of them will probably pass viewers who are not open to a deliberate approach. Nolte refers to the relationship between the war and his wife as the "nation of two". It's quite a concise statement. No doubt anyone can come up with a certain definition, but you need some concentration to capture her emotional import. <br /> <br /> This is the story of a man who loses everything - his ability to write, his identity, his wife (twice), his only friend, his country, his self-respect. At some point, he stops walking on a crowded New York street and just stands there until dusk, when he is moved by a curious policeman. The reason he stopped is because he simply has nowhere to go. What Vonnegut describes is far more than depression. I do not want to sound condescending, but it is a feeling that is difficult to understand in my youth. Young people can THINK that they know what Nolte is holding in one place, but it really requires maturity and an accelerated sense of finitude that can only bring maturity. <br /> <br /> Remember Robert Frost's line that the house is a place where when you go you have to take you? Well, no place will take Nolte.
