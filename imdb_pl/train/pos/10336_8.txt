This one is difficult to see - as the previous reviewer says. It's amazing, considering the terrible movies that appeared just after World War II - especially the "liberation" of Dachau. It is clear that from the middle of the war, we knew exactly what was happening with the Jews. The sequence that shows "transport" is alive, almost like on the basis of an actual chronicle (the Nazis liked to record their atrocities). Knox as a Nazi is a genius. It shows the course of the Nazi career. This graph is especially eloquent when contrasting with the reactions of other Germans, initially laughing at Hitler, then in disbelief and finally helpless. This contrast, however, allows us to believe in the "conversion" of one young Nazi officer to an anti-Nazi position. It happened as a witness to several attempts against Hitler, in particular Staffenberg's plot, which took place when the film was revealed. A strong film, effectively using flashbacks, accurately predicting Nuremberg and other routes that took place after the end of the war.
