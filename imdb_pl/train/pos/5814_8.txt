Along with all that is happening at the moment with MJ, I started listening to his music, watching a strange document here and there, watching The Wiz and watching Moonwalker again. Maybe I just want to get some insight into this guy who in the eighties thought I was really cool to decide if he was guilty or innocent. Moonwalker is partly a biography, part of a feature film that, as I remember, I saw in the cinema when it was released. Some of them have subtle information about MJ's feelings about the press, and the obvious message about drugs is bad m'kay. <br /> <br /> Impressive visually, but of course it's Michael Jackson, so if you do not like MJ, you will hate it anyway and you will find it boring. Some may call MJ an egotist for permission to make this movie. BUT MJ, and most of his fans will say that he did it for the fans, what if he is really kind to him. <br /> <br /> The actual movie bit function, when it finally starts, takes only 20 minutes, disabling the Smooth Criminal sequence, and Joe Pesci is persuasive as a psychopathic ruler of drugs. Why he wants MJ to be so bad is beyond me. Because MJ overheard his plans? No, the figure of Joe Pesci is furious that he wants people to know that he is the one who delivers the drugs, etc. So I do not know, maybe he just hates MJ's music. <br /> <br /> Many nice things about how MJ turns into a car and robot and the entire sequence of Speed ​​Demon. In addition, the director had to have the patience of the saint when it came to the shootings of kiddy Bad, because usually the directors hate working with one child, not to mention the whole group performing a complicated dance scene. <br /> <br /> In summary, this movie is intended for people who like MJ on this or another level (which I think is the most popular). If not, stay away. Trying to convey a healthy message and ironically, the best friend of MJ in this movie is a girl! Michael Jackson is really one of the most talented people who ever loved this planet, but is he guilty? Well, with all the attention I've devoted to this topic ... hmmm well, I do not know, because people can be different behind closed doors, I know for sure. He is either an exceptionally nice but stupid guy or one of the most sickly liars. I hope it is not the other one.
