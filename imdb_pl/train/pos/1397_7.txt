"Shore Leave" is usually an average adventure in Star Trek. However, nothing wrong with this episode. I just think that it is not the best representation of what the program had to offer to the fans. It is light, funny, nothing more. I am glad, however, that this type of television program has enough sense to break away from serious intergalactic conflicts. In this episode, Kirk decides to release his crew, and land scout is sent to a planet that looks like the perfect place for a holiday. As usual, the planet is not as calm as it seems. There are moments of action and tension, but most of the story takes place with laughter. Good, but not everyday.
