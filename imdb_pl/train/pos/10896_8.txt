At first, I did not think that Ben Affleck could really make a funny Christmas movie, boy, that I was wrong, my daughter invited me to see her with her and I was not disappointed at all. James Gandolfini was funny, I liked Christina Appelagate very much, and Catherine O 'Hara was good as well, the plot is what really sold me, I mean, too weary family, at the table for people who can barely see but once or twice in And you probably need as much alcohol as you have the system to deal with Christmas, so I thought the assumption was good, buying a family of $ 250,000, was a bit far away, but it turned out that it works quite well for me, because it was a whole riot, it shows the class struggle of different families. has many funny moments, including embarrassing things on the computer for a teenage boy. All in all, I loved this movie and I will watch it again on Christmas day or earlier if my daughter wants it too.
