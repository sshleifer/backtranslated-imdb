Although this movie is somewhat filled with cheese of the eighties, I have space for it in my DVD stand and I do not know why. I think I like it because the moral of this story is: "television is rubbish, so turn it off and go and get life." For those of you who choose to listen to the news, you should try to read a book, it's nothing like a movie. To ruin this at the end of the story, the deadly wounded Richards ends up breaking the plane in the network building, killing himself, everyone inside, and simultaneously closing the net. I read it many years ago, but today it would be difficult not to compare it with 9/11.
