A brilliant portrait of a traitor (Victor McLaglen in an Oscar-winning spectacle) who is pursued by his own conscience. McLaglen plays the IRA rouge, which betrays its leader to collect the prize during the Irish rebellion Sinn Fein. Scenes showing the mafia fights and actions are very realistic, focusing on the desperation among individuals. Lack of hope for a better future seems to be a fate worse than death. <br /> <br /> The director John Ford excellently creates a dark and tense atmosphere, reinforced by a foggy and dirty representation of the Irish landscape. Dramatic music by Max Steiner adds film pleasure. Oscar winner also for the best screenplay, nominated for the best film. This is one of the Hollywood classics.
