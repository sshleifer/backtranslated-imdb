Again, Stacy Peralta is true above all for people who have lived this story. Letting those who deal with the genesis of the great wave surf, tell us your stories, how they felt and what they think, you get the feeling that you were there. The film carries you from the 1950s to the nearest, focusing on three major architects contributing to the evolution and development of sport. Honest "home movies", such as films of yourself and their contemporaries, bring you into the world. Layers of music, culture, technical information, a clear picture of participant's athletics and magnificent images of the great wave gain the full perspective of this aspect of surfing. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing exactly.
