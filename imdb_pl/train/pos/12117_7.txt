Although this movie caused Davis to be on the map because of her incredibly intense performance as an illiterate waitress guttersnipe / prostitute Mildred Rogers, this movie is strangely unsatisfactory for me as a whole. Acting is okay in every way. What I can not understand for me is how or why Phillip, a sensitive, well-behaved young man, will take on the constant abuse that this wanderer constantly gives him: in some respects, his na√Øve tolerance is ridiculously unbelievable. Yes, I know he is a sensitive club player, a closed intellectual. But Davis is such a poisonous witch that no one who has cultivated would tolerate her attitude or actions and would not make it credible. Davis is amazing in her role: yes, she may occasionally overdo her histrionics, but it is a vivid, creative portrait of everyone you look at. It is a pity that she did not play a gangster. Her character would be completely credible as a tramp among the low!
