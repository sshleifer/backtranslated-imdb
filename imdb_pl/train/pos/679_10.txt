This supernatural thriller by Peter Weir is truly one of the most fascinating and fascinating movies I've ever seen. Richard Chamberlain performs his best performance as an Australian lawyer who defends a group of young Aborigines accused of murder. As he approaches the matter, he discovers more about the main accused, Chris, and himself. Chris tells him that he is Mulkurul, who seems to be a race of supernatural beings who lived in Australia thousands of years ago. At the same time, extraordinary high rainfall seems to confirm the Aboriginal prophecy about the arrival of the LAST WAVE, the one that will drown the world. <br /> <br /> Sequences of dreams and supernatural effects strengthen this movie and make it a spectacular experience. Olivia Hamnett and David Gulpilil have solid supporting roles, as well as a person with a difficult name who plays Charlie, an old Aboriginal who can turn into an owl. The climax and ending do not fail, unlike many other supernatural thrillers that fall after a promising hour. However, you can not call it a pure thriller. It is also a drama and speaks of spirituality and spiritual identity in the modern world. Master work by Peter Weir, a master of visually stunning dramas.
