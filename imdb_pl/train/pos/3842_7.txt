Sometimes a surreal thriller that will push the buttons of most people. The Fourth Man certainly offends anyone who has a penchant for politically correct. The hero of this story is a bisexual Catholic alcohol writer, Gerard (Krabbe), with a seriously distorted sense of imagination. Verhoeven offers <br /> <br /> Gerard has an example of everything that is wrong with a modern man. He is unable to work, he has delusions, he is unable to control his desires, he is afraid to engage in meaningful relationships and completely apathetic to life in general. <br /> <br /> As the hero himself states at some point, he is a professional liar, unable to remember the truth. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Gerard's dream of spiders engulfing Christ, and then waking up to start a long march to his own destruction. He chases <br /> <br /> one man (presumably a boyfriend), and then chases another at the train station. Later, during the lecture, he meets a woman who thinks he wants to help him, or <br /> <br /> maybe he has more evil plans ... He quickly catches Gerard in her network, encouraging him with sex and money, having lots of both. He also has secrets <br /> <br />, like three dead husbands. Is she lonely and really looking for someone who could care for her - or is she a mortally black widow who lures Gerard to his death / death? Will Garard be the fourth man he will kill? The woman is Christine (Soutendijk), and Verhoeven does everything to guess what he intends to do. <br /> <br /> This is an interesting movie, with lots of sex and intrigue. It is similar to Verhoeven's <em> basic instinct </ em>, but it has much more depth and is certainly more shocking. There are many very strong gay content, which can force some viewers to make a spike. I highly recommend for fans of intelligent psychological thrillers <br /> <br /> or anyone looking for something completely new.
