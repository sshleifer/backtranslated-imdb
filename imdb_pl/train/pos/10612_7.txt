It's cheesy, scary, disgusting, but it makes it so funny. It has more than melodramatic moments that are just ridiculous. This movie is great for jokes. Rent her for a good laugh. <br /> <br /> The movie focuses on three female presenters, in front of mobile phones. They go to a small town to attend the festival, but they can not get a room for the night. And then they'll meet Ernest Keller. It is terrifying in a psychological way. And he proposes that they let them stay at home. But he does not tell them the truth about who lives there. <br /> <br /> Stephen Furst is as amazing as "The Unseen" that he really wears this movie. Most of the movie is boring, although discovering the truth about the Ernest family is quite interesting. <br /> <br /> Just watching this cast in these scenes makes it worth looking at. Barbara Bach and Doug Barr make nice sweets. <br /> <br /> I consider the film an old jewel, difficult to find and worth seeing.
