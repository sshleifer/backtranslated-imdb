This Night Listener is better than people generally say. It has weaknesses and it seems that there is no doubt about the species identity crisis, but I think that the terrifying atmosphere and intriguing performances make up for it. The whole thing looks like one of those fireplaces "it happened to my friend's friend". One serious complaint about the film is stimulation: but slow and sometimes uncomfortable stimulation is deliberate. Everything that is happening in this movie is well maintained in reality, and real life is just something like that? So there are no brilliant endings or groundbreaking revelations, no showdown scenes. Thanks to the heavens. While watching this movie, you have to get into the zone, forget about your reservations and expectations about what makes the movie (conventionally) good. Williams is not great, but he easily meets the needs of this story, and his character is supposed to be a bit generic ("Nobody"), just like Everyman, an avatar that makes us enter history. Toni Collette's performance should be nominated for an Oscar (even if it should not win). Try it. For the quality and content, The Night Listener is certainly in the top twenty films that will appear today.
