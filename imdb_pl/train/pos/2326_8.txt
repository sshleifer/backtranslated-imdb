Dani (Reese Witherspoon) has always been very close with her older sister Maureen (Emily Warfield) until they both fell in love with the court (Jason London). But it is not after a terrible tragedy that the two sisters realize that nothing is able to separate them and that their mutual love will never disappear. <br /> <br /> It was a really painful story about the first love. Probably the most painful story about the young love I've ever seen. All acting is amazing, and Reese Witherspoon gives a great performance in his first film. I would give The Man in the Moon 8.5 / 10
