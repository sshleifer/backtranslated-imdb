I understand that this film is a feature debut and as such is very impressive. He has a sense of real indie, but director Todd Yellin clearly has a photographic and editorial vision, command and evaluation of a mature and experienced professional. Shots are well-framed and thought-out and are used to move the story forward. He and screenwriter Ivan Solomon present a story that has much more depth and lyricism than typical "paint by number" scripts. This is a story that requires Judd Hirsch's talent to have a chance to work. Judd is fantastic as usual; like Scott Cohen and the beautiful Susan Floyd. The real surprise, however, is Elliot Korte, who plays Adam Groden. Yellin was able to draw nuances from the young actor in a role that could easily be devalued by stereotype or exaggeration. In any case, the film was refreshing and entertaining.
