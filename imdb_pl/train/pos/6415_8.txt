The drama of TIllman Jr. about the first African diving navy (Gooding Jr.), which opposes all adversities and achieves its goals despite the severe embittered trainer. The screenplay is not bad, sometimes extreme, but direction and acting are paramount, and this film is inspiring and achieves what it should do. I liked DeNiro at the helm, although he can not match his masterful works (taxi driver, godfather and everyone else), he is as good as his other good performances, such as King of Comedy or Angel Heart. DeNiro is always a convincing and credible, very good performance, Gooding Jr. He is not angry, definitely one of his better performances. --- IMDb Rating: 6.6, my rating: 9/10
