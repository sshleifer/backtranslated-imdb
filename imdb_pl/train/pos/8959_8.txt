Although I agree that this is a good but not great movie, for many reasons that other posters have mentioned, I still like it. One of the reasons is the music: I would like to draw attention to the very nice look of the Candola brothers - Conte and Pete - on the well-staged scene in the night club. These guys were the two best jazz trumpeters of their time and they managed to convince the mind of Jimmy Stewart, playing a hysterical trumpet duet, one trumpet in each of Stewart's ears. Candolis played really well, although I suspect that the real music for this scene was later named by them. I do not know much about George Duning who has earned recognition for the music (except he seems to have worked with Three Stooges on more than one occasion), but the cast of Candola brothers as jazz warlocks was a really nice accent.
