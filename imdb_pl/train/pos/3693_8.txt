Creating a movie with 18 different stories is not easy. Although the challenge was taken by 18 different international directors, not every one is good, and some are even boring. But in his essence "Paris, je t'aime" is breathtaking, showing that, as he put it "Love Actually", "love is everywhere", especially in the city of love. Here is the resumé (I will try to make as much as possible) from 18 different stories. <br /> <br /> MONTMARTRE - a kind of boring opening sequence, nothing really special. The man finds a parking space and sees many strange couples walking around, wondering why he can not find a girl. And suddenly a woman faints next to his car ... <br /> <br /> QUAIS DE SEINE - another boring sequence, about three teenage boys who are looking for some "piece of ass" when suddenly a Muslim girl sets off right in front of them, getting help from one of the boys. Really basic, but with a sweet heart. <br /> <br /> LES MARAIS - it was a huge disappointment! Although the love story of two boys with an artistic background could be interesting for the great Van Sant. Ultimately, everything that comes AFTER Ulliel's monologue is good, everything before him is simply annoying. <br /> <br /> TUILERIES - a funny sequence of brothers Coen. Buscemi - even without saying a word - is hypnotizing, and the whole sequence is simply fun. This keeps me to the end, and this also makes you really addicted to the movie. <br /> <br /> LOIN DU 16 - A beautiful story, even if the execution is weak, the heart is there. This is the story of a Spanish woman who leaves her early in the morning to take care of another suburban child. Beautiful. <br /> <br /> PORTE DE CHOISY - this segment must be the weirdest and the weirdest of the whole movie. A shampoo salesman arrives in a Paris-like place in Chinatown. If I understood it correctly, the story is about inner beauty, but I think I'm wrong. <br /> <br /> BASTILLE - a really great sequence. A man meets his wife in a restaurant to break up with her so he can escape with his lover. But my wife has some devastating news. Quite simple, but really sad and beautiful! PLACE DES VICTOIRES - a sad sequence. Juliette Binoche plays a pathetic mother. One night he wakes up hearing his dead child. When he reaches the place, the cowboy tells her that he can give his farewell to his child. One of the best segments! TOUR EIFFEL - two love mimes could be great, but even though it has cool movie tricks, the story is not intriguing and not fun at all. <br /> <br /> PARC MONCEAU - a truly original and great sequence, one of the best movies! A young girl and an older man are discussing their future and fear for a man ... Cuaron is doing great directing work, and the actors are amazing! QUARTIER DES ENFANTS ROUGES - an American actress (Gyllenhaal) falls in love with her drug dealer. a beautiful segment again, with a very sad ending of PLACE DES FETES - a woman comes to a homeless man, begins to talk to her romantically ... because she is the love of his life. Beautiful, sad, shocking, romantic ... Place des Fêtes will make everyone cry. <br /> <br /> PIGALLE - boring sequence between Ardant and Hoskins, who are looking for new emotions in their relationship ... very indigestible and unromantic, Pigalle is a disappointment. <br /> <br /> QUARTIER DE LA MADELEINE - bringing some variety in the film, QdlM is a relief. A young boy (Wood) finds a vampire killing a victim ... A tourist and a vampire ... fall in love! The dark, terrifying and strangely romantic Madeleine is great. <br /> <br /> PERE-LACHAISE - another segment of the competition. Directed by Wes Craven and the stars Mortimer and Sewell, he could have been great, but Père-Lachaise is simply ordinary, not original. <br /> <br /> FAUBOURG SAINT-DENIS - the rumors are TRUE, Twyker's short film is beautiful, stunning and well made. The blind man picks up the receiver and hears from his girlfriend (Portman - really stunning) that he breaks with him. He wonders about their relationship. <br /> <br /> QUARTIER Latin - although this segment was co-directed by Depardieu and has such stars as Rowlands, Gazzara and Depardieu, this segment is also disappointing. Nothing happens, no chemistry between actors. <br /> <br /> 14. ARRONDISSEMENT - the last sequence is both happy and sad. The American tells in her French class about her trip to Paris. Her French is really awful, but at the end of the episode she realizes that Paris is much more than at first glance. <br /> <br /> With Feist on the background ends with "Paris, je t'aime" in a sweet tone, not disappointed, although some segments bored me, the essence of the movie is great! A real movie experience for young and old. Paris, je t'aime vraiment!
