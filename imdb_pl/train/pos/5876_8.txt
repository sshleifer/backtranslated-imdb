Now I really liked this movie, it was so funny. Both Akshay Kumar and John Abraham are wonderful actors, I think that after watching this movie they should make more films together in the future. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar gets himself into trouble, meeting three women at the same time, but the way he manages when someone comes out of the door, and then the other was so funny that he watched, He was really good in his film and I hope that in the future he makes more great comedies, John Abraham plays his best friend, he plays his role really well and is so unappreciated that I'm happy that some of his amazing works have been noticed, but he is really good actor. I just love John, Neha Dhupia plays a small role in this movie and it's a good game. <br /> <br /> Muse is really good, I really recommend this movie to everyone.
