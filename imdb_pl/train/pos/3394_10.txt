I watched this movie by accident, I bought it as a B page on the Omega Man DVD. Omega Man was a bit disappointed - except for the beginning, which was clearly an inspiration for 28 days later, the rest are just TV movies. But Soylent Green is in a whole other league. I bet it's one of Tarantino's favorites. There are at least 3 scenes in the movie that I've never seen before. Heston casually goes to bed with "furniture", discussing something completely unrelated! A whole crowd of people have picked up a fleet of mechanical diggers! Priest confessing and being shot by a confessor. Ok, maybe it was like that - but there are not many films that are so coherent and original. And what is happening with Heston and Edward G. Robinson? Is this the most unlikely homosexual couple or what? Fortunately, I saw this movie without knowing the ending - which is evidently rare. Then I looked at it again and enjoyed all the little clues that make the long early scenes worthwhile. Very nice script - and some great sets. Just when you thought you saw everything. . .
