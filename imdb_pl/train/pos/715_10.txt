Everyone who sits here saying that the weak link to this movie is Ramones, they would probably say that Amadeus was okay, if not for this annoying harpsichordist. Rock and Roll High School focused around the Ramones. If anyone can watch this and not get out of Joey Ramone eating bean balls behind the scenes trying to keep him in good condition, he's obviously a daddy-square blanket. Mrs. Trogar, exploding white mice, patrols in the lobby ... immediate classics. Never think about the character of Riff Randell. <br /> <br /> If you do not like Ramones, you do not know rock and roll and you do not deserve to watch a movie called ROCK AND ROLL High School.
