After the slow start BRUCE ALMIGHTY is a very funny movie that had something positive to say. It was not one of Jim Carrey's best performances, but he was still fine. Morgan Freeman was right about God. Jennifer Aniston had some good moments. I miss Steve Correll in "THE DAILY SHOW!" <br /> <br /> I like the choices of director Tom Shadyac's films. He also did LIAR LIAR, PATCH ADAMS and PROFESSOR NURSE. In all three, Bruce Almighty takes a big comedy star and tells human history with him. A director who knows a comedy can acquire talent that can and can tell a sensible and intelligent story is difficult to find. <br /> <br /> My biggest complaint is that they should have used more biblical references. I remember only three specific biblical references and these were the three funniest parts of the whole movie. My guess is that the first few sketches of the script had more biblical references, but they were cut because the producers were afraid of offending people. It's a pity, because I thought it was a missed opportunity. <br /> <br /> My class: <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
