I really liked this movie. I thought that the plot of the film was realistic and appropriate for the period in American history. There is always a woman who does what she has to do to climb the class system. I feel that Lilly's character was correctly presented and could not be better done. What I liked best when she realized what love really is. Throughout the movie, all the men who fell for her were in love with her, gave her everything, even lost her career. Until she met Cortland, she did not understand why these men gave everything for happiness. The way her life ended was far from what she had expected. I recommend this movie to every mature audience so that you can understand the content and the hidden meaning of the movie and the story.
