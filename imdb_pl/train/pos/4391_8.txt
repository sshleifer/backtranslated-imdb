You are waiting for the remake is better or worse. I rated Audie Murphy's film as 3 (I am a severe grader), the second lowest that I gave Audie (the worst was "Battle at Bloody Beach", if you're curious). I give this film an "8" rating (and I'm a severe grader). This is a civil war history of renegades of "soldiers", if you want to call them that, against the North. People like Quantrell and the people who traveled with those outlaws. <br /> <br /> The original was a watery version, a very clean cut, and at the same time it presented the horror of what these people did. In fact, movies like the older version are best viewed by a mature audience who can see the story. I would be more inclined to evaluate the original "R" and this, with its rough nature, GP, because the newer movie gives a very honest version, a message more easily decrypted by a minor than an older version. <Br /> <br /> Since the early sixties, film makers boasted of "realism," but few of them provide it. Instead, they simply add gray scenery, gray costumes and gray events, but with cartoons of stereotypical characters, the weakness of the spaghetti age. <br /> <br /> Contemporary filmmakers realized this error. This is seen in the higher style of the West that we usually see today. This movie is an example. It gives realistic settings, but also gives us characters in which we can believe that it exists in that era. <br /> <br /> He has several downtime, which makes him sit down a bit hard and has some unexplained situations. But unexplained situations are fine as long as the whole movie is held, and the characters are intriguing enough. <br /> <br /> It starts out a little camp, but it really improves. The main character is one that we can identify, or at least sympathize with him. The character of the early film Audie Murphy really does not arouse sympathy and is too fair without motivation. <br /> <br /> The character in this movie follows the lines of a real antihero. There is motivation and the method of his madness. We never feel that it is really "right," but we can understand where it comes from. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of actions in the movie. There is also a bit of humor. A good scene is that the heroine tells the protagonist that he is not lying to him, and wonders about it. <br /> <br /> This movie manages to do what filmmakers have been trying to do for decades. This team of directors and writers was right. <br /> <br /> Recommended. Total success.
