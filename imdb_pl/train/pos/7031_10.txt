It's a great movie, I made art some time ago. It had an extra jump ... to it. I loved Vanessa Williams as Rosey, and Jason Alexander has a good voice. It was great. The setting was also very good. Except that it is 2 hours and 50 minutes, it makes it quite long. Overall, I give him 8.5 stars. They also added a few parts, but it was still fun.
