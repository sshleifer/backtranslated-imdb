When I saw this movie for the first time, I was with my dad. He encouraged me to watch this movie because it was one of his favorites. After watching the movie, he immediately became one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> River Runs Through There are two brothers, each of whom takes a different path of life. Norman Maclean (Craig Sheffer) is the older of two brothers and is on the path of education. Paul Maclean (Brad Pitt) is a rebellious younger brother who travels along a path full of obstacles. The film follows these characters because each of them follows its own path. <br /> <br /> This movie has no minus. You will be entertained all the way. Acting, direction and screenplay are perfect. Two unique things are pictures and a score. Both of these events will trap you in the world that Robert Redford creates for you. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie to be a classic. It is certainly in my book. If you have not seen this movie, watch it as soon as possible because it will stay with you forever.
