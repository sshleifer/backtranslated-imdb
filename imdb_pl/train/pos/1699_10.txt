This is a jewel of the film not only for people who like funny and quirky rooms, but who love the history and traditions of science fiction and classic Hollywood movies. Every alien of the Mars crew is the embodiment of a classic science fiction hero or member of the Hollywood royal family, and it's a pleasure to watch them bounce off each other and the residents of Big Bean.
