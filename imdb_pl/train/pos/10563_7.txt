Wow ... what ... whirlwind. The 1930s is a decade with lots of movies of every kind that I can imagine, especially in the early talk phase. There were films painfully static and boring, like "Dracula" with Bella Lugosi, and there were some that simply do not give him peace, sometimes in a good way, and sometimes not. This is one of the films that do not stop for a moment, and this is both a miracle and a pity. Lloyd Bacon, who also directed "42nd Street," had to be the king of musicals from the Depression era, and was probably excited about the possibilities that the cinema brought to the world because it filled the picture. It can not be a full minute or two without music or someone who speaks. This is completely crazy! I thought the movie deserves 5 (or 6, top), because the stimulation was very weak because it was incredibly fast and sometimes I did not know what was going on and what to think. The characters seemed to just run back and forth, talking about things that did not interest me, and probably no one else. I thought that I would be rewarded with a small headache. I noticed that Lloyd Bacon also cast the main role in "42nd Street", Ruby Keeler, and "42nd Street" was a movie whose ending was the best part. And you know what? The same happened with the Footlight Parade! The ending is absolutely amazing! He became the most impressive musical I have ever seen. The last part presents us with a few music numbers, and these are, believe me, something that makes it worth seeing the rest of the movie. The numbers are impeccable! There are three large pieces, and the most impressive is certainly the second. Suddenly the screen was filled with a beautiful and ingenious camera, beautiful people and ordinary entertainment that made me forget about my little headache.
