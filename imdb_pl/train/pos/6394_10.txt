Carl Brashear (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) was born among tenants in the south. He joins the navy and tells his father that he will come back. His father gives him an old radio and Brashear leaves the sailor's bus. The most valuable thing that his dispassionate father taught him was "Never give up". After the recommendation of the white commander Powers Boothe, who admires his urge and courage, he is sent to a diving school in Bayonne, NJ. He bears harassment from his colleagues in uniform and from his coach, the chief naval diver, Billy Sunday (Robert De Niro), and from the commanding officer called pappy (Hal Holbrook, who "has almost as many loose screws as the old one "Everybody wants to drop him, and the prejudices are very violent." Danger of diving is another failure when he loses his leg because of an accident on board. Sunday (now both have joined in compassion for their sufferings), are training, and he is able to become the first black naval diver with his artificial limb, despite being skeptical about a very mocking and dubious captain at the interrogation in the Naval Department in Washington to Determine if it meets the criteria, an inspiring movie showing that determination can overcome any chances .
