I remember seeing this movie on TV a few years ago and did not pay full attention, maybe even missed the first half, so I came to the conclusion that it was boring and overvalued. I decided to return to him last night to see if I missed anything the first time. Certainly yes. This is one of the most disturbing and amazing movies of all time and clearly influenced today's films and will probably remain forever. I can not believe that I thought this movie was boring! <br /> <br /> Young Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds present their careers and are supported by Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox. This story will leave you with a sense of disgust and fear long after you look at it, it's really scary. Oh, did I mention that the theme song is also great? Well, this film should also be watched by cinema fans around the world. <br /> <br /> Everyone should see this movie to experience it. Just do not expect a picnic.
