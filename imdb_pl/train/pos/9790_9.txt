Although the center is a melodrama, or rather at the bottom of the movie, the story is told beautifully and subtly, and the acting is wonderful. <br /> <br /> Yaara, studying at Princeton, returns to her native Israel for the funeral of her oldest and beloved friend Talia. Because Yaara practically lived with her friend's parents after the death of her own mother, she lost her adopted sister. And because Yaara, blind from birth, was led and watched over by Talia, her friend's suicide is as unbearable as it is inexplicable. <br /> <br /> Inevitably, a blind girl is the one who decides to solve the mystery of death. Although without eyesight, he has insight. Although he can not see, he is able to find what is out of sight than the "normal" people around her. In this way, the film becomes an absorbing secret when Yaara looks for clues in her memories of her relationship with Talia, in her adopted family's home, in the cassettes, diaries and people in the past and present of Talia. <br /> <br /> The film's viewpoint from Yara is also seen from her point of view, because she visualizes what she hears, believes and imagines. The solution to the mystery is rather conventional, but the search is carried out with such subtle care, and the answer is so beautiful and without a fanfare that the moment of pat is easily forgiven. Truths appear gradually, but inexorably, explaining not only Talia's life, but also her relationship with Yaara. Tali Sharon, as Yaara, effectively uses her mobile face and voice and is completely credible as both an adult and a teenager. We fully accept her ability to end the film to find her place in the world with more confidence. <br /> <br /> It is worth noting the precision with which places and activities are repeated with small but important variations that never become boring - after acting by smaller characters and an interesting decision to represent the Talia only as a teenager. I am arguing with Yaara's final declaration as standing with Gadi, Talia's last boyfriend, at the edge of the cliff, but this trip to the edge is so fascinating that the picture will remain on view longer than her words will be remembered.
