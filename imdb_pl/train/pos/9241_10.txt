Hey people, what's up. That's me, the only Mike "Sonny Sakura KIller" Kelly. You know ... you really can not write reviews about Sakura's scenario, because we did not have it there. As far as I know, history was just made up when we went on. I had the best time in my life doing this movie, and I got so much suffering that Jism came to an end .... I am so glad that the film appealed to you all. I really did not make the fights I imagined. Each time I set a few moves, the combat director constantly changed them. Still, I had a great time and met really great people. Especially a purple Ninja woman who seems to be falling from the movie scene.
