Everyone, my name may sound strange, but there was nothing else! <br /> <br /> Anyway, I have not seen anything like this before, so it was crazy! Of course it's good. It's a fun movie, and my absolute favorite thing is how to interweave other things together! Like a little chicken, a fish pretending to be King Kong and Runt a pig saying: "Twas beauty who killed the beast", Scene of world war and many more. Walt Disney has NOT lost touch, maybe not for this. Also, how they made them watch the movie and it was like home cinema. <br /> <br /> However, some parts do not match. Like the original king of lions, did not Timon and Pumba with Simba beat Skaza? In this movie they are not! they fought hyenas behind the scenes. That's more, that's why Pumba is not so confident, because he was pushed away by other animals, and also just Timon, Timon, Timon. Anyone realize that only Timone's story was told, while pumba has only flashbacks? <br /> <br /> But besides, THIS IS GREAT!
