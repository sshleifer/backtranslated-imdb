Stephen King's films are fun with me. I really like them or hate them. I did not like some of the more sophisticated productions (such as Desperation and Storm of the Century). Some of the smaller, I really loved. Sleepwalkers is one that I really like and regularly watch. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around Charles Brady and his mother, Mary. They are sleepwalkers, shapeshifters who, though they look like people, change into bones. They are resistant to scratching cats and each time they move to a new city, they set up traps to catch and kill animals. When they move into their newest city, they must look for a virgin, and when Charles finds one of them, he actually falls in love with her, but his mother must feed her to maintain her strength. The story revolves around what will happen to the girl. Will Charles save her or use her to save her mother. <br /> <br /> Although this story has a subtext of incest, which some may find unattractive, it actually plays a part in the story and is therefore not simply recorded in the film because of the scandal. Like most of Stephen King's stories, he is based in a small town with many interesting characters. The action is not the best or special effects, but somehow the whole has a tendency to "gel" and is very visible and pleasant adaptation. <br /> <br /> For British readers: This production has most recently shown on the BBC1, Sci-Fi and Sky Thriller / Horror channels.
