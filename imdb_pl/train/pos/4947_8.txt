One can only hope that many times someone as powerful as Morgan Freeman can take the time to help someone who needs help. <br /> <br /> It all boils down to loving people. As Will Rogers said, "I've never met a man I did not like." Of course, if you meet Paza Vega, what do you dislike? Her smile can melt diamonds. It is so fantastic that I can watch everything it is. The same applies to Freeman. he is just magical on the screen. <br /> <br /> They both gave us a movie that was fun from beginning to end. From the Mexican supermarket to Lorraine and Bobby to Packy. It was delicate, charming and just fun. <br /> <br /> You must check it out.
