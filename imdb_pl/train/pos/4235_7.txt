.... after 16 years, Tim Burton finally disappoints me !!!! What happened to old Burton who read Frank Miller's "Return of the Dark Knight" as a study of the preparations for Batman's return in 1988-1989? It looks like Burton did not examine the book or the movie because he got everything wrong! This movie sucks! It is not as good as the original and does not apply to the same subject as the original. If you want a good monkey movie, watch the original. <br /> <br /> ** with **** stars
