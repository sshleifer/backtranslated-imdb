OK, I do not think the Trailer Park Boys have bad stories because they kick ass. They just ... argue with each other. <br /> <br /> For example: at the end of the movie, he shows Ricky and Julian telling "Patrick Lewis" to put down the dog and leave. At the end, he shows that Ricky and Julian say they have been in prison for 2 years. In the pilot television series, the first clip they show is the same clip of Ricky and Julian shouting on "Patrick Lewis". But in the TV series, they were reportedly only in prison for 18 months. <br /> <br /> They also give us the impression that the plot of the movie and the plot of the TV series are connected (because of the screaming scene between the guys). But some of the actors present completely different characters. Of course, Patrick Roach plays in the movie "Patrick Lewis," but in the series plays Randy. Sam Tarasco plays one of the guys who pays Ricky for extermination, and then plays Sam Losco in the series. <br /> <br /> Also (again ... I know, I have a lot to say), in the movie, the guys sniff cola instead of smoking hashish. The thing is, they never really confirm that the two fictional lines are in any case connected, except for the screaming scene. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry I'm still lying.
