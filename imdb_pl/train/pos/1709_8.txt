After confusing the Halloween reinduction with the classic radio adaptation of Orson Welles' World War to a real Martian invasion, a group of moronic Martians appears on Earth, wanting to conquer only their plans, which are not in vain. element and in fact alone. <br /> <br /> It really is quite good and fun, with a few decent lines (just check the memorable quotes) to run. You will probably like Sci-Fi fans. It's been a long time since seeing it recently turned out to be much better than I expected. Despite the cast of unnamed stars, this may be the funniest Martian invasion ever made. Interestingly, the Martians themselves seem to represent almost every classic Action Hero stereotype / Sci-Fi Hero (cool teenager of the 50s, pilot fighter, fearless astronaut, brave soldier and kooky scientist). Fun for the whole family. <br /> <br /> "Get ready to die! Earth Scum! "
