One of the best movies I've seen in the last five years! The cast is extremely spectacular in the story of a young love and bravado in the Lower East Side in New York with two leading heroes. Funny, charming, sad and inspiring, this is a totally refreshing look at urban youth, which makes Larry Clark nauseous in the gutter where it belongs ... although I must admit that Bully was higher than the normal fee. Raising Victor Vargas is one movie that you will attack for lack ... so do not miss it!
