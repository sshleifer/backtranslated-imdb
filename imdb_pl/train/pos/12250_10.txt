Kate Beckinsale steals the show! Bravo! It is a pity that Knightly does not look as good as Jeremy Northam. Mark Strong has done a fantastic job. Bernard Hepton was perfect as the father of Emmas. I love the final scene (which is an addition to the innovative but well-written), when the harvest is in, and Knight's dinners with their employees and friends from the upper classes. Emma must show that he accepts it now. She is a changed woman. It's too much too fast, but OK. I will buy it. Samantha Bond plays the former Emma's governess and trustee. She is wonderful. as I imagined it. I believe that when Great Britain does Jane Austen, she is the best. American versions of English literature are made for money, not for quality. See this!
