Recently, I found a copy in the video store for $ 5 and I gladly picked it up. While music and (of course) graphics do not meet the standards of my favorite Beyond the Mind's Eye series, I'm still delighted with one segment: <br /> <br /> Stanley and Stella in "Breaking the Ice." Music is genius, and emotions they're real. The Odyssey clip does not have a history or music.
