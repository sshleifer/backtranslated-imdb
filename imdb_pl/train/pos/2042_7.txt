STAR EVALUATION: ***** Unique **** Very good *** Okay ** You can go out for a meal * Avoid it at all costs <br /> <br /> Suspended career of female Kate (Franka Potente) goes to London subway to catch a train to take her to meet George Clooney. However, after a hard day's work, he slumbles and wakes up to find himself alone on an abandoned platform. However, when he is racing in a situation that leads her from one difficult encounter to the next, she learns about something much more evil and evil that awaits her. <br /> <br /> In many ways the British film industry really is becoming one, especially in the horror thriller section, with films like Creep and a successful 28 Days Later (which has a strong echo in part). In terms of success in what he has decided to do, Creep deftly creates (especially at the beginning) a terrible sense of isolation and tense fear. In this clever running time I succeed (though unintentionally I suspect) to pay tribute to some of the pioneer horrors of the '70s, which are based on shocks and fear, without focusing too much on character development and such. <br /> <br /> From his weakness, some scenes are a bit predictable, but they do not really make him less frightening or effective in any way. I am not sure if the ending was intended to make it a game of morality and is not exactly perfect, but it is certainly very effective and fulfills its basic function very well. ***
