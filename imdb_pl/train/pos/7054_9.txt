I thought this movie was much better than most film critics deserve. Although it has confusing parts of the story, it does not prevent the film from being understood. Saying this, if you're not open to more liberal political ideas, it's probably not a movie for you. I thought that all the actors in the film are outstanding. Each character has a funny time, and the audience at the Tribeca Film Festival laughed at all times. I thought the satire was a bit overstated in one particular area, but it was deliberately done. John Cusack is right that although he is set in the future, he really makes you see the present.
