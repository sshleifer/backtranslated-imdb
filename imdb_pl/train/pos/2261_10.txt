I have seen this film and art and I must add that it was the most moving story I have ever seen. Until I saw this movie, I did not realize how awful life was and probably still is for the South African children and adults who were and live in that era. Tears came to my eyes and a lot of sadness to heart, that every human being should fight in this way only to stay alive, and to lead children out of this area and teach them to act and form them and slow them down to say their own story is simply amazing. It just exceeds five stars, I rate it at ten. Thank you, Mr. Mbongeni Ngema for such astonishing story. Although 12 years have passed since telling this story, it is still something that is hard for me in my heart. If there is a VHS or DVD, please let me know ASAP. Thank you. PS There was nothing wrong with the fact that the children wanted to draw attention to their other problems and conditions in the hope that someone would have a heart and offer help.
