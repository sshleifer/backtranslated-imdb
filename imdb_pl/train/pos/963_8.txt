Takashi Miike is one of my favorite directors and I was worried about making a movie for children because I would not like to see him go away from his movies that I've come to love: Visitor Q, Gozu, Izo, Ichi the killer and Black Sociota Trilogy. He recently seems to be researching new territory and I think he is succeeding. Even so, it was the first of his films that I saw him going in that direction, so I was nervous. I bought it thickly without watching it and I'm happy that I did it. <br /> <br /> Great Yokai War is the perfect movie for children, and adults should also like it. The whole film reminded me of so many films that I loved as a child: a never-ending story, a maze, a return to Oz, etc. I liked the films because they did not treat children like fools, and this one did not. The dark, underlying morals are there, but it's also as stupid as any children's movie. Personally, I did not care about CGI and prosthetics. I feel that they fit well and do not think that children will notice. <br /> <br /> If you are a die-hard fan of Takashi Miike, you may not like it. But I suggest you give him a chance. This proves that Miike is as diverse and talented as I suspected. He still creates his signed Miike movies, beyond what is very calming. <br /> <br /> For people who are new to Takashi Miike and want something light or dramatic, like this one, I propose these other Miike films: "Zebraman" "Katakuris' happiness" "Sabu" and "Birds in China" . <br /> <br /> Good job Takashi Miike! 8/10 stars.
