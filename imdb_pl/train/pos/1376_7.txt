It sounds like it was a Claude Monet biography, but in reality it is a very focused story of the relationship between three adolescent girls from a French synchronized swimming team. There are no parents or teachers to talk about, no school, and the boys are represented by one peripheral character, a handsome Francois who enters the story from time to time and always leaves him confused. <br /> <br /> the youngest of the three, aspiring only to the team that admires so much. It looks weird. She has not left the youthful spurt yet and has long, bony limbs, big feet and no way of talking about it. It is prognatic and has these plump lips. After a while, her appearance appears on you and at some angles can come to look fascinating. <br /> <br /> Adele Haenel is older - more, well, more developed physically. What a charming figure she cuts into a swimsuit, walking, teasing boys, waving long blond hair. But she is not what she seems. Is she? I could not understand it. The French have long been paradoxes and have little consistency. No wonder Francois always sniffs for her. <br /> <br /> There is no such ambiguity in the character of Louse Blachere. She is also in the band, but she is dingy and smooth, and sensitive to it, and has intense love in Francois. Blachere is a good actress and contributes to the awkward character thanks to her performance. <br /> <br /> The film deals with the relationships between the three, which means intrigue, deception, hidden feelings and the rest of what is associated with young girls who spend a lot of time together. This is obviously a difficult topic. It becomes more difficult during the gradual development of the homoerotic relationship between Pauline and Adele. Not that you would expect it to be a soft porn movie. The only nudity we see is much less than turning on, and what little sex is under the covers, sometimes literally. <br /> <br /> I do not think that I would like to go into the story or in its analysis too much, partly because it is rather suggestive than expressed through action, partly because it is complex and partly because I am not sure if I have it all. <br /> <br /> Give an example. Fine. Adele is a girl who others envy. She is also quite distant and happy with herself. Besides, he apparently deals with every boy and man in sight, if they can be useful at all, from the handsome but stupid Francois to the driver of the bus, from whom he wants favors. He is boasting shamelessly about his knowledge in fellatio. When Pauline approaches her to join the swimming team, Adele uses her as an observer during tasks with the guys. A better and self-satisfied narcissus, you know? But then this strange slut takes Pauline's skinny under his wing and reveals Pauline that she is still a virgin. Really? In fact. Pauline begins to approach Adele, and Adele finally confesses that she would like to get rid of her virgin and would like Pauline to do it for her. Pauline, now sexually drawn with Adele, performs a task with subdued taste. NOW Adele REALLY likes to do it with a man, preferably an older and an experienced one. He takes Pauline to favors, where he dances seductively with a guy until he follows Pauline into the room with the powder. Two girls are standing there staring at each other, but none of them expressly sexual interest in others. But Adele stands so close that Pauline slowly relaxes her reins, reaches out and kisses Adele on the lips. Adele goes back, smiling, and says, "Now it was not so bad, right?" And then he returns to the club. <br /> <br /> It's a very close description of what's going on between Pauline and Adele - but what the hell is going on? At first, Adele treats Pauline like an irrelevant child, then like a close friend, and finally like a potential lover - and as soon as Pauline responds, Adele goes away satisfied. Does she use Pauline the way she seems to use men? Does Adele know that she now has another person in forced service? I do not know. <br /> <br /> I disregard Louise Blachere as the third member of the trio, a simple and over-the-wall wallflower whose expression always suggests a daze, but which at least is completely heterosexual and the first of three to get rid of this noisy virginity, but I just omitted it from due to space. <br /> <br /> Do you see it? At all costs. (Compare this with a typical American movie about high school students.) For men, some of whom have never penetrated feminine mysticism, it can give you an idea of ​​what it looks like in a medium shot.
