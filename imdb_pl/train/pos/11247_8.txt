I saw this movie for the first time when it landed on an American cable a year after the film's release. It broke my little head, I was only 16 years old and it was the first new wave music I heard while being an adolescent, classic kid. Music mesmerized me, as did the amazing look of Hazel O'Connor and charismatic vocal performances, and the hard but soft cockney manager of Phil Daniels stole my heart. But I think that my favorite character was saxophonist Jonathan Pryce. He was so out of place in the band and so harmless and pathetic that he only begged for compassion. Favorite scenes, performance when lights went out, and a love scene on the train. <br /> <br /> Okay, so the movie is not a Rose! But he was really great because of the limited budget and the image of Britain in the early 1980s, exploding rebellious youth, looking for a way out of the benefits queue. I went to the UK just a few years later and found the film to be very reflective of the atmosphere I discovered when I was there. <br /> <br /> If you have a chance, see this. It's a great movie, with some great performances, and the music will blow you up. <br /> <br />
