I must say that it was not too exciting, but we are talking about fashion and strange ways of solving the riddle. A bit too simple, Nancy Drew (Emma Roberts) uses IMDb ... it's fantastic! I really liked this part of the movie ... <br /> <br /> Corky (Josh Flitter) is very funny ... and Ned Nickerson (Max Thieriot) seemed really hopeless ... he should have been more angry at her for how she treated him ... <br /> <br /> All right, this movie is a tour and fashion in disguise. In any case, I recommend this movie, only for summer fun. Encore Nancy, just for fun. More spy movies Emmy Roberts .. Spymate ... remember? It becomes good in this difficult job of the detective.
