Theo Robertson commented that the WAW did not sufficiently cover the conditions after the First World War, which led to the creation of Hitler and World War II. <br /> <br /> Maybe he missed the first ONE and a quarter of an hour of volume 8? It covers this period, and with the previous volumes in the series clearly shows the existing conditions. My friend grew up in Germany during this period, he even joined Hitler Youth, and his experiences were very similar to those mentioned in WAW. <br /> <br /> This document is SO LARGER than the History Channel documentaries, I also own that there is no comparison. <br /> <br /> THE ONLY fault, and the little one I have with WAW is: numbers are not counted, many times. For example, if you are talking about the lease of loans, how many war materials have been borrowed / rented? How much to Russia, how much to Britian? How many merchant ships sank U-boats and when? How many ships did the German or Japanese navy have in total in 1941? What type were they? How many soldiers? How many soldiers did the allies have in total and by country? A lot of numbers could make many viewers nod, but I would prefer MORE! And of course I always want to see more military analyzes. How was WHY did not Patton and Clark trap the German army that was in Cassini after they surrounded her instead of chasing Monty to Rome and letting her escape? I do not think you can start to understand the war until you see some of these video segments about "total war," such as the bombing of Dresden. It's like trying to understand Auschwitz, etc., Before you see the death camp clips: you just can not wrap your head around it - it's too incredible. <br /> <br /> Unknown at this time and Of course, unobtainable, were the most scandalous atrocities and inhuman behavior of the Japanese, including cannibalism (read "Flyboys"), and some vivid vivisection of medical "experimenting" prisoners without anesthesia! <br /> <br /> Dave
