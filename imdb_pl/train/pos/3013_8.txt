Talented detective Philo Vance (William Powell) is recalling his foreign trip to investigate a seemingly cut out and dried out suicide case that has good reason to suspect is really something more, rather a deliciously complex murder! <br /> <br /> When it comes to movies with a mysterious murder, there is simply nothing better than this. Populated with suspicious characters, all associated with the dog show and having very good reasons to murder the apparent suicide victim of Archera Coe, it is really difficult to figure it out or wrap the head around her, but boy, is it fascinating to watch how it develops before us. Even the cops, the coroner and the district attorney turn out to be colorful, the polished figures add a level of unexpected realism of this behavior and strengthen the general factor of "fun". I particularly liked comic scenes involving the coroner (played by Etienne Girardot), who always seems to be rude and prematurely interrupted by the discovery of corpses or wounded men while running. Detective Eugene Palette, a sergeant. Heath welcomes, often later delightfully funny, his critical commentary during the Vance investigation. I do not think of any important criticism to give this film in reality, except that it did not date well. However, it does not stop the movie from having fun. Follow and see if you can wrap your head around this secret. I highly recommend trying!
