If you can not enjoy the chick movement, stop now. However, if you like videos that illustrate complex characters and ensure extraordinary acting, read on. <br /> <br /> Ann Grant Lord dies. Her two daughters come to her bed. Ann starts talking about people from the past whose daughters are not aware and asking if these lost friendships are real or imagined. They realize that these people from the mother's past are really real. <br /> <br /> The story changes basically between 1953 and 2000, with some flashes about Anna's life between those years. In 1953, Ann met the love of her life and experienced the greatest tragedy of life. <br /> <br /> One of Ann's two best college friends, Lila, gets married. Another best friend of Ann is Lili's brother Buddy. Lila and Buddy are children of the rich Newport family, while Ann is a cabaret singer living in Greenwich Village who wants to be a free spirit, but is still bound by many conventions from the 1950s. <br /> <br /> Soon after Ann arrives to become an honorary maid at Lili's wedding, she meets a person who will become a key figure in the life of the three - Harris. He is an adult son of a former family servant who grew up with Lila and Buddha and became a doctor in a small town in New England. Ann is immediately in love with Harris, which complicates the fact that Lila has always been in love with Harris and is still there. Buddy is also in love with Harris, but being in 1953, He redirected Harris's homosexual desire for a good friend, Ann, because he can not admit to himself that he has a sexual desire for another man. Buddy exhibits internal frustration outside, being an alcoholic, shaken by an evil boy from the family - to the disappointment of his very competent and restless parents. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, all these expressed and repressed emotions lead to a tragedy - after all, it is a hatchling. <br /> <br /> Nowadays, Ann's daughters have gone away from their mother and are suffering from their own lifelong realizations and doubts. Constance is working on emotional exhaustion, trying to keep her role as an ideal mother and wife. Nina, always feeling worse, can not maintain a relationship. <br /> <br /> Mix all these relationships for fifty years and you will get an intriguing look at society, its values ​​and its impact on the personality and actions of complex people involved. <br /> <br /> The whole evening party is excellent, but there are some amazing performances and scenes - along with two exceptional family relationships - that make this movie very, very special. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes stars in the 1950s Ann, and he does it in a style that clearly shows the intelligent woman of that time who contradicts what he has to do in contrast to what he wants to do. Her performance is not easy to forget. <br /> <br /> Vanessa Redgrave plays the dying Ann, whose mind shifts from the present to the past, into the years of fantasy, and of course Redgrave distracts everything from the style of sterling. <br /> <br /> Natasha Richardson - real daughter of Redgrave - plays the daughter of Ann, Constance. The scenes between this real mother and the daughter playing a fictional mother and daughter are a perceptive feast to watch. <br /> <br /> Toni Collette plays another daughter, Ann, Nina. Nina spends a lot of time on depression and regret over herself, closing a good man who loves her, as well as her mother and sister. Collette is perfect for this part, but I've never seen her give me bad or unbelievable performance no matter what part she plays. <br /> <br /> Mamie Gummer plays Lila from the 1950s and shows us a woman even more in conflict with her expected role in life than her good friend, Ann. Is very good. <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep - Gummer's mother - plays on today's Lila. What can you say about Meryl Streep except that he always gives insightful and satisfying results. <br /> <br /> Director Lajos Koltai states in addition to the DVD that he was looking for Glenn Close to play a relatively small part of Lili's mother because he felt that she was the only actress he could come up with to play one scene in the movie. He was certainly right, and the performance of Close in one scene saves it in your mind. All other scenes in which Close is a very suitable mother of Lili, and you will get another treasure for the treasure. <br /> <br /> There are three other scenes in the film, combined with the one described above, which makes the whole movie worth watching. On the day of the wedding, Lili Ann comes to her room and crawls into bed with her friend to discuss Lili's bad intentions for her upcoming wedding with a man she clearly does not love. This scene repeats itself fifty years later when Lila comes and goes to bed with her dying friend Ann to talk about the surviving life. In this last scene Streep and Redgrave are fascinating. <br /> <br /> Another memorable scene - at least for me - is that Buddy declares his love for Ann. Hugh Dancy as Buddy gives us a moving performance of a young man torn apart by his conflicting sexual feelings. His performance is better. <br /> <br /> Fast traffic? Yes. A unique movie with incredible acting, direction and scenery? Definitely. I can not recommend in the evening too much.
