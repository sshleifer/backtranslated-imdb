For me, movies and acting are telling stories. The story of David and Betheheba is a tragedy that is profound and can be felt by anyone who reads and understands the biblical description. In this movie, I thought the stories of Gregory Peck and Susan Hayward were the best. To learn about and understand the story of David and his journey to become the king of Israel, this story became even more convincing. You felt his desire for a beautiful woman, Gregory Peck showed the true human side of this man who in his time was greater than life. Fear, Susan Hayward's reluctance, but then obedience to his authority as her King has been beautifully portrayed by her. One could also feel David's torment that Uriah had spent the night at the gate instead of at home. As well as sadness when he died in battle. The powerful and authoritative condemnation of King Raymond Massey made me feel his anger. The sets were real enough and the atmosphere was credible. All in all, I think it was one of the best films of its kind. I gave him a grade ten.
