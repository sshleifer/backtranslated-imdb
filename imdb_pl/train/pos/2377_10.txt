I've waited a long time for someone to shoot a loyal version of the classic novel H.G. Wells "War Of The Worlds". Timothy Hines has finally done it! I just could not believe how good it was! From acting, costumes, special effects outside the world, I just can not say enough! Dramatic, intense, full of first-class performances of the highest cast! You have to see it to believe it. Certainly not. I have read all these negative comments from others and I can not believe what they said. We had to watch a different movie, huh? And the bad comments of this guy who is who he is, well, he just does not know what he's talking about. Hines.
