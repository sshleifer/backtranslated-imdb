A great addition to someone's collection. <br /> <br /> 12 monkeys is a movie you do not see every day. He has great actors who have a great story. This is not the normal role of Bruce Willis, but he plays the part played by John McClane. <br /> <br /> The virus kills everyone on earth and leaves hundreds of stories that have survived, is not a new one, but takes on a new, new direction. <br /> <br /> A man (Bruce) is sent back in time to get information about the virus that destroyed most people. <br /> <br /> the actors in this were amazing. I have to mention Brad Pitt, who was hilarious because the mental patient James Cole (Bruce) is meeting in a psychiatric hospital. <br /> <br /> The director did an amazing job, bringing us a disturbing picture of the devastated future by a human created virus. <br /> <br /> Animals seen in the world of viruses have made them feel like in the world when people are brought to underground facilities. <br /> <br /> This movie was perfect and it has to see it and it must have it. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it. <br /> <br /> 10/10
