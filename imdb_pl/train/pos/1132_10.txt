His Hollywood imitates Daytiem Soap Operas at its best! It's a game we never see. Great characters and great lines. Whoopi is hilarious ..... Sally Field is so at the top .... Gary Marshalls lines are riots ... that's what I love in good comedies. I have never been afraid to make fun of myself !!!!!! Terri Hatcher as "Dr. Monica Demonico "did not have enough lines, but he was still great and fun on the screen. I would like to know how the idea for this movie came about. I have never seen a cast of people so funny in creating a comedy! Soapdish to must have and I am waiting for a DVD !!!
