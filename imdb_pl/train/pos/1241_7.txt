This film is very funny and every criticism is based on personal preferences - not on the quality of films. In addition to the widespread over-curse in some of Murphy's scenes, the movie is a great tool for his humor. It has some pretty good special effects and exciting action scenes. <br /> <br /> As a seeker for missing children, Murphy's character begins to look for a missing girl who leads him to the path to which others believe he was "chosen" - to protect the Golden Child. A young boy is born as an enlightened one, destined to save the world from the forces of evil, but whose life is in danger, if not with the help of Murphy, and his beautiful, mysterious and mystical helper / guide / defender. /> <br /> There are also moments of philosophical lessons to challenge viewers interested in considering deep thoughts. One of such scenes is the place where the Golden Child, whose figure Murphy is supposed to protect, is tested by the monks from the temple of the mountain. The elder monk presents a tray of decorative baby necklaces to choose from, and the child is tested according to his choice. <br /> <br /> This is a fantasy / comedy based on the assumption that both are good and evil forces in our world, which most people are completely unaware of. Accepting this assumption of the plot, we must abandon our contact with the perceived daily reality and prepare ourselves for the earth and walls to fall apart and reveal the kingdom of evil that is just waiting to destroy us. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent movie, with a good story, great acting and, for the most part, quite a decent dialogue combining a serious theme with a healthy balance of fighting with martial arts and the humor of Eddie Murphy.
