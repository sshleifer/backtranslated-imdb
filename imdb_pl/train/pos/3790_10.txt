I joined this accidentally on an independent movie channel and I was attached. I am a professional actor and I was stunned by performances. They felt completely improvised, absolutely without influence. I could not tell if it was written as a script or how it was filmed and I waited until the end to see credits, and then I spent half an hour on IMDb to find this movie. Do not miss it. I can see that the screenwriter and director also made a very good film "Ludzie codzienni", which I enjoyed a lot. The shame of the film industry is that projects that are perfect do not receive the distribution and advertising they deserve and live under the radar. This movie deserves a high and proud flight. I am calling people to check and see.
