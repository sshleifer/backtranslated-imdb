This performance is great. He has some of the best magazines I've ever seen. He has a great direction of Dvid Trainer, who also directed another intelligent television series called BOY MEETS WORLD. <br /> <br /> This program is without one of the best. Like THIRD PARTY, ROSEANNE and the famous COSBY SHOW, it will be on TV for a long time. <br /> <br /> From perfectly crafted jokes to the wonderful performances you've dreamed of, is a great show for people who lived in the seventies and people who did not. This performance appeals to the young and the young at heart. An excellent show.
