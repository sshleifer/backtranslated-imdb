This is one of the better comedies that have ever been on TV. The first season was fun, like most seasons. The only reason I give this 9/10 show is the unfortunate last season. The only good part of the last season was the finale. My favorite part of this program were scenes that cut the imagination of people, often depicting characters from famous TV programs or movies from the 70's. This is a rare performance in which I liked every character (except for the last season ... too late to try to develop a new character, and the fez was not so much fun). Red's foot in your butt has not aged or Kelso's stupidity. Well done to fox for keeping such a good performance for too long, too long.
