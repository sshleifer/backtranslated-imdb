I just watched the movie I was afraid that it would disappoint me. However, I was quite surprised. The American franchise pie is still in my favorite franchise movies of all time. yes, it will not be true if I say that I liked the pepper because I liked the original one. beta beta along with two previous cakes definitely lost something that the first two cakes had. This will not become classic, as the first two did. but what the hell - it's still funny with a lot of good times and I think it should be the first movie to choose from, if you want to have fun and relax after a hard day at work or school. beta beta deserves 6/10, but I gave it 7/10 only for being the next piece of PIE.
