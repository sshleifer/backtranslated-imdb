The film aroused my interest, mainly because Dianne Keaton is my favorite actress. I do not agree with some other posts on the basis that the plot was not intricate. I had no problems with following him (maybe some had too much eggnog the night before). The film was very sad and moving. What else do you want? Alexa Davalos is a great new talent (also beautiful), and Tom Everett Scott does a great job. The mother and daughter's relations could have been somewhat unrealistic, but the behavior of young people in the film was not. It was tragically sad but informative. It certainly beat other performances that were on TV New Years Day
