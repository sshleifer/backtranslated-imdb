Men of Honor has many great aspects. Good action sequences, lots of "feel good" scenes, good musical score, but the part that really makes the movie a great actor. Mainly Robert Deniro. The history of Men of Honor focuses on Carlu Brashear played by Cuba Gooding Jr., who wants to be the first African-American deep-sea diver in the navy. It is a chronicle of his difficult struggle from being a poor farmer to enter the diving school, and even further. It's a good story, but it looks like it has been done many times. A person, against all odds, will not give up until he reaches his goals, which he established for some sentimental reason many years ago. This can happen, but many of the struggles that Brashear faces in the film are questionable, including C.O. a diving school interfering with his last test. However, all this was composed on the stage in which Robert Deniro finally enters the film. Deniro plays Mater Chief Sunday, who is a teacher at a diving school attended by Brashear. As soon as Deniro enters, he ignores the atmosphere of extreme arrogance that can not be hated unless you have incredible willpower. Before the movie ends, Deniro makes a lot of speeches that will make you laugh about how cool he is, but you're too stunned by the way he hits them. In the end, you have to doubt some aspects of the movie, but admit that if it was true, you'd be napping in your seat for the first twenty minutes.
