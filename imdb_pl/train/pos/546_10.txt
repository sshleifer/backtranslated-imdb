I thought it was one of the best parts I've seen for some time. Sometimes I felt like I wanted someone to die, and killing Stanley's annoying figures was brilliant. It was such a well made movie that you were happy when he died. My only problem was that in some scenes it looked like someone with a home camera was filming it and it was weird. Judd Nelson is sweet, at least in my opinion, he was great in the role of Stanley Caldwell. A brilliant movie.
