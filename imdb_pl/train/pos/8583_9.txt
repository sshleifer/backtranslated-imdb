The Korean War was called the forgotten war of America. So many unanswered questions were buried along with 50,000 people who died there. Sometimes we are treated as a game or movie that deals with this distant, ghostly frozen cemetery. Here's probably one of the best. His name is Sergeant Ryker. The story is about an American soldier named Sgt. Paul Ryker (Lee Marvin), who was chosen for a top secret mission by his commander. His task is to escape to North Korea and offer his services against the forces of the United Nations. The success is so great that it turns out to be invaluable to the enemy and has the rank of major. However, he is later captured by the Americans, brought to trial as a traitor and spy. Determining that he was ordered to escape, unfortunately he learns that his commander was killed and there is no evidence or evidence of his innocence. He was convicted and sentenced to hang. However, his conviction is doubtful by Cpt. Young (Bradford Dillman), his prosecutor. Convincing commander Gen. Amos Baily (Lloyd Nolan) about his doubts, he is given a new trial and if he is found guilty, he will be executed. The court drama is at the highest level, as is the cast with Peter Graves, Murray Hamilton and Norman Fell as a sergeant. Max Winkler. Korea was far away, but the possibility of condemning the communists and hanging it hit very close to home in the fifties. Thanks to the excellent script and powerful message, this drama has become a classic courtroom. An excellent view and recommended to everyone. ****
