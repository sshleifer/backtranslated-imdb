I found "Time At The Top" as an entertaining and stimulating experience. Acting, although generally not brilliant, it was perfectly acceptable and sometimes very good. As a film directed to a younger demographic group, it is certainly one of the better works in this genre (Children Sci-Fi). I would usually say that Canada, Great Britain and Australia produce the best films and TV shows for children, and "Time At The Top" does nothing to ignore this theory! I do not think continuity and great acting are important for younger people. A good plot and an ingenious scenario are much more important to them. Both are abundant in this film. Special effects are good, without prejudice to history, or closing viewers away from your own imagination. It would be very easy to inject SFX overload in this movie, but it would completely destroy the entire "Raison D'etre". <br /> <br /> Camera settings and work have a very high standard in this film and complement the beautiful wardrobe and historical accuracy. In general, this movie is very satisfying and I recommend it to all viewers who can see the world through the eyes of children or those who try, like me! Now I really have to read the original book as soon as possible.
