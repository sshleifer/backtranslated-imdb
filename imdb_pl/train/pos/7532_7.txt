Batman's new adventures (also called Gotham Knights) take place 5 years after the last episode of Batman: The Animated Series (B: TAS) and are broadcasted for only 24 episodes. This is not a scary program, but it is not as good as the original Batman Animated series. I will start with all the things that I think are not very good. <br /> <br /> The first thing is the first, the animation itself: long and sweet, Gotham is no longer dark, the sky is always bright red and orange, B: TAS did it too, but it was drawn on the dark palate, or the color of the sky he was more ominous, in this show the color of the sky is too bright. It all looks like other kids and does not seem unique like Batman: TAS did it with his dark, cool artistic style on Gotham. The artistic style is OK, but it no longer reminds me of Batman. Each character consists of straight lines, squares and triangles, making the characters look less like a human. In the original series (B: TAS), characters look more like drawn versions of real people. Animation can be more consistent here than in B: TAS, but it's definitely not that good. <br /> <br /> Next: some episodes seem too stupid and childish, but some topics are even stronger than in B: TAS. (Two faces try to kill Tim Drake / Robin 2 and some villains get quite severe treatment). This brings me to the next point. <br /> <br /> Because this is to be done in the future, as well as in the final episodes of the Batman Animated Universe, many villains meet death or go away forever. Poison Ivy apparently drowns when the cruise ship explodes; Two-Face almost kills Penguin, Killer Croc and himself, so he moved to Arkham forever; Joker falls into the exhaust tower of the industrial plant (although he will return later in the Justice League animated series); Catwoman goes to France, leaving Batman, etc ... Just because the series ends, does not mean that they have to get rid of the great characters! The motives of villains are also bad. There are not any! In B: TAS, we find out that these villains are mentally tormented, and their lives are ruined, that's why they act as they do, in this performance, criminals commit crimes to develop history. It's as if Batman just did not care about saving what's left in the people he's fighting with, he just beat them pointlessly. Batman is a colder and more malicious version of the character, but since he's been doing this job for years, I can see why it's so harsh. <br /> <br /> Then redesigned character models: they are awful. Gordon slowed by 100 pounds ... is he sick? Many villains look stupid (Joker, Riddler, Catwoman, Mr. Freeze, Mad Hatter and Killer Croc are among the WORST). Although I think that some characters look better (Bane, Scarecrow, Batgirl). Harley is more or less the same, and Ivy (which is even hotter) has pale green skin. <br /> <br /> With a series of many bugs, some episodes are great - Over the Edge, Mad Love, Beware the Creeper. My favorite place is Girls Night Out, Old Wounds, Legends of the Dark Knight and Never Fear. All crossovers with Batman in the Superman Animated Series were also great. <br /> <br /> The absolutely WORST part of this program is how the creators say they love the animation of this series more than the original. In the case of the DVD function of the original animated series Batman talk about how much they are proud of the style of art and how difficult are the animations of some characters, but in the end they did it (difficult animation necessary for Clayface's animation, for example). On the DVD features in New Batman Adventures, the creators basically say: "To hell with B: TAS, this is a new, new re-vamp, it looks better and we love it, as we DO NOT ALLOW THE SERIES!" (Alright, it's an exaggeration). When the artists reject the amazing artistic style of B: TAS, which really annoys me! <br /> <br /> This is not a bad performance, but I still do not like it as much as the original animated series. At least the show does not talk to the audience, which is why I still applaud it. Although some episodes of this new series are fantastic and worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Superman: Animated series and Justice League: animated series are great supplementary programs for Batman: Animated Series and The New Batman Adventures, so also give them a watch.
