Director and co-author Eytan Fox, scriptwriter and director of the acclaimed mini-film from 2002, Yossi & Jagger (2002). This comparative epic at 53 minutes is another great romantic drama in which we must deal with the tragedy and celebrate the beauty and joy of life. Westerners, especially urban gays like me, have to be moved outside of our security zone and be informed about real life and the fight for death elsewhere to be able to love justice. <br /> <br /> While "Yossi & Jagger" "Ha Buah" focuses on a pair of homosexual lovers in the closed borders of Israeli military service, focusing on a group of civilian friends, both simple and homosexual, who share the unit in the heart of Israel generally tolerant of gays, but not always homosexual, the capital of Tel Aviv. <br /> <br /> "Ha Buah" begins with a dramatic border crossing scene in which Noam (Ohad Knoller? Yossi from "Yossi & Jagger") meets the handsome young Arab Ashraf (Yousef Sweid) for the first time. Romance is soon blooming? but in this case, political climate options would have to be quickly taken over or completely lost. <br /> <br /> From there we follow intricate relations between members and lovers of roommates and the unavoidable effect of the very conservative Ashraf family. If you are closely following the dialogue of this film, you will have no reason to be disappointed with the ending. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack for "Ha Buah" is alive and the visuals are beautiful and sharp? ie real life in the Middle East. <br /> <br /> English subtitles are very easy to follow and quickly rest and appreciate world cinema at its best.
