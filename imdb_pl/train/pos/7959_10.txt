It's a really cool movie! I remember seeing him first when I was very young and watching him all the time, like once a week ... Shadow was my favorite character in the movie. Homeward Bound is really fun and really cool as they train animals to do all these things. Parts of the film are, however, sad (eg When Sassy, ​​the cat falls on the waterfall and when Shadow falls into the hole at the end). I saw the second Homeward Bound, but I must say that it is not so good first. Shadow is smart, Sassy is, well, Sassy, ​​and Chance is a funny idiot. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes comedy or talking animals. It's one of ten of my favorite movies!
