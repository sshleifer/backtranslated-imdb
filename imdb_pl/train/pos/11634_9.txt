I just came back from the advanced Redeye show and I have to say that I have not played so well in the film for a long time. WES CRAVEN is at its best. He brings us the amazing end of the summer thriller, which I desperately wanted. This is the thriller of the year ... no doubt. <br /> <br /> All actors are amazing and the action is realistic and fun. F / X were great. It gradually built up tension. I was on the edge of my place most of the movie. It's been some time since I've heard the audience cheer and clap in the theater. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for excitement, action and a good game this summer, REDEY delivers. Go see him!
