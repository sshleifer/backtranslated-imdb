This movie is fantastic. Finally, well-written characters that you can love for all your good and bad. Pierce Brosnan is hysterical in this role. I think it's the best thing I've ever done. He made other roles that showed shades of capacity for this kind of full-fledged work, but this role eventually gave him room to act. I almost died when he walked through the hotel lobby in underwear and shoes. And Greg Kinnear and Hope Davis also have aspirations, as well as the actors who aspire. Kinnear is so unwise that his turn is really satisfying at the end. You give good actors a good job and they give us something more.
