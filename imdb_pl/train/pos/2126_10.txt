Many things about love and life can be learned by watching people in THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER. <br /> <br /> Ernst Lubitsch had another silent triumph added to his appreciation in this beautiful film. Thanks to the brilliant dialogue (courtesy of his longtime collaborator Samson Raphaelson) and the magnificent casts of many talented performers, he created a truly unforgettable movie. Always believing in the intelligence of his viewers and favoring sophistication in the slapstick, the director came up with a brilliant film reposition seasoned with this elusive, mysterious quality known as the "Lubitsch touch". <br /> <br /> Although the story takes place in Budapest (and there are plenty of accents among the players), it does not matter. The beautiful simplicity of the plot lies in the fact that any large American city or small town can easily become a place of action. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullavan are great as romance-loving officials, then with everyone else - without knowing it. Their dialogue - so skillfully treated, that it seems completely natural - perfectly reflects their confusion and quiet desperation when they look for soulmates. This is one of the classic love stories in the cinema. <br /> <br /> Cherubic Frank Morgan has a more serious role than a man whose transient meaning in his small world is broken when he finds a cuckold himself. Finished with the scene thief, he does not allow any emotions to escape. In addition, Morgan gives a movie with the most joyful moments - at the end - when he states that the latest employee of his store, poor youth, enjoys an unforgettable Christmas Eve. <br /> <br /> Joseph Schildkraut adds another vivid picture to his list of screen portraits, this time about the humorous, sylopantic Lothario who deserves to be punished in the end. The gentle Felix Bressart has his best film role as a family man who really can not afford to engage in shop scheres, but remains Stewart's steadfast friend. <br /> <br /> Sara Haden has a small role as a sales officer. William Tracy is hilarious as an ambitious errand boy who uses unforeseen events to take advantage of sales force. <br /> <br /> In small roles, Charles Halton plays a senseless detective, and Edwin Maxwell appears as a pompous doctor. Girls' girls recognize Mary Carr and Mabel Colcord - both of them invaluable - in their one scene as grandmother and aunt of Sullavan.
