Here is one more beauty in the series of beautiful films directed by Eytan Fox. The film shows the story of lovers in the stars (one Israeli, one Palestinian) in modern Tel Aviv. The effectiveness of the film results not only from the image of the inter-ethnic conflict, but also from personal and political conflicts in ethnic groups. For example, there is an eloquent moment when one of the supporting characters, openly homosexual, is visited in the hospital by his boyfriend, who brings him flowers and tries to kiss him in front of his visiting family, and suddenly we see a wave of uncomfortable discomfort to wash the room. Apparently the young man is not as open as it seems, and the family is not as accepted as he would like it, while the boy is confused and rejected. A lot of complexity is packed in a fleeting moment. As we know from Yossi and Jagger, Fox is a master in efficiently packing emotional and psychological complexity into short sequences. The film is also effective in the same way that it presents the mutual brutality that Israelis and Palestinians inflict on each other. If you are not without heart, you will be crying over the last third of the movie. Although the plot is melodramatic, it is so intelligently written and preserved that it reminds us how satisfying a good melodrama can be.
