Michael Stearns plays Mike, a sexually frustrated person with an interesting moral approach to sexuality. There is no problem with watching naked dancers, but when women start having sex with men, then they lose it. He believes that when women actually have sex, they lose the sense of "innocence" and / or "beauty." So he walks around Hollywood Hills, persecuting couples who love each other at a distance, finally shooting dead people with a high-powered rifle with a range. <br /> <br /> It seems that the main reason for the existence of this movie is the dedication of sex activity over and over again. "History" is more than a reflection. This will certainly make many happy heterosexual men very happy, because they are treated long enough to be naked (ladies here looked terrible, without clothes) and sex to serve as a large dose of excitement. Of course, seeing a wide range of this phenomenon, the coefficient of creep increases considerably and illustrates coercion towards voyeurism. (First, Mike looks at the pairs all the time for a few minutes before finally pulling the trigger.) All this is underlined by the terribly obsessive, if somewhat atmospheric music on the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> People with a passion for a nightmare basket will certainly please it in one way or another. This includes even one lesbian attempt that confuses Mike and makes him uncertain * how * to react. It develops at a very slow pace, but ends with the most fun ironic twist of action. It is a perverse and twisted rarity that, if nothing else will definitely stop some viewers on the screen. <br /> <br /> 7/10
