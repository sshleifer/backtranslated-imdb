"Saving Grace" is never ridiculously fun, but it provides a lot of good laughter and I enjoyed it a lot. Brenda Blethyn is a great actress and is great at introducing the widower Grace, who is resorting to growing marijuana to pay off huge debts. The support staff also does a great job. The French actor Tchecky Karyo has a funny, small role. The premise is attractive. The idea that a woman from the hill grows and smokes a pot, sounds quite funny. And the movie plays with the assumption wisely every now and then. Of course, there are flat moments, such as the one in which two older women confuse Grace's marijuana leaves with tea leaves and start to draw childish pranks in the store in which they work. It was a thoughtless gag that did not come to fruition. The tone of the film is slow and sometimes boring, but I have enough laughter to give this English recommendation. <br /> <br /> My result: 7 (out of 10)
