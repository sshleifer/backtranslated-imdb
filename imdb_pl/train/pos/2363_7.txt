This adaptation of the story by MR James "A View From A Hill" was first shown on British television in 2005. On the small BBC 4 digital channel. I saw that it is repeated on BBC 4 and decided to give it Go, remembering the successes BBC from 1970 in other stories by MR James, including "Whistle And I'll Come To You My Lad" and "The Signalman". Although it is not in the same class as the masterpieces, the "View from the Hill" is a pleasant and sometimes overwhelming drama. <br /> <br /> The historian comes to a small village to review the collection of a recently deceased collector of antique artifacts. Being in the countryside, he sees an abbey that has been destroyed for hundreds of years. But what does this have to do with the old binoculars and macabre legend about the ominously named Gallows Hill? And what does the squire of the country and his servant know about this? Although I was not terrifying in any way, I liked this little production and if the working time was longer than 40 minutes, it could become a really great adaptation. It just so happens that everything seems a bit hasty and a little more exposure to set the mood would be appreciated. <br /> <br /> I give it 7 out of 10.
