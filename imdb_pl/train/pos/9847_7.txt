It was fun watching this movie ... despite the fact that I have a lot of time, that this movie almost copied Monsters Inc. There are many things that are very similar between the two, the relationship between the animal / monster and the small child, other animals trying to break this relationship, etc. This was how it felt throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> However, one of the functions of redemption is Scrat :) Very funny character, even if it does not make sense :)
