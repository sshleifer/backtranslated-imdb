Gerard is a writer with a slightly overactive imagination. He is also a homosexual and a Catholic who is vulnerable to Catholic guilt and a sort of clairvoyance, or so it seems. While traveling to Flushing, he is "seduced" by Christine. When he discovers that Christine's new boyfriend is a bit of a difficult trade that he has dreamed of from a distance, he decides to stick to it. Finally, forced heterosexuality has its own compensation. Then she realizes that the previous three husbands Christine all died with a violent death. Did Christine murder them and will he or a boy, Herman, be the "fourth man"? Verhoeven's overheated melodrama is a delicious blend of Hitchcock and David Lynch, full of eroticism, OTT and religious images, and a huge amount of red. Many times it looks like a dream and we can never be sure that what we see is real or the product of Gerard's imagination. The fun is to figure it out. Also the fact that Christine is an infinitely more pleasant character, which either priggish Gerard or stubborn Herman, means that we almost do not want to root any of the men. In fact, you can say that Gerard's appearance can not happen quickly enough. Super performances also from Jeroen Krabbe and Renee Soutendijk, as well as the best Verhoeven movie to its wonderfully subversive science fiction piece Starship Troopers.
