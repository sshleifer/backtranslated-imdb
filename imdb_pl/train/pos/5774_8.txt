Meteor falls from the sky and wakes up the plesiosaur, who used to terrorize the area around Crater Lake long ago. When the monster eats the locals, they try to find the monster's murder. <br /> <br /> Recent attempts to send old movies about horror and science fiction, such as Lost Skeleton of Cadavra and Alien Trespass, are debatable. have movies like Crater Lake Monster available for projection. It's a movie that these films counterfeit and send only this is a real bargain. It's all that these films try to remove only from the cheek and all the more fun because of it. This is a real drive-in movie that was unfortunate luck when Star Wars changed the way you look at special effects. The monster, a combination of a stop motion and a head of a natural size, is a charmingly adorable little beast. Filmmakers spoil the audience with frequent shots of the monster and its chaos. Sure, everything is false, but are movies about suspending unbelief? Actually, I think it's about really cool monsters that are. <br /> <br /> I like this movie in a bad release. If you want a real authentic propulsion in a monster movie, look no further. It would be an ideal solution for a double or triple function with similar movies of lake monsters (Boggy Creek, etc.)
