This is one of those movies you think about when you wake up the next morning. It will give you a warm, fuzzy feeling and leave you with a smile on your face. <br /> <br /> Sure, we feed on typical stereotypical characters and stories, but this is a trick: Entertain. <Br> <br /> Being from Sweden and living in the US for a while, it's fun how we react. "A dead husband will kill him," "She (Gabriella) will die, and then there will be a moving, greater than life ending." We know how these things work, everything ends together. And that's how it happened. The characters were quite simple, they were so sophisticated that you really did not think too much, nothing was left to your imagination. Siv will probably be the closest, she'll make you ask yourself if she really was in love with Daniel, but that's it. <br /> <br /> But the movie is beautiful, set in the Norrland countryside, the music is absolutely amazing and the characters are loved. Michael Nyqvist is really brilliant, with his crazy unique look, and Frida Hallberg is charming and affordable. Maybe a bit too nice. <br /> <br /> But most of this movie makes you feel and that's the most important thing. You cry, laugh, hate and identify. I do not know about you, but it does not happen that often.
