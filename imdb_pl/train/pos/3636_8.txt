This is a good movie about the dreams of one person and striving to achieve it. It's a beautiful and inspiring movie. Why do some people have to try to find a mistake in every film that appears, especially in the good ones. Dennis Quaid gives good results in this true story of Jim Morris, a science teacher and high school baseball coach who is being pushed by his team to make another shot in a professional baseball career. With an excellent cast, including Brian Cox, as a crunchy old naval officer who allowed so many son's accomplishments to go without his support. It was good to see him as something other than the villain in the movie. If I have one complaint about this film, then this is: never let Royce Applegate re-sign the national anthem. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this movie belongs to the handful of great baseball movies like "Field of Dreams" and "The Natural". It evaluates two thumbs up and a large "well done".
