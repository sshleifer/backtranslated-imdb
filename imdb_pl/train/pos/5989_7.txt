The film begins with a group of children in the reform school and focuses on a child named "Gabe" who apparently worked hard to earn a conditional release. Gabe and his sister move to a new neighborhood to start over, and soon Gabe meets Dead End Kids. The children in this film are small punks, but they are much less antisocial than in other previous films, and in the core are good punks. However, in this area there are also criminals who make insurance frauds through arson and see Gabe as a convenient scapegoat - after all, he was a school reformer and no one would believe he was innocent when he was framed. So when Gabe is ready to send back to The Big House, the rest of the gang must save him and reveal the real cheats. <br /> <br /> There were "Dead End Kids" in several Warner Brothers films in the late 1930s, and the films were generally very good (especially ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES). However, after the expiration of contracts for boys, they went to Monogram Studios, and the films, charitable, were very weak and formulated - with Huntz Hall and Leo Gorcey they were almost the whole show and the group changed its name to "The Bowery Boys". Because ANGELS WASH THEIR FACES had excellent writing and production qualities, and AND Hall and Gorcey did not constantly attack the camera, it's quite a good movie - and almost earns 7 points (it's a REAL CLOSURE). In fact, even though it's not a great movie in terms of aesthetics, watching is really nice, so I'll give it 7! Sure, it was a bit of a hokey - especially towards the end, when the children take their rights into their hands, and Reagan ignores the Charter of Rights - but it was also quite fun. The Dead End Kids perform their best performances, and Ronald Reagan and Ann Sheridan have provided excellent support. Sure, this part of the movie was illogical and impossible, but it was still fun and cute - so if you can suspend disbelief, it works well.
