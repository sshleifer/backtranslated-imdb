Gung Ho is one of those movies that never tires of watching. Michael Keaton has always been my favorite, and he is absolutely funny in this movie. Gedde Watanabe fits step by step. They both work great together. Although this movie is a comedy, I also like it, as shown by Hunt (Keaton) and Kazihiro (Watanabe) fighting as leaders of their groups. They both try to maintain their peace and then finally get into a fight (which is hysterical to watch). First of all, they are both on the floor. Then Hunt jumps into a chair. Kazihiro jumps onto the desk. Hunt jumps into the desk with him. The fight is then poured from the office to the factory. I love the fact that after the workers have separated them, you can say that they both feel bad, letting things get out of hand. There is also a scene where you can see Hunt's influence on Kazihiro. He is in his home and a boss from Japan arrives and says he would like to visit the factory tomorrow: <br /> <br /> Kazihiro: Tomorrow is not a good day. Sakamoto: Why not? Kazihiro: The factory is blocked and we can not find the key. <br /> <br /> Say you can not imagine Michael Keaton saying something like that! <br /> <br /> I really like this movie because it is really funny and also shows how radically different people can not only learn from each other, but also be good friends.
