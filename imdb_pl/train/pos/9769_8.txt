I liked. Overall, I'm not a fan of comedy and comedians, but I like Whoopi. I am also a supporter of Sci / Fi Fantasy. And the madness of dinosaurs. I read for pleasure, but when I feel stressed or really dead, I watch TV and movies to escape. Theodore Rex made it possible for me. It makes me successful in my eyes! I did not even leave to do something else when it was running. Whether it was rated as "good" or not is not important to me. And no, I'm not a minor. I'm not a moron, either.
