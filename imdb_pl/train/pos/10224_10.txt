... and I mean it. If not literally (in the end, I have not seen every movie ever made!), At least of course among those I know. <br /> <br /> 5.3 ??? The rule with IMDb is: sometimes movies rated very high (for example, a piece of Kannes-Kompetition-Krowned-Korean-Kraap called "Oldboy") can be really bad. Rarely, however, a movie worth watching is rated below 6. This movie, worth watching, is. Disgrace. <br /> <br /> True, I give her 10 in protest. The film is not perfect. Its real rating should be 8 or 9. It has some disadvantages (especially Belafonte), sometimes the script wanders around. However, we have one of the greatest directors of all times, the Czech Jan Kadar, the director of the two greatest actors of all time, beloved, bigger than Zero Mostel and the elevated Ida Kami≈Ñska in acting / poetic / moral tour de force. A couple created in Heaven! It is true that this film, with slight flaws, does not attract the average audience, but those who are interested in watching the excellent (and not uncritical) movie of the unmatched director who gave us "The Shop on the Main Street" (best movie) about the Holocaust) should not be missed just because some stupid IMDb grading system decides that "American Beauty" is better than "The Angel Levine". <br /> <br /> It is not.
