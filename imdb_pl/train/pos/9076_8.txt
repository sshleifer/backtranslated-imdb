It would have to be one of the funniest television series that would have left the States since the fall of "Everybody Loves Raymond." Warburton is always fun and it complements the rest of the cast to perfection. David Spade enormously tickles my funny bone with his extraordinary line performance. After admiring the British series "Coupling" I see that the creators of "Rules of Engagement" received their original idea, but it is not to be "brickbat" - absolutely brilliant dialogue and the path that is transferred, sets this particular series completely separately. However, achieving success in the new series requires more than just a competent cast, especially in the very difficult field of comedy. Being a part of a professional team writing comedy for most of my life in Australia for 7 years, I especially appreciate the role of the director as well as the perceptual and creative talent of the film crew. One of the few claims I have for this series is, of course, "can-laughs" in cans. Surely the live audience could be used during the filming of the series.
