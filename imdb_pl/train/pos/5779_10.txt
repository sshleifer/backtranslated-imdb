At the beginning I did not even know about this program for about a year because of the Internet. I did not see him on television in my country someday, and many people do not usually know about this program. It is a pity, because it is the most original and clever animation that I have been witnessing for many years. <br /> <br /> We do not give away 10 points, but this is one program that really deserves all 10 points. Although this may seem like a typical cartoon at first glance, it should be remembered that this is not a show for children. When the whole story develops, you know that this is a real deep plot with a spiritual message. This spiritual part of the story is based mainly on ghost animals, an old Indian faith that has been preserved for many years. This gives the program an original phrase that can not often be found in animated programs. <br /> <br /> The overall design is also something completely different. Sometimes it resembles Spawn in terms of a lively design, and sometimes it takes on a more cardboard approach. I believe that David Feiss, who also created and directed Cow and Chicken, animated the episode of the series (as well as drew this segment in a comic book). <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a spectacular show, a show that takes on a variety of topics, such as reality, suicide, spirituality, life, this is something you should not miss. When you start watching, you'll probably see it to the end. A small fact may be that the show takes on less material from the comic, but it is not too annoying. However, the only question is, where is the DVD ?!
