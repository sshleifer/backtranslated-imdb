This is not a great movie, but I admire writers and director for trying something different. The main theme of the film is fate and small, seemingly irrelevant things that can significantly change the future. In a sense, it reminds me of the FAST DOOR movie, although instead of focusing on one random event, seemingly random things happen many times and each of them helps to build a sweet conclusion. In addition, a strange bald guy seems to understand all this and talks about it during one short scene - as if he was some almighty being, but there is no explanation in him (like two guys who fight each other in the clock tower in THE HUDSUCKER PROXY ). <br /> <br /> The DVD jacket shows Audrey Tautou. This is due to her success at AMELIE, although she is only one of many actors in the film and has no major role in it. The pace is crisp, it works well and the application is not bad at all. The only reason I did not get a higher score is that some of the characters were a bit uninteresting and I think the movie could probably have been sharpened with a few smaller threads.
