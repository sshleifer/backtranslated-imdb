A job seeker seeking a job is confused with a murderer in a small town in Wyoming, which leads to all sorts of complications. Cage is perfectly staffed as an unlucky motherfucker who hopes for quick earnings and getting out of the city. Hopper does what he does best by playing a psychologist known as "Lyle of Dallas", a real murderer. Walsh as the crooked sheriff and Boyle as femme fatale complete a great cast. The script of the brothers John and Rick Dahl contains delicious twists and John's direction creates a great atmosphere of "neo noir". Witty and very funny, he draws the viewer from the beginning and never gives up.
