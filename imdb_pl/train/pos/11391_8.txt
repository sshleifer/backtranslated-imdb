The American in Paris is Gene Kelly's showcase. Watch how Gene sings, acts and dances his way through Paris in many situations. Some purely majestic, other pure corn. You can imagine what Kelly was made of because he made the film just a year earlier, "Singin 'In The Rain." It is definitely one of the best of all times. It is interesting to look at the similarities between these two films, especially in the characters of Kelly, the only major difference is that one is in Paris, the other in LA <br /> <br /> Some have said that Leslie Caron's acting was less than clean. Perhaps Cisse Charisse, who was originally intended for the role, could do better, but Caron is quite credible in this role and has chemistry with Kelly. The short role of Oscar Levant in this movie gave him what he needed, someone who does not look like Gene Kelly. Filling the role of an everyman is not an easy task, but Levant did it with the same class as the other. <br /> <br /> All songs and routines are perfect. Even the long ballet at the end of the movie makes it a better movie than without it. Seeing that there really was not much time for the screen to make such a loving relationship credible, Minnelli used this sequence to make it seem like you spent four hours with them. Brilliant! <br /> <br /> I would have to rate this movie with Singin because it is very similar in history and song. Singin 'would barely get a bow because of the uplifting performance of Debbie Reynolds. <br /> <br /> Full recommendation. <br /> <br /> 8/10 stars.
