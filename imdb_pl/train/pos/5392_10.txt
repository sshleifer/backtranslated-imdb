The Waiting Womans Ward of a large, lying hospital, with all its joys and sorrows, is the place where LIFE IS LAST. <br /> <br /> This almost forgotten drama is a small soap opera, full of comedy and tragedy, all related to the life of obstetric staff and their patients. The honesty with which this topic moves indicates the condition in front of the film's code. <br /> <br /> The wonderful Aline MacMahon, as a nice nurse, is a quiet center of the film, a rock around which all the flow of electricity. Is able to cope with any crisis or crisis situation, is the best mother, sometimes the last, a friend. Surrounding MacMahon is a group of excellent costaras: Loretta Young as a convicted murderer released from prison long enough to give birth; Eric Linden as her scared young husband; brassy Glenda Farrell as a dame who hates children; sweet Clara Blandick as a very mature mother in the sixth birth; Preston Foster and Hale Hamilton as thoughtful, compassionate doctors, and Frank McHugh as a crazy comic father-father. <br /> <br /> Film heroes recognize Bob Watson as a little bully who wants to see Stork; Paul Fix as a nervous husband who promises to behave like a "little soldier"; Gilbert Roland as a desperate Italian husband and Elizabeth Patterson as a joking wife of a doctor interested in the adoption of son Farrell - all unclassified. <br /> <br /> There are a few absurdities on the story - some mothers are obviously much too old; Farrell becomes grossly drunk on the ward, but none of the staff notices this; of course, the psychotic patient is able to wander around freely - but that really only adds to the bizarre entertainment value of the movie and makes things not too serious.
