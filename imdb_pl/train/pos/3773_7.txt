Bill and Ted came back, only this time a bad friend from the future sent back the evil Bill and Ted to destroy them, thus destroying the "Wyld Stallions" and the basis for human society in the future. This time Bill and Ted have to travel through the afterlife "Absolutely Bogus" and save humanity "Excellent" <br /> <br /> With the same humor and wonderful new characters, like a grim reaper, station and robot and Ted (station creation) Bogus Journey once again entertains and is worth watching the soundtrack itself. <br /> <br /> 7/10 <br /> <br /> The most triumphant sequel <br /> <br /> A party at the guys! hehe
