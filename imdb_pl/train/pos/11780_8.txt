This is a documentary film that I came across accidentally in the British TV channel More4 and I must say that I consider it extremely interesting and provocative. I will also look for a book that was the source of this document. Essentially, this is the theory of Professor Jared Diamond, why some parts of Earth's societies are prospering, and others are not. The argument he presents was new to me and argued about how the fortunes of the right crops and the right animals that are able to domesticate are undoubtedly convincing. As for the documentary itself, it is well filmed and well-told, and not many of the reconstructed scenes that spoil a lot of contemporary documentary. Diamond also helps not be condescending, which is the fault of many intellectuals when they try to convey the message to the masses. People said his theory is Marxist, but I do not buy it, and I do not think it's a more sociological geologist. It was also refreshing to hear theories about the evolution of a non-religion based society. I highly recommend watching.
