It's a very funny movie, easy to watch, which has fun almost all the time. The director's work is recognizable and the type of humor is his hallmark. Film is a typical story of police partners, like deadly weapons, but jokes and comedy are Argentine. The phrase is that one of them is a psychologist played by Peretti and must go with the detective Diaz (played by Luque) during his tasks while he also helps him (Diaz is worried because his wife betrayed him). Some dialogues are fun all over the world: understandable and funny everywhere. Overall, he is very good, he would have deserved 8, but I rated 7, because at the end he dropped a bit. For personal attention, I must add that this is a "bravo" for Argentinian filmmakers, given that small good is coming recently.
