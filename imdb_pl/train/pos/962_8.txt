I just finished watching this movie and I have to say that I was so impressed. Everything about it was great. Acting heroes, history. A reliable child who grew up brave, always willing to help others. His mother must be proud. I could not take my eyes off this movie for fear of losing something. It is a prefect fairy tale with morality, charming and terrifying sprites and "monsters", but nevertheless with cordial people. The child nudged and tormented at the school, which becomes a hero. Chosen for a rider at a local village festival and a trip to Goblin Mountain, where he discovers Yokai who are amazing creations from which Brian Froud would be proud. And evil Kato and his sider, who definitely needed a hug. These evil people grab Yokai and throw them into the red pit along with unwanted items, such as motorcycles and other mechanical elements that combine into horrible, brutal monsters whose only task is to kill. Takashi, a young boy, is the one who has been their savior, next to a red man / dragon turtle and River Princess, and a lovely little creature who, if it were America, could turn him into a cuddly toy and sell in any good toy store. The lines are good, especially Do not try this at home children and other gems that make you smile. Suspend faith and watch it with your child or on your own and enjoy! Although I must admit that the end was a bit sad. And not necessarily so. Best wishes Furdion
