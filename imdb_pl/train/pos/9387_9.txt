As commented on by others, I checked it after Siskel and Ebert exchanged it as one of the top 10 films of the year. What a gift. Then I went to buy to borrow. <br /> <br /> The best offer? Dwight Yoakum stops the truck when he realizes that someone (Cage) is at the top of his taxi. When Cage looks down, he apologizes. "I'm sorry if I scared you." Yoakum throws a gun in Cage's face. "Does this look scared?" Great humor after an exciting (and temporary) escape. <br /> <br /> It really was fun. Continuous observation of the sign "Welcome to Red Rock" evokes a groan and a smiling head tremor. The music has created a hunt, an amazing quality of a film reminiscent of "Twin Peaks". However, unlike the "Twin Peaks", it does not spoil things, going too far in a bizarre way, needing "top" yourself. <br /> <br /> I admit that I watch loans 15-20 times. You see, they had "One thousand miles out of nowhere" (perfectly chosen) playing as a freight train curved down to the desert floor. . with snow-capped mountains in the distance. It was amazing, smooth framing. What's more, I have never seen a better unification of sight and sound in the film. It also fits the story perfectly.
