The title is a sound that makes one of the heroes ride his imaginary trolley along the trash, where characters live. The film is based on a series of stories by Shugoro Yamamoto and tells the story of a group of people who effectively live in ruined houses on the edge of a landfill. It's a mix of laughter and sadness. <br /> <br /> The first color movie of Akcja Kurasowa was something that I wanted to see for a long time. Oddly this was often mentioned as available only in the shortened version from three or four hours of the original due to an error during the execution of some promotional materials. I stick to the full version, waiting for us to see what Kurasowa wants us to see, only to find out in the latest edition of Criterion that the 140-minute version is a full version. <br /> <br /> Finally, we sit down to see the movie last night. I have mixed emotions related to the film. First of all, it is visually connected with each subsequent movie. You can see all the other Kurasowals of the other six movies reflected in this film, right up to the painted sunsets. This is an effective film in its color application and you can understand why he took it so long to the movie, which he would be happy with (of course there are also unsuccessful projects). The film is a visual work of art (although you should remember that you will see it on a widescreen TV, it was filmed 1.33, so it will appear in a normal relationship with the TV.) The rest of the movie is a mixed bag. Part of the problem is that the life of all these people is not fully connected. As separate tales all work well, but as a film whole they do not hang in one. I do not blame Kurasowa because you can not always get things out of the box, especially when someone like Robert Altman, specializing in this type of movie, sometimes bombarded himself. <br /> <br /> It is not saying that there is no reason to watch a movie. Like all of Kurasov's films, there are always reasons to watch his films, regardless of whether they work or not. The first trip of the "trolley" is one of the best things that Kurasowa has ever done and is worth the price of renting. This is one of the most magical moments in film history because the cart is checked and removed. The father and son living in the car move (although ultimately they are very sad) and there are other pieces that shine (like a cast that is great) and you should at least try the movie as something other than a male usually associated with samurai movies or detective stories. <br /> <br /> An intriguing master of the film master, which in this case means that he is better than the success of other filmmakers. <br /> <br /> Between 6 and 7 as a whole, much more in pieces.
