<br /> <br /> What can I say? This is one of the most perfect films ever made. It is a return to glitox, perfect romantic comedies from the 40s, but with a modern accent. The script breaks with wit, grace, humor and tenderness, cinematography is breathtaking (NYC has never looked so beautiful) and of course the cast! Dudley Moore performs his career as Loveable, drunk Arthur Bach. It is also longing and true ... one of the best poems of the film is its poignant "Not everyone who drinks is a poet ... some of us drink because we are not poets". The great Sir John Gielgud won a well-deserved Oscar for the great performance of Hobson, butler and protector of Arthur. Although he considered this a role of "take money and run", he brings to the character all the talent, experience and bravado of a tragidian expert and a cunning comedian. The supporting cast is also beyond this world, from Bach Geraldine Fitzgerald's woman to the bombastic mafioso by Stephen Elliott. <br /> <br /> The score is also extremely memorable and perfectly complements the film. the unfortunate sequel that was born.
