I've been reading Blaise's modesty for several years, picking up belt numbers. After the film with the fiasco that was created many years ago on the basis of the first book "Modesty Blaise", I was surprised that the result was so good. <br /> <br /> I got a movie that was not based on action or violence. The director focused on history and psychology. How was Modesty built based on her own story and what part of her life she influenced her childhood. I think that this thought will give more understanding for the next (hopefully) movie. I just loved old-style movies. <br /> <br /> However, everything was not so good, gambling was not so good. almost boring and unreal. Acting could also be improved. I do not think the bad guy in this movie is real, the only reason he was there was that Modesty could have someone to tell her story. They could also expand the film, showing more about it when building the "Network", but I'll guess that it will be the next movie. <br /> <br /> And please, forgive me my bad English
