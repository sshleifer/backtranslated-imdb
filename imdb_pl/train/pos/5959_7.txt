This film will not be released in the annals of the grand cinema, but it is a great way to spend one and a half hours with your family. The film is finally released on video, where it should have debuted in the first place. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of an eclectic group of friends who gather for dinner, which they called "The Hungry Bachelors Club". Jorja Fox plays a woman who serves as a surrogate to get a down payment for the restaurant she wants to open. Bill Nunn plays a mysterious man who loves Cadillac, who becomes her lover. Fox gives a discreet and moving performance, and Nunn is unfailingly talented as always. Micheal des Barres is a hoot as the main attorney. The cast of the band - consisting of well-known faces - fits together well to liven up this crazy group of characters. It's a good rental and one of the few you can see with the whole family.
