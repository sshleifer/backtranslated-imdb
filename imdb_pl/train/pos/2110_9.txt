So much was written about the plot of the film, a great performance, a script, a melancholy, bittersweet atmosphere, a great direction - what can I add? Just look at one of the most warming hearts, beautifully preserved, moving scenes that have ever been filmed. It is Christmas Eve, and the figure of Frank Morgan (owner of the store - Mr. Matuschek) recovers from a broken marriage and suicide attempt. When each of his employees leaves, he invites them to a Christmas dinner. Each of them politely rejects him. Everyone has plans for their own Christmas Eve. The moving picture is deeply moving at this stage. Frank Morgan gives a show of his career, and this scene easily brings me to tears. Fortunately, we have a happy solution for this unique scene. A new employee, an errand boy, is the last to leave the store for a beautiful snowy street scene. Mr. Matuschek desperately approaches this boy and asks him how much he would like to spend the evening with him, treat him with all the wonderful Christmas dishes that the errand boy probably did not see! lonely like Mr. Matuschek and together can have a great Christmas meal. Every time I see this scene, it moves me. If you can get a stunning look at the DVD with a great trailer with Frank Morgan introducing himself as Mr. Matuschek and the appearance of the director of the film - the talented Ernst Lubitsch. This film is a joy from beginning to end.
