Bill was indeed a cultural fountain, from which emerged a beautiful rainbow fog of social and introspection, inspiring such famous derivatives as Cop Land, The Departed, The Godfather 3, and recently, of course The Wire. <br /> <br /> Thanks to the multi-faceted characters and stories described as "4-dimensional Shakespeare", Bill grabbed you for the collars from the first episode and just did not let you go. <br /> <br /> The show covered, anticipated and even sporadically caused all major world events in 1984-2010. The most famous moment that could be seen was episode 19 of the 5 series, broadcasted on the eve of the second Gulf War. Errant - and eventually ending his career - drug detective Jim Carver for Craig's "Fun Boy" Richardson's apartment at Jasmine Allen Estate in early 2003, was widely regarded as an allegory for the failure of the coalition to find weapons of mass destruction after Iraq's invasion a few months later. <br /> <br /> However, it was the work that Bill did to highlight some of the lesser-known problems faced by police officers and who praised him the most. It was a sympathetic drama covering such sensitive areas as the phobia of helmets, under-uniformed clothing, homosexuality in van, lost clubs, casual drunken drunkenness, siren aversion syndrome (SAS), groin dementia caused by chasing the suspects while wearing an overly starved uniform and many , many other problems that still raise concern, disturb, haunt and excite officers. <br /> <br /> The last word should be addressed to one of Bill's most famous fans, Nelson Mandela: It will not be an exaggeration to say that I would not be able to break through the dark emptiness of loneliness that summarized my last years of imprisonment on Robben Island, if not for the warming heart of the random Reg Hollis buffoonery.
