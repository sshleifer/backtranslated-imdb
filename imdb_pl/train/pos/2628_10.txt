I think Lion King 1 1/2 is one of the best continuations, as if it was not the best of three Lion King movies! In the film Timon and Pumba tell us where they come from and have problems with adjusting to others, such as Timon, who have problems with digging tunnels with other Meercats! Timon and Pumba set out to find their dream place and find them, and soon they will find them, as well as the Simba they pick up, but soon they must choose between their dream location or help Simbie face his evil Uncle Scar and announce his rights as King Lion of the Duma Rock! Filled with great new characters such as Ma Timona (Julie Kavner) and Uncle Max (Jerry Stiller). I think my favorite character was Uncle Max, because he was very cheerful, and the comedian Jerry Stiller, father of Ben Stiller, took the floor. Disney was smart to cast Stiller in this role! Filled with great characters, animation and the story and music of Lion King 1 1/2 is in my opinion the best of all sequels and better than Simba's Pride, although I admit that I really liked it! Lion King 1 1/2 is a great Disney continuation that the whole family can enjoy! It has a good story and is very fun! 10 out of 10!
