I can not believe that I just see this movie - I think maybe I thought it was another movie about bad treatment of slaves and I avoided Roots for the same reason - as I have not seen the Schindler's List yet - I do not want to be "torn" by the pain of others people, no matter how authentic or informative it is to be. <br /> <br /> So I'm guessing that the main thing I noticed in The Color Purple was that it was not that black people were treated badly by whites. Black people were perfectly capable of raping their own daughters - or giving them away to be treated as "slaves" by their "husbands". Watching was painful, but in the end everyone was redeemed, and acting was phenomenal! I could not believe that Oprah was playing at the age of 35! And from the beginning I love Whoopi - it was amazing. I'm so happy that yesterday I felt bad, and Showtime was leading The Color Purple.
