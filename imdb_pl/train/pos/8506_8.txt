. . . but it was on the UHF channel and the reception was very indistinct. I would really like to have this film because I watched it mainly because I am a bus driver and when I saw this movie, I used this model of a bus. Only (during the murder process about 15 years later) I vaguely remember that OJ is one of the stars. I only remember that he was a driver and a bus that was fired and crazy. I was unsuccessfully looking for this movie because I watched it in the mid-1980s. I liked the movie, I do not usually watch thrillers, but after reading the summary in the TV guide and seeing its beginning (though indistinct) I was left with the whole.
