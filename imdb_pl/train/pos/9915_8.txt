I had nowhere to go. I was in flight to Vancouver. I would probably miss this movie if I did not choose Air Canada. Looking at the small screen at the back of the seat in front, I found it captivating and mesmerizing. I made a drift in several places and had to jump, but I had to look at the end. Now I am looking forward to the DVD release in Europe, but if I am paralyzed when I can leave, it will only be discovered! the film gives so much insight and "fills" the story that the photos tell. <br /> <br /> Recommended (if you have time on your hands).
