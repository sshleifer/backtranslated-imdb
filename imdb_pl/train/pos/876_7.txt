Super, extraordinary video from Audiard, Read My Lips is a pulsating, lonely heart thriller. It is perfect for the beautifully gray charisma of Vincent Cassel and has a wonderfully contained performance by Emanuelle Devos. Devos is the repetitive function of Audiard in the same way that KArin Viard appears for Jean-Pierre Jeunet: unconventionally beautiful (it is described by all as unattractive in this film), versatile and capable of creating a subordinate profile. <br /> <br /> This is almost a definition of her role as Carla, an enforced dog bitch, ridiculed by her colleagues using her deafness. And yet he finds the ami d'exploitation, if you like in the former Con Paul. Everyone uses unconventional talents of the other person (theft and reading of lips) to deal with their situations and create unconventional romantic close-ups. Devos / Audiard cope with Carla's deafness and her companion, a distorted internal world with a discreet, stylish style. <br /> <br /> In this film (2001), Audiard now clearly controls his approach to tension, action and investing in a framework with a real experience that will become a huge hit - the Prophet - nine years later. 7/10
