Netflix should mention this short feature in the information for Silk Stockings. Perfect in every respect for this overproduction of down. It had much better Cole Porter songs and a lot more energy. Silk stockings turned out to be a huge disappointment. Fred was too old for such things, although dances and Cyd are beautiful. I will be in the clock for the Ninotchka Garbo version - Melvyn Douglas. Did Peter Lorre get sick while creating Silk Stockings - he seems to be very passive in more active numbers and with fewer lines? I am very happy that I accidentally came across Paree - Paree. It made the whole experience a lot nicer. Bob Hope as a simple "song and dance" is pure joy.
