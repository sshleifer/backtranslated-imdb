I loved this movie. He was almost the same as the first (cabin on the lake), only instead of killing women, he also kills men. And the scenes are much more interesting, two of my favorite scenes are first, when Stanley and Allison are in a dance club, and he describes Kimberly's last moments before he gets thrown into the water, and second, when Stanley visits Allison in his basement , just before going down on the set, when he kisses him. These scenes were very intense and thrilling for me. I gave the film an 8/10 rating, not because the movie was bad, but because filming was bad, I mean, there were times when you noticed that nothing was wrong, like filming it in the usual way, film shot "Live" from the camera is not visible, but then you will notice very little filming errors. what went wrong??
