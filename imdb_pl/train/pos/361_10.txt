As I said at the top, four stars are not enough. This is one of the best movies I've seen in almost 17 years of my life. For people who really do not like it or do not understand it, you can not have real appreciation for the art or you can have a short period of attention. <br /> <br /> Even if I have not seen all of his films, I must say that it is Spielberg at its top. It is very sad that films as big as "The Color Purple" do not appear too often, because I think that we all desperately need the highest quality movie entertainment in these difficult times. <br /> <br /> Films like this are more than just movies; they are works of art that should be appreciated more. <br /> <br /> The idea that he was nominated for the 11 Oscars (even Best Picture of the Year) and did not receive one trophy, is a sign of how blind and stupid Hollywood can sometimes be. Spielberg was not even nominated for the best director award! He should sweep the Oscars this year. <br /> <br /> The film clearly shows how unjust some people's lives are. <br /> <br /> If only the films were so good ...
