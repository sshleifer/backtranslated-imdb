Hollywood North is a satirical look at Canadian film history when the Canadian government offered huge tax breaks for films made in Canada. Most of the time, he was treated as a tax shelter or a cheap way to produce American movies. For example, he left Porky. In any case, Matthew Modine plays a novice producer who wants to adapt to his favorite Canadian novel. However, to get money, I need an American star. He gets a loose gun and learns that he has to compromise to such an extent that the film no longer resembles the book on which he was originally based. It plays well in Canada, but it may not be understood outside the Great White North. The Americans will think that we are satirizing ourselves, but we will lose the point that we are satirizing them. For Canadians 8/10 for the rest of the world 5/10.
