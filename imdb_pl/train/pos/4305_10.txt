The Grand Canyon is a very strange bird. It is a completely unique urban song, in which the connection of the whole story would not give much. <br /> <br /> It seems that the main theme is the inherent uncertainty of life of people of every race, background and station. But to proclaim that the theme of the film will be monstrously lower its scope. Similarly, pigeonholing it in a particular genre is futile. <br /> <br /> The film has a lot to say, though probably different volumes for each viewer, and says it all in such a dishonest way from so many angles that in the end I can not even define my main message for myself. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, he does it with such laser precision; each prop, dialogue line and music bar in the background, contributing to the ubiquitous mood and powerful message that I am pleasantly surprised and after each visit very nice. Still, he does not feel stifling. A brilliant movie with a great cast and everything that works.
