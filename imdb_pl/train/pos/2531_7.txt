A really good horror with the biggest, Boris Karloff and Bel Lugosi. Dr Janos Rukh (Karloff) is on an expedition in Africa, trying to find an ancient meteorite. Once found, Rukh is poisoned by its radiation. Everything he touches dies, and the dark side of Rukh makes him an egoistic murderer. His friend, Dr. Felix Benet (Lugosi), finds a limited solution to the problem and at the same time realizes that radiation can be used for the good of humanity by treating diseases. Two monsters will fight for the possibility of radiation. Quite good special effects. Others in the cast: Frances Drake, Frank Lawton, Beulah Bondi and Frank Reicher.
