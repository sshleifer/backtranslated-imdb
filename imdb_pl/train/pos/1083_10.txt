Another example of Cary Grant's exceptional talents. A performance worthy of the Oscar, but once again rejected by the Academy. Mr. Grant leads the range from stupid to gentle in this wonderful comedy about a man who decides to move out of a big city. House building traps are well described and have become the basis (loosely) for Tom Hanks's more modern vehicle, "The Money Pit." <br /> <br /> If you like a good old-fashioned comedy without a curse and free sex, this movie is a must.
