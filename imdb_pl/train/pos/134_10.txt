Someone releases this movie on DVD so that he can dedicate his place as one of the greatest movies of all time in ten to twenty years, when critics and film historians look back on so-called movies from the 90s and see how wicked they were mostly, and how Lars Von Trier tried to revolutionize and enliven the world of international film with this masterpiece. In its present form, "Zentropa" (or "Europe", as it is called outside the US) is one of the most fascinating and artistic views on the bleak and almost psychotic uncertainty that leaked from Europe after the Second World War, namely the decimated German landscape whose physical horrors only matched the destruction of her people's psyche. Von Trier magnificently paints his vision on the screen. You'll feel like you're watching a lost classic noir spy from the late forties with perfectly illuminated black and white scenes, and you feel that you are on the verge of something out of the edge, especially in scenes such as killing on board a train. Literally, when you see this movie, you are a witness to the evolution of the art form. <br /> <br /> For some reason, Von Trier soon caught up with Dogma's own movement. And although his "Breaking the Waves" and "Dancer in the Dark" are in themselves classics, it is with "Zentropa" really raised the art of making films for new, exciting heights. 10/10, he is aging like a good wine and begging for a DVD.
