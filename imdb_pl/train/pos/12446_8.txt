Having heard about Modesty Blaise before, but never reading a novel or comic, my wife and I liked the film very much. He delivered, in a captivating way, a good introduction to the character and its background. <br /> <br /> Although it has some moving elements, it is a more intimate game, perfectly written. Unfortunately, this is also the place where a serious film defect is revealed. The intimate game is based on the capabilities of its actors and unfortunately only half of the cast has been released. While Alexandra Staden did a great job as Modesty Blaise, her counterpart Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau - as a villain Miklos - no. Smiling through the story, as if it were an advertisement for an enlarged toothpaste, it does not build an atmosphere of anxiety that would make a movie masterpiece. The supporting cast is somewhat similar, from some stereotypical gangsters and weirdos to decent performances by Fred Pearson as Professor Loba and Eugenia Yuan as Irina.
