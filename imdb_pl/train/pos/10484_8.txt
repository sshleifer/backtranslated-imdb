The charming does not even begin to describe "Saving Grace"; it is absolutely irresistible! Anyone who ventures into this movie, goes with his spirit soaring high (haha). <br /> <br /> Grace Trevethyn (Brenda Blethyn) has just lost her husband, but her problems will continue to worsen. Her dearly she left her without money and overdue debts. In the face of losing everything, he must find a way to get a lot of cash ... quickly! He comes up with an idea when her gardener Matthew (Craig Ferguson) asks a famous gardener for advice on a plant that is secretively growing. Grace immediately realizes that his plant is marijuana, so they decide to use their gardening skills to grow a lot of high-quality weeds and then sell them to pay back outstanding debts. <br /> <br /> The most noticeable quality about "Saving Grace" is his sympathy. Each character is extremely nice and, except for the first 20 minutes, the movie is a non-stop good mood. Everyone wants a happy ending for everyone, even if it means turning a blind eye to some illegal activities. <br /> <br /> Acting is at the highest level. Brenda Blethyn is one of the best British actresses and here's why. It changes what could have been a caricature, a fully living and breathing individual. She is a nice lady, but she is not stupid. Craig Ferguson is as nice as Matthew. He is a loser, but he is so nice that it does not matter. The rest of the band also fits this category, but Tcheky Karyo deserves special attention. A French actor always has an aura of threat around him and it suits him well, but he also has great comedy skills. <br /> <br /> Nigel Cole finds the perfect tone for "Saving Grace". It's about charm. One of the problems I have with British humor is that all energy seems to be exhausted from the movie. Not so here. The film is very nice and always fun. This does not mean that "Saving Grace" is simply a nice movie that will leave you with a smile and a good feeling. Although this movie is not an out-out comedy, it has two or three scenes that are hysterical. <br /> <br /> If there is a problem with the movie, then the culmination is a bit misleading. The answers to the questions, however, are the ending and unexpected turn of the action. <br /> <br /> See "Saving favors," especially when you're having a bad day.
