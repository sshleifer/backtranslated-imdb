Not many reviews, so I thought I would add one. <br /> <br /> DO NOT GO THROUGH OTHER OPINIONS! It was an excellent movie. <br /> <br /> RKS is one of the few Indian directors who can create a really good movie. <br /> <br /> AB and Akshay have given another example of a great bhoomika, which was a bit unexpected, but great to watch. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised that there was not much buzz around the release. <br /> <br /> Or filmfare / other nominations rewards, considering how good the movie was. <br /> <br /> Better than Khakee, I thought and thought Khakkee was a good movie too. <br /> <br /> Is it quite a long movie, but definitely worth it and it seems to be long when you watch it. <br /> <br /> I can not wait for the next RKS movie and the next AB, the Akshay movie always seems to work well together ... for example, waqt. <br /> <br /> Bhoomika also worked very well in the movie and it should do really well if it continues in the same way in the future.
