Anyone who saw the Passion of Christ Mel Gibson and was concerned about bloody violence would like to see this film. Although it was not a success in the box office or television ranking, The Fox Movie Channel still finds a really good theme to show it once and for all. I liked the way they trained Chris Sarandon and the men who introduced his students to sing in Hebrew. Although Sarandon did not have long hair, like any other Jesus in other movies, his appearance is very similar to what a Jew would appear. What surprised or surprised me was the scene in which Caiaphas told Jesus about Pilate: "And never forget that you are a Jew!" Though it was not a racist remark, Colin Blakely tried to make Chris Sarandon look like garbage in the eyes of eminent people of that time. The portrait of Pilate Keith Michell was enormous compared to his previous performances in "The Story of Jakub and JÃ³zef" and "Historia Dawida". But if you compare his portrait of Pilate with Telly Savala or Hurd Hatfield, you can say that he really did paint the impression of a Roman prosecutor.
