I caught an evening at the cinema with a friend. The evening is a chick without apologies for it, but I can say with relief that estrogen is not so saturated that it is painful to see a man with bloody blood. With the exception of a single appearance at the very end of the film, I watched with interest and did not have to turn around or roll my eyes at a melodrama of self-satisfaction. Ladies, for their part, they will certainly love this film. <br /> <br /> Ann Lord is older, bedridden, and spends the last few days on Earth as comfortable as possible in her own home with two grown daughters in her party. Anxious about the memories of the past, Ann suddenly summons the name of a man her daughters have never heard before: Harris. While both of her daughters silently consider the importance of her mother's strong desire to remember and regenerate her unfortunate affair with this mysterious man at this time of all time, Ann comes back to the memorable day she met Harris - and so we lost our youthful optimism at the future that we all inevitably part with. <br /> <br /> Both Ann and her two daughters - one with spouses with children, one of the series "commophobe" - struggle with the main question whether true love really exists, and maybe even more important if true love survives the test of time. Are we convinced throughout the day that love never lasts forever? Will we all realize that accounting for the imperfect is the only realistic result? The subtle fact that older Ann is still struggling to answer these questions on her deathbed is not lost on two daughters. <br /> <br /> Photos to the evening are interesting - most of the movie is published in Ann's mind, as the past remembers, and for this reason I think the film was filmed as if it was intentionally overexposed to give everyone an ethereal glow (and thus, make it very clear that all this is not true, but it has gone back to the past). Claire Danes is beautiful (she seems really, really tall, but in reality she only has 5 "5") and she is absolutely captivating in one climactic scene in which her vocal talents are finally put to the test. <br /> <br /> You really can not talk about the laughter of the cast that leads from Claire Danes and does not let go: Vanessa Redgrave, Patrick Wilson, Meryl Streep and Glenn Close fill the other main minor roles in the movie. br /> <br /> I can not say anything negative about this movie at all, although Hugh Dancy's fight to emerge from absolute one-dimensionality is ultimately a total loss. Playing bad, beloved drunken offspring with obscenely rich people who face a great bravado but secretly afraid that they will never achieve anything, probably does not offer much in the way of character exploration - he had his orders and kept to them. <br /> <br /> In the end, gentlemen, your friend will surely cry, and probably not feel so affected, the evening will certainly not be a waste of time to watch the evening. Catch it in cinemas or take it as a rental to get points for when you want to accompany Die Hard 4 or the upcoming Rambo movie. It will be your little secret that watching did not really cost you anything.
