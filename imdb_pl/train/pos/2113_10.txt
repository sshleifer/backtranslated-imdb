The location of the shop around the corner is precisely defined at the beginning of the movie, Balta Street in Budapest, but it can be really anywhere. A small number of sets reflect the Central European project, but it can be a shop on every corner. The film does not concern Budapest or the retail trade in leather goods, but the ups and downs of love, reflected in most of the main characters. <br /> <br /> Alfred Kralik and Klara Novak sparring partners at work, but their anonymous letters to each other are full of hope, aspirations and romance, and history develops to beautifully combine these two aspects. Hugo Matuschek, the store owner, has trouble with his wife, she only has a voice at the end of the phone. Ferencz Vadas has a secret affair. Ilona Novodny has a gentleman who buys her fur clothes. Mr. Pirovitch's life revolves around his wife and children. Pepi Katona "Santa's game" girl for Christmas. You feel even this quiet Flora Katchuck, staying at home with her mother, dreaming of someone. <br /> <br /> The screenplay is a masterpiece of comedy and drama. It moves effortlessly from stage to stage. This is one of those silent films that render back and forth over and over again, simple but deep. Dialogue reflects a statement that is not common today. <br /> <br /> The whole game is great. Even small characters, such as a waiter in a cafe and a policeman on the street, are perfect. James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan are having fun. He really got into his step as an actor and gives a sweet and sharp performance. Margaret Sullavan was a great actress and underestimated these days. Some of her other films are worth catching. Like Mr. Matuschek, Frank Morgan is amazing. His moment of truth is very moving. Golden stars for all performers. <br /> <br /> It is a well-known phrase that they do not do it like they used to (The vague repetition of "You've Got Mail" was horrible), but in this case it's true. Fortunately, director Lubitsch is not in farce mode, but he has provided a classic film about the spirit, charm and warm humanity.
