This is the most convincing and excellent performance Robert Taylor ever gave. It even surpasses his great performance "Johnny Eager", which will come fully after 14 years from this film. His appearance is still wonderful, but now he has a maturity that gives him an advantage in this brutal, brutal role. Charlie Gilson (Taylor) is the last of his race, a buffalo hunter who kills not for money but for pleasure. His savage killing not only buffalo, but also people is staggering. He is basically a lonely man, in need of people around him, but they do not like him because of his sociopathic behavior. His partner is Sandy McKenzie (Stewart Granger), who has enough of hunting, and goes only further because he is a failure of anything else. On the way, Charlie kills the Indian family and gives beautiful Debras Pagent. Charlie tries to seduce her unsuccessfully, but he sees that Sandy is interested in her too. Granger is a little sad looking at the fact that he is fed up with hunting, wanting to leave the girl and her child. Lloyd Nolan as a drunk skinner is wonderful with his wise cracks and accordion. Russ Tamblyn plays a half-race trying to fit into the white world. The group is a strange combination of good and evil, young and old. In the end, Taylor is scared by buffalo, like many hunters in front of him, and escapes from Sandy with a girl. After returning that night, Sandy leaves with the woman, putting Charlie back to the killing rage on her mission to get Sandy and have a girl for herself. The last confrontation takes place in a snow storm, and the last scene is so shocking that you will never forget it. This is Taylor's film and he was a really underrated actor of the era.
