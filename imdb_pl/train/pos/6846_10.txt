The film gets my stamp of approval. The scene in the museum requires action without dialogue. This is one of the most interesting and unique scenes in the history of the film. Dickinson's character Kate is very well developed, and her performance is felt throughout the movie. The best Angie Dickinson's job since Point Blank!
