Usually I'm not too busy with a specific performance (except for the OC and Desperate Housewives ... hey, I'm 20 years old!), But I'm not kidding, after one episode of Reunion I was addicted. <br /> <br /> I can not even say how stunned I was that his time period was against Bush's speech last night because I really could not wait for the 1987 episode that will be broadcast this Thursday. Again this conflict was unfavorable, because being a new show, it must build an imitation and push the second episode back for a week kills the impetus. <br /> <br /> He said that television is not always worth being an Emma to be pleasant. I do not expect Reunion to take home any prizes, but I expect him to be able to capture my attention throughout the season. Have you ever watched the first few episodes of your beloved exhibition years later? Sometimes you wonder how you came up. Character building takes some time. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, one episode of an idea is great every year. The only other program I can recall is doing something similar, 24, and each episode is an hour ... and a year full of events is more realistic than an eventful day! Please give this show a shot. Relax in the form of art ... it's just a TV!
