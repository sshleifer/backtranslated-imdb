It's a great drama and a pleasant change of pace compared to today's hectic and loud movies. This is another solid store based on a real store, which still means that many of them could be composed for dramatic purposes. Honestly, I do not know, but I liked the story. <br /> <br /> The story is about a young man from the 1950s who is interested in rockets and wants to enter this field instead of working in coal mines like everyone else, including his father, in this city in West Virginia. The big problem is the conflict between the boy and his father, which in my opinion was exaggerated. I would like to have a little less tension between the two. <br /> <br /> A young man, still a boy, is played by Jake Gyllenhaal, one of his first assignments, I think. He is sympathetic, just like his school buddies here. It's nice to see nice kids in a modern movie. Two other key actors in the film are Chris Cooper (dad) and Laura Dern (a kid's teacher who encourages him all the time.) <br /> <br /> The pictures are decent, the soundtrack from the 50s is pleasant to listen to. Once again: I wish you more of this kind of films made today.
