Audiard made a very interesting movie here. It starts with the description of the almost deaf young woman in her working universe as a secretary; is ignored, frustrated, rejected ... Hiring a trainee as an assistant seems to be a way for her to find someone in her life: but the guy just goes out of jail. Both of them rejected by society gradually combine them. The character's description is rich, goes into details ... they begin to help each other; because he can read on the lips, which turns out to be very useful for him ... He will gradually evolve, away from what it was at the beginning. <br /> <br /> It's beautifully filmed; the whole is very convincing, even if at the end it turns into a noir movie. The gesture is particularly well watched in filming Audiard. Emmanuelle Devos should be nominated for Best Actress Cesar Award for his main game. The action at the end of the film makes it impossible for her to simply "etude de moeurs". It's really surprisingly fun: 8/10.
