It is a great, absurd horror, which captures the essence of the mid and late 80's obsessions, which was supposedly the music of evil. I remember that when I was a kid, I was scared by teenagers from metal. It does not help that when I was ten years old, I found a desecrated grave in the cemetery in my hometown. It turns out that this strange metal kid has dug a few old bodies and used their bones in some strange sacrifice for Satan. So maybe something like that has discouraged me for some time, but now I love it as a 24-year-old. <br /> <br /> I bought this DVD for 6 bucks and I expected it to suck because of poor, but to my surprise it ruled. It's about the extreme demonic power of metal. And you must love the scene in which the guitar shoots lashes and pairs headbangers in the crowd. This movie is amazing, if you love metal from the 80s and bad movies, this one is for you. 9/10!
