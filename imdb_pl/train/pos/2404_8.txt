I'm a huge fan of M Lillard, that's why I finished watching this movie. Honestly, I doubt if he would be in the movie, I would like him or even look at it, but when I looked at it, I realized that the story was pretty decent. The bad ending I have to say, but I saw it coming. It's a low-budget movie, and some of the actors were not really good, but in total I rated this film 7/10. <br /> <br /> Suspending wondering what Lillard was actually doing was what really stopped me interested in this movie. <br /> <br /> It's a good rental! <br /> <br /> 7/10
