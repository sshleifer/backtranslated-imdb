Pecker is a hilarious, yet twisted film about a small town in Baltimore, whose everyday, dark routine is broken by Pecker, a young photographer who takes pictures of "real things". No pretty models, great men just living. This wonderful film ridicules the plasticity of the city's artistic chain. There is one particular scene in which a homeless woman who is shopping at Pecker's savings store buys exactly the same coat as one of Whitney's junkies for only 25 cents instead of five hundred dollars. This shows that no matter what money you have, you may not always have the taste. Once again, John Waters sends you into an endless spiral of laughter and austere reality. You can have your main Hollywood movies with special touches and mountains of stars, but give me "Pecker" or "Hairspray" (another excellent movie by John Waters) over "Titanic" or "Godzilla" every day !!
