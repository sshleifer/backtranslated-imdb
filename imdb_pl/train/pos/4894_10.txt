I grew up while the music in this film was popular. What a great time for music and dancing! My only complaint was that I was a little too young to go to the USO and night clubs. I'm guessing it sounds like I've lived in the past (I have great memories), so what's the matter with it? !!? The Second World War was a terrible time, except when it came to music. The death of Glenn Miller was a terrible sadness for us. This movie will be my favorite. Clio Laine was perfect; what a voice! I do not know how long I missed this movie. The main reason for this comment is the warning of the modern generation about the alternative to Rap and New Age music, which is offensive to me. Watch this video and give it a chance!
