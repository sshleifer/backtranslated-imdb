I saw this movie when I was traveling around Brazil. It was difficult for me to really understand Brazilian culture and society because it has so many regional and class differences. Watching this movie in Sao Paulo itself was a revelation. It shows something from the daily lives of many Brazilians. On the other hand, sometimes it is slightly dramatized. And this is the only negative comment I have about this movie. Sometimes there is too much, too much sex, too much murder and too much cynicism for one movie. The director was able to film some things a little more subtly, which would make the movie more effective. <br /> <br /> Still, I liked the movie and the way the story unfolds. The characters are complex and very much like people in real life. Not very American actors and actresses with many cosmetics, but people who can be ugly and beautiful at the same time. This makes the film realistic, even if the story is not so convincing.
