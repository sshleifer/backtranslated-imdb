I found this movie available for streaming on Netflix and thought I would try. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around Ryan and Theo Taylor (Colm Feore and David Cubitt), who finally saw each other after their father died. Ryan and Theo at the beginning argue about who did what. But then Theo learns that his brother Ryan is not only gay, but dies because of a deadly disease. So Ryan and Theo spend their time patching out differences. <br /> <br /> This is such an amazing movie. I only saw Colm Feore in season 7, but he was phenomenal. David Cubitt, an actor I've never heard of before, also did a phenomenal job. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to those who are interested in gays and lesbians. It's one movie you do not want to miss. <br /> <br /> I give this film 10 stars out of 10. Excellent movie!
