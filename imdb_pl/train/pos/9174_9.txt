There were many film and television productions by Jane Eyre, each of which was aimed at their recommendation, but I suspect that this is the one that people will discover and fall in love with in decades. It's just a classic (and offers much more history than others). Timothy Dalton is completely in his element as Rochester, he rarely lacks a mark; its performance is surprisingly agile and multicolored, yet it does not go too far from the dark complexities of the characters. Jane Zelah Clarke is more wise than unearthly, but creates a perfect foil for Dalton (who, accordingly, dominates over her!). ). There are a few technical errors and a few moments where production values ​​could be better; although it was largely a top-class production according to BBC standards from those times. But it is the performances that are a real pleasure. Do not miss it!
