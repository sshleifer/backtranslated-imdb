Several features of this movie are immediate. The sound is rather penetrating and we realize what great progress has been made in sound reproduction in the years to come. The language of dialogue is rather peculiar and unnatural, and acting still resembles its transition from stage techniques. <br /> <br /> Bette Davis always gives a strong performance in all her films, just like in the early days of her very successful career. I feel, however, that the cockney accent does not match the face. I think that this is the adopted accent of cockney, which does not sound true to me. <br /> <br /> Somerset Maughan loves to delve into human relations of great dramatic intensity that will please all viewers. Like many other characters, Bette Davis can change a beautiful, seductive woman into a viper full of fiery hatred. Leslie Howard is well manned as a withdrawn English artist with a club foot desperate to find a partner and making the wrong choice in an intriguing little waitress. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, the young doctor meets his true love on a busy street. They pass through a movement completely unaware of the multitude of screams and whistles. This scene is probably supposed to be fun, but it seems quite funny in this very serious movie. This is probably intended to send you home with a smile on your face. In the end, as far as we see (and we hope), it is a happy ending.
