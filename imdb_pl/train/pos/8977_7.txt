In the film it is only 4, but for fans of the movie from the 1940s it is almost mandatory and evaluates 9 as a show of a change! I was attracted to watch it thanks to the presence of Richard (Captain Midnight) Webb, who plays the colonel responsible for this event. What surprised me was the stunning performance of Doris Day. Besides "Calamity Jane," I've never seen a song better than she was here. Randolph Scott is also unforgettable, even if he does not see much time on the screen. It's been some time since I watched the movie, but I was pretty sure that Humphrey Bogart appeared. With so many familiar faces it is difficult to follow. If you ever get on the TV station nearby, remember to catch the Doris Day sequence if nothing else! <br /> <br />
