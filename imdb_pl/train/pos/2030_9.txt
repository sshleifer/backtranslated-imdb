The man from Snowy River II does not rediscover the wheel, but it is pleasant for the public, a beautiful movie that hits great notes. <br /> <br /> For those fans who want the elements that made the original Man From Snowy River movie a hit (breathtaking landscapes, extensive results, sweet romanticism and cracking action) this movie really delivers. This story begins a few years after completing the first, Jim (Tom Burlinson) left to collect a fortune in horse breeding. He returns to get to the place where he finished, with his courageous, well-bred, beloved Jessica (played by the Australian divine lady Sigrid Thornton), who is still trying to break free from her corset upbringing at the station of cattle with feathers (Harrison is now played by American Dennehy). Foil for Jim and the character who shakes the story is a well-to-do snob from the Alistair Patton (Nicholas Eadie) class, who is interested in Jessica. Add some social tension surrounding the property and stallion to the mix with the wrong attitude from the first movie and the story. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie is acting. Tom Burlinson fits into Jim's wide hat and laconic humor. Sigrid Thornton is a beautiful heroine, and they both manage real chemistry on the screen. Filling the solid shoes of Kirk Douglas will never be easy, and Brian Dennehy stomps and screams, but he never feels very authentic in this part. <br /> <br /> The music is wide and lush, and the photos can be a roll from the Victoria tourist reel. There are moments that give the impression of being very indulgent, as the director wants one more picture of the helicopter of the riders to show how great the landscape is without a personal drama. A little more grit would be enough, we are Aussie, we can do it !! There are moments of JAWSish with a stallion who opposes faith. However, the funny thing about this movie is that there are really ingenious and moving scenes among some glaring stereotypes. Jim puts his saddle on the stallion (VERY Horse Whisperish before his time) Jim and Jessica are standing at home, a great scene where Jim shows Alistair's ride with his trusted whip. I can see why this character is such an icon. <br /> <br /> All in all a very pleasant continuation. We hope everyone involved wants to do something different. Man from Snowy River III: The CRAIGS. I'm sure we'd all like to see Jim and Jessica doing it on their farm. <br /> <br /> Aussie DVD contains some additional scenes. It's worth it if you're already a fan.
