I just read the storyline and it's the worst I've ever read. It does not do justice to this amazing movie. An example of a good summary can be found in the "Turner Classical films" list. In any case, it was one of my favorite films as a small child. My sister and I could not wait until April, when we see it on T.V. This is one of the best films about horse times. This is one of those great classics that the whole family can see. Romance is clean and endearing. The story is interesting and the songs are great. They do not make such films anymore. Good performance, not advantage. Pat Boone and Shirley Jones are in the best shape, like many other great actors.
