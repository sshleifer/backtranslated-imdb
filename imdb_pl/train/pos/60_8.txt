"Home Room", like "Zero Day" and "Elephant", was inspired by the recent wave of school shootings. But unlike the other two films, "Home Room" focuses on two survivors (no shooters or dead) in the wake of the shooting. Making it less exploitative and more useful, because little effort is wasted on asking questions that are not answered. <br /> <br /> Do not give up on this little movie for the first 20 minutes, it should be set up for real story, but it plays like a rejected episode of "Hill Street Blues". It's bad, but they endure it, at least long enough for the film to be classified as a function. I recommend skipping it completely and just jump to hospital scenes - there is nothing that can not be picked up from the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Like many good small movies, it was creatively a one-man performance by Paul F. Ryan was both a writer and a director. Although this arrangement does not guarantee a good movie, it is usually a good sign, because it will mean a certain unity of design and performance, which is often lacking in large dramatic budget functions. Because the "Home Room" scenario is his real strength, it is fortunate that the writer made this production and assured that his vision will hit the screen. <br /> <br /> Ryan has a huge chance with the ending, which checks the limits of the sentimental tolerance of the average viewer. He leads him to the edge, but despite all logic, he leaves the cry instead of cowering. Why the ending songs are a combination of the audience's need for the reward at the end of this kind of trip, the song ("Sweet Surrender" by Sarah McLaughlin), which comes out, and the amazing edition of the last minute. <Br /> <br /> Another strong point of the film is the cast Busy Phillips (Alicia) and Erika Christensen (Deanna) as the main characters. Although Phillips plays his typical alien teenager, and Christensen, his intelligent daughter of a good family, they both bring more roles to their roles than ever before. The family life of both girls is more than satisfactory and not very interesting for Ryan. What is happening here concerns two of them, despite the lame story of a police detective who is thinking about the city, trying to connect Alicia with a lone shooter. If they ever cut and trim the film, this story should be condensed. <br /> <br /> The story of two very different girls who connect and help each other is not a new idea, and Ryan could easily control the film in clich√© and predictability. But instead, his script makes them engage in a fascinating and persuasive sparring match, slowly rejecting each other and sharing moments of vulnerability, just to retreat back. Deanna's line "I'm dying inside" tears you apart - I can not think of a moment in any other movie that's as intense as this one. He desperately needs a connection that Alicia is equally desperate for. Deanna makes progress only when she withdraws. The viewer still expects a group that will never happen. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, it not only generates a lot of tension, but allows you to admire both heroes and two actresses who have implemented them. <br /> <br /> Again what do I know? I'm just a kid.
