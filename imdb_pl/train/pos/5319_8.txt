Forget it's a "B" movie. Forget it is outdated in many respects. Instead, screenwriter Ida Lupino deserves credit for dealing with a theme that at the time (1950) was a taboo subject in Hollywood. As far as I know, it was the first movie that touched on the subject of rape and the emotional and psychological effects that this crime has on victims. <br /> <br /> Although most cast actors are at best pedestrian, which at the time was eighteen or nineteen, gives a great performance of the whole traumatic young woman, Ann, who tries to escape from her "shame". Based on her work in this film, I am surprised that she did not have a more successful acting career. Also, Tod Andrews has some great moments when the minister who helps her. <br /> <br /> Ms. Lupino, of course working on a limited budget, was still able to create some unforgettable scenes, such as chasing the streets and alleys leading to rape, and then the police depot. And she created a bittersweet ending that made me wonder if Ann really could live a normal life again.
