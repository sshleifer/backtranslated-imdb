I really like 101 Dalmations, when it appeared in 1996, now 5 years later I went to see 102 dalmatia in 2001, I thought it was fantastic, but I think that 101 is better because I think it is more fun, more humorous , and this movie was based on the same story as the comic version (one hundred Dalmatian (1961)), I wonder if there are plans for 103 Dalmatia. I hope that yes, maybe yes, maybe not, all of us Dalmatian fans will have to to find out if there are 103 Dalmatians in the future.
