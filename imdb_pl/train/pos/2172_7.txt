`Mad Dog 'Earle returns with her sad sack minor Marie and this variable club foot Velma. Same as Babe and Red, Doc and Big Mac, and even mutt Pard, who chews sceneries. The only thing missing is good reason to convert High Sierra Raoul Walsh 14 years later, without thinking about the line or the frame, and it does it with talent noticeably rung or two down the ladder than in the original. (Instead of Walsh, we get Stuart Heisler, for Humphrey Bogart we get Jack Palance, for Ida Lupino Shelley Winters, etc.). The only change is that this time instead of black and white, it's in Warnercolor; Unfortunately, there are those who will count it as an improvement. <br /> <br /> And Died A Thousand Times may be unnecessary? and worse? but at least it's not a parody; history still works on its own amazing conditions. Earle (Palance), freshly removed from a pen near Chicago, goes west to lead a great job, originated by the ill king Lon Chaney, Jr. ?? knocking on the mountain resort. Along the way, he nearly collides with the Oakies family when he is delighted with their granddaughter; smiting occurs even when she discovers that she is lame. Arriving in the cabins where the rest of the gangs are located, he finds amateurs on throats and Winters who throws himself at him (like a dog). Waiting until they call their inner man at the hotel, Palance (to Winter's worry) offers payment for the surgery to cure the girl's deformity, a gesture that turns around. Then the surgical strike into the resort turns into a bloodbath. On Lamas, Palance moves up into the cold Sierry .... <br /> <br /> It's quite an absorbing story, skillfully made, which lack of divination Walsh and his cast brought him in 1941, in God's year, with this role and the role of Sam Spade in Maltese Sokole became a star. And the last, heretical remark: these mountains look great in color. <br /> <br />
