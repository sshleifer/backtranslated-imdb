Good night Mister Tom is so beautifully filmed and beautifully realized. He is not completely faithful to the book, but does it have to be this way? No, not at all. John Thaw is mesmerizing like Tom Oakley. His transformation from harsh to caring was so well realized that she became more credible than Scrooge in carols. Inspector Morsera is the best hour of thaw. He was seriously matched by a young Nick Robinson who fully convincedly portrayed an evacuated traumatic relationship with his mother. The script and music made it worthwhile to buy, and to see Thaw playing organ. Amazing! The most moving scene was Willie who learned about Zak's death, and then Tom told him about his deceased family who died of scarlatina. Buy it, you will love it! 10/10 Bethany Cox
