Actually, I found the film "interesting"; in the end, one worth my time to watch and rent. That's right ... some of the scenes were at the top of emotionalism, screaming, etc. But what movie does not emphasize his program, genre or "ax for grinding"? Almost nothing! I was surprised that I read the review in another place made by reviewer S.Fran on another reviewing website, but I decided that his negative review is a more detailed description of his "own" review of the film; not from the movie at all. Everyone who watches this movie will realize that it is great to recommend to family and friends; no car chases, yes! Being an "Italian" family, I can fully refer to the environment shown on the screen. The film also has parts with a tear of tears. What real life can be in such an environment. Nice movie.
