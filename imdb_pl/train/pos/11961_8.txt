I thought it was a great way to spend time on a hot summer weekend, sitting in an air-conditioned theater and watching a light comedy. The plot is simplified, but the dialogue is witty, and the characters are friendly (even the bread of a good suspect serial killer). While some may be disappointed when they realize that this is not Match Point 2: Risk Addiction, I thought it was proof that Woody Allen is still in control of the style that many of us have come to love. <br /> <br /> It was the most that I had laughed at one of Woody's comedy for years (dare I say a decade?). Although I was never impressed by Scarlet Johanson, she managed to soften her "sexy" image and jump straight into an average but thrilling young woman. <br /> <br /> This may not be the crown jewel of his career, but it was a lot stranger than "Devil Wears Prada" and more interesting than "Superman" a great comedy to see with friends.
