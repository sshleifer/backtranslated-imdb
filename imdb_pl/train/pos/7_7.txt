Although I did not like Stanley and Iris as a movie, I admired acting. Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro are great in this film. I have not always been a fan of Fonda's work, but here it is both delicate and strong. De Niro has the ability to play any role in actor gold. He gives a great performance in this film and is a great scene in which he must take his father home for the elderly, because he can no longer take care of him, which will break your heart. I really would not recommend this movie as a great movie entertainment, but I will say that you will not see anything better.
