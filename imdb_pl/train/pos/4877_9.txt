Actually one particular person / character is not "there", but my summary refers to the power of the film. And all this is achieved without any fancy camera movements and / or large production sets, but with a great story and very (credible) and good actors transmitting history (arc). <br /> <br /> You can call it a song accompanying great Japanese movies / movies (such as Tokyo Story, etc.), obviously not so much historical, but more romantic! Great acting, nuances in performances that are really jewels. If you want to experience a touching story and want to see a film that affects you emotionally, this is one of them. As you have noticed (as in the case of many of my reviews), I do not go into history. There are places in IMDb where you can watch them, I'm not the one who ruin the story at all!
