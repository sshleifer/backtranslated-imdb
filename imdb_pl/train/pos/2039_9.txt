First of all, I would like to emphasize that the people who criticized this film made several glaring mistakes. Anything that has a rating below 6/10 is definitely a complete nonsense. <br /> <br /> Creep is an absolutely fantastic movie with amazing movie effects. The actors are very credible, the narrative provokes thinking, and horror and graphic content are extremely disturbing. <br /> <br /> There are many secrets in this film. There are many questions when the audience is revealed to a strange and bizarre creature that creates a habitat in dark tunnels ridden on rats. How was "Craig" created and what happened to him? <br /> <br /> Fantastic movie with a big cool factor. A film with many unanswered questions and a movie that should be appreciated along with others such as 28 Days Later, The Bunker, Dog Soldiers and Deathwatch. <br /> <br /> We're waiting for more of these fantastic movies !!
