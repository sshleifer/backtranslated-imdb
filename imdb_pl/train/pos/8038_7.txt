Two snipers wander deep in the jungle in search of their goals; slimy South American drug ruler and outstanding general. <br /> <br /> Moderately successful in building a bleak atmosphere, Sniper is in many respects a very solid thriller, taking time, establishing his characters and their difficult situation in good sequences of action. Director Llosa does not always manage to maintain a grim mood and could slightly exacerbate the story; some detours here do not add up too much. But this movie is much better than its Stallone / Stone travesty The Specialist. <br /> <br /> Billy Zane, usually incredibly tiring, does surprisingly well because the inexperienced Sniper has teamed up with veteran Berenger. As for Berenger, this movie turned out to be his latest big budget venture in Hollywood. He is able to play such roles in a dream and is very convincing here, re-introducing the role twice in DVD sequels.
