Long before "Brokeback Mountain" (about 23 years earlier) "Deathtrap" for the first time I saw two men passionately kissing on the screen and to be honest I was shocked. I understood this in terms of the plot and it did not arouse my sensitivity (not much), but for the first time I saw it at least in the film "mainstream". I thought it was an unreasonable move for this time and I dared to try, especially Christopher Reeve, in the middle of his time as Superman rated by PG. Male bisexuality on the screen could hit the step of "Brokeback", but it is worth noting this earlier incarnation.
