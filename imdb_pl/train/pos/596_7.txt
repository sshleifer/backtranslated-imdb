This for the television version of the legendary stand against hopeless opportunities is more objective, more realistic than the previously recorded versions of events, although one film shot after this was probably too far in the humanization of the figures of Sam Houston, Bowie, Travis and Crockett. <br /> <br /> We put emphasis here on Jim Bowie, playing with a sharp, cynical detachment by James Arness, who apparently is still alive at the age of 85. Then he was 65 years old and returned to the game after years away from the screen to do this part. <br /> <br /> Born in Puerto Rico Raul Julia humanizes Gen. Santa Ana, like no one since J. Carol Naish did not make it in the year 54. However, the Mexican dictator is portrayed as lecherous, greedy popinjay - they have never seen Gaudier uniforms before. He receives excellent advice from the European officers he hired, but he is convinced of his infallibility. <br /> <br /> Alec Baldwin is the only actor whose age is right for the character he plays: Col William Travis. His portrait is serious. He is almost delighted with the older men who share command with him. <br /> <br /> The only disturbing fact was Brian Keith as Crockett. In a gypsy hat cap and carrying Ol 'Betsy, he stumbles as if he came in from another movie. Without conviction in the performance, the character is reduced to several stages of convention. <br /> <br /> The script reveals some historical facts that have been omitted or suppressed in earlier versions of the film. We learn that Jim Bowie was, in the person of Santa Ana, fighting his brother-in-law. Mexican soldiers acted poorly in part because they were armed with rifles left after the Napoleonic Wars generation earlier. "Santa Ana likes occasions". Bowie crookedly explains. The whole project of defending the old Spanish mission as a fort was militarily ill-advised - this fact was explored deeper in the 2004 film The Alamo.
