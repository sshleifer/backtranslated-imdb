Just one of the best ever! The adaptation of the novel Truman Capote by Richard Brooks is a real artistic achievement. Stunning black and white cinematography (which should have earned an Oscar), Quincy Jones' poignant result and amazing performances by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson as oddly chosen assassins. This movie was 0 to 4 in Oscars and was not even nominated for the best movie while Dr. Doolittle was. Conjecture! <br /> <br /> Although you do not recognize the Clutter family as well as in the book, it was a good decision to focus more on Perry and Dick and on the tracking process of these guys. down. John Forsythe is also impressive as Alvin Dewey. There are simply no disadvantages. 10 out of 10. Best performance = Scott Wilson with R. Blake per second. Highly recommended!
