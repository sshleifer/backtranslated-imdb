Andy Goldsworthy is a Taoist first-order champion, expressing the Way through his sublime ephemeral art. Indeed, time and change are what matters in principle in his work. I bought his first book a few years ago, and my family repeatedly raved about it. So it was a pleasure to get to know the artist personally through this movie, he is as patient and gentle as one would expect and has some great things to say about the natural world, the deepest of which are expressed by his sporadic inability to say it in words. It is like most children playing alone in the open air (if they do), creating things from sticks, sand, mud and snow before they grow up. Mr. Goldsworthy received the gift and the mission of extending this type of game to create deep visions of nature and open to them often tired eyes in a brilliant new way. And always with the highest respect, gratitude and humor of the wandering and wondering monk.
