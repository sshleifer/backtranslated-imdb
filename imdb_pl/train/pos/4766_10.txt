It is extraordinary to watch a movie in which the performance of a single actor is so good that one can feel that the film would be of little interest, if at all, without his presence. <br /> <br /> Despite not very good direction - in fact there are many scenes that seem to be shot too quickly and carelessly - seemingly low budget, strange conspiracy about the man who wants to take the place of the killed priest and other points of the week, Pierre Fresnay's presence is so impressive that from the very beginning until the terrible end he is shocked. <br /> <br /> I have never seen or can imagine better performance for the future, even Paul Scofield acting in "Man for all seasons". <br /> <br /> In fact, the end could be considered even absurd if Fresnay did not play the transtorned priest, who returns to church, performing the crime. <br /> <br /> "Je suis Maurice Morand, prètre catholique" ("I am Maurice Morand, a Catholic priest") speaks with such brilliance that you can forget about the crazy ness that led to this goal. <br /> <br /> Another impressive thing about this movie is one scene in which Morand - who is stunned, is a priest - absorbs a huge amount of vines in a cabaret turning him into the blood of Christ. <br /> <br /> Gérard - a man who wants to bring Morand to the Church or replace him himself - he must drink it if he does not want to leave it in the cabaret. He does half the exclamation and applause from people who think he just drinks three of the four grapevine litters. <br /> <br /> In the next scene, the dialok between Morand and the garbage collector is outstanding. "Do you take people too?" Morand, who hates himself for what he just did, asks. "That would be too much work" is a wise answer. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is not worth commenting on, but it's definitely worth seeing because of the very strong and strangely emotional atmosphere created all the time. <br /> <br /> I think "Le défroqué" is a very strange movie, but it has to be watched by all viewers - if they are good catholics, it is mandatory - because it is a very rare jewel in the history of the film. <br /> <br />
