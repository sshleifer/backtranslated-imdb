I try to watch it every day most of the time, and although I've watched it for the last 4 years, I have not seen every episode. <br /> <br /> The Show is about Danny Tanner, who is a guy who makes news for sport. His wife is killed by a car accident from a drunk driver and asks Jesse, the Elvis maniac by bike and is obsessed with his hair. Joey, an adult child who makes comedies and makes cartoon voices all the time to take care of her three girlfriends, Donna Joe, is called her DJ, Stephina, who is the second oldest and Michelle, the youngest. <br /> <br /> Everyone lives under one roof, no one can help them. <br /> <br /> Later, on the show, Jesse gets a friend and later is her wife and has twins, Nicki and Alex. (This is starting to happen in the new seasons) This program is amazing, if you like Zack and Cody's life in Suite, then Raven, Boy Meets world and Designing Woman will love it. (It starts to improve in the final seasons) Be careful, you will love it!
