Initially, I came across Sevy minutes in heaven Linda Feferman when I was 14 years old and I worked in a video store and I loved it. I recently watched the movie again and realized that it was a lost treasure. The film features Jennifer Connelly, almost twenty years before winning the Oscar for Beautiful Mind, as Natalie Becker. Byron Thames plays his best friend in the world, Jeff Moran. The film is definitely a milder, nicer and softer version of "Pretty in Pink" and "Some Kind of Wonderful" from the 80s, that's why it's so good. He is honest, not forced to such films, and parents will enjoy watching this movie with children. <br /> <br /> When Dad Natalie leaves home on a business trip, Jeff convinces her that he should move in because his family life sucks. Thanks to the support of her friend Natalie, Polly, played splendidly by Maddie Corman, lets him. But this movie is not about putting children in situations and seeing what they can deal with. Three tracks are so natural, and the scenario, surprisingly so honest, that the best in their performances is a heartbreak. These characters really care for each other. This is a great movie to show children who reach their teenage years. <br /> <br />
