I must say that Higher Learning is one of the three best films I have ever watched. He has a great cast and an equally brilliant director. Singleton shows what life can look like at the University. There are 3 main storylines, skinheads, African Americans and homosexuals. I was intrigued by all the stories, but I was most interested in Kristen's story, struggling with feelings for another girl. The end was great. After watching the movie 25 times more, I still cry. I would give this film 11, but I have to settle with 10/10.
