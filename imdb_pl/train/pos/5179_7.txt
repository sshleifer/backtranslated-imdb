Indian Summer is a warm, multitasking movie that would make a great afternoon movie (with a bit of editing). <br /> <br /> The film begins in the past when a group of children is shown as a moose that perfectly sets the tone before entering the present, when a group of adults from the "golden age" of the camp is invited again to spend a few weeks of vacation by Uncle Lou, head of the camp. The film allows the viewer to spend time with these characters, remembering the times in the camp, and create new memories in their last stay. <br /> <br /> Film manages to do so in a great way that brings his characters in this wonderful environment and allows them to grow without worrying about the development of the story. Watching the memories of these people and their mutual relationships are what the movie is and why it works so well. He never goes all out and melodramatic, always keeping warmth, charm and realism. I have never seen a movie in which nostalgia is so well captured, and I found myself drawn in, even though I was not alone in one of these camps as a child. <br /> <br /> For a warm, nostalgic movie of character, I highly recommend.
