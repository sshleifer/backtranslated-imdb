When I saw the complicated DVD box and the terrible statue of the Red Queen, I felt sure that a great disappointment awaited me, but surprise, it surprised me. Understandable obvious and unforgivable nonsense that such a complicated solution should be thrown to such an extent that it barely reads the subtitles, let alone a ridiculous explanation. These discrepancies, but the movie is a dream. Wonderful ladies in fabulous costumes in wonderful sceneries, all the time moving and accompanied by a great result Bruno Nicolai. Maybe it's not Morricone, but it might as well be in those lighter pieces. Really nice with lots of colors, lots of sex appeal, some bloody killings and minimal police intervention. Magnificent.
