Henry Thomas was "wonderful." His character attracted my attention. I was so "caught up in history" that I forgot that it was not real. I wanted him to stop the child and see who a special person is. Other people in this story were necessary in the make-up of his character. The way they joined together to help each other was really inspiring. I love movies that show the real side of human emotions, without having to hit your head, because you're not smart enough to figure it out yourself.
