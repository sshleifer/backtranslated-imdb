This movie surprised me! I have never heard of Hyde of Gackt. I did not expect much! The reason I wanted to watch this movie was because someone mentioned that the movie contained some serious John Woo action scenes! Usually I am very careful when it is reported! There is only one John Woo and to this day there was not one director who would be close to his brilliance when it comes to action! The fact that "Moon Child" will contain a vampire convinced me even more! How can you go wrong with burning vampires! Sounds promising and interesting! The first thing I noticed in this video was that the pace was considerably slow! It's time to set the mood! This movie features some cool Hong Kong-style action scenes! But "Moon Child" is not an action movie! It's a drama about friendship and loyalty! We focus on characters and their relationship to each other! Pop singers Hyde and Gackt do a good job in acting and are very credible as friends! The only problem I had was with the plot! A few times the film seems to skip several years without explaining what happened and why they had to skip it! Example: when one gang member dies (a very dramatic moment), Alexander Wang sees Kei (Hyde) drinking blood from one of the attackers! The movie without warnings and explanations skips 9 nine years and most friends are not together anymore! Also, without a proper reason, Son (Alexander Wang) and Sho (Gackt) have to kill themselves! I know that this is done to add a serious drama! Because of the actors he is very effective, but sometimes he feels forced! In addition to the disadvantages of the story, this film has an atmosphere and smoothness that makes it hard not to like this movie! It's hard to explain why this movie is great! But it's just! The general experience you receive is cordial and sincere!
