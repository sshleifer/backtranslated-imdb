Film this movie stinks. It works just as well. But <br /> <br /> I do not care. If there is a strong representation of what was in the 80s <br /> <br /> how (for many of us in the inner world) and what hip-hop, Zulu <br /> <br /> the nation and to break the dance was really similar. Great music, great <br /> <br /> dances! It looks like it's a documentary from the past <br /> <br />, when hip-hop was a way of life. It is also interesting to see how New <br /> <br /> York looks like zero from a nuclear attack. Some viewers <br /> <br /> may be too young to remember that he was a poor, neglected city in the '70s and' 80s. This is the best of all hip-hop / break <br /> <br /> dance films that were released during this period. Of course, <br /> <br /> 80's are now a joke with all the bad TV shows and movies <br /> <br />, but those of us who survived will always remember <br /> <br / > tenderly all the time when music, dance and graffiti were fresh!
