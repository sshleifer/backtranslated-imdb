I agree with what he wrote "veinbreaker" in relation to the "Ahhhh" feeling that appears at the end of this film. I loved the places they chose to shoot, the songs were well-written and interesting, especially the psychedelic song on which Hans Matheson sings. It's trippy. Nighy was great in his role, Nail "nailed," Beano was a typical drummer, and Rea kept him together. Bruce Robinson was amazing. Helena was a lovely girl. But I felt that Juliet Aubrey's performance was great. Scenes between Aubrey and Robinson killed me! Perfectly played and the music behind the stage was spot on! It is a pity that not many musicians checked this movie! They should! I told all my friend musicians. a great quote from Jimmy Nail's character: "it's supposed to be rock and roll, not the Ghost phantom ***** g!"
