A pretty good romantic comedy in which I think I've never seen Meg looking better. All players did a good job, keeping it alive. Of course, in the real world, no genius mathematician would even look at a monkey, but that's why I love romantic comedies ... you can just forget about reality and have fun. Nice movie. Shit, Meg is honey, eh?
