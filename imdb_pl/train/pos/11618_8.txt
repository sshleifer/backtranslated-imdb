Rachel McAdams. Cillian Murphy. Wes Craven. Dream team. This is one of the best thrillers in 2005. A great story. A great return. A great eye candy. This is one of the greatest films of Wes Craven in addition to "Krzyku" and "Koszmaru na Wiązów street". This can be the best. The plot is one of the best things in the movie and it's very simple. Lisa Reisert (McAdams) with a difficult hotel management, gets into the late Red Eye back to LA. He does not know much about her being Jackson Ripner AKA Jack the Ripper (Murphy). They have a few drinks and finish together on the plane. He later reveals to her that he is an assassin who was sent to kill the Secretary of Homeland Security, who is staying at the Lisa hotel. And what does this have to do with Lisa. Well, she'll have to move her room to the top apartment to bomb it, and if not, Ripner will murder her father (Brian Cox). The return and bringing the story really gives it an extra character, and the side characters and side jokes really add to it. In general, definitely one of the best thrillers in 2005. Definitely worth seeing. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 of 4 stars
