Generally, I'm not a huge fan of time-lapse movies and initially RUKA did not attract my attention. However, knowing that this film was made in repressive Czechoslovakia during the times of Soviet domination, the more I watched the movie, the more I realized how subversive this innocent-looking little movie was. This subtext really made the film come alive and give it real power, both as a work of art and as a political statement. <br /> <br /> A sad little movie is made without any dialogue, but it's pretty clear what an event is. A cute little wooden man makes a clay pot and has a beautiful time when suddenly an animated hand appears and destroys the pot - instead it creates a hand sculpture. Well, a wooden man is constantly trying to chase his hand and do his own. However, over time the hand becomes more and more intrusive and ultimately kneels by a man. And to the end, the man is dead thanks to the intervening hand, and the hand, in the sign of true hypocrisy, gives the man a funeral of the hero! <br /> <br /> As I said, this film is an obvious attempt by the courageous Jir√≠ Trnka to criticize his dominant government. No wonder that although the Czechs loved this film and praised it critically, the state (ie the Hand) forbade this small parable. Unfortunately, Trnka did not live to let his people free a little more than two decades later during the so-called "Velvet revolution."
