Great, great, great! That's all I can say about this movie, but imdb wants at least four lines of text, so I'll discuss it. The cast was great (Jerry O'connel is very cute!), The music was great (the sixties had the best music ever, imho), the historical material was interesting, just like the way the 90's actors created it looks like they were there in the 1960s. And above all - the stories of the main characters have brought tears to my eyes, and this is the size of every drama. BUT IN ONE WORD: GREAT!
