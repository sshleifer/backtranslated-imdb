Unlike other comments, I find the film fascinating, even with all its disadvantages and the zombie action of some actors. <br /> <br /> As a technologist, I think that experiments are interesting and realistic. Although reading the minds of people on the computer sounds fantastic, experiments are now being carried out for this purpose. I will notice that these experiments are at a very early stage, with results not yet favorable. <br /> <br /> Characters in the movie are well manned. The girl, though a bit worried, looks like an adequate fool. The truck driver is a bell for real truck drivers. The minister expresses doubts at first (the principal investigator tells the minister that he (the minister) is not sure whether he believes that God created man or this man, created God, his faith, only the zombie doctor game. Secrets that they hide are appropriately adequate In the face of death, they react as real human beings. <br /> <br /> The film is a warning against Dangers associated with unlimited government supervision As in the thriller, the film does not have enough emotions, and as a scientific exercise with the philosophical foundations are fascinating.
