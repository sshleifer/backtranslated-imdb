I went to Ashura for the Fantasia Festival Kickoff festival. Man, that was cool. The director was supposed to be in Montreal at the Canadian premiere, but for health reasons he is still in Japan ... oh Lord, I hope he will improve and make a lot of other films. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite simple, but somewhat original ... demons roam around Edo in Japan, and Swordsmans called "Demon Wardens" kill them and are afraid of the rebirth of Ashura, a demonic goddess who sleeps and is reportedly very much asshole. /> <br /> He brings us to Izumo ... some elite swordsman called "Demon Killer" and his friend Jaku, who is a typical brutal jealous asshole ... <br /> <br /> It seems boring? Well, now thicknie .... <br /> <br /> Izumo withdrew from killing demons, because he killed the young kid "on the impression" that he is a demon, he never knew, but he killed her. So Izumo continued his life and regained himself in Kabuki's theater. In a joyful boat on a nice night, Izumo sees a girl hiding on a bridge that changes his life and starts killing demons again ... for the sake of the matter, the cause of love ... and shit ... the guy knows how to deal with the sword and pull funny massacre. <br /> <br /> Izumo carries a film as far away as the game ... is a complete package ... knows how to fight (hell, he knows), he is witty, he is intelligent and he has this gravel. You never have to shout: "NO ISUM, THIS IS A TRAP" The guy already knows that he has common sense. He is really the perfect hero. <br /> <br /> When it comes to cinematography, aesthetics are quite interesting. It's definitely a movie that looks like a manga. It is creamy, full of special effects and nothing, at all costs will make this movie will not look realistic ... it's amazing. Many colors are "unreal" photography, besides ... it's quite simple ... but as I said, the main character is wearing A must see, a story led by masterful hands
