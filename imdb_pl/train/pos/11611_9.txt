Japan 1918. The story of 16-year-old Ryu begins with the death of her father. As will be revealed later, both her parents died of tuberculosis. In this desperate situation, Aunt Ryus has a marriage with a Japanese girl in Hawaii, whom he only knows from his photo. Upon arriving in Hawaii, ryu discovers that her new husband is much older than in the picture and that she lives in very modest circumstances alongside the sugar cane plantation where she works. Ryu did not get used to hard work on the plantation and in despair because of her situation in the new home he thinks about escaping. He soon discovers that he has nowhere to go. Friendship with Kana, her co-worker, gives her new hope and strength. This image is based on real events from 1907-2020, when thousands of Asian women married men in America, whom they knew only from their image. This little-known picture is well written and works. The location is breathtaking. Mifune Toshiro also appears in the film in his last appearance on screen as Benshi (narrator of silent movies). This film gives an insight into Japanese culture here and overseas. You must see!
