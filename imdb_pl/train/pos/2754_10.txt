I really love this movie, I saw it again last week after 3 years. This movie is perfect, great acting, great story, great director / work with the camera / music. It's a gift to show it to someone you love. too bad jaco van dormael did not do more movies after that. Top 5 jobs. Really !! <br /> <br /> Today is 3 years and 3 days later than the above comment. it was never sent because there were no more than 10 lines. Anyway, yesterday I saw "le huitieme jour". This is undoubtedly in my film 3. together with "Cinema Paradiso", which is also a masterpiece. The soundtrack is really good. I am really curious about the new movie "jaco von dormael". I hope that it will complete my movie 3. If you see this movie, rent it. Or even better. Buy it. Because you will want to see it again.
