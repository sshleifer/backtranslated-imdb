Wow! So much fun! Probably a bit for normal American children, and really to call it a movie for children, this movie reminded me a bit of Time Bandits - very Terry Gilliam. While the overall narrative is quite simple, Miike still throws LOTS of surrealist and Bunuel-esquire moments. The entire first act brutally composes from the stage to the stage the normal family life of the main child / hero, with the world of ghosts and evil than appears in them. And although the ending has a somewhat ambiguous aspect, which is common to Miike's creativity, layers of meaning and metaphor, especially the message of anti-war / revenge of human folly, it is quite moving. As manic and ingeniously funny as other great Miike movies, only instead of over tortures and gore, he gives us an infinite number of monsters and jokai from Japanese folkloric creativity created by CG and puppetry packed into the imagination of a multi-faceted adventure. F'n advice, and one of the best Miike!
