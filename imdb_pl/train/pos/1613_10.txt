This film is still the favorite movie of all time. Only a pretentious, humorless moron would not enjoy this great movie. This movie is like a piece of warm apple pie with French vanilla ice cream! I think it's Cher's best job and its most reliable performance. Cher has always been charismatic, good-looking and an enviable figure. Do you like her singing or not - who else sounds like Cher? Cher definitely marks his presence in the entertainment industry and will be remembered long after others appear and disappear. He is one of the most unique artists in the world. It's funny, because who would think of Cher as such a talented actress? He is the head above the so-called today's movie "stars". Cher is a real actor on the same level as Debra Winger, Alfre Woodard, Holly Hunter, Angela Bassett and a few others, because she never seems to be an "actress", she really becomes a persuasive figure. She deserved the respect of her peers and the film audience. <br /> <br /> Everything about Moonstruck is great - characters, scenery, dialogue, food. I am never tired of watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Every time I watch the scene where everyone is sitting at the table at the Rose house, I stop the remote to see exactly what the delicious food is like. I've seen spaghetti, mushrooms (I think), but I do not understand if they eat ravioli, ziti? What is this main course? It looks great and drives me crazy! <br /> <br /> Everyone in this family were hard-working people and they respected each other. Grandfather was not pushed aside and tolerated, he was an important part of the family and he was listened to and respected for his age and wisdom. He seemed to be quite healthy, an independent old encoder. <br /> <br /> Loretta's mom was not just a housewife, she was an adhesive who kept the family together and was a perfect example of what a wife, mother and house manager should strive for. She was proud of the lifestyle she chose, but she did not let him determine who she was. Entrepreneurs with high power do not feel as comfortable in their skin as Rose Casterini. Pay attention to the saucy way she said: "I did not have children until I turned 37. You get the impression that she was the type of young woman who did exactly what she liked and went on without realizing what had happened. She was adorable, smart and very clever. What a wonderful mom! <br /> <br /> I did not like Loretta right away, because she seemed to know a little - it was all that was not as risky and controlled itself as others wanted to think. She could tell others about herself and the place where she made a mistake, but she did not really use common sense for her own life. She was about to marry a middle-aged boy, simply because she wanted to have a husband and a sense of identity and purpose in life. She was more conventional than her own mother. She dressed and wore her hair like a matron in a detention house and seemed humorless and bored, but underneath you felt that she was vulnerable and lonely, and she had a lot of love to give to the right man. It will probably also end up being an amazing mother. <br /> <br /> I saw in the future a house full of Loretta and loud Ronnie, happy kids, and Rose and Cosmo were happy every minute.
