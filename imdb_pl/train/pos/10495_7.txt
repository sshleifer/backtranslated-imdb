Saving Grace is a cool movie to watch in a boring afternoon, when you're looking for something other than ordinary scripts and want to have fun. I mean, the whole idea of ​​this movie and all the marijuana in it is so crazy! It was the first movie I watched with this subject (drugs / marijuana), which does not really criticize him, he just jokes. Grace Trevethyn is a widow who lives in a small town in the UK and has many financial problems because of her late husband who committed suicide because he was full of debts. The problem is that Grace, who imagined she would save some money for her, discovers that she has to pay all her husband's debts in debt so that she does not lose all her belongings, especially her home, which she loves so much. She has never worked before and is in a tragic situation until Matthew, her gardener who is very well-known for smoking pots, decides to work with her on selling large-scale marijuana.
