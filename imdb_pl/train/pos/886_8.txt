It was one of the DVDs that I recently bought in a set of six named "Frenchfilm" to refresh our French before planned holidays in beautiful Provence this year. Up to now, in addition to improving our French, we have significantly increased our appreciation for the French cinema. <br /> <br /> What a breath of fresh air to the musty, predictable, unimaginable bang that was cast out by Hollywood. This is a good example for screenwriters, actors, directors and cinematographers. It was so stimulating to see two identifiable characters in the main roles, without having to be shiny characters from the covers of magazines. <br /> <br /> Another thing that I liked about this movie was the slow nature and the expansion of the plot, so you could guess how it all would end. Is there a good good in this selfish thug that continually treats its seemingly naive benefactor with the type of contempt that the former opponent would show? Does our sexually frustrated poor, small, deaf heroine prove that she responds to her dreams and the situation that fate has given her? The viewer is intrigued by these questions, and the actors slowly and convincingly discover the answers, facing the events that challenge and shape their feelings towards each other. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, just like me, you may want to see it again. I still have to work out the psychological motif of the director for the sub-story as a curator, and some subtle nuances of camera work are worth a second look. The story requires a bit of imagination when our hero has a chance to help our abused and overworked heroine in the office. You must also have broad minds to believe in her brilliant mouth reading and how part of the action falls into place. But if you decide to have an exciting ride with this example of French cinema at its best, you will come out more than happy. Four stars out of five for me.
