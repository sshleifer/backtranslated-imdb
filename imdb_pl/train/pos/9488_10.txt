Unforgettable, intelligent and full of tension film from one of the real geniuses of French films, incredibly efficient Henri Verneuil. The plot is the exact parallel to the murder of JFK and takes place in an indescribable, fictitious country. The film, both visually and fictionally, is razor sharp. Shot with meticulous precision, he follows Henry Volnay, Procuror, who undertakes to unravel the coup d'Ã©tat. In many respects this is a very disturbing film, not only because of the cold and analytical precision of the commentary on the so-called internal functioning of a modern state. The atmosphere and characters are completely reliable, and Verneuil left nothing to chance in his tense conspiracy. On another level, this relatively unknown film was just Oliver Stone's 15-year-old beginning, which was appreciated for the film "JFK", a worse film in many areas, the smallest of which was not credible ... br /> <br /> This is a masterpiece, every cinema lover should see it, preferably in the original French version of the sub.
