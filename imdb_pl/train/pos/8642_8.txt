A surprisingly effective thriller, this. <br /> <br /> David Duchovny and Michelle 'Ensign Ro' Forbes is a successful, professional couple, writer and photographer. Forbes is desperate to move to California and, in a compromise, Mulder agrees to move, provided that they visit places of historic importance alongside the known serial killers. His idea: he writes words, takes photos, and the end result is a bestselling book that will set them up for life. To help finance a trip, they decide to make the car available and advertise this fact. Because their bad luck will make Brad Pitt see the announcement and soon after killing his owner, he and his girlfriend, Juliette Lewis, meet with a couple of writers and start trekking. Inevitable misfortunes. <br /> <br /> Pitt is outstanding as a real cool inspiring Early Grayce and can be supported by Lewis playing her usual white character, which seems to be her default setting. Duchovny and Forbes also make a convincing double act, and when events get out of control, you as a viewer are drawn into your situation and feel tense. it deserves recognition beyond the current status. The best movie.
