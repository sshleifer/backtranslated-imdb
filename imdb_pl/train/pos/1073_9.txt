Several episodes took us to "enter the Dark Angel" as a story and series, because we were moving from The Sopranos, a completely different structure of mentality. But when we're at the heart of this series, we've come to terms with it very quickly. It is a pity that the series ended just when it was just beginning to be good in the perfect category: Dark Angel was much more than the average television series. Copes of butt and rocks when it comes to action, but the interaction between characters and social reactions to "mutants" remind us of the constant prejudices we face (and what we do) every day. The fact that the story takes place in the future, maintains a surrealist mood and prevents the anti-discrimination of rubbing into our message (and therefore does not ruin the "fun" for those who do not like to be lectured during the entertainment), but every event and human / social interaction remains important for present. We all make judgments, we face our own prejudices, but in the end the question of who you are is: do you sit and close your mind, do you get up and do something with it? For those who have no choice but to fight for survival or justice, this series strengthens them. For those who have never had to face the question, this series "creeps" into this message under the guise of pure entertainment. It is much better made and well written than most TV series; I am very disappointed that it ended before it could really jump into a higher gear.
