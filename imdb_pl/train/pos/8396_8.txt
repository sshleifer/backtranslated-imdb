Sensual and hard Maria Braun. (Hanna Schygula) marries a soldier in the middle of World War II and spends half a day and all night with him. Her marriage lasts until she loses him to war and then to prison. She continues her life, becomes a successful businesswoman, being not only sensual, but intelligent, ambitious and willing to use sex when and wherever it is necessary: ​​"I do not know anything about business, but I know what German women want. You can even say that I'm an expert in this field. " Climbing on success, she always remembers her husband Hermann (her man) and finds out that whatever she is doing? it is for him, for their future happy life together. The style of "Maria Braun" resembles the melodramas of the favorite Hollywood director Fassbinder, Douglas Sirk, and allows you to see the loss and survival in post-war Germany. Hanna Schygula literally shines in every scene of the film and is fantastic. <br /> <br /> 8.5 / 10
