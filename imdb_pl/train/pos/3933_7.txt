The problem with presenting the real life of the individual is that the performance may be good, but it still does not work if the audience does not believe that the actor represents a person. This is the main problem of "Young Mr. Lincoln:" Henry Fonda gives a great performance, but it was hard to believe that Abraham Lincoln was as gentle as Fonda portrays him. <br /> <br /> This is basically the courtroom drama with young Abraham Lycoln in the lead. Regardless of whether it was a real story, I do not know, but if it is not, why use it as the main character? Does not matter. In the film Lincoln defends two young men accused of murder. <br /> <br /> There is not much in the film, as a result it seems rather empty. I wanted more history and character development. The film lasts 100 minutes, but it does not feel like it. There are several small scenes involving Lincoln and the flourishing relationship with Mary Todd, but they seem superficial. <br /> <br /> Acting is good all around, but as I said, Fonda's performance works as a character, but not Abraham Lincoln. I just do not believe that the real Lincoln was so gentle. It is true that he has a big voice when he must, for example, convince a drunken lynch crowd to let the accused stand trial, but Fonda introduces Lincoln too gently. Other performances, however, are solid, especially Alice Brady as Abigail Clay, mother of the accused. She is a nice lady for whom we can really feel. Simple and uneducated, but very sweet; we can see why Lincoln wanted to help her. <br /> <br /> John Ford seems to think about this movie as an epic, and at the time of its release it probably was. But even then, there is not enough material to present it. <br /> <br /> It's a nice watch, but not a classic one.
