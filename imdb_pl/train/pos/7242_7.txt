The year 1933 seemed a great year for satire (for example, "Duck Soup"), and this fits well, although it concerns the obsession with the contract bridge. The tone is like a humorous track from The New Yorker, suitable because the movie starts with the Goings On About Town page of this magazine. The only strange thing is the casting. Made a few years later, William Powell and Myrna Loy would be perfect. However, after 1934, you would not have adultery treated in such a sophisticated way, young and beautiful Loretta Young in some costumes with haircuts and slinky, or a group of prostitutes listening to the radio bridge contest. Even if you do not know anything about the bridge, you may still want to check out a rare example of Hollywood satire.
