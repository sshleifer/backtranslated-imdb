Just like Al Gore shook us with his painfully honest and cleverly presented documentary, "Inconvenient Truth," directors Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield remind us that the time has come to improve our lifestyle to save our beautiful planet. "Planet Earth" is also a warning signal that global warming of our planet has catastrophic consequences for all living creatures around the world. Al Gore showed us the grim future of planet Earth, presenting hard facts supported by documented examples through long but always interesting monologues. The creators of this document choose a different but equally powerful way to achieve this. They do not represent a future representation of what may happen to our planet if we do not radically change things, but rather show us the real beauty of the planet Earth in all its amazing glory. We see places we knew existed, but we never thought they could be so beautiful. In this video, we see a wide range of the most unusual places, such as abandoned deserts, huge forests full of fauna and flora, and ice landscapes, as far as the eye can see. And in all these incredibly different environments, we see the most beautiful animals that try to survive. <br /> <br /> This is exactly the movie that had to be done, in combination with the Al Gore movie, in order to realize that our planet is too valuable to be mixed up. Patrick Stewart's voice is always relaxing, so very well done, although initially it sounded like I was watching an X-Men movie! Pictures are probably the most remarkable thing about this document. Sometimes: what you see is so unreal that you forget that a man with a camera had to film all this great material. <br /> <br /> In short: it is definitely mandatory for everyone because it affects every person on this beautiful planet Earth! The truth is: I never thought that our planet is so amazingly beautiful!
