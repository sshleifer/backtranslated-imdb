I do not want to bore anyone, repeating what has already been said, but this is one of the best series in history! It was a great shame when it was canceled, and I hope someone will make a good sense to pick it up and start the series again. The good news is that it's on DVD !!!! I ran to the store and took a copy and I'm glad it's just as good as I remembered it. Gary Cole is a wonderfully dark and frightening character, and all the actors were very good. It is a pity that the network did not continue this. Shaun Cassidy, it's a masterpiece. Anyone who likes this genre and who has not seen it must do so. You will not be disappointed. My daughter, who was too young to watch her on TV (she is 20 years old), is very interested and will soon become a fan. He regards her as "very twisted" and she liked the episodes she saw. I can not wait to see episodes that have not been broadcast. <br /> <br /> This performance is amazing !!!!
