Roman Polański is considered one of the most important directors of our time, for the minds of the classics such as "Rosemary's Baby" and "Chinatown". Probably what makes the Polanski cinema very interesting is the fact that although it is able to create commercially attractive films, such as the aforementioned masterpieces, it also likes creating low-key movies that have a more personal character. "Le Locataire" or "The Tenant" is one of those films; horror / suspense story about paranoia and obsession, which is one of his best works and probably among the best horrors ever made. <br /> <br /> Sam Polański plays Telkowski, a young man looking for a flat in France. When he finally finds it, he discovers it is empty because the previous occupant, Simone Choule, tried to kill himself by jumping out the window. After Simone dies of injury, Trelkovsky becomes obsessed with her, believing that her death was caused by the rest of the tenants in the building. <br /> <br /> Sharing the same claustrophobic feeling of his other films "on the subject of housing" ("Repulsion and" Rosemary's Baby "), this film focuses on a bizarre conspiracy that can be completely or not in Trelkowski's head, the catastrophic consequences that paranoia has on his mind, and the bizarre obsession he has with the previous tenant. <br /> <br /> Trelkovsky will go into the darkness perfectly shown by Polanski, while at the beginning his performance seems strange and wooden, he slowly learns that Polański works this way, because Trelkovsky is supposed to be acting in this way, as a fool almost without a life who falls into a trap in this crazy sub-world where strange people live, and the supporting actors really gave life to the people in the building, creating unforgettable characters are very important for the success of the film. <br /> <br /> Also Polański's beautiful pictures in the film help to increase the sense of isolation and give life to the beautiful building that serves Trelkowski as a cage. Haunted paintings, which Polanski uses to convey the feeling of confusion and madness, have a supernatural beauty that makes them both frightening and attractive. <br /> <br /> If there is a defect in the movie, it's definitely a bit slow at first. it may sound like an exclusion, but in fact the slow pace of the beginning works perfectly, because it imitates Trelkovsky's own boring life and how it gradually enters another kingdom. In addition, the complex plot is certainly not easy to understand due to many complex layers. However, it is more than a disadvantage to face a provocative story like this. <br /> <br /> While "The Tenant" may not be for everyone, people interested in psychological horror and surrealistic stories will be happy with this experience. "Le Locataire" is really one of the masterpieces of Roman Polankii. 10/10
