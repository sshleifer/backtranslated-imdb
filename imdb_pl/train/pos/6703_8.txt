My children have recently started revising this series - both early episodes on N and later in ABC Family - and they love it. (I did not realize that the show lasted even after the first or second season) I'm curious, what caused all cast changes - I saw them described as "very publicized", and yet half an hour of searching for Efforts on the Internet did not reveal anything but endless comments on how early episodes were much better than later episodes. (Personally, I do not see much difference - the scripts and themes remain largely the same - but they lose great people along the way) My daughter put the DVD on her wish list, so maybe the earth with special features and comments will shed some light on all this. I would also like them to make each other humor about the changes - like in "Boy Meets World", where they throw a younger sister for the whole season, and when another actor playing in it appears later, they ask her where she was and says "upstairs" or when the early "Minkus" geek token appears at high school, they ask him where he was, and he says "there," indicating a part of the class that he never showed in front of the camera before saying, "Hey, Mr. Turner, wait ! "And escaping from the screen (Mr. Turner is another character who has left) Oh well - maybe there will be a real Hollywood story on this or that topic? I am glad that Aunt Hilda appeared on the final - she was always one of my favorites - it's a pity that it could not have been a more comprehensive meeting with the cast. (The Zelda candle just did not cut me)
