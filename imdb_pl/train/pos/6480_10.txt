It was by far the best war document ever made. From the very beginning of the first episode, Sir Laurence, Olivier described the terrifying events in Oradour-Sur-Glane, "The day soldiers came." Until the last days of the war, when mushroom clouds appeared over Japan, I never missed a single second of this classic series, and I remember it well even though it was shown in 1974. Every aspect of this tragedy was described in detail. This whole series should be obligatory for as many children in the world as possible, so that the tragedy of the Second World War will not be repeated, and bigotry, hatred, greed and intolerance were not confused with patriotism or religious zeal.
