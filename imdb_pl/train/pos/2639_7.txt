Being a fan of the first Lion King, I certainly could not wait for this movie, but I knew that there really was no way he could be as good as the original. I know that many Disney fans are afraid of movies directly on video because I have mixed feelings about them. <br /> <br /> While watching the Lion King 1½ I tried to find out what my point of view was about this movie. Will I be so devoted to the King of Lviv that I will search for certain scenes, or will I just accept this film as another look at the story of the Lion King? Most of the time I embraced the latter. <br /> <br /> Lew Król 1½ definitely has its charming and funny moments. Timon and Pumbaa stole the show in the first movie and they definitely deserved the film that focused around them. People just love these characters! My favorite parts of the film are Timon and Pumba's editing, taking care of the young Simba and a surprise ending with wonderful episodes. <br /> <br /> However, I could do without many jokes from the bathroom, like a real reason why everyone bowed to a small Simba at the beginning of the Lion King 1. I think that this type of jokes are intended for a younger set (which is after all a group I do not think many children are really worried about Disney's direct profit margins. <br /> <br /> I will say, however, that I was a bit annoyed when they directly connected the scenes from the original movie to the movie. I'm just too familiar with the original that these scenes simply stuck up in pain. Something would be different with music or voices that could simply distract me. <br /> <br /> When it comes to music, it was not that bad, but do not expect some of the classics to come from this movie. At least LK2 had a nice ballad "Love Will Find a Way." Regarding the vote, this has been well done in this film. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella did a great job as always, and even new cast members, classic comedian Jerry Stiller and Julie Kavner (best known as Marge Simpson) did a great job. You can even enjoy these great voice talents by checking Virtual Safari on a 2 DVD disc. This feature is definitely fun! <br /> <br /> So in all, the Lion King 1½ is not the perfect movie, but it's cute and funny. I think that many Lion King fans will be happy about it and will appreciate what it is - a fun, light look at the masterpiece of the Lion King from the perspective of our funny friends. <br /> <br /> My rating IMDb: 7/10. My Yahoo! Rating: B (good)
