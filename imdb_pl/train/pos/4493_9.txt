It is an excellent film about a traditional family of the working class in northern England. Filmed on site in Bolton, James Mason plays as his father, who is the dominant force in his home. At least it seems so. A clever movie based on art presents the complexity of family life. The supporting cast is also great, with many familiar faces giving support.
