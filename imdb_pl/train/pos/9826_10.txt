This low-budget erotic thriller, which has several advantages, but much more bad. The plot revolves around a lawyer who tries to purge his lover, accused of murdering his wife. Being a soft-core movie, it involves being hidden in a strip club and having sex with potential suspects. How threads are going on this kind of genre, not bad. The script is fine, and history makes sense for someone at 2 in the morning and does not notice too many story lines. But everything else in the movie seems cheap. The main actors are not so bad, but almost all of these supporters are incredibly bad (one girl seems to be drunk and / or tall). Pictures are badly lit, and everything looks grainy and ugly. The sound is so scary that you can barely hear what people say. The worst thing about this movie is the reason you watch it - sex. The reason people watch these things are hot sex scenes where there are really hot girls in the Red Shoe daily. Erotic scenes are not hot, they are dingy, shot in a porn style in which everything is only a masterful shot of two people. The woman also looks like she was a runaway from a porn session. I am not trying to be rude or malicious here, but everyone has breast implants and a burned / weathered look. Even the title "Deviant Obsession" sounds like Hardcore. Not that I do not mind pornography - in fact I love it. But I want my soft core and my hard core to be separated. What happened to actors like Shannon Tweed, Jacqueline Lovell, Shannon Whirry and Kim Dawson? Women who could work and who totally excited you? And what happened to the erotic thrillers B, such as Body Chemistry, Nighteyes and even Stripped to Kill. Of course, none of them is a masterpiece, but at least he wanted to make movies. Plus, they pushed the envelope, going beyond the relatively primitive position of Hollywood on sex, sexual obsessions and perversion. Now they are just doing hard-core movies without hard-core sex.
