Dan, the widowed father of three girls, has his own column of advice that will probably go to syndication. After the death of his wife, he devoted time to raising his daughters. Without knowing the affair for a long time, he does not prepare him for a meeting with the radiant Marie, in a local book shop in the small town of Rhode Island on the ocean, where he went to celebrate Thanksgiving with the rest of his big family. After fondling Marie from the first sight, he does not prepare much when a wonderful woman appears in the family. After all, he's a date for Dan's brother, Mitch. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning, it's clear that Dan and Marie are created for each other, and although we feel the outcome, we're going to the fun that Peter Hedges wants to give us. Sam Hedges, author and author of the screenplays, gave us two great novels: "What's Gilber Grape," "Ocean in Iowa," and great indie, "Pieces of April," which he also directed. It's just a coincidence that both films deal with families during the Thanksgiving rallies. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the movie was the natural chemistry between the two stars, Steve Carell and Juliette Binoche. In many ways, he reminds us of Jack Lemmon in his comedy and serious material, what can be said about Miss Binoche, an intelligent actress and a clear presence in every film. is ready for comedy, convince us of her Marie. <br /> <br /> The only sad note is the wasting of talent in the picture John Mahoney, Diane Wiest, Norbert Leo Butz, Jessica Hecht, Emily Blunt, Allison Pill, Amy Ryan, they have nothing to do, they only serve as a random music to Cook's decoration, which is seen s brother Mitch, copes better, because he can recite more lines than others. <br /> <br /> "Dan in real life" is a great movie that will please everyone.
