The Caprica episode (S01E01) is well-made as a pilot. Really, this episode is exactly the same content as the DVD pilot version. Having said that, episode 01 gives a very specific background for the very popular "Battlestar Galactica" series (both in its original version and in the remake of 2007). To a large extent, this applies to the 2007 series. As in the latest science fiction trends, this series explores "virtual" life or the environment. In addition, we have a lot of information about the Adam's family line, as well as their relationship with undisclosed (in the Battlestar Galactica series) Cylon developer. For the most part, the first episode revolves around the popular topic of "virtual" life and (as expected) the early life of the colony and the birth of the Cylons. <br /> <br /> In total, I liked this episode. Although it was not a new material for me or anyone who has seen the Capric DVD yet, the series seems very promising. As with many pilots, episode 01 leaves us with a cliff suspension to ensure audience tracking (science fiction community). I will definitely try both for determination and development. <br /> <br /> I give this series 8 stars.
