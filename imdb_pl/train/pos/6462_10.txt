I do not intend to spoil the content of anyone who has not yet seen this humble masterpiece of Kay Pollak. <br /> <br /> The world-famous conductor, brilliantly played by Michael Nyqvist, seeks peace from stress, returning to his childhood village. The villagers, who followed the genius in silence, slowly tempt him to share his greatness. <br /> <br /> Each role in this film has a very specific goal and shows the extraordinary potential in each of the actors playing their own chord in short but precise words, a symphony of love. <br /> <br /> Not love in the sense of a relationship, but in the tone of a ghost deeply buried in each character, each revealing his own to present the story, their needs, their skeletons, desires and much more. <br /> <br /> I will not forget to mention two main parts played by Frida Hallgren and Michael Nyqvist, whose dramas are played in unforgettable emotional harmony feedback. They deal with the pain associated with their own disability to love themselves. <br /> <br /> Michael Nyqvist is really put to the test in a very difficult setting, in one of those movies that either end up being catastrophic or fantastic. And fantastic that it happened from the beginning to the end, no less than a second more or less than enough, you have a sense of change and taste more. <br /> <br /> To this day, definitely one of the best films I had the pleasure to watch.
