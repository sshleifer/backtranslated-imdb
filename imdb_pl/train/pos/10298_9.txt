On the one hand, I was enjoying seeing Jim Carrey in a movie where being above the top was not the goal. His character is like all of us. Wanting more - better things that happen to us and expect from God. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman created a wonderful God. With a sense of humor and a real sense of love for each of us, but ready for a small holiday when the opportunity arises. <br /> <br /> I thought that Jennifer Aniston's character was a bit too sensitive and understandable for Carry, basically a selfish TV presenter wants to be, but that's how it was written. <br /> <br /> I think the announcements ruined some potentially very funny scenes, because everyone who saw them knew what had happened before it happened. /> <br /> I have read some reviews and it seems that some people look a bit too deep. This is a summer comedy that is not intended to solve the problems of the world, although there are several messages that we could all take to heart. <br /> <br /> A funny movie.
