Russell, my favorite, is great in this movie. What's more, the film covers a huge range of human passion and sadness. Everything, from marriage to homosexuality, is addressed and respected. The film makes the viewer aware that the tolerance of other people is the way to save humanity. A great love story between Lachlin and Lil. I keep repeating their scenes. Anyone who has ever been in love senses in these people. All characters are perfectly manned and presented.
