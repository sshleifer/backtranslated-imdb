if you're like me, you'll love this great movie for teenagers. I think it's out of psotami / książkę miłości / liceum w USA / krzyk / dziewczyna kalendarza / beksa / all the wonderful films set in the 1950s and early 1960s and have a great soundtrack. not so much songs as in some of these types of films, but still great. Sometimes it is very funny and has a great interest in love. they were more typical for these great films. My favorite movie of all time returns to the future, when Marty bodes until 1955 in these great films that will remain in the 50s (early 1960s), there are also such films better, but not much.
