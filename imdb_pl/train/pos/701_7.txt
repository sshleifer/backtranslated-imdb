I did not know what to do, besides I think it is much better not to have too many exceptions. Do not misunderstand me, this is not a bad short film. Tess Nanavati is a relatively new director and writer, so I think he deserves many awards for making this film. You can say that it was an act of love for her. Acting (except for Dominik) is a bit bad, and the quality of the film is not great, but for a really low budget the film is good. There were times when the plot is intricate and there are parts that go on, although I do not feel that it weakens the ability to understand the film. If you love Dominica Monaghana as much as I do, I say that you follow him. The gag reel was cool, I will not ruin it, but there is a special scene that makes buying a DVD worth it so that you can watch it over and over again. If you like the movie, check out The Pink Mirror, a movie also made by Jagged Edge. I know that Dominik's fans will enjoy this little piece of heaven.
