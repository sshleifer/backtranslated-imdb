When I heard this movie directed by Ang Lee, I made sure I would see him. This Taiwanese director gained fame thanks to "Wedding Banquet" and "Eat Drink Man Woman" a few years ago, and then he switched to "Sense and Sensibility" and "The Ice Storm". Now he draws attention to another American icon - civil war. <br /> <br /> This story takes place in Missouri, the federal state with the sympathies of the South. They never officially joined the Confederate army. Instead, they formed bands of outlaws, called "bushmen," grew long hair, and sometimes confiscated the uniforms of the Union, which they wore in their ordinary clothes. <br /> <br /> The film presents their moral dilemma, dramaturgy of times and their allegedly heroic missions to kill shopkeepers and farmers who helped the Union. There are no stars in this movie unless you consider singer "Jewel" to be well-manned as the young widow of the confederate. <br /> <br /> Tobey Macquire is cast as a young boy from Germany who is ridiculed because of his legacy because Germany was allegedly sympathetic to the Union. This young man is a great actor, full of a fresh face of a young man, whose performance includes his wonderful and subtle realizations when he is exposed to the horrors of war. <br /> <br /> Jeffrey Wright is a liberated slave who travels with boxers, his loyalty to a young man who bought him freedom. It gives excellent and understated results. <br /> <br /> However, some of the acting is wooden, especially in long conversations about morality. And their costumes are too new. And the subject of the "southern gentleman", including manners, gifts and courtesy for women, turns out to be a bit too important - especially because they make it worth murdering all men, who pull women from their arms, and then burn shops and homes. <br /> <br /> Although I do not think it will be one of the great Lee Anga movies, I was fascinated by the free parts and its over 140 minutes long. I was interested in what happened next, and felt empathy for each of the characters who met as a true and imperfect human being entangled in the forces of history. <br /> <br /> Not as much as an ordinary movie war, but still recommended - especially for lovers of the Civil War. <br /> <br />
