Here's another movie that does not really require a lot of recommendations. It's a classic comedy, very funny and fun, which of course inspired a successful TV series, which many would say is even better (personally I like both). <br /> <br /> For some, it's hard to warm up to Jacek Lemmon and Walter Matthau as Felix Unger and Oscar Madison, when they were weaned on a TV show with Tony Randall and Jacek Klugman (or the other way round). But in both cases we have four good actors who in real life seemed so similar to their film counterparts that they managed to make these characteristics their own. This is the humorous material of Neil Simon, which is key and where laughter really comes from. <br /> <br /> For those who have never heard of THE ODD COUPLE, this is the story of a neurotic and sophisticated tidy freak (Lemmon) being expelled from a 12-year-old marriage by his suffering wife and living in an apartment in Manhattan a careless and totally irresponsible friend (Matthau). Collecting these two unlikely roommates in the same four walls makes the situation very funny.
