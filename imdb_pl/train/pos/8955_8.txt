"Bell Book and Candle" was recently shown on the cable. Not seeing this for a moment, we decided to look at this comedy. Based on the hit of Broadway by James Van Druten, who was the vehicle of Rex Harrison and Lilli Palmer in the early fifties, the film was adapted to screen by Daniel Taradash. The film was directed by Richard Quine, who turned the game into a wonderful comedy. <br /> <br /> Apparently, judging by some of the comments sent by IMDb, the main problem seems to be the combination of two stars who collaborated on "Vertigo", released in the same year. The film audience did not think about the age difference when the movie was released. In fact, most of the aging male stars from this period have always been involved with much younger women. <br /> <br /> The movie taking place in Manhattan during Christmas is a delightful comedy that delighted viewers. Kim Novak was at the peak of her beauty, because it was clear that the camera adores her no matter what she plays. As a witch who becomes a man, her Gillian is adorable. James Stewart, who plays Publisher Shep 'Henderson, is also seen as the best. Mr. Stewart was an excellent comedic actor who shows why he was at the top. <br /> <br /> Supporting roles, great Elsa Lanchester, playing in Queenie, is a welcome addition to every movie, as she has shown here. Also good is Nicky Holroyd with Jack Lemmon, brother of Gillian. Ernie Kovacs is also seen as the writer Sidney Radlitch. <br /> <br /> This is a great way to spend a winter night at home watching "Bell Book and Candle".
