Placed between San Francisco and Captains. The bold two major parts of Spencer Tracy is a very interesting film about the war and its impact on some people. They gave him weapons, Spencer Tracy and Franchot Tone in the only movie they ever produced, and Gladys George as a woman who loves them. <br /> <br /> Tracy and Tone is a pair of designers from World War I, Tone is a weak character who almost goes through the hill in the camp, but Tracy stops him. Tracy is still playing the lovely, younger type of Wallace Beery, whom MGM predicted for him when they signed him with Fox. <br /> <br /> On the front, Tone has the opportunity and takes her when, during the fight, he manages to reach the church tower, which looks at the German machine-gun nest. He has already learned to shoot and does Sergeant Major York. But Alvin C. York has never been changed by the war like Tone. <br /> <br /> Wounded in a fight Tone convalesces in the hospital with Gladys George taking care of him. Tracy goes away to visit his friend, and he and George are doing something. Later, when Tracy is reported missing in action, Tone and George marry. Tracy has a broken heart when she comes back and finds out about her marriage, but she sits in a step. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie has to do with a tone that uses war skills that he learned in gangster trading. He's a hit man now, and George does not know what he's doing to live. I think you can imagine the rest. <br /> <br /> Part of the movie that caused me some trouble is that I can not believe that Gladys George could not understand it. She is a smart girl from the street, her role is very similar to the one she played in The Roaring Twenties with James Cagney. <br /> <br /> Speaking of the Roaring Twenties, the development of Humphrey Bogart's character is similar to Tone, although it was not the central character of the movie. In fact, there are elements of One Gave Him A Gun, which can be found in Taxi Driver and in Clint Eastwood's classic, The Unforgiven. <br /> <br /> The sequences of battles from World War I are very well presented by director Woody Van Dyke. For some reason, Leonard Maltin watched this movie, I think he is much better than he gave him credit.
