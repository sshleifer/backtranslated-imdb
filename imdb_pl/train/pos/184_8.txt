There are no people like Show People by Marion Davies (as Peggy Pepper) and William Haines (as Billy Boone). My introduction to Mrs. Davies was a "clip" from the movie; deliciously false, in which he lowers his scarf to reveal various emotions. My introduction to Mr. Haines was about watching the movie; however, it is possible that I saw him in a less memorable role. Haines makes an amazing impression when he joins Davies for a meal in the canteen - throwing his hat on the ring with great pieces at the table. Indeed, Haines and Davies provide great comic shows. <br /> <br /> The story begins with Dell Henderson (Colonel Pepper) leading his daughter Davies to Hollywood, confident that it will become the latest sensation of Tinseltown. Indeed, Davies and Haines have already become comedy stars. But Davies wants to be the real queen of drama. Davies leaves Haines and collaborates with the amazingly dramatic Paul Ralli. But the audience prefers Davies in more comic roles; maybe the director King Vidor proposes a case of art imitating life? <br /> <br /> Full of great Hollywood content, both on and off the set. Full of great "cameos"; for lunch in the studio at the table of stars, Davies sits between Douglas Fairbanks and William S. Hart. However, the best "bit" player is Charlie Chaplin, who has the courage to ask Davies for an autograph! While the scenes are fun, they and episodic sequences help "Show People" become a less important film and even an important historical document. <br /> <br /> ******** Show People (11/11/28) King Vidor ~ Marion Davies, William Haines, Dell Henderson
