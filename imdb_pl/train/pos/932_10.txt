********* Ten out of ten stars ********* <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe that it was a TV movie. The phrase "from television" itself makes me tremble. Production values ​​for television films are almost always significantly lower than the production values ​​for professional film studios. With this in mind, this version of "Christmas Carol" should be released in cinemas because it is so good. This is my personal favorite from all Christmas Carol films, because every aspect of this production is of the highest quality. Yes, there are a few minor bugs on the screen with two ghosts that visit Scrooge, but there is no movie that does not have at least a few bugs. <br /> <br /> Scott turns on Scrooge's star show is fun. In fact, I can not come up with one performance in this movie that should not be applauded. Costumes, photos of places and winter backgrounds are mesmerizing. The musical result is engaging and warming the heart. Add solid directing, flawless photos and loyal scenarios; we have here what will one day be considered a holiday classic. It really was not long enough to be a classic, but mark my words, one day it will soon be. This film has become an annual Christmas tradition in my home because it embodies the true meaning of Christmas: love, selflessness and giving. In such a selfish, greedy world, my family and I can lose ourselves in "The Christmas Carol," starring George C. Scott.
