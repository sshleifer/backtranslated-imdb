"The Student of Prague" is an early full-length horror or rather "autorenfilm" (ie the film's author). This film is a member of the movement of many movements, which tried to give the film respect or simply to earn, adjusting literature or theater on the screen. Fortunately, the history of this book with moving images is good. Using the poem by Alfred de Musset and the story of Edgar Allen Poe, he focuses on the topic of the doppelgänger. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie is the most cinematic because the effects of double exposure make Paul Wegener appear twice in the scenes. Guido Seeber was the creator of special effects for his day, but he is not very good at setting the camera or moving it. The filmmaker Leon Hunt (printed in "Early Cinema: Space, Frame, Narration") made an interesting analysis of the film, using cropping to reinforce the theme of the dual game: left / right characters, close / far and front / oblique framing of characters and shots. Regardless, the film consists mainly of long shots from a fixed position, which is noticeably primitive. The lack of editing is worse; there are very few stage cuts and scenes remain. None of this is unusual in 1913, but at the same time more advanced films appeared in this area, including better parts of "Atlantis" (August Blom, 1913), "Twilight of the woman's soul" (Yevgeni Bauer, 1913) and short DW Griffith movies. <br /> <br /> An extended universal movie dictionary until 1926. It would allow a much better remake. What's more, the remake has a reason for Lyduschka, besides being an occasional troublemaker and deputy viewer. Here the intrusively preserved Gypsy lurks, seemingly, with a cloak of invisibility. I know that their world is silent for me, but I assume that their lips move so that their world is not silent about them, so how can Lyduschka slip over the shoulders of others and not be noticed? <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, this is one of the most interesting early conceptual films. Wegener, who seems to be the main mind of this film, in addition to playing the main role, would later play the title role and co-directed the "Golem" in 1920 - helping inaugurating the supernatural thread in the German silent cinéma. <br /> <br /> (Note: the first version I watched was about an hour (certainly not quite) and it was in bad condition, sometimes with whitened faces and so on. I'm not sure who was since then I also saw the Alpha DVD, which after 41 minutes contains the missing footage in the above-mentioned print, as well as less and very different title cards, but visually it's not that bad though.)
