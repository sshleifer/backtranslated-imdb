In the aftermath of Watergate, many underground films appeared, such as the one written by the late Adam Kennedy (based on his novels). <br /> <br /> Gene Hackman plays former veteran of Vietnam "Roy Tucker" who lost in prison. He receives visits from Marvin Tagge (Richard Widmark), who claims to represent an organization whose aim is to help the wrongdoer wrongly. They offer him freedom and despite distrust, Tagge accepts. But he takes with him a colleague from the cell named Spiventa (Mickey Rooney). Exactly why it's hard to see, because Spiventa is an annoying little man who drives Tucker crazy with a persistent conversation about sex, not what you want to hear when you're behind bars. <br /> <br /> Tagge benefactors kill Spivent in front of Tuck with astonished eyes. He reunited with his wife Ellie (Candice Bergen) and received a new identity (strange, he does not try to change his appearance.) Shaving this tacky mustache would be the beginning), settles, but discovers that there is a catch - Tagge wants Tucker to do it less than the murder of the president of the United States. He refuses, so Tagge kidnapped Ellie ... <br /> <br /> I will leave a summary here, but I'm sure you can guess the rest for yourself. The script has enough holes in the threads to read the book (a fun trick!). The people Tagge represents are never revealed. Allusions to the murder of J.F.K. they are obvious. Despite the findings of The Warren Commission, doubts as to whether Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, remains to this day. <br /> <br /> This was Stanley Kramer's first film for years, and although there is no turkey, he lacks the hug, say "The Manchurian Candidate" by John Frankenheimer or "The Parallax View" by Alan J.Pakuli. Being a left-wing conspiracy film, he has a tendency to wrap around his subject, instead of dealing with it. I personally prefer the right ones - they are more fun! "Domino" has an appearance and style reminiscent of T.V. film and boasts what must be the easiest escape from prison in the history of cinema, not to mention the end taken from the classic Michael Caine "Get Carter". <br /> <br /> What makes him watchable is Gene Hackman and Richard Widmark. The latter, who unfortunately died at the beginning of this year, is wonderful as a mysterious Tagge, which initially appears to be behind the surgery until he too is eliminated without any more, starting the death chain, which aims to remove all traces of evidence as one after another perpetrator bad shares are falling - just like dominoes. As Tucker, an innocent pawn, Hackman is wonderful. You have to wonder why he decided to hide in such an obvious place. In his shoes, I would run to the other end of the world, anywhere, to get away from these fanatics. Hackman's love scenes with Bergen slow down the story and it is almost a relief when she is kidnapped. Presumably, the producers thought so too, which explains why it starts with a bizarre prologue, depicting the whole premise of the film - expressed by the British actor Patrick Allen - warning the audience that "they" are there and that "they" want us. Comedian Les Dawson later faked this opening in his B.B.C. show "The Dawson Watch". <br /> <br /> Mickey Rooney previously collaborated with Kramer on "Its A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World". His death scene is similar to that of the picture, and the actor looks as if he has been stung by a wasp rather than shot. <br /> <br /> Previously, conspiracy movies were made only by the left, but now the law also begins to work. Last year, an absurd mixture of lies and half-truths about the government of Tony Blair turned out to be the British response to "Reefer Madness". At least "Domino" had a lovely Candice Bergen. The best film by Chris Atkins was Anne Widdecombe! <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, the "Domino principle" was created by Sir Lew Grade, the legendary British television giant for "The Saint", "Jesus Of Nazareth" and "The Muppet Show". He re-worked with Adam Kennedy in 1980. At "Raise The Titanic!", Whose defeat was so great that it eroded Grade's ambitions as the new Louis B. Meyer. Being a bit open, I would not rule out the possibility of conspiracy.
