"Stargate SG-1" tracks intergalactic explorations of the team called SG-1 using a device called Stargate and all surprises waiting on the other side of the wormhole. <br /> <br /> Seeing this series sporadically for It's the first few seasons when it first came out, I did not know how it really would be, 10 years after the last episode. My old impression was that the series was great, but my impression was far from the truth. "Stargate SG-1" is more than just a science fiction series, it's one of the best prepared, interesting, long and exciting science fiction ever produced. And why? Because it works on an amazing assumption. <br /> <br /> This value from the series significantly exceeds the value of the film on which it was based and I think it is a very good example of television, as a medium, with the right premise, is able to provide something that does not work on the limitation movie time. The sense of familiarity created by a long series, observing the characters and their circumstances that progress over time is staggering and simply increases the ability to suspend disbelief, and all this is the result of a great writing and dedication of the whole crew of the show. <br /> <br /> "Stargate SG-1" for 10 years offered great adventures, but never was afraid of the challenge of transferring the story and gave way in very different periods of the show: <br /> <br /> - First several seasons, perhaps up to 4/5, focused more on the exploration of planets and different situations, keeping sections unrelated to each other, if it was not always approaching Goauel's threat. <br /> <br /> - From the fifth to the seventh there were more and more episodes focusing on the fight against Goaul'd and preventing attacks on Earth. After these seasons, exploration of the planets was almost just an excuse to place sg-1 in the place of conflicts Goaul'd / replikator / ori <br /> <br /> - the eighth season is probably the most mixed. It has a stream of episodes that include minor earthly affairs in which the stargate is not even mentioned, but the last episodes contain some great moments of the replicator. <br /> <br /> - Travel 9 and 10 together because they have the same new enemy and there is no Jack O'Neil. Both are a good continuation, although the first few episodes of season 10 are a bit weak, because they seem to be little more than SG-1, and people / Jaffa are losing the battle after the battle with the Ori. <br /> <br /> Basically, after season 7, exploration has been pushed into the background, which in many ways was a shame because of the potential and mystery of every planet (episode) presented; on the other hand, it caused so many wonderful episodes of ongoing conflicts that the character change of the series continued to work and shows how wonderful and brave writers were. <br /> <br /> I do not even believe in the show to have a high quality ending, which nicely puts them to rest, I have the feeling that it can last; the people involved were great professionals, and the narrative of the series had a lot to offer. The last season returning to the initial nature of the series was very feasible and would be welcome, but ultimately everything is as it is. <br /> <br /> In the end, because I liked everything, it's a bit hard to find that it ends. The big picture, which, however, draws the work of hundreds of people in 10 years, is a view of beauty and a true testimony of the dedication of the crew, these outstanding actors and characters that we will always remember as a collective called SG-1.
