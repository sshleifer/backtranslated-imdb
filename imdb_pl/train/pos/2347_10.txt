I am a fan of Pushing Daisies from the very beginning. It is wonderfully invented, and Bryan Fuller has the most unusual ideas for this concert. <br /> <br /> It's unbelievable how much TV needs a creative, original program like Pushing Daisies. It is a huge relief to watch the program, unlike the rest, where, if you compare it with some newer programs, such as Scrubs and House, you'll see similarities, and sometimes it becomes boring to see shows so close to your identity. <br /> <br /> With a great cast, great scenario and cheerfulness in every episode, Pushing Daisies is, so far, one of the most amazing programs on TV.
