Whenever people ask me to name the scariest movie I've ever seen, I always say "Black Noon" and nobody has heard about it until today. <br /> <br /> I watched him 30 years ago at the age of 13, when my parents left for the evening. As far as I know, only once was shown in the UK and unfortunately is not available on DVD or VHS. <br /> <br /> If anyone can trace the copy, let me know. <br /> <br /> If I looked at it again, it would probably be a great disappointment, but it always stuck in my memory as a particularly disturbing movie!
