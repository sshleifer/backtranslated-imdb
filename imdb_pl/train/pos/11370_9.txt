Spoilers - if I describe characters and their relationship to the story. <br /> <br /> This is a high quality movie. The subject matter is both gloomy and addictive. The stubborn determination of Stephen Rei, Burakowa, is simply enchanting. With all apologies to him, his hangdog, the constantly imposed expression on the face serves the character well. It is, as we would say in England, the protagonist of the television series of Inspector Taggart, certainly grim because he sees three murders a week. Well, this is not strict, because Chikatila worked for many years ... <br /> <br /> You get a real sense of resistance from the USSR bureaucracy, perfectly presented by Joss Ackland (who often seems to have created this kind of role). <br /> <br /> The key figure (and I write this as a remake of the Body Snatchers Invasion is shown on the BBC1) is the character of Donald Sutherland "Mikhail Fetisov". His quiet support of Burakowa is unwavering. And it lasts through Perestroika and drives the FBI's involvement in profiling. Brilliant. <br /> <br /> This is mandatory when it comes to me.
