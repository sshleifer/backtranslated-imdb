This is one of the scariest, scariest and most thrilling horrors EVER! <br /> <br /> Dr. Creed (Louise) and his family move into a new home with his wife (Rachel), daughter (Ellie) and little son (Gage). Everything seems normal until Dr. Creed loses one patient, who had a terrible head injury, then the ghost visits him when Victor takes him to Pet Sematarta and shows him where the dead come alive. <br /> <br /> Louis does not know if it's all a dream and he is talking to Ellie, who is worried about her cat, who can be killed by a truck, and then Rachel tells Louis that it's really hard to talk about death from because of her sister Zelda, who was really sick (as we see in retrospection, how sick the sister really was and this is one of the most terrifying scenes in history!) <br /> <br /> Next day Louis calls Jed, saying that the cat he was killed by a truck and Jed took him to the place where Victor Duch told him not to go! And bury the cat, his wife and children will go see their grandparents, and Louise is alone in the house, shocked to see that the cat has returned, and now it is so bad in him that he is going to see Jed, and Jed tells him that he also buried the dog there too (As we saw in other flashbacks). <br /> <br /> Later in the movie Family at the picnic, Gage plays with a kite and Gage says I'm dropping him, "The wind blows a stick near the road, where the trucks are approaching the past, Gage is approaching the road, Louis is rushing to get it, the most heart-wrenching scene in any horror movie will go away with your jaws on the floor or shivers will go back to you when you hear Louis scream, Soon he misses him so much that Louis buries Gage in the same place where buried is the Cat. <br /> <br /> The most horrible thing about this movie is that some of the scenes in this movie are not too far away from life. <br /> <br /> This movie is simply amazing, and acting everyone was great! 10 out of 10
