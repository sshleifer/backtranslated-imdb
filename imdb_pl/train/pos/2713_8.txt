Wilson (Erica Gavin) is caught by the cops and sent to jail in this skilful and funny example of using the first-class 70s, marking the directorial debut of Jonathan Demme. After writing and producing several films of "New World" mentor Roger Cormans, Demme got the opportunity to direct for the first time, and he provides a movie that not only delivers the expected and tasty doses of nudity and violence, but has attractive cheek-cheek quality; he is often as funny as brilliant. <br /> <br /> Distinguishing scenes are a lewd and raw vaudeville act, performed for prisoners, as well as a powerful sequence of dreams / fantasies for the restless and obviously suppressed Superintendent McQueen icon of horror Barbara Steele, making a wonderful turn in this antagonistic role ). I also loved the scene of bank theft and the kidnapping scene, which was simply noisy. Similarly to other such films, it is also praiseworthy that it is a portrait of female initiation because it is pure exploitation. These women are hard, they do not take away any garbage and are more than capable of dealing with themselves. <br /> <br /> Our attractive cast here takes full advantage of their roles: Juanita Brown as an aggressive Maggie, Robert Collins as sassy Belle, Rainbeaux Smith as a lovely and shy Lavelle, Gavin as a novice with wide eyes and Lynda Gold (aka Crystin Sinclaire) in a bright appearance as an accomplice on the outside. <br /> <br /> As our climax unfolds, Demme goes out with a strained "beat of the clock", when our heroines are racing to save Belle from lobotomization by predatory Dr. Randolph (Warren Miller), a type of man who does not think on the use of women. <br /> <br /> By jumping according to the aromatic result of John Cales, "Caged Heat" is optimistic entertainment and a guaranteed good time. <br /> <br /> 8/10
