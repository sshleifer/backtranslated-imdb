With a lot of sunlight, light and filtering shadows through windows and rooms, tracking photos moving around the crowd with a handheld camera, fast editing and extreme close-ups here and there, photography is an interesting, artistically made film. <br /> <br /> The plot of this film starts with a bit of fluffiness about the beauty contest. The film begins on a warm Sunday at the local swimming pool, where we meet the lovely Lucienne aka Lulu (played by Louise Brooks) - a bit of showing off the men staring at the pool, soon decides to enter each other to represent France in the beauty contest Miss Europe, much to her disappointment very jealous, imitating in the mud fiance (really annoying guy). The ten competitors running along the runway are wearing swimsuits, while the winner is chosen as the contestant who receives the longest applause (I wondered if the girls could not just walk more slowly to prolong their time - applause - applause) !). Soon, Lulu is chased by the prince and Maharaja, but her hot head does not like the attention given to her by other men or her adoring audience (I guess he just wants her in his house, cooking his meals and staying out of sight, which ?!). <br /> <br /> Louise Brooks is beautiful and cute, her presence helps to strengthen this movie, but it's really the way of photography that interests me the most. A strange, dubbed sound is slightly distracting, which is somewhat detached. The printout on this version looked very clear and full of nice contrast. Watching this, I just tried to overlook the sound problems and watch the movie visually, and found the film perfect, worth seeing.
