Footlight Parade is one of the best music comedies from the 1930s. A humorous screenplay and star cast, including Jimmy Cagney, charming Joan Blondell, Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler, make this movie better than the rest. The film, directed and choreographed by the creative genius Busby Berkeley, will make you smile from ear to ear from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> Of course, Busby is the undisputed master of the Hollywood musical from "Gold Diggers from 1933" and "42nd Street" on his account (as Dance Director). The parade of lights is colored by hundreds of scantily dressed choristers, a Berkeley trademark. The fancy dance numbers were shot with only one camera, and Busby was the first director who filmed close-ups of dancers. His obsession with shapely legs and "rear" shots is widely demonstrated here. The overall effect is very erotic and hypnotizing. <br /> <br /> Our boyfriend Jimmy Cagney plays in Chester Kenta, the producer of "prologues" or short music productions on stage, which were performed in cinemas to entertain the audience in front of the gadgets shown. He is surrounded by winding partners, a corporate spy, and a girl digging gold. Although Cagney had solid experience in vaudeville, it was the first film in which he showed his dance talents. Joan Blondell is remembered as clever Cagney's puzzle, secretary of lovestruck. And Ruby Keeler is adorable as always. <br /> <br /> The movie reaches its peak thanks to three outstanding production numbers, "Honeymoon Hotel", "The Waterfall" and "Shanghai Lil", each of them is a masterpiece and probably will not be reproduced in today's Hollywood, where so-called "Special effects" replaced creative cinematography. <br /> <br /> Claudia's bottom line: Clever and erotic, with some of the best music numbers ever made on celluloid. An extremely pleasant epoch of depression.
