The film "Men in White" is definitely one of the funniest, if not the hottest comedy movies I've ever watched! (and watched a lot!) It's about two garbagemens who become "men in white" and then stop an invasion from space. It is also a parody of many classic films, such as "Men in Black", "Star Wars" or "Dr. Strangelove. " Anyone who says that this movie is crappy has something wrong with the head. There are a lot of funny gags and jokes, and you can really hurt your mouth, laughing too much (it happened to me!). If you can watch this movie on TV, watch it now - you will not regret it!
