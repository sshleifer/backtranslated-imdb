Some have compared this movie to Deliverance. I believe that Mice and men are more appropriate. Our main man, Heaton, definitely loves Spike. It does not matter if it's sexual love or not. This is the reason why Heaton does not leave Spike. He needs him. They need each other. As brothers, as a family, as the only connection with humanity. The setting, scenario, and minimal cast make a great movie. Honestly, I did not care what happened to the heroes. But I took care of what the filmmaker did with them. He handled them well. I spent some time wondering how the ending will look like Mouse and Men. The soundtrack and photos were attractive and intriguing.
