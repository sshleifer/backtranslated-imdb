This raises the year after the events in the "Basic Instinct". Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone) is now in London. While having sex with a footballer while driving a car traveling at a speed of 110 miles per hour (do not ask), she leaves the road and ends up in the Thames. She survives - he does not. The police employ a psychiatrist Michael Glass (David Morrissey) to see if he is mentally competent to stand trial. Naturally, he begins to play with his mind instead of murder and sex. <br /> <br /> This movie was doomed before it even opened. It took forever to get the cast and director, the scenario problems were permanent, and the cast was not happy (Morrissey often complained about the movie). It's still not that bad. It's very similar to the first one - there is lush music, beautiful locations, lots of sex and nudity (it had to be edited on R), nice plot and good game - but it has no effect. This is like retreading the first one. People are killed here with a leash on a choker (I believe) ... just like people were killed by an ice cube in the first one. In one sweet moment, Stone picks up an ice cube and looks at her wistfully. He also plays mind games with a man and can draw him into murders. The similarities are too obvious. <br /> <br /> It is also VERY rated - there are a lot of explicit sexual conversations, men's nudity (Morrissey looks much better naked than Michael Douglas), feminine nudity (Stone still looks great) and some bloody murders. The action is good in all areas. Stone is simply fantastic; Morrissey looks miserable, but it's OK; Charlotte Rampling and David Thewlis are good at supporting roles. <br /> <br /> So - it's not bad at all, but it seems to be the remake of the first one. I still recommend it. People just attacked it because Stone is not liked and they thought it was stupid to do the "Basic ..." sequel 14 years after it was created.
