I really liked this film because I have a great interest in American history ... in particular, Antebellum and the civil war. I recently bought it from the shelf with previously watched films for sale in a supermarket and I was very happy to add it to my collection of historical films. Although not of the caliber of civil war films such as "Glory" or "Gettysburg", he provides a lot of stories about the pre-Civilian brotherhood of cadets in West Point. <br /> <br /> It may be gray uniforms, youth or military discipline, but I am fascinated by the history of the Cadet Corps from about 1830 to the edge of the war. I imagine what it was like to sit in the classroom with other young men, learn how to fight, and then lay down lessons against your classmates! <br /> <br /> There were actually two classes in 1861: one class in May, the other in June. the film does not mention this, with the exception of Henry A. DuPont, the first graduate of the May class; and George Custer, the last graduate of the June class. the reason for both classes was not so much the war, which resulted from the transition to a four-year course, after a few years of experimenting with a five-year course (I think that the first class had been attending for five years, the second for four). As the film shows, the cadets were like brothers and often had nicknames ... George "Fanny" or "Autie" Custer; Alonzo "Lon" Cushing; James "Beauty" Stuart (for JEB Stuart, class 1854), etc. <br /> <br /> I say that this movie is "Santa Fe Trail", as it should be, because this movie from 1940, though pleasant, history is really going through. The cadets from several different classes finish together. JEB Stuart and George Custer are portrayed as best friends and are side by side in stopping John Brown's rise in 1859 at Harper's Ferry. In fact, Stuart and Custer have never been friends but enemies during the war. They faced each other (for the first time) in Gettysburg in 1863 (Stuart was on Harper's Raid ferry, but Custer was still a cadet at the point when it happened). <br /> <br /> "Fanny" Custer plays a role in class "61", although his classmates Dev O'Neill and Shelby Peyton are fictional. I believe that they are based on Partick Henry O'Rorke and John Pelham, two people you can see. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I really like this movie or any movie that provides a window to the mid-nineteenth century America.
