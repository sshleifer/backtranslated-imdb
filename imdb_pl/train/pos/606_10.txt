I have seen many of Saura's films and have always found the amazing way in which he creates music, dance, drama and great cinema in his films. Ib√©ria shows even better Saura, dealing with multimedia concepts and a more contemporary concept of dance and music. Another thing that drew my attention is that in this film, dancers and musicians, dance and music are equally important: the camera shows different aspects of music interpretation, examining not only technical issues, but also the emotional experience of the game. The interest of Saura as a bridge between classical and contemporary music and dance is another element that can make this film the most aesthetically pleasing among his other works. Therefore, I strongly recommend it to those who love good cinema, good music, good dance, great art.
