Why producers did not give a chance to show All trash on TV, why producers did not give Six Six chance? Will the series hit the video? I would like to see how it ends. Put the season first on video and sell. I was a loyal Six Degrees fan and waited for his return. I put my recorder on the tape of all programs. Thank God for that. I just found out that the show was canceled and I have a broken heart. I would like to know that it will be canceled, why did not they tell us? I thought that the program develops the depth of the form. Writing was also quite good. Steven (Campbell Scott) is my favorite. I'm sorry to see that!
