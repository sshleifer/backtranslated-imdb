This movie is fun and suitable for all ages. It is definitely family entertainment. The cast does a great job by playing people in the midwestern town of Big Bean, Illinois. Where we have to assume that nothing is happening, because the excitement (before the invasion) of the decade is the new (and only) access ramp from the interstate. Location speaks for a boring and totally unbelievable for the invasion of Marsans to Earth. But these Martians are completely inept, even though they are well-equipped with an arsenal of properly ghastly and deadly weapons ... including one destined to fight the Martians! The Martians are worried and throwing accents so that our viewers and residents would like to help them ... leave the earth. J. J. Anderson playing a very young carnivorous Halloween duck just has great lines. Watch this movie for laughter and entertainment; makes you think is not. But it is subtle and pleasant.
