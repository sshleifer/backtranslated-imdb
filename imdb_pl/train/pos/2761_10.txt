I saw this movie first on my way home from Paris to Newark aboard Air France in August 1996. I consider the film a masterpiece. It's a movie that people should do. I still think that Daniel Auteuil is one of the sexiest actors around. In this French movie he plays a divorced father and businessman who lost his joy of life until he passed through Down's syndrome, who lives in an institution with other patients with Down Syndrome. Actors, including an actor who actually has Down syndrome, create a credible friendship and relationship between these two unlikely men. Daniel's life and ours change forever with Down's syndrome. He realizes that life is not only work, not fun, but life and love, and that's what life should be. The ending is a little stupid, but I still think it's one of my favorite movies. Just bring a tear to your eye.
