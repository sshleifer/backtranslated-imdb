I saw this movie (its English title is "Who's Singing Over There?") During the Montreal International Film Festival in 1980. Then rave won ... and disappeared. Horrible shame. It `s genius. Lofty, funny, sad and extremely funny. The script is a work of art. It's been 19 years and I've only seen a few comedies (or any other genre, that's it) that match their originality.
