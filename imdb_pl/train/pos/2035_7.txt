Well, I'm going to go against the rules of this movie, so it seems. Being a self-proclaimed horror fan, I sat down to this, not quite knowing what to expect. After 2 or 3 minutes I was really scared (quite rare). The film obviously has a small budget and is geared towards the charing cross station, but the lack of money in movies does not divert attention from the story. Yes, the story is a bit stretched and it does not explain too well, but THE CREEP is a class act and continues to cut and dismember everything that appears. COMMUNICATION FOR LADIES !!! THEY ARE SOME PARTS OF THE FILM THAT SHOULD BE CLOSED WITH EYES, AT LEAST OR LEAST SOON! understand when you see it. <br /> <br /> All in all a good movie and it changes to see a good slass movie that actually scares
