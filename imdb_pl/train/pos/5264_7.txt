A stunning mini movie, a musical based on three cuts by Cole Porter from Broadway. Bob Hope's first acclaimed film is a joy! He plays an American playboy millionaire on holidays in Paris. The film begins with the fact that he sits at a table in a cafe outside, telling his friends about the beauty that will take his breath away. Suddenly he sees her a few yards away. it is so much that his friends tease him and suggest "just show her your banking book". But Hope says he can win her in less than 30 days for "no" money! They put on polo ponies and take all his money and ID cards. Hope follows her, and when they are alone, he makes a proposition he does not believe is sincere until Cole Porter's "You Do Something to Me" sings. But he has to leave, and he tries to make money as a guide so he can pursue her. But when he sees him showing another girl in the city, disappointed that he wants to drop him. She continues to pursue her and catches up with her and her family on the race track, where she places her modest wages in the last race, hoping to win enough to impress her. Through a series of events and large synchronized dance numbers he loses the winning ticket and decides to marry him rich or poor. So she wins the girl, race and bet and sings two more songs!
