"Citizen X" tells the story of the "Butcher of Rostov", a pseudonym of a shameful and perverse Russian serial killer who in 1978-92 won 52 lives. The film focuses on the detective of the novice (Rea), who stubbornly pursued the killer against any adversity in the face of a bureaucratic unwillingness to cooperate in self-service and convenient denial. HBO film for t.v., the movie offers a solid cast, good performances, saves the audience a lot of frightening details, but plays like a docudrama without a Hollywood-like style. A steady and simple dramatization of a serious and relatively unknown story more interesting than "Jack the Ripper". (B)
