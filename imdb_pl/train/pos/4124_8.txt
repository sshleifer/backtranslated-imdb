Lloyd Bridges as Mike Nelson and his boat were the stars of this series. Which made me look so good that it was a real feeling underwater. The performance shows the youthful energy of energy to explore underwater, which is contagious. <br /> <br /> The show was also educational, showing viewers things about diving from someone who looked like a seasoned professional, Mike Nelson. The performances were excellent and the program always seemed to be well-made. I admit that the drama in the scenarios sometimes goes into the same notes in more than one episode, but each program has its own program with every other program produced in this era, the infancy of American television.
