The sensitive film does not have a sparkle and, to some extent, a narrative structure, but it is nevertheless perfectly made and made. The point of the narrative structure is, however, controversial. Although it gives the impression that it ends nicely in the final scenes, and combines your thoughts with what contemporary viewers can describe as a "story", I am skeptical about whether this feeling * needs * the narrative structure 'is definite and detectable. It will inevitably be compared with SOMERSAULT because its the main character (I'm not sure if it's the right word!) There is a young and very young woman whose newly discovered sexuality confuses and strengthens her - although of course Film Cate Shortland is better at this aspect. But while reckless viewers have the option of rejecting this film as a clich√©, PEACHES is in some respects much more ambitious than SOMERSAULT. Perhaps that's where it fails. This is certainly very different from Monahan's first function - INTERVIEW! I'm not entirely sure how the sex scenes between Weaving and Lung have added to the story. Who knows - maybe it was. They certainly tried to discredit and defect the character of Weaving - though personally I think it was achieved without the need for these scenes. <br /> <br /> ***** JUST SAW THE FILM AGAIN ***** **** <br /> <br /> During the second watch, I see how some people reject it as a telemovie disguised as a function. But I'm not sure how clear these "categories" are, or even whether we should make this distinction. In any case, I think there are enough layers in the film to distinguish it from Hallmark's efforts. On the other hand, the structure of the film is very formal and its content is not difficult, at least to the extent to which SOMERSAULT, TOM WHITE, THREE DOLLARS, ILLUSTED FAMILY DOCTOR, LOOK BOTH WAYS and THE HUMAN TOUCH are. All performances are good, but I came to the conclusion that the main reason I'm enjoying the movie is that it matches the "Australian" genre, not necessarily adding something ... and I understand that it can be quite a good reason for another person * NO * to like! Indeed, it is only when Lung entered the room in her Vietnamese dress that the film really begins to pack. But that leads us to the next debate - * should we * expect that the film must constantly challenge us? I certainly like to challenge a film (or a book or other people), but is there no room for what is simply a nice story? <br /> <br /> I have not removed my first post about this movie because I am too aware of the Orwellian subtext of such an act. But I would lower my initial grade from 8 to maybe 6.5. <br /> <br /> When it comes to AFI Best Film nominations, my voices go to THE HUMAN TOUCH, THREE DOLLARS and LOOK BOTH WAYS - and I think LOOK Both ways should win.
