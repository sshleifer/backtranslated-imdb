Announced as the story of Steve Biko - well played by Denzel Washington, as you might expect - it was actually the story of Donald Woods, played by Kevin Kline. <br /> <br /> It was undoubtedly the creation of Kline as a serious actor and he was surprisingly good in this role. <br /> <br /> Attenborough gave a direction that one would expect, and often the spectacular scenes of the masses were of such a kind that only he could get through. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast was competent enough and did a good job, which eventually ends with a sad story about South Africa, which is still not in the distant past.
