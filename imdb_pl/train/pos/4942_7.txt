I must admit that for the first half hour of the movie I was basically lost. There was a bit of funny humor, but at best a divine plot and a general sense of senselessness which was close to compelling me to think that I was wasting my time. Then - for no apparent reason - I suddenly realized that I liked it. There was no blinding moment of realization and no suddenly dramatic scene that captured me. In fact, nothing exciting is happening in the entire film. It was as if I suddenly realized that the film was to be largely pointless - and that there was charm in its futility. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman acted as an unnamed actor who found a "small project" to start a career. He's going to play in a supermarket and spend the day at a supermarket near to explore the role. There he meets and connects with Scarlet (played by Paza Vega) - a cashier who wants more from life. She helps her prepare for the interview, as if she was listening to the role, and she introduces him to real life. It's really fun watching "him" (because this is how the hero is identified in the subtitles), be overwhelmed by a visit to the local Target store. <br /> <br /> Freeman and Vega were wonderful together, with a strange but complete reliable combination of romantic but paternal chemistry. If you feel lost at the beginning, stick with it. In the end, it turns out that it is a charmingly charming film. 7/10
