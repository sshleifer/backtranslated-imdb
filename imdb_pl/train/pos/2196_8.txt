... so what's in those missing 10 minutes that were so awful that they had to cut them out of the original movie? We had three years to produce the movie ... Barbara Stanwyck played in the original play, but here, Carole Lombard plays Maggie King. Star Co, Fred MacMurray, is probably best known for "Double Damage" with Stanwyck, as well as his hit TV program "My Three Sons". Look out for the young Dorothy Lamour (Bob Hope's films) and too fabulous Franklin Pangborn, who made every film on tape. Of course, he works in a beauty salon on a ship! Add sublime Charles Butterworth and Anthony Quinn. Good timing and clever banting in the beginning. Maggie Ella's girlfriend plays Jean Dixon, who was the best friend in "Holiday" and "My Man Godfrey". In Maggie's "Swing High", a tourist meets a soldier who leaves the army. Maggie misses the boat when she leaves the port and becomes a soldier. Ten-year-old Quinn has a small stage at a local bar in Panama, where Johnson (MacMurray) plays the trumpet. Maggie, Harry (Butterworth) and Skid team together and try to find out how to get back to the States. Good singing Lamour. A good (but short) performance by Cecil Cunningham as "Murph", a wise, helpful owner of a local saloon in Panama. While others regretted that it was bad, it was not so terrible or even somewhat exotic, with a fake location in Central America for the first half of the movie.
