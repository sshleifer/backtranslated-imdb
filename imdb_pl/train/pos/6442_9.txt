It's a great Swedish movie ... it was the first Swedish movie I've seen ... it's simple and deep ... what a great combination! <br /> <br /> Michael Nyqvist did a great job as a famous conductor seeking peace in his hometown. <br /> <br /> Frida Hallgren was great as his inspirational girl who helped him continue and never give up. <br /> <br /> The struggle between the conductor and the hypocritical priest who loses the battle with Michael when his wife stands in front of him and defends Michael's noble cause to help his native people find their own peace in music. ... it was not that good, but it has some deep meaning.
