I would not know about this movie if it was not for its "unexpected" Oscar nomination for the best animated film. Fortunately, it turned out that I could watch this animated little treasure. <br /> <br /> The story tells the story of a child Brendan was the nephew of the impressive and overprotective abbot of the town of Kells. The main occupation in front of the abbot is to build a wall protecting Kells from attacking Vikings. One day Aiden, a well-known illustrator from Iona, sought refuge for them. Aiden opens Brendan's eyes to the art of illustration and the temptation of the outside world. Along the way, Brendan made friends with the white forest spirit of Aisling, who tried to regain the ancient crystal invaluable for the meticulous art of illustrating books. <br /> <br /> The "Secret Kells" is different from most animations these days. It is a kind of change, because the illustrations are made in raw geometrical lines and designs without much care for realism, just like symbolism. The movements of these lines resemble the simplified but fluent style of animation used in the initial sequence of "Kung Fu Panda". However, this great use of color is the main source of admiration for the audience. The reds used in the sequence of the Viking invasion are unforgettable. <br /> <br /> Try to catch this silent jewel of the movie. This is a welcome respite from the senseless bombastic current animated tariff, such as "Monsters Vs. Aliens "and the like. The modest Celtic music score is effective in creating a sense of fantasy that saturates the film. OK, the story can be a bit shallow and the ending is a bit short. I would like to know more about the Book, on which Brendan and Aiden worked. But the clear star of the film is its amazing stylized graphics, which is based on a work from the real Book of Kells.
