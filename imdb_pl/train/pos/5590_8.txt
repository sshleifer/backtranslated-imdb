(There is no need to summarize the story, because others have already done it.) <br /> <br /> It is understandable that many viewers find a mistake in the movie, raised as in the case of today's kineplex impression. Against this background, it seems that a movie like Ecstasy wandered from another planet. I think there are several reasons why it is worth it. <br /> <br /> Most importantly, the film develops poetically because the camera moves slowly over the surrounding hills, trees, clouds, etc., providing a calm and lyrical sense of the natural world that integrates a man and a woman into its fold. Together, they reveal a style and dimension almost completely absent in today's technology-based theaters, where the editing of quick fire works to distract the audience and not focus on it. In addition, the story is conveyed through the eye rather than the ear, almost without a dialogue explaining what is happening. This means another extreme departure from today's very literal tariff, where visuals seem to count only when they excite the audience. But maybe the most disturbing - the movie is sometimes incredibly quiet, not in the sense that silent films are quiet because we expect them to be. But in the sense that characters rarely say when we expect it. So the weight of the story is shared between the creator of the film and the viewer. The former must skillfully choose their visuals to convey the narrative, while the latter must think about these visualizations because they will not be explained. <br /> <br /> None of this is intended to diminish today's film - making. It is enough to emphasize that a film like Machata comes from a completely different aesthetics than the one we have today. I'm not saying that I will be better or worse. I argue, however, that Ecstasy represents longing, which is very lacking in today's film experiences, where such "contemplative values ​​are routinely rejected as slow and boring. <br /> <br /> The film itself is not a masterpiece, although sometimes it reaches the artistic heights, as in the beautifully composed scenery of the beer garden, in which the last lugs float to show the magnificent picture below. The slow landscapes of the countryside with the pantheistic celebration of life, nature and regeneration express themselves splendidly. These are scenes that do not overwhelm you, but instead - a given half-chance - they accumulate quietly in the experience as unforgettable in their own way as tingling in the spine. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the movie is sometimes heavy, as it is when Machata overlaps with photos, especially in the final sequence of work. It is difficult to know what to do with this rather destructive presence. Perhaps symbolism has to do with the heroic dimension, which hard work has for a hero with love binoculars and people in general - this topic is then promoted by influential Soviet cinema. Still, his presence here is quite boring. <br /> <br /> In any case, I must admit that at first I tuned in to see the wonderful Hedy LaMarr in the buff. But now I have to admit that in this process I got so much more than just watching in the forest.
