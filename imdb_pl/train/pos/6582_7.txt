Okay, so there's the view from the front of the Checker taxi, probably in the late thirties. It has big triangular headlights. There is also a DeSoto cabin in this black and white, driven by character, almost musical love. Hairstyles, male and female are great. If Dolly Parton had Victor Mature's hair, she could do it. There is an attic of artists who would be the envy of every fortune-teller Andy Warhol. <br /> <br /> If you watch this, awaiting the great story of Casablanca or the Sound of Music oom-pah-pah, you will be disappointed. Under this approach to the runway model is a nice little story. <br /> <br /> My copy on DVD with another movie for 1 $ was very visible. The title sequence was adorable, but she was not there with Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World or The Pink Panther. It was a RKO movie, but it did not have a nice airplane logo that RKO used. <br /> <br /> I liked Victor Mature in One Million, B.C., Sampson and Delilah, especially on Violent Saturday. Check if you can find it. He was wonderful in a comedy with Peter Sellers called Caccia Alla Volpe or After The Fox. <br /> <br /> Richard Carlson did I Led Three Lives on TV in the early 50s. <br /> <br /> Vic Mature was proposed as part of Sampson's father in the remake of Sampson and Delilah. Apparently he was asked if he would have problems playing the role of his father because he was so well known as Sampson. Wiktor replied: "If money is right, I will play Sampson's mother." <br /> <br /> Tom Willett
