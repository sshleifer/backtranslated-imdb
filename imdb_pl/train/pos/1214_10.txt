It all started with True Heart Bear and Noble Heart Horse to ensure the club's safety. A noble heart horse met Dawn & John and took them to see the True Heart Bear. Later, the care counter has dropped more and see if it's a Dark Heart, but they can not go unless the club cares, so they ask Dawn & John to look after the club. After the True Heart of the Bear and the Noble Horse of the Heart Return, They send Dawn and John back to the camp. Than the club bears and cousins ​​grew up to prepare for the fight against Dark Heart. Finally, kidnapping a Dark Heart through the caring bear and children (Dawn & John) must tell Christy that Dark Heart is bad. Then they work together to save the Caring Bears. Later, the True Heart Bear and the Noble Horse of the Heart discovered him in the shadow of the Dark Heart and returned to care for the earth to discover that they were gone. Children (Dawn, John and Christy) come, but they have no power to stop the Dark Heart. The True Heart Bear & Noble Heart Horse come with the help of Dawn, John and Christy to free other bears, but Christy got in the way and was hit by the Dark Heart magic. Than the Dark Heart saw how Christy was hit and stopped fighting with the care bear to help her, but he can not, because Dark Heart (alone) has no power to take care of Christy's rescue. Care for bears and children help Dark Heart save Christy. Now Dark Heart is taking care and he became a real boy who fell in love with Christy. Dark Heart is now a real boy and helps Christy in training in the camp. <br /> <br /> It's a great move in history and the best movie about Care Bears I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I like all movies about caring for bears and I can not wait to see "Care Bears: Big Wish Movie (2005)". <br /> <br /> Who likes this movie?
