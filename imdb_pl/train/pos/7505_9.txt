If there's one genre I've never been a fan, it's biographical. Always confusing, full of false information, exaggeratedly dramatized scenes and scams all around, biopics are almost never done correctly. Even in the hands of really talented directors, such as Martin Scorsese (The Aviator) and Ron Howard (Beautiful Mind), they often do great harm to people who try to capture on the screen. Skepticism takes the place of hype, because most of the biopsies that hit the big screen, and Bettie's notorious side did not differ. Some critics and viewers opposed Gretchen Mol for the role of Bettie Page, saying that he is no longer a celebrity and has no chops for his role. I never doubted that Mol could handle this part, but I never expected her performance to be as far back as I watched the movie a few hours ago. Mol delivers a boring Oscar as a cult pin-up girl from the 1950s, which after an early life of abuse (presented subtly and tastefully done, which will probably be done by only a few directors) will accidentally become one of the most frequently discussed models of all time. The image takes up a lot of earth in 90 minutes, but in no less than three thread threads, there is still the impression that the story may be missing a small part. Director / co-author Marry Harron and Guinevere The fantastic scenario of Turner is only too sudden and not as clear as it should be. Still, both ladies must admit that they have created an almost flawless biography that pays homage to both its theme and the decade that it emulates masterfully. Come to Oscar, Mol, Turner and Harron should receive nominations. I doubt it would happen, although there are certainly no more women than three. 9/10
