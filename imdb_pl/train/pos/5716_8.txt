I have not seen any Japanese Grudge movie, but I really like this one. I rarely get SCARED while watching movies. I can jump if the effect and sound are surprising enough, but scaring a movie is a rarity for me. But I got scared of resentment. Maybe because I did not expect anything when I watched. I did not expect to be scared. I did not know anything about it either. It was probably a good thing. <br /> <br /> It's a movie that you apparently either love or hate. Most people compare them to Japanese Grudge movies, but although I have not seen them, I do not think it's appropriate to compare any film. This film is in itself. <br /> <br /> History is weak, as most people say. I do not agree. The story is minimal and deliberately done. The techniques used to tell a story - for example a broken time period - are perfectly made. The director knows exactly what he's doing, and I believe he got his vision the way he wanted it to. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 8 out of 10. This is a movie that will appeal to watching or hating. It's so simple.
