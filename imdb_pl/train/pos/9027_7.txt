Above-average movie and acting partly corrupted by a completely predictable plot. Even the music is chosen so that words fit the action every time. The smell of the Pleasantville camp hangs around this movie. As a piece from the age it is more accurate than not. His description of the tragedies of cities and the lack of mobility up is sketchy but moving. Chris Cooper performs first-rate performances as Howard's miner.
