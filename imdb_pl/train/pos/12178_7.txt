I think this film has a low rating because it was rated by the worst moments. There is a joke about diarrhea and an embarrassing scene with nutting, but there are really a few moments that made me laugh. Jason Lee performs a wonderfully subtle comedy in this movie, and Julia Stiles herself is damn funny. In addition, this movie behaves like most romantic comedies, after about 40 minutes you know how it will end. (Which is better than most of them, where you already know after +/- 5 minutes). In any case, better movies to watch, but definitely not the worst choice ... Regards
