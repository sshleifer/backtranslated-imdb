Henri Verneuil represented the commercial cinema in France in 1960-1980. Always strong at the box office and usually telling dramatic and tense tales about casino robberies, settlement of mafia results and battles of World War II, Verneuil can count on being able to offer us two hours of entertainment on Saturday night. He worked with the cream of male actors of his time: Gabinem, Belmondo, Fernandel, Delon, Sharif, Anthony Quinn. I ... comme Icare is the only time Yves Montand directed. It is a strangely static film, taking place mainly in offices and conference rooms, containing not one scene of pursuit and almost no violence. <br /> <br /> Montand gives a good performance if it is a bit dry and he is well supported by other actors. I could not help thinking what Costa-Gavras could do with this story, based on Z (murder of Lambrakis) and L'aveu (torture of Artur London in Czechoslovakia by Stalinists).
