This is a musical adaptation of Dicken's Oliver Twist. Most of the original story has been preserved, but some threads have been omitted for the film's flow (such as summer, which he spent on regenerating and a half-brother). The biggest difference in film and history is that at the end of the book Fagin is hanged - an ending very different from this musical movie. <br /> <br /> It's a one of a kind musical - one whose style and range really has not been matched before or since. The songs are often quite pleasant and memorable, but the choreography of the film is visible. While in most musicals, a few people, maybe even a small group, dance in choreography, here the numbers often encounter hundreds or even more. It's a really great view and I was lucky to see him in the theater when he made his debut and is one of my earliest childhood memories. Just a few moments ago, when I saw him again, I must say that the film has improved over time. Great sets, wonderful acting and singing - this is a unique feast, which is hard not to love. <br /> <br /> By the way, when I saw the movie again, I was surprised how high and feminine Mark Lester's singing was for the film. Well, according to IMDb, his singing was named by a girl and that would certainly be his voice.
