This film is amazing for three main reasons. It is beautifully beautiful. I liked it very much. The film features a bold color theme with unusual costumes and picturesque scenography. Photography that looks very expensive (and probably was not) complements the look. I always like these stories about unadapted / lonely groups who meet and become a family. Sometimes they fall into clich√©, but this one does not. This group of actors really presents defective, but very nice characters. Alan Larkin is the best (between him, the van and the road movie, I could not help but remember my favorite movie from last year's Little Miss Sunshine ??). I discovered Fabrizio Bentivoglio, a very interesting actor, and I was just nervous about a bit of Til Schweiger's performance. The opening scene, all scenes in which they spoil their tricks, are very funny. The film has a mix of humor and emotions. I really like the end. And of course, it's about the Magician. A good magician makes the audience look where they want to create an illusion. What exactly is what a film director does and why they call it film magic.
