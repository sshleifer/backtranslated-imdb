I have not seen a movie from Nolte that I did not like. However, it was said that he did a lot of movies and only saw a few. In my mind, I keep here the images of his performance and the one in the "Thin Red Line". Nolte has a full range of acting talents. When you need to shout, he roars like a wounded lion. His best moments are those that I value in actors: when it just emanates through gestures of face, hand and body, saying nothing. I came to the conclusion that our current generation of actors, in general, underestimates what an actor can do without speaking, without knowing the mastery of Keaton and Chaplin, the generation of actors is too much based on the mechanical magic of computers. Of course, this is also a sign of the times in which we live. Did Chaplin live in our time ... who knows, he could just as easily become a fan of CGI tools. <br /> <br /> I have not read the Vonnegut novel from which this movie appears on the screen. However, the plot is not so far advanced or complicated that we can not follow the path, even with all its surprises. Of course, at first it seems ridiculous. However, this is not impossible. <br /> <br /> Consider this at the beginning: Spy in the heart of the Third Reich: the extraordinary life of Fritz Kolbe, America's most important spy in the Second World War, Delattre and Prichard (look at Amazon for more details). Think about it: Undercover history: Piercing the Reich: American Spies Inside Nazi Germany DVD (I saw it here: http://store.aetv.com/html/product/index.jhtml?id=75054) seems to be producing the History Channel. <br /> <br /> So, is this story funny? Far taken yes, impossible, no. Return to the story. Nolte's character is recruited and takes on an unbelievably dangerous mission, and unfortunately the script does not give us enough reason why he accepts it. Was it a kind of passivity that he was drawn into this role, he says, because it was the best story he ever wrote and played a role? It is hard to imagine that any of us would understand. But it was an amazing time and people did extraordinary things. <br /> <br /> Acting throughout the entire cast is great and, as people have noticed, Alan Arkin, always fantastic, is very good at a small role. <br /> <br /> I was really shocked at the end of the movie (no - I will not mess it up) and made me feel awful because of the choice. Did this person feel that the road was finally over and that he had said everything that was necessary and that the chapters would be added to a life filled with many burnt pages? It's hard to say, but it really shakes. <br /> <br /> Nolte gives one of the best performances you can expect ... the premise of the movie makes you wonder about many things. It's very funny and provocative. What great films should be. A bit long, but it's worth it. By the way, film music has the choice of one of the best living composers: Arvo Part.
