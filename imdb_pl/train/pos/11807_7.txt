After watching Dick Tracy in the $ 6.99 basket at Future Shop, I decided to try without any knowledge and be a huge fan of Mafia and Crime movies. I was very surprised to see a very funny, intelligent entertainment film with solid performances. The film is moving well, of course it has another solid performance by Warren Beatty, but the real distinguishing features of the film are Al Pacino and Madonna. I was happy when I learned that Pacino was nominated for his role as an above-average gangster trying to suppress the city. Madonna was great as a lady in danger, she really impressed me and added depth to her performance. If you want to watch a funny, intelligent movie with great acting and a solid script, try Dick Tracy. I do not think you will be disappointed. And watch episodes including Paul Sorvino, James Caan, Kathy Bates and Dustin Hoffman.
