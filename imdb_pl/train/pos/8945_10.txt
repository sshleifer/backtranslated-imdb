it is a sincere attempt to create a charming sweet love story. the obvious inspiration for the successful TV series "Bewitched", this beautiful sweet rom-com is a timeless treasure. comparisons are obvious. Jimmy Stewart plays the unfortunate but solid "straight". kim novac plays a sensual blonde witch who catches him with a love spell. but when the spell is broken by a stronger witch, she bestows on the duties of running her own store and draws consolation from the fact that her beloved pyewacket (her feline friend) is taking care of her beloved aunt. You will recognize your aunt from "Murder by Death". this film is funny and touchingly sweet, carrying a spectacular wit and a pleasant witch. worth seeing.
