I've seen practically all of Cynthia Rothrock's films, and this is the funniest thing for me. It reminds me of the early films of Jackie Chan. I must admit that Mrs. Rothrock may not be the greatest actress, but she is very good as a war artist and a very charming young lady. This movie, though probably not the best of all her films, was the most entertaining.
