After all these years, the genius, costly giving of his soul by Peter O'Tool, finally a movie after the film, Hollywood is throwing him an Oscar recently. <br /> <br /> Country Dance appeared late in the night and, of course, he dropped me in my complaint complaining in my alleged "Life". How does he do it? <br /> <br /> York is again brilliant in this kind of games. Both psychic battleships were loaded for the bear .... <br /> <br /> Bravo for the author, director, cast and crew. No wonder the Nazis have lost these Irish, Scottish, English mixtures ... brutal honesty hurts ... back in the 1970s, when I personally believed that "honesty" is pure and absolutely necessary to trust. I have modified my extreme extremes and will be content with more human, warm flaws in myself and others. <br /> <br /> Forgiveness allows humanity to have reverse gear and allows us to repair our own ego and erotic bull head mistakes ....
