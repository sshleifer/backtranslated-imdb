This material is a masterpiece in the film B / W 35 mm. The film makes you see a strange way to start the day at 7:35 at the bar and how many things can happen in 8 minutes. <br /> <br /> Briefly surprising, you get a complicated story with very few elements, and step by step makes you realize that something is wrong. It expresses a lot, makes adrenaline go hand in hand with subtle details and is amazingly understandable for everyone, not only for cinema critics experts. <br /> <br /> But I know how it sounds: European short, black and white and low budget. Do not let it frighten you. It's really worth seeing everyone, not just experts in this genre. <br /> <br /> Is there really nothing to say about, because the movie lasts only 8 minutes (exactly) and I do not want to spoil it. But I just watched it online and could not understand why no one spent a few minutes to post a comment on the subject. <br /> <br /> It's really worth to watch it. 10/10
