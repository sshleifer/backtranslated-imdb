"Fear of the black hat" is all that should be (much weaker) "CB-4". Rusty Cundieff's satirical eye is ruthless because it folds, spindles and destroys every aspect of hip hop trends and culture. Is "FoaBH" like Spinal Tap? A bit. Is it a derivative of Spinal Tap? No, not really. The goal is more focused, the satire is better focused and, to be honest, it is more fun.
