This light comedy should be entertainment. Sometimes it gets quite hysterical ridiculous, but if you have not spent any time on the "side" of the tracks, you will miss a comedy when it explodes. <br /> <br /> The cast of the characters is well connected and they are quite credible in their roles. As Grace copes with her dead girlfriend, she was well played. She is a real lady. My favorite is the white pimp outfit she wears.
