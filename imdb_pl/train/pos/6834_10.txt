Let's get to the point: this is a movie that I would take with me on a desert island (with a DVD player). It's just perfect. If the reason for watching a movie is that you love actors, you like to engage them in space and feelings, this movie is for you. See the scene when Myrtle (Rowlands) comes on stage drunk, and Maurice (Cassavetes) has to improvise because he does not follow the script. If you are sensitive to camera movements, you will be fascinated by the way the camera moves on the stage, a specific flow that gives you the impression of a camera following the actors, as if it were guided by the theatrical principle of "private space" ... amazing. just a brilliant blend of tale and realistic drama. Cassavetes again argues with Hollywood and the politicians of major companies, but this time it's done by Broadway, creating one of the most exciting films about the theater. This movie is bliss.
