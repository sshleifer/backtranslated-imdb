BEFORE THE DEVIL IS FIND THAT DEAD begins promising, establishing a simple contraction that does not work, narrated from different perspectives (in the style of RASHOMON). About an hour, Sidney Lumet transforms this movie into something that is more than the sum of its parts; Eventually, it transforms into a multi-faceted family drama, exploring the full sphere of human emotions / relationships when the story comes to frost. <br /> <br /> As with Lumet, he succeeds in persuading performances from his cast of cast stars, without the idea of ​​excessive action or hyperbole. Philip Seymour Hoffman, in one of his best roles, is a complex, mysterious and interesting character, and often outshines Ethan Hawke, who plays his brother, Hanka. That does not mean Hawke is not bad; in fact, it is quite adequate, in a difficult role that suits its style. Marisa Tomei is excellent because of her relatively short appearance (the fact that she bares her body, she adds to that). The character of Albert Finney (father of Andy and Hanka) is the most intriguing and in my opinion he deserves a bit more time. Amy Ryan also does her job properly. <br /> <br /> BEFORE THE DEAD I KNOW YOU ARE DEATH is not a unique film, but proves that Lumet is still a great career at the top of his (apparently) sunset. There are many of its characteristics and trademarks, including the use of its characters. It is necessary to see a deadly script (without the play of words), intelligent dialogue and tempo and a decent result, BEFORE THE DEVIL YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE DEAD. A really underrated gem. 8/10. 3 stars (out of 4). He should just enter my Top 250 on 248. I highly recommend it.
