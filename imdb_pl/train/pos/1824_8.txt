All Dogs Go To Heaven is a movie I have always liked. When I was a child, I watched it every other day. This is underestimated if you look at his IMDb rating and the comments of many people in general. This is not a bad movie, as many say, it's a very good movie. This is good and your children will probably like it. Although it is rated as G, some parents may find it a bit violent. In fact, this is a rather dark story in which dogs are similar to gangsters who are involved in gambling, extortion and even murder in cold blood. The film follows a dog named Charlie, who escaped from a pound, is killed by his old friend, goes to heaven, but returns to the ground. Many younger children watching this movie may feel like they are watching a great movie for children. <br /> <br /> There are several scenes that can scare young children, but I'm sure they will be fine. Every time I watch this movie, it reminds me when I was a small child. I'm sure everyone has a movie that reminds them when they were younger, it's a movie that makes me feel that way. Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise performances are great, and this is the last film in which there was a little girl named Judith Barsi. Unfortunately, she was killed at a young age, which is a shame because she had so much potential and I do not deserve what happened. Now that I know her story, I can no longer watch the movie in the same way because her voice sounds so sad. <br /> <br /> The animation in this movie is great, the voice work is great and the story is good but a bit different from many other children's films. It was popular at the time of its release, but was obscured by the mega popular Disney The Little Mermaid. This is a movie that is not meant for adults, but if you're a child or if you've grown up with this movie as a child, you'll love watching this movie.
