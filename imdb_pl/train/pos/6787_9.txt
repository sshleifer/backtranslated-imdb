I came across this late in the night at TCM. <br /> <br /> I did not see this because it came out originally, but I never forgot about it. <br /> <br /> I completely forgot how wonderfully talented Signe Hasso was when she was still young, just like Shelly Winters before the balloon. <br /> <br /> Ronald Coleman was the quintessence of the state actor of his time - I read Othello in English High School - and PRESS IT. After watching "A Double Life" I read it again and finally I understood what was going on in this play. <br /> <br /> The Gordon / Kanina writing team was at the peak when this script was completed - <br /> <br /> The movie is worth remembering and re-watching,
