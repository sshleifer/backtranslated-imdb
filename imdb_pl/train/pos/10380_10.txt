in 1976, I just moved to Ceylon from us. I was 23 years old and had been married for over three years and started to go out as a lesbian. I saw this movie on an old black and white television, with awful reception, lonely and uninterrupted, in awakening that seemed to echo history. I lived in a small home in Tucson Arizona, and it was summer ... like everyone here, I never forgot the feelings of images of this story and its remains of fragile magic and I appreciated the hope I would see it one day. I will check. I would also like someone to make a film about the "other side of Venus" with Shirley Verel. it also has the same delicacy and persistent emotion ...
