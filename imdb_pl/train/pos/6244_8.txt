Each country in which a functioning film industry operates has a reasonable (or perhaps crazy) artist who creates films that you can completely understand when you are part of this country. I think Hundstage is such a movie. <br /> <br /> You see the lowest level of society in Austria, dirty, alarmed, strange, hateful. But they still have enough money to let themselves be tuned in cars and big houses. And they definitely do a lot of weird things here that may seem "normal" to them because they do it all their lives. From a normal human point of view, you can now easily follow a film and be disgusted or fascinated and watch a piece of Austrian art films. <br /> <br /> But if you are LIVING here and you know the people you see in Hundstage as a social tumor. A society that is becoming more and more crazy by the day, creating its own rules that no one else can understand, slows down the social system from within. And you see people. Sitting in the park, standing on the opposite corner of the street, queuing in the same line. Maybe you'll meet them at the bar or disco you can visit. Maybe you even work with them at work or live next to your home. You start to hate them, not knowing exactly why. You will try to escape - but you can not. Maybe you'll end up like them. But you think it's "normal" because you do it all your life ... <br /> <br /> Life is not so clear, although Austria is one of the richest countries in the world. He has beautiful people ... but some are ugly too. There are many hard-working people who try their best ... but there is also a bit of driving behind and destroying everything that the Austrian nation has built up so far. <br /> <br /> A very pessimistic movie.
