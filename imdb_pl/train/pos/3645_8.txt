A good story about following dreams and really dealing a blow by doing something about them when there is a chance. Morris was not easy either - he had a family, work, other tasks, a mortgage, etc. - he could not just drop what he was doing and carelessly jump on a greyhound to play AAA for 4 months. It required courage. I am glad that they showed their indecision, almost to the time when he got a call to major companies. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing him fighting Red Sox (I think ...), that was a great story. Although Morris actually looks more like John Kruk or Mills Watson than Quaid - that's good. <br /> <br /> Quaid does a very good job playing a man, teacher, trainer and "the oldest rookie" .... As someone who is in the same age group, I can certainly identify with his difficult situation. You are not too old to do what you dreamed about as a child, but it happens. You must do this before lator. <br /> <br /> Probably said, nicely edited, wandered, preserved, well-known faces of the late Royce Applegate, Brian Cox and Rachel Griffiths. <br /> <br /> Good work all around, I'm glad that it hit. <br /> <br /> *** outside **** ... who would have thought that Tampa Devil Rays would be the subject of such a good movie early?
