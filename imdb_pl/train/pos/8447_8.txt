In truth, it is not really a "movie", like an extended final episode; by that I mean that if you did NOT follow the TV series (Murder: Life on the street), I suspect you would have a hard time watching this TV movie. Having said that, "Homicide: The Movie" is still a great watch. I think it says a lot about TV production, which EVERY single cast member will come back, many years of absence, to once again present their characters and lead to the closing of the amazing program. The film emphasizes the sense of "family", not only among characters, but also among actors. It is all very bitter, knowing that it will be the last time when we will see them all together under the title HOMICIDE. In terms of feature, I think that this movie is missing. The candidacy for the mayor Giardello seems especially invented and I felt that his shooting could be resolved within his regular position as Leiutenant. Also Det. The extreme turn of Bayliss, which was suspended at the end of the series, was finally resolved, but I, for example, NEVER felt that it must be; I liked being kept secret (let's remind that the first episode of the first episode was also not solved in the whole cycle!). As a supporter of the TV series, I can love this movie, and the fact that it was created even after H: LOTS, was canceled, but I do not recommend it to anyone who did not have the slightest contact with the series. Now, if they just released it on DVD ...
