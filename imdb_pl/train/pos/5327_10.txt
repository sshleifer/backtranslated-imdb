As a competent fan, I recommend this film as faithful to facts and well-functioning. As an eleven-year-old living in Istanbul, I heard some friends talking about a new music sensation that made the girls scream. I thought hmmmm, if the girls like them, they must be crap. Until now, the only recordings were Haley Mills, The Everly Brothers and Ricky Nelson. Shortly after the holiday with my family at the Ishry military cafeteria, I heard a song (which I later learned "Love Me Do") and which was influenced by the difference between her and every song I have ever heard. When I heard my older brother 'Meet The Beatles' album, I was addicted to life. After reading the final book on their origins (by Davis), I was surprised that this movie was tracking the facts very well except the omission of most sex and some drugs (this has affected the use of metadrine / dexadrine). >
