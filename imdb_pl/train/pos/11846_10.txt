I really liked this movie. The animation was well done and the romance was charming. I liked most of Bryan Adams' songs and the result of Hans Zimmer was perfect. Many people do not realize how well it refers to the motifs of Heart of Darkness / Apocalypse Now (what happens when the so-called "civilization" attacks someone home, what it means to be "civilized", etc.). Opening the scenery and music were very moving. The film is a lament for America, which was once beautiful.
