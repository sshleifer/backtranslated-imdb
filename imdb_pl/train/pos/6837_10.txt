A typical De Palma movie with many styles and scenes that will lead you to the edge of your seat. <br /> <br /> Certainly the thing that makes this movie better as an average thriller is style. It has some greatly edited scenes and a few scenes that really upset the nerves that will lead you to the edge of your seat. The best movie scene; Museum scene and the murder of the elevator. There are a few mild erotic scenes, and the pace of the movies may not be fast enough for an ordinary viewer to fully appreciate the movie. This movie may not be suitable for everyone. <br /> <br /> The story itself is also pretty good, but actually the style makes the movie work! It can only be for fans, but also ordinary viewers should appreciate the good tension in the film. <br /> <br /> There are cool heroes portrayed by a good cast. Michael Caine is an interesting choice of castings, and Angie Dickinson works as well as it looks good (not bad for a 49-year-old!). <br /> <br /> Pino Donaggio's music is also typical of De Palma and I like the film very well, just like his music for another De Palma movie "Body Double". <br /> <br /> A brilliant thriller to destroy your nerves. I love De Palma! <br /> <br /> 10/10
