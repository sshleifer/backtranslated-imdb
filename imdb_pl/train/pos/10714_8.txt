Scots stand out by telling stories. Traditional kind. Many years after this event, I still see in my mind an elderly lady, my friend's mother, telling about the battle of Culloden. It makes the characters come alive. Her passion is an eyewitness. One for events on the wet moor, about a kilometer from the place where he lives. <br /> <br /> Of course, it happened many years before it was born, but you would not guess how it says it. The same story is described in bars with the length and width of Scotland. When I talked about it with a friend one night in Mallaig, a local guest gave his version. The discussion lasted until the closure. <br /> <br /> Stories conveyed in this way become part of our being. Who can not remember the stories told by our parents when we were children? They become our invisible world. And with aging, they can still serve as an inspiration or emotional reservoir. Facts and fiction mix with aspirations and role models. Warning Stories. Archetypes. Magic and mystery. <br /> <br /> "My name is Aonghas, like my grandfather and his grandfather in front of him." Our hero introduces himself to us. And it also presents a story that goes back to generations. He creates stories in stories. Tales that evoke the impenetrable wonder of Scotland, its harsh mountains shrouded in fog. It's a legend. However, Seach'd is rooted in reality. That's what gives it a special charm. It has raw beauty and authenticity, mitigated by some of the best Gaelic songs you will ever hear. <br /> <br /> Aonghas (Angus) visits his grandfather in the hospital just before he dies. It's burning with frustration. Some of them want to be in the 21st century, spend time in Glasgow. But he is raised on the western shores of the Gaelic-speaking community. <br /> <br /> However, there is a deeper conflict in it. He wants to know the truth. The truth behind the ancient stories of my grandfather. Where does fiction end? And he wants to know the truth behind the death of his parents. <br /> <br /> He is pulled to make his last memorable journey to the top of one of Scotland's most inaccessible mountains. Can you tell the truth? Or is it all in the stories? <br /> <br /> In this story about the stories, we return to bloody battles, poisoned lovers, old folklore and sometimes more treacherous folklore of accepted truth. In so doing, everyone joins Angus because he lives the story of his life. <br /> <br /> Seachd: Unavailable Pinnacle is probably the most honest, unpretentious and truly beautiful Scottish film ever made. Like Angus, I was a bit irritated by the pretext to tell history on subsequent stories. But, like Angus, I forgave it when I saw a "bigger picture". Forget about Braveheart cash pastiche and the like. You can even give up the rightly famous dramaturgy of The Wicker Man. To see a movie that is loyal to Scotland, this one is probably unique. If you think about it deeply enough, you can even re-evaluate the power of storytelling and the age-old question of whether there are certain truths that can not be said but only experienced.
