Thanks to the Warner Archive, I can once again see this gigantic show of varieties, which throws everything apart from the kitchen sink. (Bath is, however, present.) This movie gives time to the screen to every person who was contracted with Warners at that time. If some artists seem unknown to some, it is because they were great in quiet days, and the most faded with the popularity of gadgets. There are also truly outstanding artists from the vaudeville period. You will be impressed by Winnie Lightner who makes two numbers. There is also this French star, Irene Bordoni, who in a sexy way shouts a love song. Perhaps one of the biggest attractions is the two-color Technicolor "Chinese Fantasy", which has been restored for this version. She is really beautiful and plays Myrna Loy and Nick Lucas in it. In the end, there is a huge finale of "Lady Luck", which lasts almost a quarter of an hour. This is the real epic of the early talkie era. Any lover of the old movie will love it.
