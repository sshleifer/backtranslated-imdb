Like many of you, I am a big fan of real noir films from the 1940s, but Red Rock West was a real feast for all of us who long for the past. The term "neo-noir" has been so often misused in the last ten years that it has lost its meaning and influence. On the other hand, the film by John Dahl really deserved to be called such. The cast is perfect all around, and Tay Garnett or Jacques Tourneur felt at home. The plot is so tight that you are addicted in the first fifteen minutes. James M. Cain would appreciate that. Many modern movies wonder why they do not do them the way they used to be, and I'm not even that old. Films like Red Rock West give us hope for the future by paying homage to the past.
