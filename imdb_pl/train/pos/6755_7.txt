Ah, noir. My favorite species. The continuation of Otto Preminger's "Laury" is a film noir taking place in post-war New York, where corruption and violence are spreading. It features Dan Andrews as sergeant Mark Dixon, a detective whose brutal tactics landed in hot water with his superiors. <br /> <br /> When he accidentally kills a murder suspect, Dixon tries to blame the crime boss Tommy Scalese. Dixon is close to achieving his goal when he engages in the wife of the deceased, beautiful Morgan Taylor. Of course, in a typical noir style, things are quickly falling. <br /> <br /> While the movie does not do anything interesting in the camera or narratively wise, it has a continuous tone of fear and darkness. Like most great noirs, it is also greatly moved, drawing the viewer from the very beginning. <br /> <br /> Still, like most Preminger movie films, it's not something I watch again. He lacks Wilder's wit joke, Hitchcock's visual extravagance or Welles' spatial experiments. Like Lang's later work, "Sidewalk" is very similar to the "clone" of what noir should be, instead of something really artistic. <br /> <br /> Thematically, the movie is nothing special. It's about a policeman who is slowly becoming a criminal. In one scene, Dixon explains that his father himself was a small cheater, the film flirted with the concept of predestination, but this one scene is as far as Otto goes, or dares to take his ideas. <br /> <br /> The work of the camera is also disappointing. Otto does not have intelligence. No effort is made to assign the camera to anything. He does not play with space or architecture, nor does he emphasize the police procedures step by step. These are just sets for a tripod with occasional sliding in and out. It does not matter, although most people do not care about these things. <br /> <br /> There is one good shot, in which our hero is trapped in a car full of gangsters (cage noir), who himself enters the car lift (another cage) and is taken to the main gangster lays. Like Lynch's "Blue Velvet", Otto retopologizes the film, constantly comparing "upstairs" to hell. It works well, but the design of the set does not strengthen it. <br /> <br /> 7/10 - Otto seems to follow the Hawaiian form of what noir is, instead of playing with the possibilities that noir can go on. Just like "A tour", "Night in the city", "Scarlet street", "In a lonely place", "Violence", "Bomberang" and "Johnny Eager", "Where the pavement ends" is one of those well done the other film noir. He is competent and engaging, but he lacks this unique magic.
