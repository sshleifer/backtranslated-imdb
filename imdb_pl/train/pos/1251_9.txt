This documentary tells the story told in Pilger's latest book, Freedom Next Time, which was published in 2006. It shows the shocking expulsion of the natives of Diego Garcia, one of the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean. /> The islanders are technically British citizens because Diego Garcia is a British colony, like Mauritius, once a nearby island where the natives were banished. But the British government ignored their requests to return to their homeland, because the island is now a military base for the United States Army, which used it as a basis for the bombing of Iraq and Afghanistan. <br /> <br /> As usual, Pilger's account is shocking, especially as it documents the treatment and current impoverished living conditions of the surviving islanders. His interviews are excellent, and his representative of the Parliament, in which he uses the government's information to nail him, is one of his best. <br /> <br /> Pilger also uses a dramatic reconstruction to conduct a series of recently released documentaries that fully illuminate the British conspiracy to evict the natives. The weaving of this material with the interviews and music of the islanders really strengthens the influence of the film. <br /> <br /> It is not easy to watch, but "Stealing a Nation" is John Pilger at its best. Recommended.
