Old Mill Pond is more a tribute to African-American artists from the 1930s than any denigration of the whole race (despite the caricature of Stepin Fetchit). In addition to the one I just mentioned, there are frogs or fish versions of Cab Calloway, Fats Waller, Joesphine Baker, Bill "Bojangles" Robinson and Louis Armstrong. This Happy Harmonies cartoon by Hugh Harmon and Rudolf Ising is very funny musically with excellent characteristics all around. They all sound like a real thing that half of me thinks possible. If not, they are certainly very flattering. Even the lazy, mindless character of Fetchit becomes an exciting workout here when he is chased by a tiger when "Hold That Tiger" plays the result. I highly recommend it to fans of "30th animations and jazz music.
