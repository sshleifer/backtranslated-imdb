Ghost Train is a great and fun movie, typical of the better British comedy aggregates from the 1930s and 1940s. The antics of Arthur Askey's comics are not as fun as they once looked, but this can be overcome by perceiving it as a piece of the era or curiosity. <br /> <br /> For low-budget war production, Ghost Train is atmospheric, effective and provides some real voltage. Great fun for a dark (and yes, stormy) night. Lighten up, take off your critic's hat and enjoy.
