In the Hollywood west, these trails were a hard group that, when it arrived in the city, partyed quite hard. After all, riding on the trail was a lonely business the day before the railways reached all parts of the US. <br /> <br /> Drovers who worked for boss Gil Favor, played by Eric Fleming, did not differ. But Fleming was a man in the industry, he had a job to do and he hired a leading team to do it. <br /> <br /> After a long run of Rawhide and the fact that the regulars stayed with him most of the time, we met all participants at some point. Around them were focused on a few feature points, though most of them were Fleming and Clint Eastwood Rowdy Yates, guy number 2 with the herd. <br /> <br /> The West picture of Clint Eastwood was formed by Rawhide, it is a pity that they are not shown more often. Probably because they were made in black and white. If it was an NBC program, it would be made in a color like Bonanza and it worked as often as these programs. We would see a lot more of a man who became a legend of movement. <br /> <br /> Ironically, Eric Fleming left the show before shutting himself down to make movies. He made them a few and he hoped that the program would give him the banking name of the film. Unfortunately, he died in the place of the movie in which he shot the action movie, he drowned in the river. If he lived, he could be a name like Eastwood's. <br /> <br /> Clint took over the role of the head of the trail last season, and then the show ended his run. And of course he became an icon he is today, not only in the western genre. <br /> <br /> Rawhide was a tough western who had a few hard guys in it. No frills in this one, they were cowboys simply working and fighting with the elements and regardless of the situations in which they were thrown every year. <br /> <br /> They really do not do such TV series anymore. What a pity.
