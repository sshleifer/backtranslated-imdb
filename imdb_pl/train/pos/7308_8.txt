With a simple story and a captivating heroine, it was a horror story that started it all. John Carpenter wakes up a dreadful nightmare on Halloween night, when Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis in her debut, career-defining role) and her playful friends plan a night of insidious play - only to go with a relentless psychopath from hell. <br /> <br /> Michael Myers escaped from nearby crazy aslyum ... after murdering his sister fifteen years earlier, now he is back in Haddonfield, the sleepy city of Illinois, where his murder took place. After staring at Laurie after he drops the package into the abandoned home in which he lived, he begins to persecute and terrorize her, turning her night of fun into horror as she chooses everyone who stands in her way. br /> <br /> Beautiful photos and lighting make this moody horror horribly ... with long, grim shots that constantly give the impression of being persecuted by a maniacal serial killer. Myers is well hidden until it is fully disclosed in an exciting summary. <br /> <br /> Although "Halloween" is certainly outdated, it is not less cool at all. The idea itself is goose bumps, and this little shock is one of the most famous and memorable horrors ever created ... spawned seven sequels and finally horrifying processing of Rob Zombie, and set a new horror standard that still exists today.
