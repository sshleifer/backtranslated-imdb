This is a powerful documentary about domestic violence in Cameroon. The "sisters" in law are lawyers and judges, who in 2004 successfully pursued husbands for mistreatment of their spouses and won one woman in a divorce she desperately wanted through the Muslim council. It is quite long - about two hours - but fascinating both for individual reasons and defendants, as well as for lawyers who successfully represented them in courtrooms under the leadership of women judges. He will leave you, as he left me, with many questions about exactly how this change happened. How and when did women come to occupy positions in Cameroon? Have several of the cases presented in this video had a significant impact on the treatment of women in general by their spouses? Was the admission of a divorce by a Muslim court, contrary to the husband's express wishes, a one-off event? I am not suggesting that the creators of the film could answer these questions. They made a movie two years ago, not yesterday. And the film they made deserves a wide audience.
