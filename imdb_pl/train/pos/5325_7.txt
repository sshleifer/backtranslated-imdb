The idea of ​​making a movie about the Beatles sounds humble, because no production can capture the historical idea of ​​the Beatles. Then it is best not to try to recreate the past, but to create an illustration that best suits other Beatles' available materials. This is exactly what "Birth of the Beatles" offers us, a simple story known to us without any extravagance. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS here *** <br /> <br /> Be warned that not everything is as accurate as some Beatles graduates can expect. The Beatles are seen performing songs that until now were hardly ever composed. The Beatles perform "Ask Me Why", "P.S. I Love You "and even" Do not Bother Me ". Beatles' graduates should see that if the Beatles in the film only made songs that they actually performed in Hamburg, the younger viewers might no longer recognize the Beatles they had learned to know. Only "Johnny B. Goode" and "Love Me Tender" by Stu Sutcliffe are preserved from this original Hamburg repertoire. <br /> <br /> The guys who play the Beatles in this production do not look like the originals, but the rest of the movie still looks good because the movie is completely accurate. The guy who plays Lennon does it well and the rest of the band is not bad either. Brian Epstein is great, and the moment when he cuts Pete Best out of the group is probably the most memorable scene in the whole movie. Also as a bonus you will see the original Cavern club in the film.
