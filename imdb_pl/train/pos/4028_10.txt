I come to Pinjar from a completely different background than most of the other reviewers who wrote here. I am relatively new in Bollywood films and I was born and raised in the USA. So I do not have a broad basis for comparing Pinjar with other Indian films. Fortunately, no comparison is needed. <br /> <br /> Pinjar is nothing but a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> In one line I can say that Pinjar is one of the most important films coming from any studio anywhere and anytime. On a mass scale, * could * be the Indian equivalent of the "Crouching Tiger, the Hidden Dragon" if it had been properly promoted in the United States. It could have been a movie that put Bollywood on an American map. American film audiences have long had an affair with "Gone with the Wind" and although Pinjar does not borrow from this story, there are some similarities. Not least of all is a solid (according to US standards) 183-minute working time. <br /> <br /> Against the background of the division between India and Pakistan in 1947-48 is a fascinating human drama of a young woman trapped by circumstances and put in trouble had nothing to do. Placed in an unsustainable position, she somehow manages not only to survive, but also to develop and even flourish. <br /> <br /> If this story is missing in any way, it is in exposure. The development of Puro (the protagonist) as a person would be better illustrated - at least for a Western audience unfamiliar with Indian culture - if the "story story" of its characters were fully developed in the early part of the film. But that would stretch the 3-hour video for 3 1/2 hours, maybe even more. Because not a single minute of film is wasted, and nothing that made it impossible to edit it could not be cut out because of the time. It is better for the audience to fulfill what was before, than to omit what remains. <br /> <br /> I could use many words to describe Pinjar: "moving", "disturbing", "convincing" "heartbeat" immediately comes to mind. But "uplifting" is perhaps as apropos as any of them. Any story that indicates the steadfastness of the human spirit in the face of the worst opportunities must be considered as such. And Puro's triumph - although it probably is not immediately visible to the people around him - is no less inspiring. For the strength of the story, I can not recommend this movie enough. <br /> <br /> Equally inspiring is the portrait of Puro Urmila Matondkar. Too often overlooked among younger brothers, newer actresses, Urmila has the unique ability to deliver a completely credible character in any role she plays. She not only plays the role of Puro, but also breathes life into a character. Choosing Manoj Bajpai as Rashid's inspiration. He manages much too little Indian movie heroes: subtlety. His knowledge of expression and nuances is key to the role. It contributes to a greater threat in the early part of the film with its penetrating gaze than in the case of all armed rioters. <br /> <br /> If you only see one Bollywood movie in your life, make it to Pinjar.
