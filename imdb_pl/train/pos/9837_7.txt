Zombi 3 has an interesting history in creation. First of all, this is a continuation of the hit of the Fulci Zombi 2, and the Zombi 2 itself is of course a marketing gimmick, which is to make people think that it is the continuation of Dawn of the Dead by George A. Romero aka Zombi. Confusing enough? Basically, none of the films have anything to do with each other, but who cares when they make money. My guess is that Fulci himself does not care about producing halfway through Zombie 3 when he decided to leave. Bruno Mattei was taken aboard to help film the movie with additional scenes to extend the duration of the action. <br /> <br /> The story of Zombi 3 is your typical zombie dish. Scientists are developing serum on an island in the Philippines, terrorists steal it, freeing plague, and zombies run amok. Scientists want to create an antidote, while the army is focused on mowing everyone without prejudice. There are also short excerpts from DJ Radio's talk about how we treat the planet. <br /> <br /> Overall, I liked this movie. I've heard horrible things, but I find the foolish dialogue quite pleasant. The film seems to be an attempt to raise awareness about pollution, corrupt army, God-playing man, etc. I have the impression that it was at one point a serious movie, but turned in a strange direction, probably when Mattei came on board. <br /> <br /> In addition to tearing off other zombie movies, it was very similar to The Crazies Romero. You hear Radio DJ breaking the good news: "When you see men in white suits and gas masks, run to them for help." This is obviously played for images of men in white zombies. Later, they steal the scene from Crazies, in which one of the ordinary, unpolluted people is killed by mistake. <br /> <br /> The gore factor is pretty good including zombie hordes on every corner. How cool is that? Let me count the ways? Birth of Zombie 2. Flying Zombie Head 3. Zombie Birds. 4. Zombies without legs floating in the pool. My favorite zombie was a maniac with a machete at a gas station. He was a bad ass and almost destroyed the whole building, trying to kill the girl. <br /> <br /> Favorite quote? When the sergeant insists on cremating zombies, the scientists ask: "Do not you think that when the ashes are in the air, it will fall to the ground and contaminate everything?" To which Sargeant boldly replies: "Now you are talking about science fiction." He also continues to mention Science Fiction, even at the end when everyone is dying. <br /> <br /> Extras: Gallery, Trailers and Interviews, especially the one with Mattei, in which he insists he should lead 40% of the scenes, but I do not remember which or other important details. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Must see the zombies and fans of Fulci. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7/10 <br /> <br /> Molly Celaschi www.HorrorYearbook.com MySpace.com/HorrorYearbook
