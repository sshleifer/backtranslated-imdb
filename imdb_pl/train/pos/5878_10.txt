Garam Masala is one of the funniest movies I've seen in ages. Akshay Kumar is perfect as a womanizer who has an affair with 3 girls and is engaged at the same time. John Abraham is sometimes funny and this is one of his best works so far. Paresh Rawail is as good as ever in most of her films. Director Priyadarshan has released great films in the past. Hera Pheri, Hungama and Hulchul are among the best. Garam Masala is his funniest movie he did. The three new actresses are mediocre. Rimi's dream does not have much scope in this movie. I was impressed with how Priyadarshan made a movie with a simple plot of a guy having an affair with 3 girls at the same time. All 3 girls have a day off on the same day and go to the same house. Full of lots of laughter, this is one Nonst Entertainer.
