There are moments in the movie that are so horrible, your teeth hurt. But knowing that there was only a few weeks left before the Code made the films harmless and bland, Paramount put it into production before the innuendo and leering were out of fashion. Vanity is so terrifyingly anti-feminine that it is delicious. As Kitty Carlisle sings, women are shown with tags that could offend the Bronx whore. They emerge from the clams (poke, poke, wink, blink) in the positions of absolute surrender. Right guards, so stupid that they can not find the door, look into their skirts and giggle. Naked girlish choirs sit uncomfortably in gigantic cacti (can they be a source of hallucinogens?) While we listen to "Sweet Marijuana" and observe how blood falls on the choir chest. <br /> <br /> Sure, Carl Brisson has learned phonetically his lines and seems to have no idea what he is saying. But everything is worth it, because Norma steals the show when nobody is watching. <br /> <br /> Taking one moment of this gentle down is seriously lacking the point of the whole exercise. Watch this with the charterer member NOW and be prepared to justify the whole Hollywood machismo tiku between body blows. <br /> <br /> Toby Wing, this is the icing on the cake. And Duke Ellington does not hurt either. <br /> <br /> He must go down the Lane of remembrance.
