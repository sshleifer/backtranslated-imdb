I must say that Seventeen & Missing is much better than I expected. The observation I took from the announcement was that it would simply be humdrum, but I was pleasantly surprised by this impressive mystery. <br /> <br /> Dedee Pfeiffer is Emilie, a mother who insists that her daughter, Lori (Tegan Moss), do not go to the so-called diploma event once a week, but Lori ignores her mother's wishes and so starts to go to the party . When Lori does not return home, Emilie knows something is wrong and begins to have visions of her daughter and the events that led to her disappearance. <br /> <br /> Seventeen & Missing is better than many other TV movies of this type, because it is not so predictable. Pfeiffer is the reason to watch this movie, and most of them come out as credible. The premiere of this original LMN movie took place last night. 10/10
