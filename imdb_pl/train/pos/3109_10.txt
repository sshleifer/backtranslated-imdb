The third and last film from this trilogy is finally crystal clear. It's a political movie more than ordinary entertainment. Jason Bourne will finally find out who he was, and he will discover and remember the torture he has been subjected to to kill his former identity: he really killed someone who became his delay. But the film ultimately reveals that all of this has been organized and planned by the CIA as part of the Blackfriars program, which is also explicitly disclosed in this film as being aimed at eliminating all American citizens who have tried to prevent the entire society from being controlled by a fixed and limited group people. Who was one of the most important CIA officers until 1980, When was he vice president? This is in line with what is said on the Internet. Then the truth will come thanks to Jason Bourne, but the main person who will be able to convey this truth to the public, and the only body that can make a decision on the CIA is a woman, and this woman takes part in the general investigation of the Senate. Woman and Senate; read my lips. In the US, politics is combated in the media, and two media are necessary for every presidential campaign: it is music and cinema. At the moment, Hollywood and beyond the intelligentsia, academia and intellectuals use cinema in general, and this film in particular, to develop an idea in society, that salvation will come from women and the Senate. So go and watch the movie. It is quite funny and has a sweet fragrance from the end of the period and a great change that some expect, and others are waiting for it, but no one can pretend that it will not come: the only point is knowing how deep and serious it will be. <br /> <br /> Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris Dauphine University, Paris University 1 Sorbonne Pantheon and Versailles University Saint Quentin en Yvelines
