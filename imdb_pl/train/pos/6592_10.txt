I have not seen this movie, but I have to. After reading all three books by Thor Heyerdahl (Kon Tiki, Ra and Aku Aku), I am actively looking for a copy of this film. <br /> <br /> The assumption that Peruvians have moved to Polynesia is alive and good. Considering that this crew did NOT have a GPS, only an old-fashioned (tubular) radio with a 6-watt output, their journey was at least heroic. <br /> <br /> If you want, please reply to this message tell me where the copy of this movie is. <br /> <br /> I would like to buy it.
