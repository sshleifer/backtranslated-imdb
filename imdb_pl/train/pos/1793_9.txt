I saw this movie on a Sunday afternoon. I loved this movie. I loved everything from the tiring moments of mothers and daughters to the scenes in which Mama Gummer (Lila) cries because of her poor decision to marry a man for her parents, not because she is really in love. I loved those moments because they were so real. At the beginning I was seriously scared because I hoped it would not end like Bobby, which was a great cast, but a poorly written movie without real meat. But in the middle of the movie I felt completely different. You will laugh and you will cry, but eventually you will want to see the evening again. Trust me when I say GO SEE IT!
