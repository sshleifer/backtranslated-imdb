I gave it 10 out of 10 points. I love it so much. I am a child of the 80s and for many years I have been dealing in heavy metal. These are the reasons why I like this movie so much. It's nice to see these posters in the boy's bedroom (Judas Priest, Lizzy Borden, Raven, Twisted sister ...) and his vinyl collection (unveiling of the wicked Exciter, Rise of the mutants by the metal master Impaler and Killing is my company Megadeth). Also the FASTWAY soundtrack is completely unbelievable and fits the story perfectly. If you're in metal, TRICK OR TREAT is your friend. Do not buy or watch this movie for OZZY or GENE SIMMONS, because they are in the movie for a few seconds, watch them, because the soundtrack and story that will take you back to the glory of the 80's. After that you will not be the same person.
