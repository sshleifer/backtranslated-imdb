I have not read the book by Kurt Vonnegut, from which it was adapted, but I know some of his other works and I wanted to see how it will be translated into the screen. In general, I think it is a very successful adaptation of one of the novels of Vonnegut. It concerns the story of an American living in Germany who was employed as a spy in the USA. His job is to immerse himself in high Nazi rankings and send secret messages to Americans via a weekly radio program. But when the war ends, he is condemned as a war criminal, but he escapes to New York, where various strange twists of action await him. <br /> <br /> If Mother Night has a problem, she has a tendency to be too sentimental times. But for most of the movie schmaltz is limited to a minimum, and a very strange plot is realized with skills and self-control. There are also wonderful moments of black comedy with the participation of three right-wing Christian fundamentalists and a very high-ranking Nazi in a prison cell. Very recommended.
