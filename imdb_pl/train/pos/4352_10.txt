I was browsing the list of films in my area on yahoo and watching a movie that was not advertised. I looked closer and noticed that there were Peter Falk and Paul Reiser in it. After watching "Madness around you" I was not a fan of Paul Reiser. However, I am a huge fan of Peter Falk. So my husband and I took a chance. We both fell into this story. Beautiful landscapes, sincere acting and a sense of family and moral values ​​that are rarely seen in films and in the world. Not what we laugh, but real situations in the lives of real people. I must even say that Paul Reiser was perfect, although I still will not see "Madness around you". I do not know where this movie went. I heard that it was released in a limited edition. He should be shared with the world. This is one of the best movies I've seen. M.
