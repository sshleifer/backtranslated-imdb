This movie captured my heart from the very beginning when I heard the first notes of Quincy Jones or saw the wonderful color of purple flowers in the meadows. This is really a movie that cries and dies for ...! The whole cast gives me the best performance in the movie I've seen for years, and Spielberg really overtook himself! Whoppi Goldberg, Margaret Avery, Oprah Winfrey (for Lord!), Danny Glover and others, give us all the best and you can feel it - almost touch! Goldberg IS A Celie, she gives her a sense of uncertainty and a sense of inferiority that the hero needs, and we grow up with her, we become stronger with her, and we triumph with her. Margaret Avery is wonderful as Shug Avery, even if she is the most arrogant, and shows us that "sinners" indeed "also have souls." Always lovable, charming Danny Glover does a wonderful job to make people hate him, and great music (let's say, ladies) Quincy Jones adds even more beauty to this amazing movie! Photography, music, director and music make this beautiful, spiritual film an experience of life. You do not want to miss it! "Sista" ... remember my name ... "
