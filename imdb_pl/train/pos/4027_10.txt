Very good adaptation of the novel amrita pritam. Urmila and manoj bajpai gave their best. <br /> <br /> the film is a natural talent and I felt it all the time. It seemed that bollywood had finally betrayed its brightness and some great artists appeared on the screen. <br /> <br /> Content wise, the movie showed very precisely what was going on during the partition, showing the suffering of a particular family and showing that trust in life goes beyond religion. <br /> <br /> The best part was that they did not make him a drama with lots of tears and melodrama. <br /> <br /> I just loved it.
