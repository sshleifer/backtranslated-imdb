this movie is ok, if you like mindless action, great acting and a very small story! Special effects are decent, considering that the film comes from the director of "Event Horizon". Costumes are like something from crazy movie max. None of the soldiers say so others tell them what to do. Eventually, it ends with a huge movie with explosions everywhere. Personally, I liked Russell better in "tango and cash", "escape from la / new york" and "performance decision". It must see this movie, leave your mind in the door of a science-fiction movie that has no ideas!
