What can I say about this film that has not been spoken about? Well, to tell the truth, many of them look very false, like some spanking and kicks. if Charlie shines, although it was real, I do not know. I'm sure they would hit her and kick a lot harder if it were. however, scenes with a pinch and hot oil look very real. and the last needle on the stage of the eye is amazingly made and is probably the only thing in the movie that has ever shocked me.
