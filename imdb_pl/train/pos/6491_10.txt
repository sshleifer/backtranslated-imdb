World At War is probably the biggest documentary of all time. Historical research is practically impeccable. Even after a quarter of a century, this is the most accurate and final documentary about WW2. An invaluable historical work, including interviews with the most important and fascinating characters from the war. I highly recommend it as an educational experience.
