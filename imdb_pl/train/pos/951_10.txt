I know that many people have a special liking for the Dickens version of Alistair Sim, but for me this version from 1984 is what you have to overcome. My wife and I have a copy of this movie on VHS and we watch it together on Christmas Eve. I often notice that we could also watch him at Halloween, because it is a very scary story about ghosts. <br /> <br /> Scott - typecast as Scrooge - is terribly mischievous and nasty, making his transformation all the more wonderful in motion. I think he's there with his performance at Patton. All ghosts are effective, each more terrifying than the last. Watching the dark, floating, skeletal form of the Christmas Spirit has not come to shiver every year. And what a helpful cast! In particular, David Warner is in top form as Bob Cratchit, like Susannah York as his wife. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that I remember that this version is closer to the original story than most others - but I can be wrong because several years have passed since I read it. Regardless, it's a great Christmas classic.
