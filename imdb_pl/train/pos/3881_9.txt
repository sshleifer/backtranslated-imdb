This movie grabbed me with an amazing opening sequence that prompted me to completely reverse the perspective, so I started getting involved when the title appeared. The theme of this movie is that everyone is playing, trying to invent themselves, but not in such a difficult way as Identity or Suspects, but in the way in which we all try to create any banal lifestyle, we find ourselves a little more interesting. The scenes in chicken magazines are spectacular. At some point, Jorgen (who owns a chicken farm) participates in the seminar laughing, where he is the worst student. His discomfort in this allows him to see the depth of his desire to change. The film forced me to reflect on the hidden secrets that lie behind the surface of the most ordinary people I see every day. There is not much conspiracy here. Guessing the secret of an old man is quite easy, but the fascination is to try to guess what all other characters will do when they understand it. I liked the movie the same way that Sideways did, although the characters could not have been more different.
