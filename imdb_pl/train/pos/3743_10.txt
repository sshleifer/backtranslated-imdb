A tight scenario, good direction, excellent performances, strong cast, effective use of places .... <br /> <br /> Paul McGann gives a detailed, subtle performance as a man at the center of a new investigation into a murder who can only have committed similar murder earlier. <br /> <br /> With his character (Ben Turner) there is an interesting moral and emotional journey that intersects with the journey of Amanda Burton. They inevitably cross each other ... Who did what? <br /> <br /> A study WHY, both in the past and in the present, not the WHO, could have given Dostoevsky a more interesting story, but hey, who is complaining? <br /> <br />
