After watching the movie "Batman Dead End" I did not know what to expect from World Finest. Of course, Superman and Batman. All my best comics in the world have them in the band. <br /> <br /> After watching this three-and-a-half-minute trailer, I wanted someone to do a serialized movie for fans of World Finest, if it's not a real full-length movie. <br /> <br /> Sure, some of Superman's things were bad, but movie trailers in cinemas are always teasers, giving you only some aspects of the whole product. It looks like he needs a complete product. <br /> <br /> Unlike the relative of director Sandy Coller playing painfully poor Perry White, most of the actors were unknown. If a real movie was made, the actors would be cast to suit the film project, although I believe that Nina Kaczorowski will do a good Lois Lane, especially if she has a closer dialogue with the character. > It's good to see Clark Bartram in the Batman costume from Dead End, but it should be updated a bit more and should not be like Batman from the 40s with a leather cloak and a hood from the 80s-90s. His attitude is similar to Batman, but I still think about the correctness of white contact lenses, instead of just letting my eyes appear through the mask. I believe that the goal was to bring it to the comic more than the film's protagonist. <br /> <br /> Michael O'Hearn can not play Superman, period. He is standing with a silly expression on his face that simply says "hit me". And the delivery of the line seems to be a problem for him. <br /> <br /> Generally, however, I would like to see a complete story and film based on this brilliant work. There were rumors about the creation of the best movie in the world, and thanks to the amendments to the script, this could be just that. I hope it will happen.
