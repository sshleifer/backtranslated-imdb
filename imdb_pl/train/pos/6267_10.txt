I thought that the original of this movie was quaint and charming, and that I sat on the edge of my seat, trying to figure it out. <br /> <br /> Since I saw the original, when I saw the Sci Fi Channel - I do not know if this remake was specifically made for Sci Fi - I knew what it was in the first few minutes. Because I like Richard Burgi as a character actor, I wanted to see how he would do it. <br /> <br /> Writers / producers etc. They modernized the film, trying to explain the difficult situation of "aliens" "(They could not reproduce their own kind anymore and needed help) using the same pseudo-science that was crowded in our ears in the 90's. Maybe it added some Polishness to the film or not. <br /> <br /> This movie. Movie? This production takes on a more sinister edge than the original - the original ended with a confrontation between a young woman and an alien and there was an understanding of the genus, although the problem of the alien was not solved. <br /> <br /> I remember that in this remake the woman became rather hostile towards Burgi / Alien - I think she could end up better. But the ending is just the end, and the yarn is the swelling yarn, which is the basic material from the 1958 Science Fiction pulp. Many great sci-fi stories were written in the 1950s, and some of them even made a movie. <br /> <br /> It is an extraordinary thing to watch as a rainy day or something like that. I rate it very well from all the remakes of the Sci Fi of the old 50's, this one did well. I really liked it a bit. <br /> <br /> But if someone really wants to see this story told by WELL, I suggest the original version from 1958. With Tom Tyron and Gloria Talbott, directed by Gene Fowler Jr.
