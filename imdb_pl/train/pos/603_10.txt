Albeniza's music permeates this movie. Once in a while it is played with original instruments (eg Piano, but never a full orchestra), but it is often reworked with various contemporary bands (eg Gitara) and treatments (eg jazz piano). Only from time to time music focuses only on music: most of the time the music is focused on different dances, often flamenco, but not always. I'm guessing there are 12 14 scenes that are not connected by a story. Not all scenes will reach a height for an individual viewer. In my case, half reached the top, although all the rest were very good in their own way. Those who worked for me led me to the aesthetic delight of goose bumps; in fact, the last scene left me crying for joy. And in a very magical way, it takes you deeply into Spanish culture. If you do not like subtitles, do not worry. The film is practically wordless, although each scene has the title of the song Albeniz. Watching this very beautiful movie sharpens my complaint that virtually none of Saury's films are available on DVD in the US. I am thinking here especially of his version of "Carmen" flamenco, a spectacular work of art available in Europe, but not here (European DVDs will not be played on American DVD players). It's a scandal.
