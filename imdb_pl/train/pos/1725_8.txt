Playing as a pre-runner for The Great Escape about 13 years later, this shattering British movie plays it straight, without any emotions and dares to overdo it well. The first part of the film is the setting and the subsequent escape of our heroes, while the second part focuses on their survival, while they try to reach Sweden. The film is based on pure figures with a simple, effective and, yes, reliable dialogue that can implement it, and achieves its goals generously. A small uncertainty makes the film spin, and as an adventure story it works perfectly within the time frame it belongs to, so the thumbs to the film, which may be the first of its kind. <br /> <br /> 7/10
