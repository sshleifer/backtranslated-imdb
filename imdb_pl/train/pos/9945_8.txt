First, the most important! This is not an action movie, although there is a lot of action in it! I think you can compare it to American sports movies! Where a team of very bad players succeeds in unthinkable winning a game or tournament beyond expectations! In this case, it's not about football or baseball, but Taekwondo! At the beginning, these street thugs seem to be good at nothing! But soon we will see that they do not want to be bandits and actually achieve something in life! It's nice to see them fighting and training! I was surprised how funny this movie was! From the beginning to the end you will laugh at your pants! Young Korean actors are very convincing! Go and see this wonderful, good movie!
