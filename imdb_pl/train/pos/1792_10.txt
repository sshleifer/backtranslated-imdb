I had the pleasure of watching this beautiful movie last night, with a wonderful addition of a question and answer session with the director after watching. I suspect that the first commentator never died in the death of a parent or someone very close. I had many such losses and this movie spoke to me. One of the main themes is how we do not deal with questions / problems / stories with our loved ones, until it is too late - they are too overpowered or worried before it happens. Talk with your loved ones, listen and record their stories, tell people that you love them, solve differences. I loved the message that there were no errors. I love the performance of the director of the relationship of two daughters - as one of six siblings, it is clear to me that he understood how complex these relationships are. His story as a cinematographer also comes loud and clear - what a beautiful movie! Casting is unique - a movie that can not be missed!
