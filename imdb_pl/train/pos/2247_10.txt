I am disappointed with the lack of posts on this surprising and effective small movie. Jordi Mollà, probably best known for his role as Diego in the movie Ted Demme "Blow", he writes, directs and plays the stars. <br /> <br /> I will not reveal any plot lines, as in the movie (at least for me) it was very exciting when I did not know anything about it. If you have a netflix account or you have access to a video store that would wear it. .. I highly recommend it. It's crazy, funny, and sometimes very provocative to create a work. <br /> <br /> The direction of Mollà is * quite * impressive and shows many promising ones. <br /> <br /> Unpredictable, with amazing photos and a great performance run in beautiful Spanish "No somos nadie" (God is on Air) is an amazing movie that you can show your friends. <br /> <br /> SEE.
