After watching the trailer, I was surprised that this movie never went to theaters, so I ordered BluRay. I had a great time watching this and I have to say that this movie is better than some big animated films. Of course, it has its drawbacks, but I can still recommend it. The animation is well made, very funny and unique, and the story kept me to the end. Some backgrounds are just great and you can see that there is French talent behind them. It seemed to me that Forest Whitaker's performance is a bit dead, but in this way the character of Lian-Chu is portrayed in the film. So, in general, I liked it a lot, and I hope it will work so well that all the studios involved will continue to create such great films. I recommend giving a chance and being surprised how great a movie with such a small budget can be. Hektor himself is worth watching the movie because some of his moments are fun as Stitch.
