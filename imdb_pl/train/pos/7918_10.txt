I loved this movie. In fact, I loved being an actress in this movie. In the second half of the movie I was introduced as a pregnant teenager. You can remember me more clearly on the stage in the classroom when the werewolf was on the screen. I was a woman in the first place with her hands fixed on the face in response to what we were watching on the film projector. In fact, they have doubled me several times, so it's hard to miss this mistake. Thumbs up to Full Moon High. I wish that the cable would come soon.
