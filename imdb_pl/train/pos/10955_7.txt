Initially, I won the Sarah show with a nice 8 thick, but I struggled a bit with her humor, and 7 years is what has been determined. Let me explain. <br /> <br /> You will like Sarah's humor or not. If you do not do it, I doubt anyone can convince you. You know who you are and it's okay, but you know it too. Going forward, the first season gave us fantastic passages about Sara, her friends and family and her aspirations for life. In one memorable episode, she is "stopped" by officer Jay, whom he meets for the first time. - "Do you know why I am standing here?" He asks. "Because you have all C in high school?" He answers questioningly. It seemed a real question. - It's funny things in my book. Sarah can come to you from strange angles. In another episode her romance with God was particularly funny. God is meticulous and jealous of a wonderful joke. He is clever, he is twisted, but she would show us the truth in a humor and we would laugh. <br /> <br /> Then came the second season. Although we still do not lack any new and ingenious comedy, it seems that we just slipped into trivial poop and farts. I laugh a little here and there, but most of them seem to be a filler while she and the writers are struggling to fuel some original material. Sophomoric and tiring are the feelings that I have felt recently in episodes, but I've been looking for him about the gems I find (the turtle) and I'm waiting for him to turn them over. I was a fan of her routine "Jesus is magic" and I would like to think that I understand what she is capable of. Let's get back to this.
