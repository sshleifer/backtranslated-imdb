Sudden Impact is the fourth of Dirty Harry's films, and one of the best features of these movies is that they do not reduce the quality from one movie to another. In this way, Sudden Impact provides another exciting ride through the life of Dirty Harry Callahan. This time Harry is trying to solve a series of murders during the holidays. It seems that Harry is always working. Clint Eastwood plays Harry, playing all his action people, slowly, deliberately and without fear. As the first of Harry's filthy films made in the 1980s, Sudden Impact does not have a touch of 70's style, the first three films. It does not mean that its quality is lower. Bottom Line: full of intensity and action, Sudden Impact is another worthy addition to the Dirty Harry series.
