Wow! I've seen so many bad low budget movies lately, but this one is great. A very realistic representation of police life in a city on the east coast of Germany is a strong opposite of other crime movies or series. I loved the main actress and the absolute rejection of all popular police platitudes. This movie is realistic as documentation and as entertaining as drama. A perfect compromise!
