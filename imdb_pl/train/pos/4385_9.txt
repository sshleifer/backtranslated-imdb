What can be said about a film that has one of the darkest, most nihilistic and sometimes the most bizarre - I will not say "nice" .. I will say "charismatic" villains in the history of Cinema and the best sword fight Flynn and Fairbanks were in splendor? It is an epic of a stubborn, sometimes stupid, incredibly courageous and honest man fighting for his honor and freedom against tyranny. I love it. John Hurt and Tim Roth were great villains. Jessica Lange was very moving, tender and sensual.
