This horrifying and bloody adaptation of the great novel by Stephen King includes the outstanding central performances of Dale Midkiff, Fred Gwynne (who unfortunately died several years ago) and Denise Crosby and some truly macabre effects gore.Director Mary Lambert has a great sense of visual style, and manages to make this one of the few versions of King's work, which is not only worth seeing, but really annoying. Presenting a baby zombie Gage (Miko Hughes-later in "New Nightmare") is as remarkable as what can easily be a funny character is threatening and terrible. As with people who think that this is not terrifying - look alone in the dark (eventually with your squeamish girlfriend) and I guarantee you that the "Pet Sematary" will crawl Some of the horrors such as "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" should not be watched in a group. Recommended for horror fans!
