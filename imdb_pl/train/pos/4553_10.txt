As far as I know that the real guy the main actor plays, he saw his performance and said it was a great portrait, I'll agree with him. This is a fantastic movie about a very talented boy / man who is helped by a special part of the body. Oscar and BAFTA winner and Golden Globe nominee Daniel Day-Lewis plays Christy Brown the crippled man with cerebral palsy, who spends most of his life on the floor, in a wheelchair and carried by the family. However, he has a special left foot, he can write with her, paint her and keep things with her. He learns to speak later in the movie, it is very good for a guy like him. She also starred in the Oscar-winning Home Alone 2 and Brenda Fricker was nominated for the Golden Globe as Mrs. Brown and BAFTA, winning Ray McAnally as Mr. Brown. He was nominated for Best Director Oscar for Jim Sheridan, Best Screenplay, script based on material from a different medium and best image, he was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Film, Best Makeup Artist and Best Adapted Screenplay. Daniel Day-Lewis was number 85 in "The 100 Greatest Movie Stars", he was number 20 in "The 50 Greatest British Actors", he was ninth in the British Finest Actors, and he was number 15 in The World Greatest Actor, and the film was number 28 in the 50 largest British films. Outstanding!
