It was the eighth and final film Columbia Whistler and the only one without Richard Dix, who withdrew from the movies and was to die the following year. It is still a competent thriller, the machine continued perfectly without it, but ?? something was missing: Dix! Stories from the Whistler series have always been interesting, sometimes brilliant, scenarios often noir, always moody, but not only Whistler himself suspended everything on the screen, Dix also did it. <br /> <br /> A young couple going out for the whole two weeks want to get married in a heavy rain, but is thwarted when the potential bride disappears first, and then it turns out that she is already married before she seems to go crazy. Is the potential groom discouraged, even if the private prick he has hired to find her suddenly rattles him and lams or is he blind? Who twists who is the question. Michael Duane in his penultimate movie is fine, if he is a bit of a wimp, the beautiful most beautiful moments Lenore Aubert came next movie in Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein, and Richard Lane was great as always loaned from Boston Blackie. Also the only trip in which Whistler himself had to get wet because of the depression in the rain, unless he was sprayed with sea foam in the Voice. <br /> <br /> A lot has happened in this last hour, worth watching and Again, fans of this genre like me. Launched in 1942, the Whistler radio series lasted until 1955, reaching almost 700 half-hour shows, almost all of which are available on mp3 and are based on what I have heard so far, almost all of which are also worth listening to.
