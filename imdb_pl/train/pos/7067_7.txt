Although not known today, Deanna Durbin was one of the most popular stars of the 1930s, a beautiful teenager with a lively personality and admirable opera singing. This 1937 was her first big movie and it turned out to be a real bonanza for besieged Universal Studios. <br /> <br /> THREE SMART GIRLS refers to three daughters of a divorced couple who hurry to their long-invisible father - a faithful mother reveals that he may soon remarry - with the strong intention of undermining his girlfriend with a gold digger and turning him to his mother. Although the story is small, the script is witty, and the cast of the expert plays it in a neat way. Durbin has a pleasant voice and appealing personality, and such good actors as Charles Winninger, Alice Brady, Lucile Watson and Mischa Auer complete the cast. Ultra-light entertainment for fans of the film from the 1930s. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
