Many people commented that this movie was not as good as the first one. Well, maybe this is not for you. But how does your child react to it? Well, mine loved it more than the first. <br /> <br /> Disney movies from the past can sometimes be a bit difficult for young children. (For example - Bambi's mother is shot.) This movie was really great for my sensitive little girl who likes humor and happy endings. <br /> <br /> If you want to be snobbish, what should be the Disney standard based on the past - skip this movie. <br /> <br /> If you have a sweet little girl or a little boy with a mild heart, you really want to enjoy, buy this movie and treat your little ones. This movie is great as a bedtime film for happy dreams, not nightmares. I'm happy with the movie that pleases my child and does not have to impress my parents all the time.
