A fun movie. I saw this movie at the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras film festival in 2002 and I laughed from beginning to end. Acting was subtle, but very funny. I'm not entirely sure of the influence of "The Real World", I do not understand it here, but the movie sticks without understanding this program. Heather B steals every scene he appears in, especially when he plays with his rarely talkative red star. Highly recommended. I would like it to appear on Video / DVD in the future.
