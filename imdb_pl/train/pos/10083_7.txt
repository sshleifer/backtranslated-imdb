The fact that this movie was released on DVD still formatted for television and with a blurry picture really annoyed many film purists ...... and rightly so. It deserves a lot better treatment. <br /> <br /> The story is about a street performer who needs a son to hand over his craft (rules of the day) and instead ends with a little girl (not a conventional one) ... and problems that follow. The old man bought a kid at a slave auction and soon discovers that the kid is not a boy, which he apparently thought was an accident. <br /> <br /> The old man "Bianlian Wang (Xu Zhu) is like a funny looking with a missing front tooth and a contagious smile. The little girl" Doggie "(Zhou Renying) is a cutie. The rest of the story is about how they both manage after this. a little raised in the last 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> In general, it is associated with a plot full of drama, tension, humor and sadness. Do not expect good image quality for money spent on DVD. Until it appears on the widescreen screen, borrow it.
