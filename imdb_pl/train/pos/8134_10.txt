. . . it's just as good as the original. It almost reaches its size thanks to Cundieff's unusual ear for music and dialogue. Shish kebab of self-interested hip-hop posers. The group "Niggaz with Hats" (NWH) is every rap group that you've heard and completely parody. The wardrobe is unbelievable. Buy the OOP soundtrack, if you can.
