This is probably one of the worst films ever. This is horrible. But it's so good! It's probably best if you do not watch it, expecting a thrilling plot and something fantastically clever and funny, because you'll be disappointed. However, if you want to see it, to see 50 million vases and fantastic hair Goro / bad English, you will have a real treat. The harder you think about the movie, the worse, unless you have the competition to see the most holes / bolts, in which case you have hours of entertainment ahead of you. I really recommend this movie to bored or die-hard Smap fans. And even then the latter should be a bit cautious, because Goro's Japanese fans were a bit nervous, they thought he was selling. (It was not really when Johnny Kitagawa (who was an executive producer) could do it for him).
