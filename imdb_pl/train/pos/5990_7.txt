I do not have much to add to what has been said before, but it's a movie about his time and the first (and probably only) time when the studio completely suspended the movie on Dead End Kids. <Br> <br /> Warner's gave the boys a lot of help, from director Ray Enright and the budget "A" to the almost magical cast of supporting actors. At every step we get one of these jewels from real professionals. There are too many of them to mention, but it seems that everyone on Warner's fate (Sans are the biggest stars) goes through this photo. (See if you can see John Ridgely) <br /> <br /> The only advantage of the highest performance is always a reliable Eduardo Cianelli as the mafia boss with a messianic complex. He plays this character almost exactly like the leader of Thuggie in "Gunga Din". He has something to watch! And Marjorie Main is excellent and has been winning her best role since "Dead End". <br /> <br /> My offer for this is a second function on a double account with something like "City for Conquest". <br /> <br /> Applause for the Warners!
