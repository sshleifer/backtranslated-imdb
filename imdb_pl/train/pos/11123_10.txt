Greetings from this Portuguese guy :) <br /> <br /> I believe that Sopranos are one of the best productions in history, they have reality and fiction mixed in such a way that it is difficult to see the difference. It has the same quality as GodFather! James Gandolfini fits the paper as a glove! I would really like the Sopranians to never finish. This is perfect! It should be a topic in school :) I saw Sopranos when I was a kid, but I was too young to be awakened to the end of the episode, so now I bought all episodes in DVD format and I watch all episodes in the house before and after dinner and I'm addicted, yes how I did it with Prison Break. In my opinion, Prison Break and The Sopranos is the best television series ever. The argument of both is great and the actors are excellent. Congratulations for this job. <br /> <br /> I apologize for my English. Thank you for reading.
