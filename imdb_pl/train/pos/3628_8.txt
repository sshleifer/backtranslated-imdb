The film had many basic values, such as family and love. It expressed human emotions and was an inspiring story. The script was clear (it was very easy to understand, which makes it perfect for children) and sometimes it was enjoyable and fun. There were several charged symbols to search for. The photos were acceptable. There was no point in experimenting with what many filmmakers were doing today (which is frankly quiet to warn a little). It was clearly filmed but had a pleasant soft quality. Although the editing could have been better, I thought it was a nice movie for the family. And the organization of information was simply thrown at you, which I did not like too much, but all in all it was a good movie.
