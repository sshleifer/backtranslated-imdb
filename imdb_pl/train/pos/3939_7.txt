According to John Ford's biographical text from a fictional movie about the life of Abraham Lincoln, his biggest drawbacks may be dullness with a woman and the ability to dance in the "worst way". Ford's camera praises only the views that reveal Mr. Lincoln's early life. But in what the film lacks the complexity of character, it makes up for the beauty and depth of vision. The incredibly beautiful compositions of the early film, which could have been a series of amazing still frames, Ford has a unique eye for telling stories. The film is about the life of a hopeful young man. Henry Fonda plays a contemplative and spontaneously clever Lincoln in the tee, one of his best roles. <br /> <br /> The film concerns two young men, brothers, tried for murder, which they claim they committed. In the classic style of a furious crowd, the city decides to take justice into its own hands and lynch their pair until the honest Abe enters the fight. He charms them by telling them not to rob him of his first big case, and that they are as good as lynched with him as a lawyer for boys. What follows is an outline of all court and murderous dramas, because Abe cleverly interviews witnesses of the joy and humor of the judge, jury and city before he comes across the missing links. <br /> <br /> the movie is like a lot of John Ford movies: an Americana spoon, a bit of moderate predictability, a note of sarcasm that you're not sure about if you put a recipe, or Ford did it himself. Despite the overt "Hollywood" character of the film and the excessive patriotic teasing about the future Lincoln presidency, the film is completely pleasant and well-structured if you can take your drama with a little salt.
