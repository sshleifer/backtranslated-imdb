I watched the film recovering after a major surgery. Although I knew it was just a "B" movie, a cosmic western, I loved it. Perhaps he lacked a flash of high dollar production, but it did not so much hold my imagination and give me great escapism. Unfortunately, our society has so much at its disposal that discounting small attempts is too easy. In the same way that I can enjoy even Shakespeare's performance in elementary school, I can appreciate many levels of achievement for art. I am a cop and I found a relationship with a retired LAPD. Dreams such as his persecution of me, that I will not be able to respond to the rescue of another life (or my own) at the time of crisis. while it was a romantic ending in which Farnsworth pulled out a bad guy (predictably), I needed some happy affair in which good can win. My world is really too cynical.
