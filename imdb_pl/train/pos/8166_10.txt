This movie is very great! Acting is fine, with an excellent cast of Corbin Bernsen as a perfectionist dentist who cheats and tortures his patients. At first he sees his wife with a poolman and then goes crazy. He also takes revenge on his wife and the pool next to the patients he tortures. The most special effects are also beautiful, although some are really fake (like a drilled tongue that was lying outside for one night and is still red in the morning). But the torture scenes are absolutely well done. Although this movie has a weak point, it is very slow; between heavy parts sometimes are simply unusually boring parts. But for a real horror / thriller fan it's a must-watch!
