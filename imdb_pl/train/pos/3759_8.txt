Two years later ... Bill (Alex Winter) and Ted (Keanu Reeves) are approaching rock stars in the present future, but still need more work in their instruments. In the future, Bill and Ted are in popular public history, but then a bad man (Joss Ackland) is going to kill Bill and Ted by sending a cyborg look-he likes to destroy him. Cyborgs are sent to the past and actually murder the real Bill and Ted. Now both are ghosts and must travel through Heaven and Hell to save themselves and their future. <br /> <br /> Director: Peter Hewitt (Tom and Huck, The Borrowers) created a clever continuation with great visual effects. Much more fun and funny than the original. William Sadler (The Shawshank Redemption) steals the program as The Grim Reaper. <br /> <br /> The DVD has a good anamorphic panoramic transfer (1.85: 1) and excellent Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound. The DVD has a movie trailer and a fun storyline. This sequel was a box office hit similar to the original, but it's also (believe it or not) one of the best sequels ever made (depending on your point of view). George Carlin briefly returns to his role from the original. Pam Grier also appears in the role. It's a nice fantasy comedy. (**** / *****).
