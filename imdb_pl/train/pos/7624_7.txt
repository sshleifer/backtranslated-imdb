An unforgettable movie about the diversity of animal killers, especially similar to "Willard" in the fact that he plays the role of an aging character actor (in this case it is a step down to the level of Les Tremayne, who places the only stand out performance that I saw as he gave ) in the role of a man whose life is imbalanced and who then decides to use his animal friends to take revenge on those who hurt him. Yes, this is one of those movies in which everyone is wicked, so you will be cheering when they die, and really the choice of actors, places, etc. It can not be better in giving the film an atmosphere of miserable decadence. <br /> <br /> Tremayne's character is "Snakey Bender", and he is certainly the most interesting thing in the movie: an aged snake collector who is obsessed with the music of John Philip Souza. When a local preacher stops his practice of collecting small animals from local disciples as snakes, and his friend marries a stripper (thus annoying his ritual Wednesday night band concert), he rages in the process of creating a memorable corkscrew stack under the cliff in which he dumps the wreckage after getting rid of their unfortunate owners. One fun game that you can play while watching "Snakes" is betting on which cars will land the farthest down the cliff. <br /> <br /> All in all, very cheap and consumable, but really will be a lot of fun for fans of this kind of movies.
