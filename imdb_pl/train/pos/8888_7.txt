This movie started slowly, then gained momentum towards the center. However, the fact that the film went on for two nights broke the moment at the top. The second part really became interesting, but then gave way to a pathetic ending. Do you play football in the yard? Really, can it become more juicy and strange? Now I hear plans for a similar film based on the '70s. I will not make any great efforts to tune in to it if it is such a thing as "The 60's".
