Sentinel has something like a mill and stereotypical suspense / mystery, but it is raised thanks to good acting and suspense. These stories have already gone through as many permutations as we can, so all we have left is how good the action is, how clever the settings and bad things are, how well the main thread is made, etc. ... so Sentinel does a solid job of taking its contents. Michael Douglass and Kiefer Sutherland retain good bravado and attitude. Eva Longoria (the first time I saw her on the screen) brings satisfying support. The whole story is completely unbelievable, but it deserves to be relaxed. It's worth to watch if you like this genre.
