I've been looking for the name of this movie for years. I was 14 years old when I believed he was aired on television in 1983. The only thing I remember was about a teenage girl, a lonely one, who survived the plane crash and survived the Amazon. I remember people were looking for her (family) and knew how to take care of themselves - tells a story, and I clearly remember that she knew there were worms under her skin. I do not remember anything more about this movie and I want to see it again - if it's the same movie - and if any of you have a copy, can you send me an email to horsecoach4hire@hotmail.com? I'd be curious to get a copy to see if it really is the same movie I remember. It was broadcast on Thanksgiving (USA) in 1983 and I went through my own problems, and this movie really influenced me. Thank you in advance!
