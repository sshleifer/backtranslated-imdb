"The College Girl Murders" is my first knowledge of writing by Edgar Wallace? and generally my first real relationship with the films "Krimi" in general? and I can say that I'm impressed. These things are really fun, although I would never expect it? goofy! The film has a thrilling and beautiful storyline, with a healthy dose of humor, extravagant twists and quite clever kills. Is there some kind of bad mastermind by James Bond? who always sits in the shade and in front of a large monitor - recruits prisoners to kill some girls in a specific college with a new kind of poison. There is also a malicious monk with a whip, dressed like a communist member of the KKK, getting rid of the remains of the figures, such as too curious teachers and such, as well as a strange police commissioner who stubbornly solves the matter with a psychological approach. Seriously, if I knew earlier that these Krimi movies are so colorful and crazy, I would already buy their entire collection. The plot with the pretzel raises more questions than it finally answers, and the overload of fun tricks on the Scotland Yard Inspector Higgins account is sometimes a bit to swallow, but I do not care because it was sublime entertainment. Even the funky 60 soundtrack remained in my head for a long time. It's like a variant on the Italian Giallo, but with elements of the slapstick.
