I look at this page and it seems to me that I do not have to listen to someone who wanders around the city and has a look at a real classic. Sure, I agree that everyone has their own opinions, but here's mine: <br /> <br /> This film should not be missed by any classic horror observer and it should be seen by many ordinary viewers around the world. Of course, he lost some of his talent and magnificence with age, especially in today's world of CGI effects, but that's not the reason you'll like it. <br /> <br /> You should like it because it is a really scary movie, even for today's standards. His general shakiness will crawl the same as the original audience, so do not slam the classic if you did not give him a chance. Watch out, but not with a critical attitude. Watch how to have fun, as it was originally planned.
