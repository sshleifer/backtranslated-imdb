Zenit two great careers. David Lynch, better known for less available material, creates a delicate and exquisite story around the most unlikely premise. The man travels to see his distant brother. Not having any other means of transport, his journey takes him over six weeks on the mower. Richard Farnsworth, in his latest film, provides a stunningly layered and nuanced game in the lead role. Deadly beauty in the elation of small things, Straight Story is a classic cinema experience that can not be missed. Sissy Spacek is known as Farnsworth's daughter, a weak middle-aged woman living with the loss of her children.
