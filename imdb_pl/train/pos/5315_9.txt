This movie was very, very strange and very, very funny. All the actors are very real and very strange. The overall "look" of the film was also different, as if drowsy and faded, which only added to the cosmic, clumsy, strange atmosphere of the whole thing. <br /> <br /> This is not for everyone. I mean, it's not what you would call "mainstream", but I liked it. It does not resemble anything I've ever seen. . . unpredictable, with a strange rhythm and blows in the strangest places. Children are so stupidly stupid (and primitive) that you can not help them. In other words, they are far from the "hollywoodized" versions of teenagers. <br /> <br /> Everything for me is good.
