In the years I spent at film festivals, I saw a lot of small movies that never have a movie distribution, and go to the 3-dollar baskets at WalMart. I just found a DVD from Yank Tanks there, a great doctor, but how sad it is that I ended up being the stupidest remnant. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie, I would like to see it in the cinema in all this. I would prefer New Yorker Films to translate the title directly. It's good that the Americans are stretching a bit. If the title of the film helps the American public to discover random chaos, the better. Cinema imitates life and visa versa. <br /> <br /> Also, I think it distracts that the subtitles contain prices in dollars. Come on! The euro is not difficult to understand, it makes the audience gringo math. Seeing the film, especially the one shot in Paris, the viewer should not have a broken effect, reminding himself: I'm an American watching a movie and explaining to me the euro for dollars. <br /> <br /> We can not wait to see more of these actors as well as the writer and director.
