Chloe is mysteriously saved from Dr. Caselli, a corrupt physician responsible for transferring patients from Belle Reve to Project 33.1, and a fraction of a second later Clark arrives. He discovers that Bart Allan has returned to Smallville and meets at Kent Farm. When Bart is captured by Lex while breaking into the LuthorCorp facility, Clark discovers that Green Arrow has also hired Bart (aka Impulse), Arthur Curry (Aquaman) and Victor Stone (Cyborg) to investigate the 33.1 project. Clark accepts joining the trio to save Bart and invites Chloe to participate in their mission. <br /> <br /> "Justice" is the best episode in this sixth season. In this episode the Justice League begins its saga with an association of five heroes: Clark, Green Arrow, The Flash ("Impulse"), Aquaman and Cyborg. Chloe's participation is spectacular, completing the necessary organization for teamwork. Eventually, Oliver breaks with Lois based on the importance of fighting criminals and secret Lex labs around the world. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'Justi√ßa' ('Justice')
