It seems to me that most people do not seem to be a good idea about the movie, at least that's my opinion. I'm not sure if it's a movie about drug addiction; it is rather a film about the way of thinking of these brilliant brothers, drugs are side effects, something marginal. Again, this is not a commercial movie that you see every day, and if the author wanted it, he definitely failed, because most people think it's one of many drug-related movies. I think, however, that there is something else. As in many films depicting different cultures, the audience usually fully understands films showing their own culture, i.e. Something that they grew up with and are well acquainted with. This film is supposed to show what these "genius" people often think and what problems they face. The reason they behave this way is that they are bored with the mind :) They have to meet people who do average things and accept these things as if they were launching space ferries everyday. They start quite hard work and achieve excellent results in a short time. They feel like ... I went to work, I did not do anything, I still did twice as much as the guys around me when they were on their projects, what should I do now with my free time. And what is even more boring? When you can start to predict behavior not because you are a psychologist, but because you have seen this pattern in the past. So for them, on the one hand, it is a job that does not require a challenge, which sometimes is quite boring, and on the other, they start to discover people's behavior. This is a recipe for great boredom. And the stupidest things are usually done to get out of this state. The guy earlier mentioned that their biggest problem is that they try to understand life in terms of logic (mathematics describes logic), whereas life is not really a logical thing, in fact it is absolutely right.
