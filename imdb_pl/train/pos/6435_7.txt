I think most people who have posted comments about this movie do not understand how to watch a movie and / or have a slight sense of elegance. First of all, in order to evaluate a movie, you need to understand to what extent everything in the movie works together. Contemporary sensitivity requires a great drama. No, I do not mean the great setting of characters and plots, but they seem to require emotional trajectories that are very tragic or very comedic. It's a subtle movie. His beauty lies in his subtlety (not to be confused with simplicity). Neither history nor characters are simple in this film. It is a beautifully filmed movie that makes full use of the combination of sensuality, politics, human weakness, frivolity ... you name it. The world in which he is located today would be a stranger and incomprehensible ... a world in which, if you have one, you must love him NOW and loudly, even if you think you have him. <br /> <br /> Many people today do not understand that Victorian society was not really Victorian, as people understand this term today. <br /> <br /> This movie helps you set a record.
