This is one of the best music concerts anyone will ever see and hear. I grew up when All My Lovin 'was new and hear it again today by the original artist, it is a measure of Sir P Mc's strength to charm every crowd of all ages. This document goes backstage to show us life on the way not only for the band, but for everyone. I saw how this guy lives in Aussie 1975 and can ensure that his performance here on this DVD is no less than it gave almost 30 years ago. I have a huge 5.1 surround sound system that does it fairly and I recommend it to everyone, especially the Beatles fan. This is the next concert of the Beatles. Singer, songwriter, host / rhythm / bass guitar, piano, ukulele, just pure genius. Few are artists who can stand alone with one instrument and hold the crowd in their hands. If you want to pay attention to the perfect music, buy a CD recorded in the studio. If you want to hear raw music in an intentional and spontaneous way for the crowd, with all the enthusiasm and emotions of the crowd - this DVD is for you.
