After reading the original game, I thought it would be much harder to adapt to the screen than it turned out. Donal McCann plays the great performance of Public Gar, a suppressed antagonist who explicitly manifests on the screen of his extrovert (but invisible to others) alterego- Private Gar. Eamonn Kelly also plays a great "screwdriver", whose inability to communicate his feelings only fits Gar. <br /> <br /> It's definitely worth to rent it if you find it. (Probably not available outside of Ireland and Great Britain)
