I think it's a great movie. because you can see what Diana's life looks like at home. she got so much aggression and wants to prove that the girls can fight too. I think that she and Adrian were great actors. Because of this I Am Boxing movie too. It really made a big impression on me. I think the only negative part. Is it the end. because it's fine between Diana and Adrian. But you can not see how it is at home. And I really did not like the fact that you do not see her father and her brother doing it. but I think it was a great movie and I think I will watch it a lot more :) I recommend it to anyone, even if you do not like boxes, you can see much more than just boxing. I had a great time watching it.
