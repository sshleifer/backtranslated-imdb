The film, inspired by at least Ivy Benson & Her All Girls Orchestra, which appeared throughout the war years at the Covent Garden Opera House, talks about the attempts of an older saxophonist to reform (almost) the entire girl with whom she played as a student at the end of World War II. Too short retrospections of the original band on the stage bring us great music and help to fill the background with the band members, in particular the relationship of girls with a single man - their drummer transvestite (who tries to avoid the call). <br /> <br /> Ian Holm ("The Lord of the Rings", "Cromwell and Fairfax") and Judi Dench turn to outstanding leading performances, recently widowed El≈ºbieta, and agile, female Patrick, a drummer. The late Joan Sims is a great band leader, now he plays the bar piano on the seashore, and June Whitfield shines like a trombone player from the Salvation Army. Cameo performances by other celebrities such as Cleo Laine, Leslie Caron, Olympia Dukakis and Billie Whitelaw make this an unforgettable experience. The film is a strand of memory, with an all-star cast of what according to all rights is supposed to be a bunch of actresses from the hill. I can only say that I hope I look as good in their age! Especially Leslie Caron is an amazing fox at the age of 69. She certainly still gives me a pulse! When I watched this, I mentally persecuted the director of casting for not using women of the right age. Then I looked at these girls and discovered that each of them is old enough to perform in London in 1944 (although for Judi Dench it may be a bit strained). <br /> <br /> If you like swing teams, develop in nostalgia, or just want to see how a good woman can cope with the appearance of three-quarters of a century behind her, do not miss this movie. <br /> <br />
