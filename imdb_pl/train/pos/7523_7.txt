I saw this movie at the Palm Springs International Film Festival in 2006 and it's a movie, not a movie, because it was apparently filmed by HBO to show it in their cable networks this year. This movie presents the site as a slave and disciplinary fetish pinup and B & D movie actress who had enough talent to become a real actress. Page was a bit more, and the movie touched some of its other roles in modeling, but not enough to balance the career of the pinup icon from the 50s. This movie is supposedly based on Richard Foster's book The Real Bettie Page. It's shot in black and white because of that nostalgia of the fifties. I have a book called "Bettie Page The Life of a Pinup Legend" which contains many great pictures depicting the Page's career and I must say that this movie plays in the movie, and Gretchen Mol as Page, many of these famous photos are very accurate. Mol alone with the Bettie Page black wig and brown contact lenses is Bettie Page. Not only does it look Bettie's page, but it has a smile and characteristics that went through the camera perfectly. And her body is as close as possible to the replica of the pages. A great casting. The story is quite thin and tabloidesque and could certainly be much better. But it's a pretty good TV movie. I would rate it at 7.0 on a scale of 10 and recommend watching it on TV.
