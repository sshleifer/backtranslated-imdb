This film is really difficult. To be simple with you, this movie does not contain a lot of riveting history, does it make you want to know how it ends ... but let me tell you something now ... I've never been so uptight and jumped in my life! This film will surely bring spikes and emotions! To be honest, I watched it almost at midnight, so I was a bit sleepy anyway, so maybe it explains why I was nervous ... or maybe because this movie provides in this aspect! It's mainly about a couple who will lose their child in a tragic event. They decide to move out and rent a house in the mountains ... everything looks calm and peaceful, until they have their first guests (I think it is the main character's sister, and she takes her husband with her) ... at night the husband hears noises ... check this, and when things start really bad ... do not stay the next day and tell the park that they should go out as soon as possible, because something is wrong ... to shorten a long story ... in the end they find out what happened in this house over the last few years and decide that you need to take care of it. <br /> <br /> This is not a Hollywood hit, it has a huge budget, but please do not let this put you off. It is frightening, tight and very bouncy! Just give it a chance :)
