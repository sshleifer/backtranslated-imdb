Maléfique is a very interesting film. It is a godless stop of triumphs and failures. The main concept is great, three of the prisoners with strange personalities join the fourth (with whom the audience identifies) and try to escape from their cells using the book of magic they find in the cell walls. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere is well intertwined, reminds me of reading about the prison stay of Edmond Dantes in the Château d'If (before he became the Count of Monte Cristo). The director feels that the characters are attached to the cell, especially the character with which we have to identify (Carrère - a mental criminal whose crime is not specified, but it is suggested that it may be a scam). On one occasion Carrère dithers when he leaves the cell for exercise and has a locked cell door; we never leave the cell, claustrophobia is uninterrupted. Outside the cell, there are no shots from prison, and the view through the bars is a wistful sunset over the general wall of the prison. Although the film seems to be very modern, it has a very old world of imprisonment. <br /> <br /> The heroes are alluring. We have Marcus, a brutal transsexual before surgery who plays offensive mother for Pâquerette (in French for Daisy), a long-delayed youth. Pâquerette likes to eat everything that is beautiful, and unfortunately it includes his younger sister, hence his current problems (I like this comment on internalization, very primitive). Lasalle is a withdrawn, possessed elderly man, for the brutal killing of his wife. <br /> <br /> The main message of the film is that your desires will destroy you and that it is accompanied by a ritual. I think that's what disturbs me the most, seeing people destroying themselves ritually. It has a real life ring in it. Quite a simple soundtrack confirms it well, each step into the moving sand is accompanied by a dull bell of the gong. I actually hear gong every time I do something self-destructive. <br /> <br /> I think one of the fictional problems is that the heroes' endings do not reinforce the message consistently, especially from Carrère, also the concept of the book seems to change throughout the film, not in terms of another revelation. I also think that some of the images we see are somewhat amateurish, more in appearance than from performance, such as the famous "vagina eye" and Lasalle's sodomy, for me completely empty paintings. <br /> <br /> Finally, the film seems to be such that the director is in a hurry with it, and some things do not seem logical, for example, we awkwardly led to the belief of various things about the child of Carrère. However, it does not change the fact that we have here this rare bird, "pure" horror. There is no comedy slag or genre, like Cube (1997 / Natali), an obvious film to compare with it, it's a total immersion in which you feel as if you were in a cell with heroes. The last comment about the fact that it is a "clean" experience, I think it is something that others have mentioned, so it is quite a unanimous point. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think that my favorite part of the movie is the situation in which Lasalle talks about his past as a librarian. He vividly describes the scene in which one day he goes to work and sits in his usual place in the center of the room, in which all books are arranged around him in a circle. Books seem to chant him that he will never contain their knowledge. That drives Lasalle crazy. It's really an obsession with understanding and knowledge. This is something that I felt myself. <br /> <br /> The last remark is that two of the quite well received comments on the board mixed up the names of the characters. To find out that Lasalle is a senior librarian, just click on the Philippe Laudenbach website and you will see that he was born in 1936.
