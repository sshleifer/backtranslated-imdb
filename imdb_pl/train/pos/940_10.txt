WELL. I am biased. I live near Shrewsbury, England, where this great movie was filmed. It still looks the same. I remember they were filming quite lively here, and false snow on the streets for many days. Often, when I pass through Shrewsbury, I see a street or house and it will remind me of the movie. <br /> <br /> George C. Scott's Scrooge is a more realistic character than many other versions of the screen. His physical appearance is not a typical miser. Scott is big and impressive. A man who thinks those smaller ones are worse. <br /> <br /> We all know the story and quotes. The book is one of the most appreciated works in English. And I do not believe there are many cynics who would say that people are not able to change and redeem. This movie version presents it all beautifully. George C. Scott may be an American, but he plays the role of English miser with great skill. <br /> <br /> I love this movie. If you have not seen this version, I strongly urge you to do it. It is usually available for a small sum of money ... or are you mean?
