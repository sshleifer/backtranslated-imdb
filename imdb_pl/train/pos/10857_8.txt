Johny. This is one of his best style exercises here, creating a strong movie with a good Yakuza story. Choosing a new Yakuza head is the beginning of a war within the organization. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, violence is wise in context, creating a very powerful gang movie. I especially like the way he tells the story, moving around in all roles in the Yakuza family and making us see violence as the only way they have to solve their problems ... <br /> <br /> Talk about aspects technical film is a good example of the halted, rhythmical and planned way of filming. One of the Hong Kong Films of the year. It's like hellish things, but with no easy action scenes and a confused story. Definitely recommended to all lovers of Asian films. <br /> <br /> (sorry for my English, better to do in Spanish lol)
