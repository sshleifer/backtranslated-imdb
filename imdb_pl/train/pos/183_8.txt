A great comedy with Marian Davies (with a nice William Haines). Young Peggy arrives in Hollywood looking for fame. Cameo performances present "all the stars in MGM sky" on the famous receiption scene, as well as a lot of old films doing details for the scholar. Pic also captured the famous, wickedly sarcastic figures of Davies from the top stars of the day (her Swanson to beaut!). <br /> <br /> "Peggy", even when he meets the famous Marian Davies in tennis, turns up his nose and comments: "Oh, I do not like her!" <br /> <br /> My printout was perfect . History, direction, operation of authentic charm and necessity for all dumb afficinados.
