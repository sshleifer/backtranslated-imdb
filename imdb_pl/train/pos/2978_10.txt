BASEketball is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. This is an off-the-wall movie with the creators of South Park Matt Stone and Trey Parker. They play two friends of loafers who create sport in the driveway, which becomes a national sensation. Most gags are really fun, but the funniest part of the movie is the "psyche-out" attempt of other members of the opposing team. There is no rule about what is not allowed, so naturally they do the craziest things. One of the disadvantages of this movie is that the pace is much too fast and after watching for about half an hour I asked myself "Wow this is it?" Another funny part of the movie was that Joe and Doug are still harassing Squeak, who is mesmerizing little boy. BASEketball is a comedy classic with a few very accessible lines and it's very nice to watch it!
