Chuck Jones's "Hare Conditioned" is a fast, often funny cartoon. Pitting Bugs Bunny against the strange, yellow-skinned apartment store manager who wants to push him out, "Hare Conditioned" fully uses its multifunctional setting. The pursuit takes Bugs and his pursuer through various departments, which leads to an inspired gag, in which they quickly emerge from various departments in the clothes associated with this part of the store. This great gag, however, is cheated by a truly inspired sequence involving elevators, in which Bugs, disguised as a lad from the elevator, urges the store manager to relentlessly enter or leave the elevator at the wrong time. This is a great climatic track, which, unfortunately, gives way to a not too funny final gag. At the time, however, "Hare Conditioned" has become one of the best chase films that spew wild energy. As Bugs became more and more sophisticated in some of the other cartoons of that period, "Hare Conditioned" showed that he could still be as attractive as a more anarchist figure.
