[Without Spoilers] <br /> <br /> Being a movie by David Lynch, one would think that he presents his mysterious mind like most of his feature films. But this is a very simple story, as the title suggests. You can not be caught in the usual Lynchian emptiness of incomprehensibility, which usually occurs after seeing, for example, the Lost Highway. It's a simple movie, but it's a really great movie. It is both an innovative and entertaining aspect. It's innovative because it's not Lynch. But maybe this is Lynch. He likes to distort our minds and therefore creates a movie that may seem very mainstream and far from Lynch himself. Being a very avant-garde director, he can just make a movie just to annoy the ordinary audience, because he knows what they expect, but he does not give it to them. That would be tricky. <br /> <br /> The pace of the movie is slow. I would almost say that the mower's speed ... Do not expect an action orgy, but the movie is really funny for those who are going with the flow of the film. Look carefully at the small details that Lynch has staged throughout the film for our entertainment. Look for a great cinematography that will revive this movie. And listen to the score of Badalamenti and the main theme that really animates the often-shown landscapes in Iowa and Wisconsin. <br /> <br /> Farnsworth scores one of his best performances in this movie, making him one of the most lovable ol-men ever shown in the film. He does not have to say anything to express his feelings and thoughts. His cheerfulness just shines through him, and his acting brought him an Oscar nomination. Do I have to say that his poor health in this film has not been preserved? He was diagnosed with cancer and shot right after the film was finished. This knowledge puts more emphasis on the film because it becomes a tribute to Farnsworth. <br /> <br /> All of the above create a very nice movie, which is suitable for all people who like the movie in the way it should be done. You can ask for homilies that are not so obvious and a bit naive, but they do not ruin the overall picture, because it is an unforgettable movie. 9/10.
