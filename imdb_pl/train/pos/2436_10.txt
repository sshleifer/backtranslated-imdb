Generally I like something light and funny, so this movie should not have liked it. But it caught me from the very beginning. The history of the family's choices and challenges seems obvious, but the question still arises: "And if it was my family? My choice?". I cried and laughed when they did it because I really felt what people felt. He was in places difficult to view but harder to reverse. The story is real and life is sometimes difficult to watch! It shows what filmmakers can do without sex, violence or special effects: a good story is a good story in itself. The best and most unpredictable stories are true. Just like in real life, you really do not know what will happen next, or why people do what they do!
