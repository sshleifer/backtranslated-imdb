Search for the funniest parody of pretentious films in an artistic home ever made. <br /> <br /> This movie exposes all stereotypes and then a few! Extremely evil (actors Downs-Syndrome!). A very heavy dialogue. Scenes that are supposed to shock but fall. Jarring edition. Nonsensical story points. All wrapped in something like the smirk of disrespecting the audience and obscure psychedelics. <br /> <br /> It achieves exactly what it was designed for. A hilarious satire of these boring movies created by spoiled teenage trust funders to show their parents when they ask them what they have been doing for the past two years! After "What is this?" He received the Cannes award, the presenter Werner Herzog reportedly been informed that the film was in fact a parody, in part of his own films! Apparently he dropped the information. To this day, he refuses to discuss this incident. <br /> <br /> In any case, look and laugh, it will be a classic of humor for many years.
