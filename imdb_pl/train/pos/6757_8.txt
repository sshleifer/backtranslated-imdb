Dana Andrews is "Where the Sidewalk Ends" in a movie from 1950, in which there are also Gene Tierney, Gary Merrill, Karl Malden and Neville Brand. Andrews plays a New York detective Sgt. Mark Dixon, a policeman with a bad mood who has been in trouble in the past because of beating suspects. When a man is murdered in a gambling club belonging to a gangster, Scalise (Merrill), Dixon and his partner are going to investigate. Scalise blames the murder of Ken Paine (Stevens), who left the club after fighting not only with his wife Morgan (Tierney), but with the victim. Dixon thinks the victim has a lot of money and was killed by gangsters. He goes to see Paine and not realizing that he has a plate of war in his head, knocks him to the floor and accidentally kills him. Now he must hide the murder. As another complication, he falls for Morgan; her father (Ken Tully), who went to Paine's apartment after he saw that Paine hit his daughter, was arrested for the crime. <br /> <br /> This is a really great, rough noir with good performances. Severely handsome and weathered Andrews is convincing as a tough but nervous detective who has to stay ahead of his colleagues. The film reconnects him with his fantastic costura Laura, Gene Tierney, and she looks beautiful as a model with a bad taste in men who are apparently accustomed to ruining. He does not know much, he has one more on his hands. Ken Tully is doing a great job as her father who protests against his innocence, despite some damning evidence. Karl Malden is very hard as Dixon's boss. <br /> <br /> My only problem with this well-filmed, fast-moving and absorbing movie is the ending. Pure Hollywood and, putting in place Tierney, I doubt if I would react the same. A small criticism of the film written by Ben Hecht directed by Otto Preminger. I did not think it was as inspiring as "Laura", but there are not many things in this world. If you like movie noir, then you have to see.
