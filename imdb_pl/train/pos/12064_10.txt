"Woman in Black" is one of the most terrifying British ghost stories ever made. A young lawyer, after arriving in a small town to deal with the property of a dead client, is haunted by a mysterious woman dressed in black. The film is loaded with an incredible amazing atmosphere and frightening calculations that ensure maximum possible effect. The action makes the viewer deeply involved and the finale is quite disturbing. Acting is excellent and the tension is sometimes unbearable. So if you want to see a really horrifying horror gives this look. I dare make someone watch "The Woman in Black" at night with the lights turned off. Highly recommended 10 out of 10.
