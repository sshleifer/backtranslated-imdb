] I have not seen this movie? Have not you even heard about this movie? That would not surprise me. One of the few really "independent" films produced in the last ten years, no studio believed in this image and was never selected for serious distribution. The independent company Kino Films gave BOESMAN and LENIE a very limited run, practically without any promotion, and most of the major film critics did not even bother to review it. I think that a film based on one act, one set of apartheid and its influence on two people has never had a chance in today's market - and this is a loss of an intelligent filmmaker. <br /> <br /> For the record, both Angela Bassett and Danny Glover deserved to be nominated for Ocsar (just like the operator), but the film received such a small fanfare that I can not even blame the academy for it. It is a film that is demanding, provocative and painful, and requires the audience to meet it on their own terms. That being said, it is definitely not a movie of thoughtless entertainment. Director John Berry wisely does not try to dress in the art of Athol Fugard. Of course, we received some broken flashbacks and breathtaking stage shots, but the film version of BOESMAN AND LENA is in fact a story about two people living in inhuman conditions. <br /> <br /> They expose their basic human rights, Boesman (Glover) and Lena (Bassett) have no one to attack, but each other. The third character joins them for a moment (Willie Jonah, amazing in a silent role), but the focus of the film never deviates from the title heroes and what they have become. Bassett and Glover give bold performances as a broken pair, performances that simply can not be improved. Vigorously and brutally stimulating, both intellectually and emotionally, BOESMAN AND LENA deserve to find home video again. Without a doubt, the best movie of the year 2000.
