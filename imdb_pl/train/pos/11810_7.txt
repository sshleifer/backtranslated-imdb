Even so, I liked it. Warren Beatty is just as a hero of the comic. What saves this film is a set, an amazing cast and a branch of a mediocre scenario. I really expected something more significant in terms of action or story, but I have very little. The main reason for watching this movie is to watch one of the biggest Hollywood stars in this amazing film. <br /> <br /> The only person who did a terrible job and did not even belong to the movie was Madonna. She did not belong to the movie, and her acting was very bad. The film just stood at some points. You've been expecting something more and you have nothing. Al Pacino plays a really bad guy and he does quite well. He and Beatty make a great guy and a bad guy. <br /> <br /> It is also interesting to see Dustin Hoffman and Warren Beatty in a film other than Isthar. I did not see Ishtar, but I heard bad things. This movie is good, but it could have been much better. I liked it as a child, because I thought it looks cool, and visually the movie is amazing, the sets are amazing, the writing is only fair, and with such a cast in the movie I would expect a little better. <br /> <br /> SPOILER <br /> <br /> Especially I thought that the finale was not big enough. It was interesting, but for such a great movie I just thought that it could end with a bit of roar. The reason for watching this movie is the atmosphere. The film uses only 7 colors of the comic, which makes it all the more visually perfect. <br /> <br /> Costumes and makeup were also impeccable. Face makeup for villains was great. Beatty does not match such a great character as life. Even so, it's a good movie that could have been much more. This is better for me than Batman, another adaptation of the comic book that came close to the same time. Of course, the film was much larger in gross terms.
