The plot of this pleasant MGM musical is invented and only sometimes funny, dealing with espionage and romance, but the focus of the movie is actually indicated for melodious cutscenes presenting Eleanor Powell's extremely talented and athletic dance tap, incited by Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra, starring Ziggy Elman, Buddy Rich and Frank Sinatra. Red Skelton's actions are the best in Powell, and he and midfielder Bert Lahr receive most of the comedy minutes, though Skelton is more effective when, if you can believe, behaves like an interest in Powell love, and Virginia O'Brien actually provides the most movie humor as a companion dancer. Powell's technical excellence is reflected in one incredible scene where Buddy Rich brings his percussion skills and needs to be watched several times to allow breathing to catch up on precision. Director Edward Buzzell makes good use of his large cast to move the action nicely, despite the rather chaotic scenario he has to deal with, and allows the improper impossibilities of Powell to rule the case.
