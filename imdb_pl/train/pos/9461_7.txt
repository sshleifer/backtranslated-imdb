Steve Carell appears as a person to refer (in a sense) to Dan in real life, a movie that, as I expected, will not like it, but it ended with his sympathy. It is not that the movie laughs loudly, but that it has a big heart. We all like Steve Carell, it's not what the Office fans would expect from him, but you know what, I liked the movie. <br /> <br /> Carell plays Dan Burns, a widowed father whose daughters do not like him. One weekend he and his daughters travel to see their family. There he goes to the bookstore and falls in love with a woman. When he returns home, he finds out that his brother Mitch (played by Dane Cook) meets this woman (played by Juliette Binoche). <br /> <br /> Dan in real life, sometimes I found it a bit unbelievable. Is the Burns family people who practice and play board games together and do many other family things? I would doubt it very much. I do not know any family that would be like that. Does this stop me from raising my thumbs? Well. <br /> <br /> Dan in real life: *** / ****
