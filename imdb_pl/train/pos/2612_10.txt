It's a movie that has been done very well. I heard mixed reviews during production and was waiting for their release! Regards the director and all the actors. The supporting cast gave Evie Mendez what she needed to take her to the top. As everyone says here, the second part of the film is riveting. Katie Cassidy did an amazing job with her character because she did not do much work when the movie was made. He has quite a career ahead. I was surprised by her performance. I liked the movie completely, questioned my values ​​in life and priorities, and I'm a better man! Great news lies in the film. Slow down so that everyone can enjoy!
