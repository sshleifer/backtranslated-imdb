This really funny movie has a whole cast of characters, almost every sensual middle-aged woman in Hollywood and a moving, funny love story. Capomezza and Malacici are rival catering in the Italian district of New York. They are also on opposite - extreme - ends of the taste scale. Their children are cast in the main roles of the church production of Romeo and Juliet. Of course, they fall in love. On the scene! The confusion and confusion that makes parents quarrel with each other and their children is set against us in the background of the wonderfully tasteless home of Capomezza and their wonderfully tasting weddings. Four parents and charming young lovers, heroes are a vague priest, an ordinary grandmother, a lady who waves her wand and gives the spiritual advice she receives from a medium called Blessed Roscoe motel with beds in the shape of a car backseat and two pigeons. There is neither a sight nor a punch line in this fast film. <br /> <br /> Even the names of two families are part of the fun. "Capomezza" can be interpreted as "low eyebrows", and "Malacici" can mean "blocked snobs". <br /> <br /> If you are sensitive to Italian stereotypes, you may not like this movie. If Bette Midler makes you ashamed, you may not like it because all the women in this movie make Bette Midler look like Martha Stewart. The rest of us should love it!
