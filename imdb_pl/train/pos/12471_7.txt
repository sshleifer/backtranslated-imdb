I did not know the real events when I sat down to watch it, only the fact that it was based on real history. After the death of his father, Rhonda tries to help his daughter Desiree (... I did not know that someone really called his offspring, that) he would deal with the loss. It is really made for children, as is often the case with "family" movies (let's say, go together and gather everyone to watch, although I would stop teens unless you are sure they are buying a concept), but this does not diminish the demands that the death of a parent is, and does not really appeal to anyone. The plot is interesting enough and moves well enough. Acting is diverse, and the brilliant Burstyn is outshone by most of her cast colleagues, Mathis tracks it quite well, and Ferland and her peers (with a few exceptions) are the least convincing in the group (and to be honest, they're annoying; I'm not really in the intended group) The editing and photos are standard, and certainly not less. Although humor is limited to a few funny lines, the tone is not unpleasant, there is an intense scene or two, I recommend it to fans of this type of movie.
