Even though The Shining has more than a quarter of a century, I challenge everyone not to fall into the madness of Jack Nicholson. This is a rare example of something so special that no one was able to tear it away; instead, it has been repeatedly referred to in pop culture. Twins, a blood elevator, RedRum, crazy "writing" crap ... this should be seen if there is nothing else to understand all the allusions to her in everyday life. The film is simultaneously frightening, tense, beautiful and intriguing mentally. He has the classic Hitchcock secret and the terror of the modern thriller. And he has what horror films usually lack: a great script.
