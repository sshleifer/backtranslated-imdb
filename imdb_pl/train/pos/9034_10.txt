This movie was absolutely brilliant !! Every performance in this movie is perfect, especially Jake Gyllenhaal and Chris Cooper. It looks like Mr. Gyllenhaal will have a HUGE movie career, if that's all. I thought Joe Johnston was a strange choice as a director, because he usually associates with large budget hits (Jumanji, Honey I shrunk the kids). He pulls out each scene from a clean class. My favorite scene was that Homer goes down the shaft and looks at the sky, going down, like all his dreams, was beautiful. Joe Johnston should direct more of these great, action-driven movies, as well as his big blockbuster movie, which is also perfect. FAME!! for everyone involved in this masterpiece!
