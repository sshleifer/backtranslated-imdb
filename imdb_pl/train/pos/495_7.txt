<br /> <br /> There is a STAR TREK canon - a lot. From the canon, we know the history of the future. Advances in technology, events, places, first contacts with new creatures, names, dates, etc. <br /> <br /> A COMPANY largely ignore the canon of ST. The unfortunate fact has long been serious fans. As one of the assumptions, I assumed that the producers will at least watch the first few episodes of TOS and retro back - but no. <br /> <br /> Phase guns, like most technologies, look much more modern than in TOS. An old-fashioned Starfleet laser gun, a slow gold transporter effect - that's what I was expecting. In addition, I did not expect to hear pure sounds based on TNG-like sounds, but far from the sound effects of TOS. <br /> <br /> In the earliest view of TOS (the original pilot: THE CAGE) we see the Starfleet with a more formal military aspect - a bit of an old navy. At ENTERPRISE, we see a shocking disregard for rank. There is more military code in the STAR BLAZERS cartoon than in ENTERPRISE. <br /> <br /> It's good that Captain Archer is uncertain about the Universe's needs (unlike Kirk, who has never lacked the certainty of applying human justice), but inside the ENTREPRISE, everyone seems to be equal. Unprofessional, uncertain, more distant from the sense of formal military service than in any ST series - and that says a lot! <br /> <br /> An informal song opening country music heralds family travels, not the adventures of an important large military ship. <br /> <br /> ENTERPRISE wants to show us mostly funny, warm conversation about interpersonal relations, and not take us into historical, daring, rough, sophisticated exploration space. <br /> <br /> I would choose Adrian Paul for the captain and the elder man for the doctor. Nevertheless, I liked the actors mostly. Linda Park, an outstanding ball dancer from Boston College, will certainly thrive. The characters that make up the crew seem to be carefully created. <br /> <br /> ENTERPRISE starts its course stronger than the previous three STAR TREK series. Let's hope for a good future!
