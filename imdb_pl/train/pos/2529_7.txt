"The Invisible Ray" is part of science fiction and horror. It was also the third of the seven functions of Karloff / Lugosi. Boris Karloff plays a dominant role in this entry. <br /> <br /> Through specially designed astronomical equipment, Dr. Janos Rukh (Karloff) demonstrates to colleagues Dr. Felix Benet (Bela Lugosi), Sir Frances Stevens (Walter Kingsford), his wife Lady Stevens (Beulah Bondi) and their nephew Ronald Drake (Frank Lawton) that a meteorite containing a powerful element landed on the African continent many millions of years ago. Rukh impresses with his guests who invite him to accompany them on an expedition to Africa to find a mysterious element. <br /> <br /> Rukh sets off alone and discovers the place where the meteorite landed and the element he calls "Radium X". Due to the long absence of Rukh, his wonderful young wife Diana (Frances Drake) attracts Drake and they both fall in love. Meanwhile, Rukh gets contaminated by Radium X to such an extent that everyone he touches will die instantly. Contamination causes his skin to emit a bright glow in the dark. <br /> <br /> Rukh goes to Benet for help. Benet develops an antidote that is taken every day to provide temporary immunity to this element. Unfortunately, the deadly element also affects Rukh's brain, slowly turning it into a vengeful murderer. <br /> <br /> When Rukh continues his work, Sir Frances takes news of the discovery to France. Diana and Ronald accompany him. When Benet informs him about this action, Rukh accuses the party of betraying him and revealing him and secretly planning his revenge. When he returns to France, he learns about the healing power of Radu X when he heals the blindness of his mother (Violet Kemble Cooper) and about Benet's work in treating his patients' ailments. <br /> <br /> But Rukh's madness intensifies. First, he murders an innocent man whom he identifies as Rukh. After hearing about the visible fall of Rukh, Diana and Ronald are getting married. This is Rukha's anger and he begins to take his revenge on five other members of the expedition. One night he is lured into a trap set by Benet and ........... <br /> <br /> Karloff is great in the lead role, passing from a happy marriage of an ambitious scientist to a crazy maniac. Lugosi has a simple role for now and does what he can with a limited part. <br /> <br /> In the 79th minute the film was the second of the six longest collaborations with Karloff / Lugosi. Karloff's film all the time.
