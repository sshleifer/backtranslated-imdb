It was one of the best movies I've seen. The film is about real life and how drugs can play a major role. Although this movie seems to be produced from a low budget, I think it is exciting. <br /> <br /> Some of them may not like this story and say that the script has no direction. However, when a person plunges into drugs as deeply as the characters, there is no direction of life. I believe that this film is an accurate reflection of what can happen to a person if they face extreme temptations. <br /> <br /> Most of the actors are novices in the industry. Everyone, however, did very well. Everyone seemed to be doing their job well and adapting to their character. <br /> <br /> I think this movie can be a good tool to use when dealing with a person or a loved one who is involved in drugs and seems to be spiraling out of control. This movie may scare them enough to change their way.
