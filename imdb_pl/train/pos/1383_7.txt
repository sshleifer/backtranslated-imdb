The original title means "Birth of octopuses". I must admit that I do not fully understand this title. The English title is "Water Lilies". But after writing this, I read another user's comment: "The title in French is also suggestive:" prieuve ", or an octopus, suggesting that the individual must simultaneously juggle with many pressures." Thank you for the explanation. <br /> <br /> The main theme is the first sexual emotions of girls, when it is not clear whether they are directed at the same sex or the other sex. It's no different in the case of boys. I think that both Floriane and Marie will eventually have heterosexual feelings without any admixtures. <br /> <br /> Much of the film is water ballet. Sometimes the girls have their heads down, and nothing above the water except the feet and legs they wave and kick in the air. For people like me who have never seen such things before, it was fascinating. - Floriane is the leader of one team of "water lilies". <br /> <br /> Marie says she would like to see when Floriane is training. It seems to be their first contact, which is not ordinary. They will be together soon. Floriane takes Marie to the garage, where the boy is waiting for her, and then he leaves with him for an hour, while Marie waits until he returns. I took it for granted that the couple slept with each other. But later we'll find out from the movie that they're doing less than that. <br /> <br /> I can provide information that few users will find somewhere else. There is a scene where Marie secretly steals Floriane's garbage bag. There is an apple in it, mostly eaten. And Marie goes to the rest. ?? In another film, "Kazetachi no gogo" (Afternoon Breezes) Hitoshi Yazaki (Japan, 1980), there is a parallel scene. It's about adult young women, and clearly a lesbian is in vain in love with a heterosexual woman. He also steals his beloved litter bag and also finds a more or less eaten apple and eats the rest. <br /> <br /> Later Floriane tells Marie that she would like to play her orgasm for the first time. Marie says she can not do this. <br /> <br /> But later Maria says she really is ready. And she masturbates on Floriane. There is no nudity in this scene. <br /> <br /> Probably only a female director could have done such a great psychological program or study? I would like to quote Baudelaire "Les amours enfantines". <br /> <br /> Floriane plays Ad√®le Haenel, who performed splendidly as an autistic girl in "The Little Devils" by Christophe Ruggia (2002)? ? very underestimated movie.
