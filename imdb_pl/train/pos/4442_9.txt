Ogre is a movie made for television in Italy and was not supposed to be a continuation of Demons, because Lamberto Bava mentions it even in an interview with the DVD Sheirk Show, but was named Demons III to be part of the Demons series. Music in Demons and Demons 2 was rock music from the 80s, while it is more frightening music, and the first two are the horror of Demons III: Ogre is an architectural horror, so Demons III is not a proper continuation of Demons, but still like this movie. <br /> <br /> Music is frightening and adds tone to the castle, that the movie is set, Ogre is another thing why I like this movie. There are two other films that are classified as demons III, namely Black Demons (Demoni 3) and the Church (Demons 3). Demons III: Ogre is a good movie, if you do not compare it with Demons and Demons 2.
