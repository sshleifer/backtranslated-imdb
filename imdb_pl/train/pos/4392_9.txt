I really liked this movie. Tobey Maguire gives a great performance as Jake. He must be one of the best actors I've ever seen. I was surprised that there were so many funny lines throughout the film. He was also extremely good at it, although I had never seen him deliver a comic book before. The movie makes you engage in the characters and you really wonder what will happen to them. I did not know what to expect from Jewel's performance, but I think she did it quite well. A lot of exciting scenes. A completely good ride. I am absolutely a fan of Maguire's. Check the rules of the cider house. One of the best in history.
