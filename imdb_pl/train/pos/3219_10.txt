It's a great movie. He has an engaging story, an amazing main character, a very good acting and deadly act. This takes place mainly in 2036, but shows the scenes that have taken place in recent years to explain the story. <br /> <br /> The story is very well made and there are no holes. Kurt Russell is a soldier named Todd who is trained from birth to killing and like all other soldiers he never had a normal life. In the end, the army introduces newer, younger, faster and stronger soldiers. Jason Scott Lee is one of them. As a result, they do not need any old soldiers like Todd. They test new soldiers, ordering them to fight with old soldiers, during battle Russell is wounded and assumed to be dead. The army dumps its body in the same way as others, assuming that everyone is dead, but they do not realize that Russell is alive. <br /> <br /> Todd finds a camp full of civilizations on this planet, which the army threw him on. He lives there for a while but can not adapt to normal life. He rarely speaks a word, and sometimes is very aggressive towards other people. When they feel that he is dangerous to them, they send him into the desert. <br /> <br /> Just like Russell's leaving the planet is attacked by new soldiers. The military forgot to train soldiers to be wise like Todd and other old soldiers. So while these new soldiers are faster and stronger than Todd, Todd easily overwhelms them. The army is starting to realize this and Todd is killing all his people but one. This is Jason Scott Lee, and finally you see the classic battle scene between Russell and Scott Lee. Russell apparently goes to the top. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best action movies I've ever seen. That's all you can ask for in the film, including some great lines. The writer also did not forget that Russell had never seen a woman before, as he even called women "sir". In this movie there are no holes, every minute has its purpose and is very funny. <br /> <br /> A great action movie for one army for Rambo, Commando and Missing In Action fans. This is highly recommended for all fans of Kurt Russell and action / science fiction fans.
