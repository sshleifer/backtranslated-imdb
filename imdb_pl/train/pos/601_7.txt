I was surprised by the low rating of this film from viewers. I saw it one late night on television and it hit the nail on the head - I think it was in 1989, when it appeared. I remember, however, quite well, with a nice accent or two, and an interesting atmosphere on the windmill farm. Michael Pollard looks appropriately wasteful in his role, which largely summarizes the unfulfilled early promise of his career, and everyone else is playing it quite simply. I definitely recommend it as a rental, although some topics that may have seemed a bit nervous in 1989, Now may seem to be tamed, which is a shame, considering that modern "abominations" are often used as an indispensable marketing tool, a bit like demanding to be noticed.
