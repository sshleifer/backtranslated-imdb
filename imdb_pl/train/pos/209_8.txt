Walter Matthau and George Burns work great together. Willy's acidity with embarrassed amnesia Al is a mixture created in heaven. The scene in which they meet again in Willy's apartment is a jewel, and the final scene completes the film to perfection. Walter Matthau gives an excellent performance as an upset semi-retired comedian, because only he can, intonation in his voice and exaggerated dramatization combined with his general incomprehension of what is happening, create a great characteristic. George Burns' time is legendary and nowhere was it worse than in this film, its peaceful aura with desert dry answers is unforgettable. Watch out for the scene at the end when Al and his daughter ask a Spanish caretaker something and the reaction of Al - priceless.
