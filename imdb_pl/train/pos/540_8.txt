actually ... this "video camera" effect is simply an effect, rather good ... (you do not know much about directing a movie, right?) This movie is actually BETTER than the original, it's great fun to watch, made for TV, does not have to abide by any rules. It's hard for me to see number 1 because of how she kills the first girl, her disturbing. and all the time we go to Judd Nelson, that we will not succeed, we as the viewers are on his side. I hope one day we will see the third lake cabin, but I doubt it. Watching this movie, you can understand how real movies are made, because it is a kind of film in the movie. Judd is one of the most terrible villains in history and is more realistic, not only mindlessly hacks people like in other horrors.
