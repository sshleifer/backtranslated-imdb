Shakespeare Behind Bars is the most surprising and delightful movie I've seen all year round. It's about a prison program, somewhere in California, if I remember correctly, where prisoners have been practicing and performing other Shakespeare plays every year for the last 14 years. The film follows their production of "Tempest" from casting through performance, and during this process we get to know some amazing things about these men who are behind the most serious crime. Truth is actually stranger than fiction - if someone tried to adapt this story to a feature film, the audience would never buy it, but knowing that it is real, watching her is breathtaking - literally; I panted loudly when I found out about one particularly gifted criminal offense. It's a bit like an episode from the Lo series, and all the more funny because the characters and their bizarre stories are real.
