_Waterdance_ cleverly explores various aspects of the life of the wounded spinalnie. Minor disabilities are experienced from minor anguish of defective fluorescent lights flashing overhead to sexuality, masculinity and depression. <br /> <br /> The diversity of the characters themselves emphasizes the complexity of the material being studied - Joel, the writer, Raymond, the black man with the dark past and Bloss, a racist motorcyclist. At the beginning these people are united by the nature of their injuries, but they maintain a spirit of rivalry. Over time, shared experience, both good and bad, connects them as friends supporting each other. <br /> <br /> The most obvious change is the experience of Joel, who initially distances himself from his colleagues with sunglasses, headphones and curtains. When he comes to accept the changes that he has made in his life, Joel rejects these props and begins to engage in the struggles of the people with whom he shares the ward. <br /> <br /> The dance referred to in the title is a reference to this daily struggle to keep your head above the water; to give up dancing is to reject life. _Waterdance_ is a moving and powerful movie on many levels and I do not hesitate to recommend it.
