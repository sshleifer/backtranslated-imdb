When it comes to creating the universe, George Lucas is the undisputed master, and his latest Star Wars movie is very, very good (and more appropriately rated compared to the two previous films from the original saga). Recently, seeing the Revenge of the Sith, we really see this film in perspective. The last battle seems even more climactic, knowing what Anakin Skywalker passed in the Emperor's manipulative hands. It also makes the final battle between Luke and Vader more bitter, considering the love he felt for Padme and the love she felt for her children. In fact, while new movies (especially episode II) are worse than original films, they are only good for one reason. They make old movies seem even better. <br /> <br /> Mark Hamill performs a unique work in this film. It really brings the changes that Luke went through, it seems real. To tell the truth, I think he should become a great actor based on these films because he really does a great job. Harrison Ford is still good. However, you can feel that he made Raiders and Blade Runner between the last two chapters of Star Wars, because it seems to have grown a little. He adds more comedy (obviously inspired by Raiders) to the hero who works great. In short, Han Solo is better than ever. Carrie Fisher has never been a really good actress, but she does a decent job and is certainly satisfactory. Ian McDiarmid appears in this movie and after watching episode III I can safely say that he is one of the most talented villains in history. James Earl Jones still gives voice to Vader, and he is still very, very good. <br /> <br /> As for what the movie looks like, it's pretty safe to say that the Star Wars universe looks better than any of the previous (two) movies, but it was always Lucas' piano, so you really should expect. The last battle for Endor is very well made both in terms of general effects and wise tension. It was also a nice accent, which Lucas decided to carry out in three battles at the same time, which increased the general tension of the culmination. <br /> <br /> The only thing I think is pulling a movie from 9 meritorious people is Ewoki. These little creatures are so irritating that they almost ruin every scene they are in. Besides, I think it's a bit for Kiddy when a group of teddy bears with bows and arrows can defeat the Storm Troop squadron with lasers and powerful machines. br /> <br /> In total, Return of the Jedi is a very good movie, but the fact that Richard Marquand is a less talented director than Irvin Kershner, makes the overall atmosphere of the film less than brilliant. George Lucas' stupid decision to add Ewoks to the universe also makes the film lack luster. <br /> <br /> 8/10
