I saw this movie for the first time when it was released in the United States in 1984. I have seen him many times since. What strikes me in the film is the inclusion of the art of rehearsals in the lives of heroes and vice versa. Throughout the film, two are intertwined, and sometimes you are never too sure whether you are watching the characters' lives or the scene from the rehearsal. This continues until the movie's climax. Over the years, my friends and I still like to discuss if "Carmen" is really stuck at the end. From the reaction of other characters to stylized murder, it is open to debate. The passion of dance, the quality of acting, passion for art and brilliance of performances combine to create a great movie that once again combines and twists the line between life and art.
