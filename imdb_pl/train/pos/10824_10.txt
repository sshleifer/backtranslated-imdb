"Still Crazy" is undoubtedly the biggest rock comedy of all time. It has been mistakenly compared to "This Is Spinal Tap" with which there is no connection. "Spinal Tap" is a satire (and, to be honest, it is not very good, despite the "release" of many rock stereotypes). In contrast to "Tap", "Still Crazy" is filled with great actors, great songs and great human situations. You care for people in "Still Crazy". Only that matters. Oh, yeah, music is damn good too, written by Mick Jones of Foreigner and Chris Difford of Squeeze. The American audience already knew Stephen Rea (The Crying Game), but later she met Bill Nighy (Underworld, Love Actually, Pirates Of The Caribbean II) and Timothy Spall (films about Harry Potter).
