I really like this program. That's why I was disappointed when I found out recently that George Lopez is a racist and that he released Masiel Lush from the show, simply because he discovered that she was not a Latin American but an immigrant from Albania. I learned it from people at the exhibition. She was really one of the better parts of the series, and so to find out that even among those who you might think are sensitive to racism, they can also hate someone, just because of the country in which they were born, is really unsatisfactory.
