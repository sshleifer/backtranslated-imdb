Come on, look at the title! LOL! I remember seeing this movie in Saturday Late Night Creature Features years ago. It's a great, tacky movie with monsters with merry bad acting and two marvelous morons that give him a schlock factor. 2 guys from the boat rental is a movie! LOL, and you'll love the scene of the boat where the Englishman and his wife talk about all the stars, and it's noon and sunny. Damnly fun !!! You could say that they just did not care about the plot, they just wanted to let the film pass as soon as possible. In conclusion, you will love him if you love 70's schlock.
