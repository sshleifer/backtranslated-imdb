~~ I was able to see this movie yesterday morning at an early transition. ~~ <br /> <br /> I am a mother of 2 children, who range from 11 to 6 years. So I'm sure that many parents may refer to the need to see many children's films. It was refreshing for me. I have not read this particular book, so I do not know if it remained faithful to the book or not. But he certainly took the gross rate to a high level. This is the story of a "new" child in the city and it happens that there is a group of boys who have created a kind of club and like to choose children ... sound familiar? Did not everyone suffer this time? He has a younger brother whom he can not stand and parents who he is ashamed of. What I liked best was that each character was completely different from the other, all stood out. Killer (why do they always make a red head out of tyranny? My daughter has red hair! And she is not a tyrant! ... lol) is a great tyrant who screams at his own older brother. It took turns and bends, and you fell in love with all of them and really found yourself behind all the characters! Even parents, a great connection between father and son. Around nice, sweet, funny, vulgar etc ...... Take your children !!! You will enjoy it as much as they do!
