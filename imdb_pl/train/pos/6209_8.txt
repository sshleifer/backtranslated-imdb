When I heard for the first time that Hal Hartley was making the sequel to Henry Fool, I was excited (it's been a personal favorite for years) and then cautious when I heard that it had something to do with terrorism. However, after I saw it, I was surprised to find that it works, and at the same time is a completely different kind of film than Henry Fool. Writing and direction were dead, and acting was great ... especially Hartley manages to complete practically the entire cast, all the way to Henry's son, who only had four in the original. As I mentioned before, this movie is completely different from the first one, but it works: I accepted the change in tone and subject because 10 years have passed and the characters would be in very different situations since the first movie ended. In this case, it comes to an unexpected adventure ... and all that I will give up ... not to mention that I will have to see it again to really understand what is going on and who is double. Though it was certainly one of the better movies I've seen in a while, it suffers just like many sequels with its ending, because it seems that Hartley is now planning a third and the movie is crashing. I will definitely buy tickets for Part 3 ("Henry Grim"?) In 2017.
