The Secret of Kells is a movie that I've been waiting for years after seeing the early material on Cartoon Saloon in Kilkenny. I am here to tell you that it was worth waiting. Cartoons are strongly stylized, but not annoying, as I was afraid. The whole film is a beauty and a great imagination, especially I love the animated illuminated book, in which small figures come to life on the site. The characteristics are excellent, I love the voice of Brendan Gleeson as a raw Abbot and I particularly liked the sprinting voice of Aisling. The forest is a triumph, such a beautiful place. The story is well done, a mix of facts and fantasies. and really attracts the viewer to cheer on Brendan in his search for excellent book materials. And so I am a lover of calligraphy and illumination, so the subject is close to my heart, but everyone I know and who saw it, and they are not fans of crafts, agree that this is a beautiful little film. I will definitely buy a DVD when it is released and I would like to say, a well done Cartoon Saloon and all the people involved in this gigantic project. Let there be many more. :) Coming back here to say that I bought some DVDs as soon as I could and gave them for Christmas, everyone loves it! And I wish them all happiness in the world at the Oscars, such a joy that it is nominated.
