Going through this movie on Fox's movie on a lazy Friday afternoon, I can not think of a better way to spend a lazy Friday night, then pay two cents. Especially if you take into account the lack of user comments on the subject. Does any film, good or bad, not deserve more than four comments? And this movie is not bad at all. <br /> <br /> The first thing to keep in mind when watching a movie like April Love is to remember the epoch from which it comes, in this case the late fifties. The films were then a very happy medium. The cinemas were devoid of tragedy, and the screens were filled with Technicolor screens on a wide screen to tear people away from the gray glow of the evil medium in a box called television. I do not know how many people detached themselves from the boob tube to see this one, but it managed to capture my attention for 97 minutes. <br /> <br /> Teenager Idol Pat Boone plays Nick Conover, a young teenager sent to live with his Aunt Henrietta (Jeanette Nolan) and Uncle Jed (Arthur O'Connell) in the country after he was tried to steal a car. It looks like his aunt and uncle lost their own son (Jed Jr.), so Uncle Jed seems to lose his joy of life. Aunt Henrietta hopes that Nick on the farm will somehow lead Jed out of his stagnation. Role lines, like what they are, Jed and Nick do not care for each other. Jed then meets with neighbors Fran (Dolores Michaels) and Liz (Shirley Jones) Templeton. Jed immediately falls in love with Fran and of course I do not have to tell you that Liz is developing into Jed. There is also the case of Uncle Jed's horse, a trotter who has gone mad and will not let anyone take care of him from the death of Jed Jr. You can probably fill in everything that happens from that point on your own, seeing how there are no real surprises. But it does not matter, you'll have fun anyway. <br /> <br /> Once you get to know the squeaky, clean Pat Boone, as a supposedly evil boy, you will have no trouble with the rest of the movie. That being said, Boone has a surprisingly good performance as Nick. Certainly the role does not require a lot of depth, but it is nevertheless a job well done when you least expect it. As Jed, Arthur O'Connell is the perfect choice for this role. At first it's unreachable and cold, but when it's slowly warming up to Nick, we see that he's a really good guy. Jeannette Nolan is having fun as Henrietta, who constantly plays the role of a mediator between Jed and Nick. Shirley Jones takes a break from Rodgers and Hammerstein and gets a few opportunities to honor us with his vocal talents. Like Liz, she's great to watch, great to listen to and quite funny. Dolores Michaels as Fran, who is a little more crazy, is just as fun. <br /> <br /> The best thing about April Love is that there is no real, medium character on the screen. Not one real villain in all this matter. Everyone is so damned nice that you can not help watching a movie. In fact, I think it's quite refreshing, a bit like putting your troubles behind you and enjoying a summer picnic with your friends. Think of it as the Andy Griffiths old show with music numbers, a little more storyline and Technicolor wide screen. The songs are a mixed bag, with the best April Love title song. Another thing that I really enjoyed, is that they did not use the blue screens during the horse racing sequences, and therefore a little more fun and exciting. Actually, the whole movie is beautifully photographed and it was nice to see that they did not skimp in this section. Chemistry between Jones and Boone is good. The best thing is that the reluctance between Nick and Jed is presented as any attempt to gain respect for others. <br /> <br /> This movie will never be confused with great cinema. However, sometimes instead of going to Disneyland, just a nice trip in the park, and this is April Love. <br /> <br /> My class: B + <br /> <br />
