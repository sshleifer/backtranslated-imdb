This is definitely my favorite movie of all time. Mainly because he is not afraid of delving into some very politically incorrect topics (such as spanking and submission of women) that other mainstream films are just too shy to touch them. In this film, nothing is excluded, because the director freely develops the story without worrying about possible injury to the viewer. However, I do not think that anything is done here for shock value or deliberately offending anyone. Sean Young is a great and brave performance. Most recognized mainstream actresses would not take up this role or would ask for some major script changes before accepting it. Other cast members are also doing great. <br /> <br /> Have you noticed that this movie has not appeared on a paid cable since the compulsory short performance a year after it hit the cinemas? Have you ever wondered why? The obvious reason is that it just does not fit into today's political atmosphere. It seems to me rather ironic that some premium channels now have softcore porn (which are getting closer to hardcore porn), but they will not wear the mainstream movie, such as "Love Crimes". Unfortunately, although this movie is only 11 years old, you probably can not create it today. <br /> <br />
