A funny, suggestive, tangled, genius movie. It reminds me of the Holy Mountain Bunuel L'Age D'Or or Jodorowsky - a lot of weird characters that are spinning around and looking ..... what is it? I laughed almost all the way, watching the peripheral reactions of the audience that surrounded me in the theater. Fun throughout, from the beginning to the insides and poisoned viscera until the end, if it was the end. I would just like to remember every detail. Sometimes it persecutes me. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I only have the most positive memories of this movie. Because it seems that you can not take it home and watch, I suppose I will have to wait a few more years until Crispin Glover appears again with his Big Slide Show (and another show "What is it?") ... I saw this movie in Atlanta almost immediately after I was in a catastrophic catastrophe, so I was a little stunned, which could be a very good state of mind to be able to watch prophetic talking arthropods and delayed in the superhero costumes and the divine Glover in their right grimace setting Q, scantily clad girls rising from the floor like the wonderful wet dream of DADAist. <br /> <br /> Is this a statement about Life as we know it? Of course, everyone EXPECTS art to be just that. I rather think that the truth is more visible in absences and negative space. What you do not tell us is what we have to deduce, but it is much more important than the lies that other people are feeding us every day. Rather, one "WHAT IS IT?" Over 5000 films, such as "Titanic" or "Sleepless in Seattle" (thrill, gag, moan). <br /> <br /> Thank you, Mr. Glover (additionally a funny man who watches on the screen or during the Big Slide Show - clever, funny, bizarre and scandalously hot). Make more movies, write more books, keep your nightmare alive.
