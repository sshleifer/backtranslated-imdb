It has always been one of my favorite movies and will always be. In the last few years, I became a science fiction fan of the 1950s and 1960s, trying to collect all the better ones that were created then. I love many things about them, how slim they can be, how technically correct some of them were. Great colors and sets also make me go. It's a pity when they make some of these good old movies; they almost always push them out, - look at the last repetition of the Day in which the Earth stood still, it's a complete trash !! Forbidden Planet is one of the best space movies of all time, and now they are also trying to recreate it, and I shudder at the idea of ​​how the new will look! In my opinion, some things, such as fantastic classic films, should be left to themselves to be what they are, classic examples of great attempts to tell simple stories and give people emotions in the process. After adding the entire techno-crap that we have now available, the film seems to be more dog meat from the Hollywood sausage factory - nothing special. Incidentally, I noticed that the astronaut uniforms in the Forbidden Planet were also used in the "Queen of the Cosmos"! It just says that the budgets were a little lower then, right? Hey, less money and better movies, hmmm .... <br /> <br /> Great performances in this film from Leslie Nielsen, in a serious role, and Anne Francis, Walter Pidgeon (who was always one of my favorite actors) , Earl Holiman and of course Robby the Robot! <br /> <br /> The special effects are fantastic and the plot is not too stretched. This is a great sci-fi experience!
