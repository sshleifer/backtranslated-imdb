Skul with it on a dark and stormy night and get ready for alternating amusement, irritation and terror. The creaking old thread about the ghostly train, which is said to run across the lonely English village in the middle of the night, can be unbelievable, but it's a lot of fun. There are some great old platitudes, such as "ACCIDENT" that locals can remember but do not talk about. But above all, the movie is a vehicle for comedian Arthur Askey to show his special brand of humor in the style of vaudeville between the terrifying pieces. Askey's sophisticated humor is not very fashionable at the moment, but if you let him wash it, it can be fun. This is probably the best Askey movies.
