SPOILERS. Like other posters, I felt that the ending was a little sudden. I would like to see a crew adapting to life on earth after their return. I suppose the authors anticipated this problem by "loading the front" of some Voyager on Earth sequences at the beginning of the episode. (Of course, this time line has been eradicated, so everything is debatable.) I liked how Admiral Janeway died for the Voyager crew. As fans, we can get our cake and eat it, thanks to the fact that Janeway makes the highest sacrifice and lives on. I admit that the scenes of Janeway and her older person conducting the interviews were strange and could easily cross the line to the camp. Fortunately, Mulgrew (s) pulled it off.
