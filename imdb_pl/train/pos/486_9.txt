"The Luzhin Defense" is a film worthy of time. it's a deliberate, intense movie and I've been paying attention to me all the time. John Turturro is absolutely stunning in the role of a sensitive, eccentric chess grandmaster, and Emily Watson is a binding spell as a gentle but rebellious daughter of a very respected Russian family. The chemistry between Watson and Turturro on screen is obvious from the moment their heroes meet in history. In conclusion, this film is one of the best, in-depth look at the life of a chess grandmaster, and Turturro and Watson add a completely non-mainstream, non-cliche to the film. Most people come from thinking about the theater and feel moved by this ingenious look at the most unbelievable love stories.
