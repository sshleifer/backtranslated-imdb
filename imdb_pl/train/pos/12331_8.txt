Being someone who lists Night of the Living Dead in third place in his five favorite movies of all time, and at the same time loves this parody of student movies, I feel that I must defend this film against previously published scathing reviews. This short but sweet song has always enjoyed crowds in horror and science fiction marathons, in which those who participate in this event love this genre, but know that they do not take zombie movies too seriously. This film is a tribute to the original, not an insult. It's supposed to be fun, and many others I've heard about singing and applause, agree with me that it works. Especially for those of us who have seen NOTLD 50+ times. Watch the film role of the director as a reporter Jeff Drexel, and also if you have the chance to catch his parody Alien, Loaf.
