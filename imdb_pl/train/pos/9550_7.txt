Despite success in comedy or drama, Turkish directors fail in horror. "Okul-D @ bbe" are good examples of horrible Turkish horrors. <br /> <br /> But if you look at "Gen", you will understand that this is a strike. The atmosphere of the film is impressive and dark. Also special functions are colorful and are not cheap. Soundtracks fit the movie, but the scenario is not entirely perfect, and the theme of the movie is ordinary. <br /> <br /> As a result, "Gen" does not make any difference in horror movies, but fans of thrillers do not disappoint. In this respect, it is a success for Yesilcam and Turkey. (7/10)
