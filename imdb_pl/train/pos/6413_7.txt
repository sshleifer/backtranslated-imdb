Robert De Niro, Cuba Gooding Jr., Hal Holbrook and the rest of the actors and actresses in "Men of Honor" joined together to make a great movie out of it. Mark Isham wrote the screenplay, so you know that music is really good too. <br /> <br /> But: From the very beginning I noticed a lot of stupidities, gaps and exaggerated jerks of heart. I had to swear that I would ignore them and sit down to enjoy the movie. If you can do it, then _really_is_ good. <br /> <br /> The story of Carl Brashear, the real hero, is inspiring enough to survive all his life. Look for it on the Internet ... The whole story is more amazing than a movie, as the director admitted in his comments. In the Second World War there were only three African American divers in the US Navy. However, none have achieved the status of the main navy of the American Navy. Carl Brashear was the first African-American captain of the US Navy. And he was the first amputation diver ever to obtain a US Navy diver certificate or certificate. (Loud applause). <br /> <br /> On the negative side of the film book: Should I say only one of many "gaps"? Yes, I will mark this comment as containing "spoilers" and I will do it ... An early, key scene in which a helicopter hits the radio mast and drowns in the sea: never had time to fit a full Mark V diver, even if he was a legendary master Chief Billy Sunday, he was "only a few minutes late", saving the pilot. <br /> <br /> So, for gaps, fools and excessive drama, I mocked "People of Honor" from an ideal 10 to 7. <br /> <br /> Will Hollywood ever realize that pure truth is much better than their too dramatic approach to telling stories? I doubt it. Detriment!
