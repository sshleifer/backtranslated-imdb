*** SPOILERS *** One of the first films from the Second World War coming from Hollywood, which shows how the war had an impact on the GI, or in this case the US Marines who fought in it. <br/> <br /> 21-year-old Al Schmid, John Garfield, just started living a well-paid job, earning $ 40.00 a week at a local steel plant and Ruth Hartley's girlfriend Elenore Parker, who he was supposed to marry when The Japanese pampered him, and millions of similarly young Americans, attacking the American Pacific fleet at Pearl Harbor. Performing his duty as a US citizen, Al immediately joined the US Marine Corps, hoping to return to the Japanese, knowing that it would turn out that Marines would be the first American combat units to break into. /> <br /> Al finally got his chance when his unit, the 1st Marine Division, landed on 7 August 1942 at Guadalcanal in the remote Solomon Islands to attack the Japanese, who had control over it. It was during the battle of the Ilu Al River that he almost stopped the huge Japanese Banzai attack, holding back, with the help of his machine gun, after a wave of suicide attacks by the determined Japanese, until he finally got help or reinforcements. It was during a bloody fight that Al was hit in the face by a Japanese grenade, which ultimately blinded him. <br /> <br /> Now in convalescence at Al's naval hospital, he faces something much more difficult to overcome then he fights a battalion attack of Japanese or German soldiers. It has a future in which he will never see again and will have to rely on others who look after him or on him! <br /> <br /> We will see in the movie "Pride of Marines" the battle of Al himself was much more difficult than when he fought the Japanese army at Guadalcanal to reconcile with his disability. Not wanting anyone, especially his girlfriend Ruth, to regret him, Al is in fact the one who feels sorry for himself more than anyone else in the film. With the help of Navy nurse Virginia Pfeiffer, Rosemary DeCamp and Ruth, along with his Marine Marine Lee Diamond buddies, Dane Clark, he finally gives Al the courage to face blindness with the same strength with which he grappled with the Japanese Gudalcanal force. The courage that Al thought he had lost on this God-forsaken hell on an island in the South Pacific. <br /> <br /> Based on the true history of the American Marine Sergeant Sergeant Albert Schmid, "Pride of the Marines" showed what we can expect from tens of thousands of wounded American soldiers returning from the war. We see how in many ways it was much more difficult for those who fought in the war to adapt to America in peace, when they left something, as in the case of Al Schmid, on the battlefield. Al's fight with his personal demons was much more difficult than the Japanese he fought in because they were part of him and they had to fight each other to defeat them and eventually defeat them. Despite the help he received from both Virginia's sister and his girlfriend Ruth, as well as from his naval doctor, who is strikingly similar to the actor Gregory Peck, it still depended on Al to overcome the fears he faced. The fears he and he alone had to overcome and overcome, as everyone in the film said.
