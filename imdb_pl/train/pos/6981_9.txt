For all haters: condemnation of the TV series with one episode is like judging the entire book after reading the first few pages. With that in mind, I was a big BSG fan, I thought it was one of the best television dramas (not just science fiction) in the air. But the time has come for it to end and the story goes on. I liked the BSG epilogue "The Plan", but he raised as many new questions as he answered, so I was looking forward to "Caprica" ​​and I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> I hoped he would not try BSG and I was glad that "Caprica" ​​is something else, and I personally found this story exciting, in a different way than burning cosmic battles, explosions and special effects science fiction (do not get me wrong, I like these things too). Eric Stolz and Esai Morales give solid performances, and Alessandra was just wonderful. I can not wait for the next week.
