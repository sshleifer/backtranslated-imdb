This is one of the best Hong Kong movies (action), which has a tight and exciting storyline and great battle scenes. This film Sammo has everything: Romance, Drama, Excitement and a great hero. This is the only martial arts film that interested me in the story, not just waiting for the fight. Sammo fans - you must see (see also Eastern Condors, Shanghai Express (Yuen Biao to Ace!), Dragons Forever and Enter the Fat Dragon.
