When the head of the orphanage goes on vacation, his father takes over the details of the center and finishes renting the children. When you're having fun, a couple with a nice apartment and a great life, the idea to adopt this idea was created especially for them. Why would they want to spoil their elegant life thanks to three hair clogs of carpets? In no way do people like these two need children to make life wonderful. This movie makes the real world work that way, but I'm a picture of a dubiety.
