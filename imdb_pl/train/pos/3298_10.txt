It's definitely one of the best films I've ever seen - it has everything - a truly moving script, great actors who make subtleness a beautiful art to watch, actually an elegant romance (it's a pity that this kind of romance just does not seem to exist anymore) ), beautiful songs and lyrics (especially the last song), artistic result, costumes and sets that make you want to live in them. The ending was just a disappointment because I was expecting a spectacular movie that would have a great end - but it was even more wonderful than most movies. Definitely check this video - over and over again. There are many details that you miss the first time that deserve a second look.
