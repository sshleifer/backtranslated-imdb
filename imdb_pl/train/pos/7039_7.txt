War Inc. it's a funny but weird movie. The actors are friendly, the film is also nice, but I do not know how to describe the story. Later I will go to the plot. This is a movie with strange choices. Except for John Cusack as a smuggler who we saw many years ago in Grosse Point blank, which I liked. <br /> <br /> Here we have Hilary Duff playing a Russian pop star named Yonica Babyya or something like that. Her character is strange. There is a scene in which he sticks the scorpion to his trousers. And he goes to Hauser (Cusack). Finally, there is the return of two characters. It makes sense. <br /> <br /> This is the only casting choice I'm entering. Because it's just weird. The whole movie is strange. But sometimes incredibly funny and I never got bored. We have the best actors here. Turning Miss Duff down. She is not great. But here we have John Cusack, Marisa Tomeii, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley. Do you see what I mean? <br /> <br /> Here is the story of a man-man named Hauser (Cusack). He is sent to a city in the Middle East to hit a man named Omar Sheriif (not an actor). Trying to deal with your own personal problems, she must help in the popstar wedding (played by Hilary Duff). And he falls in love with a news reporter (played by Marisa Tomeia). However, there is something about popstar. Hauser is disgusted with her. There is a scene in which he sings to him a song and then he throws himself. <br /> <br /> The phrase at the end of the movie reveals the type of why. The point is that I saw it coming. But it does not matter. It's a weird, fun and funny comedy. I love most of the actors. In fact, how can I not recommend it? <br /> <br /> War, Inc .: 3.5 / 5
