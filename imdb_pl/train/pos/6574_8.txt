This can be difficult for some people, accustomed to Hollywood production styles. Directing is boring, apparently just making scenography, and the sound quality is here and there (the rustling of people's clothing sometimes competes with their voices, etc.). <br /> <br /> My friends and I started watching, not knowing what to expect, and the first scene almost discouraged us. It seemed very stagy and tacky. Then we raised the tone of content and really started to enjoy. <br /> <br /> It is very funny, despite some roughness. Definitely give me a chance if you appreciate a great dialog. Of course, Helena Bonham Carter is adorable.
