Jake's Closet has the emotional power of Kramer vs. Kramer combined with Pan's Labyrinth's imagination. Even the initial special effect seems to bow to the Lord's Labyrinth. But this is a story that takes place in modern times, not in a war from sixty years ago, and thus has an even greater impact today. Jake's Closet talks about a boy, the only child, practically alone on a summer vacation, dealing with a family that breaks down. It's horror, like The Others and The Sixth Sense, a horror for a thinking man. If you are looking for a video, it will not be your cup of tea, but if you are looking for a story that is both touching and full of tension with a good game, this is a movie for you. At the show, I saw, I swear that there was a moment when the whole audience was screaming. I highly recommend catching this movie.
