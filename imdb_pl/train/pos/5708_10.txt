It's so exciting! In the afternoon, when I saw "La Roue", a short, light movie, I consider it a real feast! This is absolutely amazing and one of the most charming photos I've seen this year. It is more surprising because it is an early talkie and embarrasses wonderful pictures of the 30s due to the innovative use of sound in the cinema. It is simply filled with music and a charming mood that is really optimistic, and most importantly, it made me happy! Of course, it will not be so difficult to regain the lottery ticket, which the man was looking for, but the pace is so joyful, and the movie is so spectacularly funny that I did not even think about it twice. Comedy is funny and I think it is even better than the Marx Brothers, probably the greatest comedic force of those times. This is rather perfect.
