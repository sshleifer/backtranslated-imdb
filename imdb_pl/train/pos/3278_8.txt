It's a wonderfully written and well-played psychological drama. This is not really a horror movie, so those who are looking for something like The Ring or The Grudge will be disappointed. What really surprised me in this film is the intelligence and subtle attention to detail in the plot and the effort that has been made internally coherent. I also appreciate Dr Phil's lack of psychobabble or New Age revisionism. Instead of developing the program, the filmmakers were just telling the story, telling it well and letting the viewer think about it. Rare landscapes of dreams resembled Wyeth's paintings and surprisingly effective. <br /> <br /> A great example of how to make a good movie with a small budget, no big studies, stellar actors, great directors (it was much better than many Hitchcock movies), special effects or "smart" twists.
