I will be honest, I finally checked this movie not for the sake of the stars - although they were sensible and convincing, especially three clues - and even a convincing story about a violation in the presidential secret service (something, I "I was informed via DVDs from this program it has not happened yet, assuming it's true, it's amazing!). I got him because he was directed, and he has a choice, none other than Detective Meldrick Lewis !! Well, all right, Clark Johnson, one of my friends from "Homicide: Life on the Street" and veteran (mostly) TV. I would say that he does as well as he can, thanks to a project that is possible to see, but quite average, despite the possibility. <br /> <br /> Veteran and as Secret Agent Pete Garrison (Michael Douglass) must learn both by blackmailing him and killing his friend, aiming and blowing up an Air Force One helicopter and shooting Preza (David Rasche. Everyone Remembers " Hammer"?). His romance with the first lady (Kim Basinger, apparently one of the MOST first women we've ever had, fictional or real) certainly does not help in his position. He must both catch the real mole in the service, and avoid dog-dog, like hunting his former best friend, agent and boss (Kiefer Sutherland, almost still in mode "24"). Throw in a few key service agents (Martin Donovan and foxy, some hard to buy as the giant Eva Longorria) and shady figures from abroad, and you have a pretty standard political thriller that is not as high as it seems and achieves the desired, if disappointing, results . <br /> <br /> The summary line is the best way to describe how this program is played without providing spoilers. The additions to the DVD seemed more insightful and interesting than the film, although the movie itself was fun enough to interest the majority (including myself).
