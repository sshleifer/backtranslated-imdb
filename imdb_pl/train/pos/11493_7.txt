The Unborn is a pretty good budget horror that uses pregnancy-related fears. This is very well kept by always good Brooke Adams and steadfast filmmaker James Karen, though the supporting cast is quite average for a grader. The music of Gary Numan is also good for all people. Henry Dominic's script is quite intelligent for this kind of thing, although there is some trace of misogyny in it. The direction of Rodman Fender is simply enough and there are unnecessary cheap fears. If you're a fan of Adams, whose film career is not as great as it should be, check it out; it's great, as always.
