In the case of a film that was hardly advertised and few people heard about it, it was pretty good. This is another of these modern British crime movies that are bizarre ("Snatch", "Sexy Beast", etc.). It is not as wild as "Snatch", but it is interesting and has some rough characters. <br /> <br /> It also has a banal and quite predictable ending, but at the beginning of the series - not late - has some nice twists and turns very interesting for the viewer for the first time. Basically it's about a weak Brit who sends a Russian "mail order lady" who ends up with the help of two Russian friends, providing some big surprises. <br /> <br /> Ben Chapin and Nicole Kidman are very good stars, like Vincent Cassel and Matthieu Kassovitz as the Russian Kidman cohorts. It's a different kind of movie and it works well. Kidman once again proves that he is more than just a beautiful face.
