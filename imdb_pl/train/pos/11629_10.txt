Red Eye is an exciting film by Freddy Kreuger, Wes Craven. Wes Craven presents the story of an ordinary Lisa hotel. After taking part in the grandmother's funeral, he decides to take a flight of red eyes. While waiting, he meets a man named Jack Rippner (what is fffrreeaakkyy?) And become friends. Ironically, they are both sitting side by side on this plane. Then the horror begins. This movie is exciting and for the weak people who do not like exciting / horror movies, let's say it's possible to pee in pants. This is an excellent example of the production of bone tremors. Wes Craven coped well with this movie. He chose the right actors, such as Rachel McAdams, a smart, sexy girl who knows what she's doing and is cautious about everything she plays in the movie. Cillian Murphy, a frightening and frightening actor who can cool bones with his amazing acting that is a bad character in this movie, and his face can really widen his eyes. Wes Craven has done a great job and I hope he will do more such films.
