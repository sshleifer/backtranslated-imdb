It is a very beautiful and almost meditative film - almost no dialogue in it, except narrative; and the scenery and music complement each other perfectly. At first I did not connect the girl's and fox's red hair until I was noticed by my friend (who also has red hair!). It's almost an old-fashioned type of children's movie saying that kids now prefer animations like Shrek or Toy Story etc. - but I think that young people should be more interested in the beauty and the miracle of nature that this film certainly does. Maybe not the best movie of its kind, but certainly an excellent and relaxing view for all ages - not just children.
