"Der Todesking" is not the type of movie that makes you happy? The second iconic statue of Jörg Buttgereit, which is much better than the infamous "Nekromantik", exists in seven short episodes? one for each day of the week? revolving around unconnected suicides people. Between these very disturbing episodes, Buttgereit inserts really scary images of a seriously decaying male corpse. Episodes are not equally powerful, but as a healthy "Der Todesking" it is quite high on the list of the most depressing artistic films. Especially episodes on Wednesday, in which the man explained his sexual frustrations to the total stranger in the park and on Sunday, focusing on the younger man molesting the dead, are extremely intense and devastating. The added value of this movie, or any other shocking one like this one, is debatable and I'm not even sure if Buttgereit had any message to communicate here. There is a vague memory of an amazing chain that encourages readers to commit suicide, but we are mainly uninformed about the motivations of these people to end their lives so dramatically. Completely different from the expectations of "Der Todesking", it is not exploitative or disgustingly graphic! On the contrary, I could never hope that Buttgereit would be so subtle and thoughtful in presenting pure human misery. The Thursday episode is a perfect example, because it stylishly shows different points of view of the famous German bridge, while the names, age and occupations of people who jumped out appear on the screen. Production values ​​are inevitably weak, and assembly is often not professional, but it is not so important in this type of cinema. The subject matter is strong and makes us contemplate less cheerful ?? but also necessary? aspects of life. WONDERFUL use of tragic music!
