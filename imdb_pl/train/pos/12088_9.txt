Hardcastle and McCormick is an excellent television program. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is predictable, just like The Dukes of Hazzard, Hunter, The A-Team etc. etc. <br /> <br /> This program is simply a good, clean TV. The relationship between Hardcastle and McCormick is quite funny. They often make a few blows in each episode, which adds to the humor of the show. It contains several car chases in almost every episode, but who does not like a good car chase? Especially with Coyote! <br /> <br /> It is a pity that they did not do this clean TV today. I would highly recommend!
