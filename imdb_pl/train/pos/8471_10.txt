This is one of my favorite Mr. Motos and I saw them all. As usual, Lorre is his charming "me" who is the debutant of Mr. Moto. Lionel Atwill plays a charmingly charming museum curator, the usual comical relief is quite funny here and there are many suspects about who to look at. It's fast and fun. <br /> <br /> The archaeologist does not have the same talent as Thomas Beck, just the second trail of these programmers, but it's right. Stepin Fetchit is on board, and when he speaks in a stereotypical way, his lines are ridiculous, not demeaning his intelligence, and he actually saves the day in his short time on the screen.
