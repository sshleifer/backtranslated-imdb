Story: The murderer unites 3 different mafias in an enterprise to buy an island that would then serve as a money laundering facility for organized crime. To defeat this, the FBI is trying to destroy one of the mafia masters. The case goes wrong, and by some improbable twists, we're dealing with another "friend who does not like each other", a movie ... one of them is an FBI agent and the other is a former DEA agent. <br /> <br /> So far, so stupid. But the power of this film is not in its history - at best a bad joke. That's funny. (At least the synchronized German version is). The action is also good, with a memorable scene using a shotgun and a rocket launcher. But the emphasis is on humor. Not a smart satire, not exactly slapstick, but somewhere in between, you get a lot of fun jokes. <br /> <br /> This film, however, is the opposite of political correctness. Legal abuse of drugs is visible in a visible place, without criticism, and even displayed as cool. This is a fragment of a film that annoys me seriously and in my opinion is unsuitable for children. <br /> <br /> In summary, for a nice evening watching the upcoming action with funny jokes, this movie is perfect. Just remember: in this genre, you often leave your brain at the door when you enter the cinema / television room. Then you will have fun. 8/10
