I was not sure if it would be just another of those idiotic soap operas that seem to be prime time, but it turns out to be quite a good performance (with little thanks to talented castings). Four female friends from different backgrounds meet and share weekly events in their love life. The one-hour program follows each of them separately, through often depressed missions, to find love and does so without boredom and banality. "Trudi" Sharon Small is a housewife (allegedly widowed after September 11), who learns a little and gets upset with her friends (who seem to be a bit looser and more creative in their efforts). It's great to see Small back on t.v. because it was great at Inspector Lynley Mysteries. The chick can work. The character of Orla Brady (Siobhan, a lawyer) is probably the most devastated, but still very nice to women when she is struggling with the nice but absorbed husband of Hari (Jaffrey, formerly "Spooks") in his driven desire to have a child with her, independently from her needs. The last two cast members are sparkling Jess (Shellie Conn), an event planner who is a wild child who sleeps with everyone and everyone, is not gender specific, and Katie, (Sarah Parrish), a grim physician who affair with the patient AND his his son sent her a career and a love life out of control. With that in mind, I'm now fascinated and I hope the BBC continues this series because it's good, it's different and it has a great cast.
