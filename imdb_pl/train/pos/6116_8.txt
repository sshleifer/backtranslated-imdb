This movie is like marmite. Either you love it or you hate it. If you enter this movie, expecting a good movie with decent production values, a good story and great characters, you will hate it. If you enter this movie, expecting a low-budget slasher, you will probably not want it. <br /> <br /> If you enter this movie, expecting to see one of the most crazy characters ever made in the form of Harry Russo, you will love it. John Giancaspro is absolutely brilliant in his crazy depiction of a crazy, murderous coke devil. <br /> <br /> The special effects are hopeless at best, but who cares? If you are the person who is prepared to watch the movie Schizophreniac: The Whore Mangler, you have undoubtedly seen a lot of horror filled gore. With the budget this movie was created, even if it tried, probably at best it would be mediocre. I would rather laugh at something hopeless than without the average. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, you probably can not stand this movie, but if you are one of the few who decide to see it, it will become the best thing since sliced ​​bread # 2 I hate marmite.
