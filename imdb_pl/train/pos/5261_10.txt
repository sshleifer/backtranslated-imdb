Do you like a really clever comedy or if you love "wedding brigands", if the answer is that the latter will stop reading now. I can not believe that this film is not rated higher. Essentially, Meadows plays a character unlike Austin Powers. There are so many ingenious moments in this gagorama. From the primitive - Leon playing alone on the porch, the former boy cheated to eat. . Well. Inspire madness - clown sex, routine on Broadway, voice over. Meadows is great as childish but very sweet Leon. Some great lines "do not blame the wang" "curled, deaky sex world" too much. . . Why this film was not huge is a mystery. A great comedy.
