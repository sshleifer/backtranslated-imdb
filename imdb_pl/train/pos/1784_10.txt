The evening is a fun movie with quite a lot of depth. All actors and actresses play spectacular performances. However, theatrical acting is expected with an amazing cast, but expectations are exceeded in this film. You can refer to the personality and situation in your own family. When you observe the interaction of family members, memories of your family are immediately invoked. This is one of the few films that inspires you to read the book. Usually the opposite is true; one reads a book and then wants to watch a movie. I will definitely get a copy of Susan Minot's book and read it. The Rhode Island scenery is spectacular, as is the soundtrack. Every car enthusiast will enjoy the seemingly expertly restored cars from the era. Needless to say now, but I recommend the evening very much. See that you like it.
