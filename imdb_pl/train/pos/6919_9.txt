"Winchester '73" was the first of a series of Westerns starring James Stewart and director Anthony Mann. Like most of them, Stewart's hero has a violent turn that threatens to explode at any time. <br /> <br /> The title refers to the "one in a thousand" rifle, which is intended for shooting from the Dodge City rifle on July 4, 1876. Lin McAdam (Stewart) and his midfielder, High Spade (Millard Mitchell), arrive on the trail of Dutch Henry (Stephen McNally) for the unfortunate act of the past. They arrive just in time to see the city of Lola (Shelley Winters) from the running salon of Marshal Wyatt Earp (Will Geer). It turns out that Dutch Henry is also in the city for shooting with a rifle. Lin and Dutch Henry are shooting for the coveted prize with Lin's win, but Dutchman Henry robs Lin from the gun and escapes. <br /> <br /> Lin and High Spade are tracking Henry Henry across the country, where they meet Lola with her cowardly beau Steve Miller (Charles Drake) stops in the United States cavalry camp, waiting for the Young Bull's Indian attack ( Rock Hudson) who won a valuable rifle by killing the cunning shooter John McIntyre. He got a gun, cheating Dutch Henry in poker. The young Bull is killed during the attack and the gun passes to Steve. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, back at the ranch, Lola and Steve meet the famous Waco rifleman Johnny Dean (Dan Duryea), who kills Steve and takes a prized rifle and Lola for himself. When Dean meets Dutchman Henryk, he lets him pick up his "weapon", planning to murder him later. In the town of Tuscosa, Lin kills Dean, because Dutch Henry's plans to keep the bank are bad and he runs to the mountains, and Lin chases. In one of the best finals in history, both meet in the final duel. <br /> <br /> I think this movie was the only collaboration with Stewart / Mann that was shot at B & W. It's beautifully photographed, especially scenes in "wide open spaces", especially the final game. Stewart plays against the type, the hero's game with a violent revenge motive, the emotion he brought to future films with Mann. <br /> <br /> As with most universal westerns, this one can boast of casting veterans and contracting players of the day. In addition to the above-mentioned, JC Flippen appears as a cavalry sergeant, Steve Brodie, James Millican, John Doucette and Chuck Roberson as various supporters, Ray Teal as the sheriff following Duryea, Tony Curtis and James Best as novices and Edmund Cobb, Chief Yowlachie and John War Eagle in various roles in the Dodge City sequence. <br /> <br /> A classic western in every sense of the word. He was responsible for recreating Stewart's career as an action star.
