Sure, it was a remake of the 70s movie, but it had the tension and action of the current movie, say Breakdown. He runs, he desperately wants to be with his hospitalized wife, the police are the smallest problem. The chases were very good, the part where <br /> <br /> was stuck at the stop, it was well done, the end of the movie was a great cliff. This is better than Bullitt, a boring movie with what, chase after muscle cars that was filmed badly? The character Vigo knew what he had to do to get away with Johnny Law, some movies had a night vision effect, CB radio - ok. I forgot the name of the movie, the guy has 76'Caddy spoiled, toys with the guy he upset. The ending is great, you can not say whether he pretends to be suicide or not, he did very well - he did not do it.
