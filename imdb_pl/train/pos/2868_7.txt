First of all, I must say that I am Portuguese and it is not typical for me to spend time watching Portuguese films, probably every year, and even not ... <br /> <br /> ... And the reason is almost a generalized idea between Portuguese, that national photos are terrible, really close to the worst ever created! However, in the last decade, it starts to surprise me when we return to the funny 40s, when "Leão da Estrela" and "Costa do Castelo" belonged to the best in the world in their films, such as "Pulsação Zero" or "Sorte Nula" both from the director Fernando Fragaty and from some actors and common music. <br /> <br /> This one is also good, not the same kind, because it's not a real comedy; in fact, it is officially a drama, the drama of a woman has some unexpected funny parts, humorous reasons for characters or funny things that happen to them, such as a hypothetical journey to the Caribbean to lie down. <br /> <br /> The plot works and can surprise us several times; the actors are doing well, the places are regular as a result; but the truth is that everything makes sense, then we can consider it a nice effort for the national cinema, which seems to start from the ashes as a phoenix. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch Portuguese Film, you can certainly choose a better option, but it still has one to measure.
