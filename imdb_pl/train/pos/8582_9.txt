Love characters and story. Very funny with lots of shares. Thomas Ian Griffith and Tia Carrer give great performances. I enjoyed the dynamic and comic interaction of Griffith and Career. Donald Southerland plays a very nice and surprisingly nice, burned man. All three actors belong to my favorites and have them in this film for a special feast. A nice addition to my extensive DVD collection. I highly recommend this movie. If you like ... Mr. and Mrs. Smith, The Replacement Killers, L.A. Confidential, The Long Kiss Goodnight, The Abyss and The Whole Nine Yards ... you will love this movie.
