As a former two-time world champion in Okinawan Karate, I like films about sacrifice for sport. But this movie is much more. This movie is so good and so deep. Recently I have been suffering from a very serious injury and almost catastrophic lack of passion. They almost went out for me. And this stupid movie touched me so deeply that it reminded me of what life was all about. This is a movie about life. Live your life for yourself and respect for others. Empowerment. God, bless, "Cut it like Beckham." I believe it's a real gem.
