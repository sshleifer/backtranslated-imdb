I watched this video at a local video store during their annual sales of sidewalks. While scanning thousands of movies, hoping to find several animated films for sale, I came across this movie. I read the back of the movie and knew it was a divine hand at work for me to buy this movie. You see, I have three siblings (and will soon be adopted) with my family. Immediately my foster children made contact with the three children who appeared in the film. The film helped them to better understand their own circumstances. For the first time, also the oldest of a group of siblings (7-year-old woman) decided to open me a bit about her past and the trauma she experienced. She is fighting the whole problem of trust. It's also the first time I've seen her cry. After watching the movie, I asked her what it means for an adopted child. She replied: "It means to be happy." Be sure to see families that raise children and consider adopting. Certainly, it opened up lines of communication with us.
