The main reason for watching this movie is Warren William, who is in top form as the manager of the Shyster campaign. He is an electrician, he is always looking for ways to deceive the audience and defeat the enemy during the biggest disasters. William is a great actor - I feel that he has never received the remuneration he owes. Bette Davis as his girlfriend also shines in an underrated role. Personally, I think Guy Kibbee is not quite a good candidate that William and the others are trying to impose on the audience. It seemed more like an empty canvas than a person. I would prefer a real character to appear than a non-sign. The story itself is unbelievable, stupid and banal. But Warren William and Bette Davis are worth watching.
