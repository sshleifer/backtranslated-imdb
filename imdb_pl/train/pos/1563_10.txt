I loved this episode. It's so great that 5 of them join forces and stop LutherCorp and save the world. I also love this episode because Kyle Gallner (Bart Allen / Impulse) and Justin Hartley (Oliver Queen / Green Arrow) performed in it !!! I just hope Clark joins the Justice League and we will follow this group of heroes around the world !! =) It was really exciting and makes viewers interested in what will happen next. I think Chloe should also join the band as a Watchtower, which would be such a cool thing for her to do outside the daily planet because she has no superpowers. I also want to find out what types of topics Lex intends to use in 33.1, I wonder what other types of power other people in the world have !!!
