I have no idea what people are complaining about. I saw this movie yesterday and I really liked it. Stone once again provided a great character. She was just as good as in the first Primary Instinct. He still has these wise but cunning answers. Although Sharon can be 48 years old ... he looks amazing! I do not care if it's as artificial as Barbie. It looks good and that's it. Basic Instinct 2 provides everything you need from the first. Sex, violence and a wonderful ending that will allow you to think and talk about it for hours! Half of the people who commented on this movie did not even see it. So do not listen to them.
