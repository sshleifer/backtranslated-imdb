This is really one of the best love movies I've ever seen. Exactly behind him is none other than "Before Sunset", which is technically not any other film, because it is about the same two people and the same romance. <br /> <br /> This is "love" in the real world. OK, only when most people are as intelligent and eloquent as the ones in the movie. Reading other reviews, I'm happy to know how many other people are crazy also in dialogue-based films. And that makes "Before sunrise" is so good. The dialog box is perfect. It's so real, so addictive and fun. No wonder Jesse and Celine fall in love with each other, because you fall in love with them at the same time. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is the one in the cafe, where they pretend that their best friends are calling, and the other pretending to be their best friend. It is PERFECT. He returns to the point where you fell in love for the first time in your life. <br /> <br /> I have to say that if you have a choice, look at "Before sunrise" before watching "Before sunset" If like you, you saw "Sunset" first, it's hard to shake off the feeling of pity and sadness for two young lovers throughout the concert. <br /> <br /> Once again, the biggest romantic movie in my books. Wonderful acting, perfect script and beautiful locations. Young love at its best.
