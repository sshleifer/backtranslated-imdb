Alain Chabat is a great actor, scriptwriter and director, but maybe he was wrong to think of a story that probably caused them to move in the corridors when Aristophanes still learned that it was "and" before "e", except "To". But, as I said, Chabat is a great actor and he can charm when he needs it. I have also gradually overcome my dislike for Charlotte Gainsbourg, who also achieves excellent results. If you absolutely insist on knowing, the "conspiracy" is about the guy in his forties, and more than about the content to be single. It does not fit well with his mother and five sisters and to take them off, makes a "deal" with his girlfriend's sister to pose - for fifteen thousand euros - like his new girlfriend, let the romance come to realize the wedding, then bend it, the same depriving him of a hook. Naturally they meet together, but on the way there are fights sub-Benedek and Beatrice and everything that is considered quite painless for ninety minutes and occurring so well in the French box office that the sequel may not be ruled out.
