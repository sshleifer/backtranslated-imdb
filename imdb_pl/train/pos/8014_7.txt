But if you like muppets, then I'm opposed to the fact that you do not like it. Basically, the same plot returned (this time in New York, not in LA) contains a lot of funny scenes and muppet hi-jinx. Many muppets leave the movie early because it focuses on Kerma and Miss Piggy. I liked it very much. Fun to watch with children.
