Ironically, in the case of art unavailable for a long time in a movie or a video, ARMS AND THE MAN remains quite permanently available on stage for years since its debut in 1894 - largely because it is getting as old as a solid satire about nature heroism and military business. Whenever the world is plunged into quarrels, ARMS AND MAN seem to soar faster and better. <br /> <br /> This is the art that Oscar Strauss has made (leaving most of Shaw's best ideas) to a successful operetta, CHOCOLATE SOLDIER (when Hollywood reached * this, * they missed Shaw's last traces and did not pay him for the rights - he was the Oscar winner himself). While the best Shaw was always his ideas and dialogue, not naked threads, in ARMS AND MAN, the plot also shines and the master manages happy endings for all interested. <br /> <br /> Young Raina (Helena Bonham Carter), daughter of the officer and richest man in her city, is engaged to an officer officer in the Bulgarian cavalry, and everything seems fine, to the botched Swiss mercenary (Pip Torrens) on the other the party climbs to its gutter, escaping the battle in which his army was broken. As usual in Shaw's satire, nothing is as it seems, and social conventions stand on the head in the light of a simple - and not so simple reason. There are no "good" or "bad guys", only people from different classes do the best they can - just like life only better - and of course with Shaw, the joke is perfectly polished from everyone interested. br /> <br /> An early (1932) version of the film (from Shaw's own script) of the most traditional and traditionally funny satirical stage show Shaw and one of his first, who made a real hit on this side of the Atlantic, has long been one of the missing. Shaw did not sell the screen rights to his plays - he only licensed them for 5 years and it turned out that thanks to the fast-growing sound technology that made the films from 1932 look primitive just a few years later, Shaw did not renew the license to show it . Therefore, we are immensely indebted to the BBC to finally release their 1987 version in a DVD case with nine other shiny games. (A little bit of PYGMALION, which is considered the best Shaw, falls out the least well on this set in production with Lynn Redgrave and James Villiers.) <br /> <br /> Even paired, as on DVD, with less impressive one act, HUMAN OBJECTIVE, ARMS AND HUMAN MAKE THAT ARE A REAL TREASURE. <br /> <br /> Helena Bonham Carter continued, after cutting off her teeth from such television roles, to a serious film career, it will bring many viewers this early role. They should not be disappointed because Miss Carter gives the performance in line with the layered innocence that the public expect from her, but under the somewhat poor direction of James Cellan Jones (and despite the beautiful and well-observed physical production of the BBC), the malignant fire of the role (and her indignation with due to underestimation in the last act) is only about 80% of its potential. <br /> <br /> You can say a lot about the true song star, Pip Torrens, as Bluntschli "Switzer". It's a great, appealing performance, but it's not about a physical comedy hidden in the early stage, in which a young soldier can hardly fall asleep despite the deadly threat. <br /> <br /> Despite these reservations, it is a solid production of a great game moved to a small screen with panache. It deserves to be widely seen and, ideally, encourage even more vivid remake on the big screen in the style and joy of the latest remake of Wilde's IDEAL HUSBAND. Practically * everyone * ARMS AND MAN are to be valued, and with good luck, we may even see the original version from 1932. "For one or the other surface, this production will please anyone who loves a good Shaw.
