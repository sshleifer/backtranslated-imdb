This 1939 film by John Ford and writer Lamara Trotti tells a fictional story of a young lawyer, Abraham Lincoln, his trials (literally) and his suffering. This is a sentimental film, quite well made, but not breathtaking. The cast of Henry Fonda as Lincoln seems a mistake, because while the actor had the right pathetic features, even with a few inches of makeup and a fake nose, he is too handsome for Honest Abe, who was famed. This is a good test from Fonda, which is nothing, if not honest, but its bad approach throws the whole movie. The supporting cast, however, is excellent and includes Alice Brady, Ward Bond and Donald Meek. But Ford is too respectful in his treatment of Lincoln, who is portrayed as being shy about the saint, and in the last scene the film goes a step further.
