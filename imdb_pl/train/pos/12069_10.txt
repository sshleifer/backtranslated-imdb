Yes, this is flawed - especially if you like Hollywood movies that require a lot of effects, pure entertainment or fantastic stories or stories, and you can not think for yourself. <br /> <br /> Roeg movies are for an intelligent movie viewer, and irrelevance is a great example. <br /> <br /> The character is brilliant, the story is perfect, but, like all Nic Roeg movies - he means on every level aspects of reality that would never have occurred to you. His films always make you think, and personally I like it in the movie. <br /> <br /> So do not expect that you will leave this movie and you feel happy for joy, because you will probably be disappointed. <br /> <br /> But I think it's perfect.
