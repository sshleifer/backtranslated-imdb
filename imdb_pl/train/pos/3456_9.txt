There is no such thing as perfect murder. Lieutenant Columbo knows that. Ken Franklin, who is the other half of the crime writers' team, does not know about it. He kills his partner, Jim Ferris, who had plans to go solo. Columbo enters the stage and asks all kinds of questions from Mr. Franklin. And he comes back one question. Column: Murder by the Book (1971) is directed by young Steven Spielberg before his fame. Steven Bochco wrote this. Columbo is a fantastic character with his worn look. It is hard to believe that this man can solve any crime. But he could. Everyone and everyone! Peter Falk is the only person in the world who can present this character. So there are no alterations. This part is a very good example of how Columbo worked. Jack Cassidy plays the killer, and Martin Milner plays the victim. the victim's wife, Joanna Ferris. There is something captivating in the scenes between her and Columbo. How to create an omelette and everything. Barbara Colby plays Lilly La Sanka. In fact, she had a tragic fate when she died after the murder, like here. I have been a Columbo fan since my childhood and I still like to watch them. For many years it was a break, they did not show Columbo stories at all, but now he's back. Return to one more question.
