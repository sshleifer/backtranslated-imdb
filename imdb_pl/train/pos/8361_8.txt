I had mixed feelings for Les Valseuses (1974), written and directed by Bertrand Blier, when I started to watch him, but it ended up being liked. I would not call it vulgar ("Dumb and Dumber" is vulgar, "The Sweetest Thing" is vulgar and inexcusably stupid); I would call it shocking and offensive. I understand why many viewers, especially females, do not like or even dislike. It is the personification of misogyny (or so it seems), and the way the two anti-heroes treat every woman they encounter seems indescribable. But the more I think about it, the more I realize that it somehow comes out as a wonderful little gem. I'm fascinated by how Blier managed to escape. The film is very funny and very pleasant: it is well written, acting is first-rate and the music is sweet and melancholy. Actually, when I think about it, two buddies did something good for the women they came to: they prepared a woman on the train (lovely, obedient blonde Brigitte Fossey, who started her film career with one of the most impressive debuts at René Clément "Forbidden Games" (1952) at the age of 6) to meet her husband, whom she has not seen for two months; they found a man who was finally able to get an ice-cold Marie-Ange (Miou-Miou) left and satisfied; they enlightened and educated young and very willing Isabelle Huppert (in one of his early performances on screen). Their meeting with Jeanne Moreau raises this comedy to a tragic level. In short, I'm not sure if I would like to meet real life Gérard Depardie Jean-Claude and Patrick Dewaere Pierrot and invite them to dinner, but I had fun watching the movie and almost two hours - it was never boring.
