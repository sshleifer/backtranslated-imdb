This movie was hysterical. I did not laugh for a long time. I mean, it's not "hunting for good will," but was it supposed to be like that? I went to advanced screening, expecting much less and was pleasantly surprised. The comedy hits hard and is quite constant. Amanda Peet is hot and amazing. The whole audience I watched with him enjoyed the movie as much as I did.
