Yesterday I saw a new redubbed and edited version and I loved it. Then I went home and watched him with subtitles and loved it. I am ready to watch it again. <br /> <br /> I am a sucker for a gentle, raised secret identity and what can be more gentle education than a pacifist librarian? Scenes in which he reveals his super powers to his friends or absent with bated breath he forgets to be gentle, they are my favorite. <br /> <br /> Of course, martial arts are stunning. I can not really say much about them if you know the style of HK. However, if you are not ... we paused the playback for a short while, and Walker, Texas Ranger was turned on. We noticed that there was a cut after each hit. Not in the black mask. <br /> <br />
