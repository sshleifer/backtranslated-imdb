This is one of the most calming, relaxing and beautifully made animated films I have ever seen. Thanks to beautiful music throughout the film, sounds and music can make you feel like in a movie! This film is not only great for children, but also for adults. It teaches you lessons like never forget who you are, you can do everything that you attach to your mind, and brave and courageous. This movie can also make you cry, which is always a nice touch in movies. This movie is funny, sad, sweet and keeps you on the edge of your seat! Some movies really give you a vague impression after watching them, and the movie "Ghost" is definitely one of them! Thanks to my 9/10 star rating for animation, music and a great idea for a movie, it gave me a lot of Spirit!
