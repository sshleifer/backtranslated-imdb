I only saw two of his photos earlier, I was reconciled with Altman. Earlier, I always described his film style as "boring". You must be in a good mind to appreciate his crazy genius. <br /> <br /> "HealtH" is quite underestimated and very doubtful. In fact, I do not think that VHS has ever been released. Why? When all those bad movies are being released on a DVD every day, this one has no reason? Honestly, I did not have any problems with this movie. For the most part he was consistently funny and funny. Almost all scenes are mysteriously interesting for some reason, whether it's a great dialogue or subtle performances. There is real skill here. <br /> <br /> And Paul Dooley's scale at the bottom of the pool is half fascinating. <br /> <br /> If you can, try to find a copy of this forgotten little gem. This is not perfect, but it is much better than most of the sludge that gets a DVD. Hell, I'd be happy with a nice copy of this VHS. <br /> <br /> However, he is often on the Fox Movie channel, so watch out for him.
