I've seen a lot of movies, but "In Cold Blood" is in itself. It works perfectly in every department. The fact that it contained few large stars helps to move it up, paying more attention to characters and their story, not the name on the awning. Blake and Wilson star in the star performances of the killer duo. The fact that most films are filmed in real crime scenes, even in the home itself, adds extra thrills. Black and white photography darkens the mood, and photography is great. There are many outstanding film works, but if I could only vote for one of the best, it would most likely be "In Cold Blood".
