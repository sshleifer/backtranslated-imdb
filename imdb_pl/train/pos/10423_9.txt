Yes, Be My Love is Mario Lanza, who gained fame and is still popular. His voice was strong and steady, so powerful that MGM decided to use it in the Great Caruso. Sam Lanza thought he was the reincarnation of Caruso. After reading the book by Kostelanitz, who wrote the biography of Lanza, he explains that constant practice and singing lessons have become the visionary of Caruso for Lazy. There is no doubt that Lanza did a great job in this story, but the story is not entirely true; the blame for Hollywood! I used to practice singing his songs many years ago and I became pretty good until I lost my voice because of emphysema / asthma ten years ago. Achieving the high value of Be My Love is not easy; but beautiful!
