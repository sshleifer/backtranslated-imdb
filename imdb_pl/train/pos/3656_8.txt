If you have problems with suspending disbelief, this is not for you. Think about it: a woman finds her newborn on a cabbage stick in her late middle age and raises it as her own. Think about it; does not try to locate a mother who may be a confused teenager in need of treatment and apparently none of the Italian equivalent of social services attempts to "care" for a child (no social welfare now I KNOW it's a fantasy.) Before you know, young Toto has less more than ten years, and his adopted mother dies, leaving him in an orphanage where a HAPPY man who loves everyone emerges.In no apartment, he not only handed his suitcase to the man who stole it, but organized the local homeless in the real residents of Shantytown and on bis leads them in the fight against capitalism in the form of a businessman who buys the land on which Shantytown stands when oil is discovered. He wants to swallow it without further "miracles", starting with the dead mother Toto (an elderly lady who raised him, not biological ), appearing in front of him and handing him doves Which can serve as a magic wand that allows him to grant wishes and humble finale in which the hobo fly to a better place, probably located somewhere over the rainbow. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the movie is here with Urok and it's easy to give up. All in all, a small masterpiece.
