It's a great movie. I'm scared that some people think it may not be based on a real story. Regardless of that !!, the movie is great, and everything you can think about is not the reason that the siren balloon on it ends in the city sirens and so on, thinking that "the girl's wish has come true" means that all our peaceful dreams will come true if we trust in us and do everything in this world to be true. The little girl (Desi - in the movie) and her mom were the best actors I've seen for a long time. Good for them, for all actors, everything for the director. If anyone can tell them, tell them: "A 25-year-old guy from Romania says thank you for making this movie."
