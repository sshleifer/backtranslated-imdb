I watched a DVD with this movie, which also contains an excellent commenting song (in English). It seems that in Cambodia (English subtitles say that the protagonist speaks Thai, but in the movie you talk about Cambodia) a very violent evil person raises boys to be assassins, using hunger and training them to fight and kill. He sends Pang to kill some people in China, and the cop's partner is killed during the killings. Wai's cop is a loose cannon who worries about his father, who is also a cop who has been shot and is in a coma. Wai's boss is his father's friend and worries about Wai's unpredictable behavior. He does not know that Wai was the one who caught his father in dealing with drug traffickers and shot him and led him into a coma. Pang escapes and hides in a dingy cottage on landfills, where he meets a woman who came here to find her mother and repeats that her father does not let her go (Pang does not speak Chinese and does not understand it, but saves her from her a father who seems to have sex with her, maybe this is the reason why Cat III). Wai is becoming more and more obsessed with getting Pang, but Pang is almost unstoppable. Even after Pang steals the boat and takes the woman home, where they get married, and she gets pregnant, Wai follows her and joins the evil man (who trains the boys), making arrangements to fight and train so that he can get Panga. Wai and Pang have a great game with a terribly abused woman, the main victim, and leave the Wai dead, and Pang cuts his child out of the dead mother just to die and leave him as the next boy to be raised as a killer. This film is beautifully photographed with an excellent soundtrack. There are many very violent scenes of violence. A woman with a long nail pulled from her foot. Knives for the neck and torso. Weapons fired directly in the head. And a few very intense beats. It can be grim and intense, but definitely worth seeing.
