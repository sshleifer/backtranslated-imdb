I remember this series so well. It was perfect - so strong and attractive characters, stylish and sexy ... and so different from everything that was on offer at the time - and now ... I'm sure it also inspired the excellent Canadian drama "Traders". <br /> <br /> Both season 1 and season 2 are available in the DVD 2 region in the UK. It is a pleasure for me to watch the series again. <br /> <br /> Season 1 is 13 episodes, and season 2 is 10 episodes. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it seems that it ended after 2 seasons. <br /> <br /> This series was great. <br /> <br /> Sometimes you can get it on the special Amazon.co.uk website
