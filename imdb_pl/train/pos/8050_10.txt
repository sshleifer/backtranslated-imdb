The most agile fat man in martial arts does it again. The early Sammo movie, in which he imitates the hero of his character, Bruce Lee, Sammo is incredibly Lee, as in his actions and fights. The way he falls into Bruce's style, and then back to his own, more well-known kung fu, is a joy to watch and shows how excellent and adaptive he is in his art. Put in a bit of slapstick humor so loved by this type of movie, and this is a movie that has everything - comedy (some unintentional, like a fake black guy), action and amazing battle scenes. A great movie with beer and buddies, worth an hour and a half.
