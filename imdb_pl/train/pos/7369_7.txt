Personally, I could not play "This is Not a Love Song", it is a brilliant movie and there is a great story in it, I just checked the time on my phone every two minutes to see how much the movie was left. <br /> <br /> I love the relationship between Spike and Heaton, where they are close to each other to live in life. At the same time, I would like the relationship to be more than what it is. Heaton is in love with a spike, but Spike Ibsen is not in love with Heaton, otherwise he does not know how to love him. Acts of betrayal on both parts have a big impact on two men. Both are devastated by the fact that the other escaped and abandoned them at a time when they really needed each other for survival.
