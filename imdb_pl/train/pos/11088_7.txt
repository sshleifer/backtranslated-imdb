Villian in this movie is one sob and he seems to be enjoying what he's doing, I think he's making him so insidious. I do not think most people like this movie, especially if they've ever cheated on their wife. This is one of those movies that remains quite vile until the end. But then you have it, the end of the candy bar that makes me look back and say "HOKIE AS HELL". Pretty good movie to the end. The ending is the ending that we would like to see, but not the end of such a significant beginning. And then the consequences of what happened. Guess that you can decide on a real ending. It left me feeling that only one character should survive at the end.
