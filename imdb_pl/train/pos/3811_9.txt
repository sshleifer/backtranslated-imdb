For a long time I have not seen such a beautiful animated function. With a healthy respect for Pixar, I must say that Ratatouille or any other film created by them can not be compared to this. Animators have created an amazingly beautiful world here. The graphics are amazing, the surroundings are stunning, almost every object in each cage is perfectly drawn. Sometimes I felt tingling in my spine - I loved what I saw so much. <br /> <br /> The plot is absolutely romantic. As romantic as the plot of an animated film. The heroes are friendly, especially Hector, the blue rabbit has, pawns, rocks and rules! The remaining characters are also very nice. Humor is at the highest level. <br /> <br /> Generally it seemed that the creators did not put much effort into it. I mean, it looked like there was not much difference to people from Pixar and Dreamworks, who try to think about something new every time. And I am very happy that the product of the European animation studio turned out to be SO great. They made a wonderful, touching film, sweets for the eyes and heart. <br /> <br /> The only minus is a stupid start and that's why it's 9-10 not 10/10
