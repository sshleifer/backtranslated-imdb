The novel is better, and the best parts of the movie are direct translations of what Greene wrote; for example, a silent but grim humor that enters the scenes with Boyer and Lorre or the obsession of a murdered child who takes over the plot. Where the movie departs from the novel, it tends to be ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I do not want to suggest that the movie is in any way bad. It always looks like a part, and history stays in the memory as good. Some of the smaller characters are stock actors who could turn their backs on everything. <br /> <br /> It's a terrible shame that the movie is not available on DVD.
