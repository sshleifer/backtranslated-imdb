The team of Merian Cooper and Ernest Schoedsack produced a documentary about 50,000 Bakhtiari people and their animals during the summer migration to winter grazing. The basic value of this film is today the capsule of the time of "forgotten people" and how they lived during what we in the West knew as "roaring twenties". You can not imagine a more drastic contrast. Raging rivers and barefoot mountain passages are brutally realistic, and animals that disappear under water actually die. To ensure that the time audience believed that history took place, a signed certificate of authenticity was finally offered. The version I saw had fascinating Iranian music that can stand alone and be appreciated without a movie. Having said all this, the film probably has more value for the anthropologist than an ordinary viewer looking for a good evening entertainment. The crew had few supplies sufficient to take pictures that they recorded, and there is no sophisticated camera operation resulting from multiple repetitions. Western intervention titles distract attention from this experience, but in reality they are part of the recording because they show how Hollywood tried to revive the life of the indigenous people to appreciate the public of the day. Desert police in their free time becomes a "police officer's ball". The producers made the documentary drama Chang (1927) and the completely commercial King Kong (1933). The topic of migration is reused in People of the Wind (1976) and in Himalaya (1999). Recommended for those who know in advance what they are getting into - and then recommend them very much.
