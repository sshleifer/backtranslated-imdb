Although history is basically routine, and the ending of "surprise" is just a bad joke for the audience, you can see what attracted these good actors to the project - it offers them a kind of role in which good actors can shine and shine. The film is impeccably made - for its time. It was reworked in 2000 as "Under Suspicion" and if you want to see only one version of this story (it really deserves it), I recommend the latter, with current Hopkins direction and more explicit references to feature points where the original could only point. It ends, however, still. (** 1/2)
