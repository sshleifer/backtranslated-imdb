This western takes place in a different way than most others. Realism is the key here. Conchata Farrell arrives in Wyoming to work for Rip Torn on her ranch. How it is presented makes it the most interesting piece of Americana. I'd rather see it on a big screen than on a tape, but it's worth a look to see how life has returned to the real west. The cinematography is excellent. Robust 9. Torn and Farrell stand out in this film.
