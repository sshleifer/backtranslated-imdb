This movie "Jen sexy as always and Polly wow, or really that this young movie can still touch the hearts of many teenagers, soon you have to put it on DVD, otherwise it will become a classic. I always love this movie in Jen, now I'm too old, but this movie is made for all men> you know I'm from the early 80's. I've had to watch everyone who lives the life I wanted, but through the movies that I can to do it from scratch, I think in short I hope and wish that this film will not die in time, but was reborn in his youth, so that they could enjoy a warm heart filling to learn about hormones and problems with dating and how to get from away from things that seem so big, but now it does not mean that this movie is a dating tool.
