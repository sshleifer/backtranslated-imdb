It has some great spots, but the length of the film can not keep the wafer's surface thin. They are more seafarers on a vacation film, zippier than Astaire's "Follow the Fleet", but not as good as "On The Town". <br /> <br /> Kathryn Grayson is bland, but Kelly and Sinatra work well together. Their number "If you Knew Susie" is funny because they create a song when they sing it. "I Begged Her" is also funny with Sinatra showing how expert he was in digging. Sinatra's solo songs are boring and seem to be inserted to show his singing, not as part of the story. Fortunately, there are some great supporting actors, such as Grady Sutton, Rags Ragland, Carlos Ramirez and Pamela Britton, and the incredible but imperturbable Jose Iturbi, like himself, to keep one view. The third bill and it is interesting that he sees the interaction with children, which Astaire never did. Dean Stockwell plays a child who wants to be in the jacket and slam on Kelly. He also visits the school, as a result of which he tells children the fictional story of his life in the Pomeranian navy (!), Which leads to his wonderful dance with animated Jerry Mouse. In another scene, dancing a charming Mexican dance hat with a charming-looking girl Sharon McManus, who is delightful and sweet. <br /> <br /> Very pleasant, but a bit too long. Tasting future musicals.
