Currently in the new METOO schedule at 4:00 PM on weekdays, just after "Maverick" and just before "Wild, Wild West" (and then "Star Trek"). <br /> <br /> I do not know if I've ever really seen the episode that was originally turned on, but it really captivates me. Unusual, unusual, surrealistic stories set in the mythical West. The type of "Naked City" from westerns. <br /> <br /> And there are the stars: Dan Duryea, Lyle Bettger, Brian Donlevy, MacDonald Carey, Rick Jason (as a treacherous Mexican), young Dick Van Patten, Jack Lord, Noah Berry, Jr. (as colorful Mexican), Martha Hyer, Marguerite Chapman, even Ann Robinson ("War of the Worlds"), Gloria Talbott ("I Married a Monster from Outer Space") <br /> <br /> She played at the SEASONS 'EIGHT, over 200 episodes, from January 1959 to December 1965. <br /> <br /> Eric Fleming is quite unusual as the head of the Gil Favor trail, the most enduring man who ever lived, with a samurai honor code and the right balance between hardness and openness. I would vote for him as president every day. (PS He had a very interesting biography: http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0281661/) <br /> <br /> And the young Clint Eastwood is quite striking, like his impulsive right hand "Rowdy" Yates. Also a veteran of the western and a country musician (immortal "One-Eye, Unicorn, Flying Violet Eater") Sheb Wooley is there as an experienced scout Pete Nolan. And Paul Brinegar creates the most bizarre figure of a cook you can ask for as "Wishbone". <br /> <br /> And then there is this great theme song performed by immortal Frankie Laine. (Between this theme and the theme "Maverick", I have western thematic tracks running through my head throughout the day.) <br /> <br /> I am looking forward to every episode; I'm collecting the whole set. A good time (not to mention the experience of camping) is always guaranteed, because it is waiting to see if the boys will encounter difficulties before advertising. <br /> <br /> "Rollin", rollin "rollin" ...
