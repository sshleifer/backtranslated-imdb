Laurence Olivier, Merle Oberon, Ralph Richardson and Binnie Barnes play "The Divorce of Lady X", a 1938 comedy based on art. Olivier plays young attorney Everard Logan, who allows Oberon to spend the night in his hotel room, when the fog in London is too thick for guests at the costume party to come home. The next day, his friend, Lord Mere (Richardson), announces that his wife (Barnes) stayed with another man in the same hotel and wants to divorce her. Believing that the woman is Oberon, Olivier is panicking. Oberon, who is the single and granddaughter of the judge, pretends to be the lady, Lady Mere, when he is really Leslie Steele. <br /> <br /> We've seen this story or its variations dozens of times. Thanks to this cast it is delightful. I mean Richardson and Olivier? Olivier and Oberon, this great team at Wuthering Heights? Very special. Olivier is strikingly handsome and does a great job with comedy when he portrays a tense, nervous lawyer. Oberon gives her the role of an appropriate light touch. It looks exceptionally young, fuller on the face, with Jean Harlow's eyebrows and a completely different hairstyle for her. She wears beautiful street costumes, although her first dress looks like a birthday cake, and in one dress she tries to try on, with this hairstyle she is ready to play Snow White. Binnie Barnes is delightful like the real Lady Mere. <br /> <br /> The color in this is a mess, and as others have mentioned, it can really use the renovation. It's definitely worth seeing.
