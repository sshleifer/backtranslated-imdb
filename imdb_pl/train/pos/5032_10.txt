The film "Frailty" is actually a psychological thriller rather than a horror movie. It has all the benefits of horror, but it is not. "Frailty" is a film about the perception of religion and the realization of the differences between good and evil. <br /> <br /> In "Frailty", a middle-aged father (Bill Paxton) and his two sons say they are doing God's work. It turns out that they are a trio of notorious serial killers called "God's Hands". We observe how father kills "demons" in a rather brutal way, while convincing his sons that they are doing God's work and that what they do is right. He claims he received a message from an angel who gave him specific instructions to eliminate the demons who live on earth. God gave him a list of names and in exchange for "services"; he and his sons will get protection, which essentially means that the police will never be able to capture them. We see all of this before us in a very disturbing way. But what really worries all this is the effect it has on two sons, especially on the eldest son, Adam. Adam himself seriously doubts the existence of the supreme being, that is, until his father and the week in the basement change it. He knows that his father apparently lost his mind and is quite sure that the same thing happens with his younger brother, Fenton. Fenton, the other half of this puzzle, takes everything as if it were his own religion. He seems to be trapped in God's world and his father's demons. I suppose it is because he is so young and easily susceptible to influence. But everything that happens to these three is rather convincing, too convincing. <br /> <br /> The events that occur in the film can be seen as living hallucinations experienced by the three main characters. I say this because each of them reacts to the situation in different ways and at some point in the film claims to see God. Dad first sees the murders as his mission. His "mission" eventually consumes him and quickly becomes obsessed with the eradication of demons. In fact, his hallucination is the most important thing. His "orders" and the list of names he receives are part of this hallucination. Watch the scene in which my father finds the ax in the barn to find out where I come from. Fenton, younger son, is impressed by all this conversation about demons and destruction. Because he is so young, it's easy to fall into the trap of his father. Adam, on the other hand, is very skeptical about his father's actions. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> In a sense the hallucination ends when dad is killed at the end of the movie. (I will not say how and under what circumstances). But let me say that it is not pleasant. After his death, he is fast approaching today. (The story is told in flashbacks, seen through the eyes of Adam's eldest son). In fact, Fenton tells a story, not Adam, as originally thought. History is told in the way it was perceived, through its actions and actions of a brother. Fenton went mad and continued what his father began by luring the FBI agent into a trap. <br /> <br /> Since religion is the main theme of this film, the film also plays about how easily religion is misinterpreted by those who do not understand it. Before Dad discovered his newly discovered mission, he did not have a clear understanding of religion, nor did he believe in a supreme being. His sons, Fenton and Adam, often sang the church hymns of innocent little children, but they probably did not have a clear understanding of what the words meant. After revealing Dad's newly discovered mission, they both set off in separate directions - Adam remained uncertain about the existence of a supreme being, while Fenton was gradually drawn into the madness of his father. <br /> <br /> A very good thriller that will pop out of you, do not watch it yourself.
