Nice Preminger movie; sometimes a maze, because it researches collections and locations from different points of view and perspectives, as if it were a natural film about the inhabitants of a modern city and its life. In this sense, it is visually and spatially satisfying, because his hero, a good policeman with a bad temper, gets into very hot water, when he accidentally kills a guy with a plate in his head. <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews plays as if he was Hamlet, and he has never been better. History can be a pure melodrama, but Andrews gives it weight and almost raises it to the level of tragedy. As his girlfriend, Gene Tierney is attractive but does not stand out. Gary Merrill is a very interesting dark character, with its natural warmth providing a nice contrast to the coolness of Andrews; his smiling, amiable, angry guy seems to constantly challenge his nemesis by the very fact that he is emotionally open, in contrast to the tightly wounded and moralist policeman who is pursuing him. <br /> <br /> There are no major surprises in this film, which seems to be transient for everyone interested. For director Preminger, this is the kind of encounter with his stars Laura, Andrews and Tierney, who went through career peaks during the making of the film. Supporting cast - Merrill, Karl Malden, Neville Brand - is understandably more optimistic because everyone was on the right track. Preminger, as always a calm observer, allows events to unfold without expressing a strong point of view, because a morally ambiguous ending is a bit disappointing, because the game of cats and mice between the two antagonists seems larger and more archetypal than any movie. contain, much less conclusive. <br /> <br />
