This movie was like any movie by Jimmy Stewart, witty, charming and very pleasant. Kim Novak's performance as Gillian, a beautiful witch who wants to be human, is wonderful, her subtle facial expressions, every movement and gesture create a unique and somewhat Gillian Haunted character has left us with every word. I can not fail to mention the praiseworthy performances of Ernie Kovacs and Elsa Lanchester as a loving Scottish writer possessed by the world of magic (Kovacs), and the other as a beloved aunt who can seem to stop using magic even when it is forbidden. The romantic scenes between Stewart and Novak are beautifully made, and the chemistry between them is great, but then again, when the chemistry between Jimmy Stewart and any leading lady is angry!
