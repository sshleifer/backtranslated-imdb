I watched the movie on DVD a few times for the first time, watched the second half after an hour and returned to the first hour. an entertaining entertainment film, thank God, there is no kickightley here, refreshing and gives us a real insight into Queen Victoria's difficult life and the difficult choices she had to make. Nothing wrong with this film, there is no real bad language or anything of a sexual nature that could offend watching the family. It can get children to investigate a bit about Queen Victoria herself and maybe less well-known figures like Conroy and Lord Melbourne
