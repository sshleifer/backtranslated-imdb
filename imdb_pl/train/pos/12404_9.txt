I lived in Rawlins when the movie was made, and I was lucky to be able to work on it. Both as an addition and Eddie Surkin for special effects. It was cool to see everything that was happening behind the stage, from Barbedwire, who revived in the electric chair, to the floor of the guards' office. It was also very nice to meet all actors, from Viggo to Tiny. Also, the gate that was cut in the prison wall for the film was and still is called by the local "Disney Gate". If someone is interested and is in Rawlins, most of the movie sets are still in place and you can see it during a guided tour. Work for R. Harlin and for R. Harlin was very pleasant and I regretted that I had no chance to do it again.
