This movie has enriched my opinion about Errol Flynnie. While Flynn is of course best known for his savoir-faire and sprezzatura (to shed some high European terms!), This movie gives him the opportunity to stretch (though only slightly) as an actor when he plays a steadfast social climber with a great ego and a sense of nerve, which fits. Supporting cast is excellent; everyone seems to be well-matched to their roles. <br /> <br /> The story moves energetically and, although it is not particularly deep (it omits, perhaps deliberately, the possibility of presenting a social commentary on the massive unequal distribution of income at that time), it certainly entertains and satisfies. From what I know about Jim Corbett, history is also fairly true to history. I really liked the great shows from the 1880s in San Francisco. To sum up, there is little to like in this film ... it's worth watching.
