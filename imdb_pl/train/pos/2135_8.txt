Shall We Dance is a great movie because it shows how something, like dancing, can rejuvenate life in the human spirit. <br /> <br /> The dance is seen as an expression of existence and the birth of individuality. This is certainly the case with Aoki. At work he is a modest resident of the office, but put him on the dance floor, and all his bottled intensity is released. It is surprising that in Japan it is not welcome due to the rigid culture of compatibility. At the beginning of the movie, all heroes are ashamed or afraid of their dancing. They will be despised or recognized as perverted for expressing their passion through dance. <br /> <br /> This movie is worth seeing to experience the revival of human emotions and passions. It will leave a smile on your face for many days.
