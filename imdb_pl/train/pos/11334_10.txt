I would say that this movie gives an insight into the trauma that the young mind can face when the family is divided by divorce or other disaster. I highly recommend this film especially to parents or people planning a family. <br /> <br /> I think that the characters are attractive and very nice from many different dimensions. <br /> <br /> A terrifying monster, though probably not terrifying for most adults, has a very real clue, which can create an over-imagination of a child who faces unknown terror. <br /> <br /> I think the movie is amazing!
