This is not a deep movie; most aspects of the plot are quite predictable and "tried and true", but it was well-preserved and contained some interesting points about what we regret (our "mistakes", as the film calls them), when we look back on our lives. I did not read the book, so I did not know anything more than the story of a dying woman who has strong memories of the old days with which she did not really share with anyone. Fortunately, they got a great cast ... Meryl <br /> <br /> Streep's daughter, Mamie Gummer, plays a young Lila, and then Meryl appears at the end of the movie as an old Lila ... except for the amazing resemblance (duh!) Younger actress She did a great job (maybe not quite her mother's caliber, but who is that?) All the others in this movie were fine, although I would like Glen Close to be more and think that the Buddha figure is too dramatic. <br /> <br /> This is more a movie for girls than for boys, but good to watch with my mother or daughter, and maybe start a dialogue. How difficult it is to meet a parent as a "person"!
