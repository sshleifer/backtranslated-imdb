What I loved about the screen adaptation of the Stone Angel is the fact that it remained so faithful to the novel! A great movie! As an avid reader, I think that the worst thing about film adaptations is that the book somehow gets lost in translation. You could say that the band Stone Angel was careful not to let this happen in this movie. <br /> <br /> Ellen Burstyn was an excellent choice for the cast of Hagar and is definitely the star of the movie. I think, however, that the Canadian actress (Christine Horne) chosen to play in Hagar in her youth also did an amazing job that requires great praise. I have not seen Horne's previous work, but I will definitely look for her after seeing her performance at Stone Angel. <br /> <br /> I have heard that the Canadian premiere of The Stone Angel will happen in spring or summer 2008. I can not wait to see him again on the big screen!
