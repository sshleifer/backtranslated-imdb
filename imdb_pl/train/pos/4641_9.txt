Eytan Fox did it again: move the viewer's heart in a humble story unfolding in an overwhelming mess. Film manages to describe the atmosphere of an amazing city like Tel Aviv so perfectly and subtly. <br /> <br /> I was there a month ago and all this: lifestyle, relationships, the heart of the city beating, a mess, the germ of a utopian mentality in the most light, carefree and unconscious megalopolis ever. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend it: it is a journey for the heart and mind with an interesting perspective for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. <br /> <br /> Note Bene: There is a central gay conspiracy in the film. If you think you're not too gay, be prepared for the challenge and finally see it as "just love." (and do not worry: the chick is hot too!)
