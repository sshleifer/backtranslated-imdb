I, like many die-hard Trekkers (or Trekkies, I do not care!) I've had seven seasons of "Star Trek Voyager", dreaming of a better show when it's over, despairing over the end of "Deep Space Nine" 1999. prayer, answers. "Enterprise" is fantastic. Fresh perspective, radically different characters, stunning new visuals, pop song for intro. (I was shocked!) I can not think of anything that I did not like. save me for 10 seasons of this program. "Star Trek" has returned - "Voyager", no one misses you! Keep on Trekkin '! <br /> <br />>
