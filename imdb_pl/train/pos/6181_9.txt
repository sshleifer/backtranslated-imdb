A very nice movie, provided you know how to watch old musicals / secrets. It may not come close to the secrets of Agatha Christie, or even Thin Man as a movie noir, but it is much more interesting than a typical musical "boy meets a girl" or "show off". As a musical, it is not Busby Berkley or the Freed unit, but it can strengthen the classic "Coctails for two" and the strange "Sweet Marijuana". The film works in real time during a stage show, the premiere of "Vanities", where murder - and soon more - is discovered behind the scenes. Did the murderer learn before the curtain would fall? Sure, but the search is fun, though somewhat predictable and disrupted by the outbursts of comical relief (fortunately in the shape of the shapely goddess of the choir girls, Toby Wing). Stupid policeman is just too stupid, the main character is a bit too nice, the main lady a little too kind, bizarre prima donna a bit too bizarre, and in love a little too much sacrifices, but as a stereotype go, they are quite stylish. There is a group of really great girls from the choir who are chosen even better than the girls from the Busby Berkley musical from the same period, which sometimes seem to be a bit chubby. Yes, this movie could have been a lot better than it really is, and Duke Ellington's number is embarrassing, but if you like to dive into old movies, it's going to be an incredibly tempting journey.
