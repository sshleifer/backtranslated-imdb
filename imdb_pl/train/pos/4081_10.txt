I've seen almost all of Miyazaki's films and they are all beautiful and engaging. But this rises above the rest. This movie made a huge impression on me! <br /> <br /> I have fallen in love with Pazu and Sheeta and their sweet, caring friendship. These were movies for me. Of course, the animation is also great, and the music perfectly captures the feelings in the film. But characters are a great point in this film: they are so well developed and full of personality. <br /> <br /> Let me explain: I am really talking about the Japanese version of the film (with English subs). While the English dub is good (mainly), it simply fades compared to the original language version. Voices are better, dialogue, everything. I suggest to see (and hear) the movie as it was originally.
