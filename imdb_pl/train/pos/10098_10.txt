Dominion Tank Police is undoubtedly one of the most amazing productions ever made, but not only in the field of animation. While the first part (Acts 1 and 2) consists mainly of action and play, the second part is more serious and the second part should not be treated exactly the same as the first part. Subtleties are really out of this world, and the characteristics are beyond brilliant. You must have an extra degree of intelligence to appreciate the intricacies of the second part (Acts-3 and 4). However, I have some complaints. In the first part of the tank, Bonaparte literally jumps over the shell of the tank and makes no sense. You can also question the credibility of Bonaparte, who jumped on the wing of the helicopter, although it was fun. Buaku rules.
