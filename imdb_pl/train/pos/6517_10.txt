I'm afraid it was a movie that you need ACTUALLY WATCH to get something out of it. This is not a careless movie like ... "LEATHAL WEAPON PART 58" do you know the one where Riggs is really crazy? it is not a movie that is almost the same at the end as at the beginning. you can run a phone call everywhere, do what ever and enjoy it in any way. I have noticed in the past that most people who do not like this type of film are the type that will do everything except watching the movie and then slam it because ... they do not understand it or do not understand what's going on It happened. <br /> <br /> DO NOT LET YOUR MOMENTS LOOK !!!
