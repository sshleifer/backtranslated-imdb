I met this film at the age of 8-10 on a cold, dark November afternoon. I played outside all day, frozen, and when I arrived around 4:00 PM, I took a cup of hot cocoa and sat in front of the television with a blanket. I was surprised to see a cartoon that was not happy and stupid - and was in fact dark and moralistic. He captured my imagination. I'm sure he lacks the text and is shortened in all the wrong places for Tolkien's purists. But it still reflects the spirit of the story, the choice of bearing the burden for the benefit of others, the consequences of selfish, hasty decisions, etc. The quality of the animation leaves room for complaint. However, the only place where this movie clearly rises above new films is the characteristics of the voice. John Hurt is great at it. If you do not like the way the characters are drawn, look away and just listen to it. His voice is extraordinary. I have seen it many times, many times and it always brings me back to this time, as a child, thirsty for a magical adventure. For this reason, I say "happiness", the film is nostalgic for me, so I do not see its flaws. But between John Hurt and Tolkien's fantasy, it still came to me and it still is.
