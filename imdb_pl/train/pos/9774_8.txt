This movie has its ups and downs, but for me the good things in this movie far outweigh the bad ... <br /> <br /> What is not so good in the movie is sometimes dialogue, sounds, lighting (am I the only one who noticed the way the sets were lit was amateur, and the actor ... <br /> <br /> What is very good is a very original plot, a very intense atmosphere, a factor that is very high, and the effects that are made to the highest degree. <br /> <br /> So, definitely worth seeing, and maybe even must-see for all fans of horror and gore ....
