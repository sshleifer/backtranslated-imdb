In the end, I set up a DVD rental to find movies not available in stores. I chose The Souler Opposite because I love Christopher Meloni, and I also like small, often ignored films. <br /> <br /> This is such a treasure! Meloni has such a charm in this part. Easily pigeonhole it, because you see it as your alter ego Elliot Stablera (LOSVU). In this movie, Meloni is a life-unrelated middleman who strikes skids in many ways, just to find a way to happiness in someone unexpected. and Tim Busfield's character is realistic and it's not over. I have not seen Busfield for 30 years and had fun. But that was the whole Chris movie. I've become such a fan again. <br /> <br /> At the beginning is a little slow, I admit. I thought that some "flashbacks" could have been edited. But in general, this movie will delight you - a man or a woman - because it has an honest, refreshing view of today's relationships.
