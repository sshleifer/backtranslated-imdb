It was a great presentation. Hemo (blood) as a Greek god was playing animation with vanity, arrogance, snobbish superiority and an innocent miracle. Quote (or scene), which I remember vividly, is that when Hemo gets tired of "all this installation ... you have not learned my secrets at all" and threatens to explode, the scientist responds with one word "Thalassa" - salt water, which scares the writer of fiction, but he relieves Hemo and presents the chemical aspects of blood nicely. <br /> <br /> Such a great mix of entertainment and information makes it a classic as fresh and immersive today as the day it was released. Stimulating interest and imagination is essential for teaching children who love to learn.
