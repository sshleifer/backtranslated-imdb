I am overwhelmed by the work of Jim Carrey. I keep this movie in my head. Grinch likes Martha May, Cindy Lou (who is very annoying, her sweet innocence), who tries to get Grinch in the Christmas spirit, Grinch's childhood (very funny!), And also the weak obvious ending - Christmas is not about gifts. I must say that I felt stupid, leaving the theater with a group of children and small children, laughing and so on, but this movie was a good, full-blown adaptation of the short film by Dr.Suss and IS for all ages.
