First of all, I think that the following commentary is unworthy of such a site. Of course, you have no taste and you do not respect the taste of others. Not to give you a history lesson, but I think you have to do it. Black actors are successful, if not more, they succeed as others. If you are not part of the "Black" race, you can not understand the quality, creativity and dynamics of old films such as "Sparkle" and "Mahogany" and "Cooley High". Since, unfortunately, you are not Black, you do not have the pleasure of feeling what we feel when we watch these classics, so you have to keep your bizarre mouth shut and just stick to your un-dancing race. Thanks.
