A castle in the sky is undoubtedly Hayao Miyazaki. After watching it for the first time, I'm glad that it does not disappoint. On the contrary, you gain the value of your time, which means (in relation to what Miyazaki's films are), it's nothing extraordinary! <br /> <br /> Produced at the beginning of his cinema career, Castle in the Sky predicts a lot of trademarks in his later films, with strong (but young) female characters forced to grow up due to external circumstances, helping by very interesting (and sometimes nice) supporting characters. And, of course, the usual fight of nature with civilization, flying machines (a lot !!), beautiful painted sceneries? but unfortunately there are no pigs (at least I noticed, after all, I only saw it once). Nevertheless, Miyazaki made his debut in the theater two years earlier with the help of Nausica, a rehearsal for Princess Mononoke, his magnum opus. Castle in the Sky is part of the two, with a delicate action packed for the first 30 minutes, reminiscent of his television series Conan, and his directed episodes of Meitantei Holmes. Here we meet Sheeta, a girl who literally falls from the sky to find her, a young boy working in a small mountain town. Intrigued by her amnesia and suspected of a connection between her and the mysterious flying city of Laputa, Pazu is to help her find out where she is from, flee from the army and the gang of air pirates. As the film progresses, the plot becomes more and more interesting, revealing Myiazaki at its best. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is very similar to Spirited Away (or vice versa, because Castle in the sky was produced first) and just like its director, Joe Hisaishi _ kompozytor_ starts with a very light result, it becomes more complex and fits beautifully when the story goes forward! <br /> <br /> Note to English dubbing, with a good interpretation of the two main stars, although Sheeta Anna Paquin has a very thick accent (which the actress still had at this point in her career) and goes to Mark Hamil as Muska, making up delightful but devilish villain! <br /> <br /> Do not miss this one!
