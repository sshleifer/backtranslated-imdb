This is a very interesting project that could be quite brilliant. Meeting 11 outstanding international directors and assigning each of them 11 minutes, 9 seconds and 1 frame to create a chosen segment; each brief overview of the global reverbs of September 11. Without the use of spoilers, I would say that Ken Loach's work is a jewel in the crown, and Mira Nair ("Indie" segment), based on true history, deserves to make a full feature film. One of them is also aware of watching his short film, why Alejandro González Iñárritu is today one of the best directors in the world ?? he is simply a master of the medium who also has a deep understanding of the subject. Unfortunately, not all 11 parts were made. Youssef Chahine, in her segment of "Egypt", accepts the Arab attitude of collective guilt through her own fault, which could potentially be the most interesting. He fails miserably. Short Chahine is poorly written and badly done, at least enough to stand out among the other, better chapters of the movie. Despite the quality imbalance, I would still give the film 7/10 a concept, if not for performance.
