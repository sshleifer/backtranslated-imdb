Anyone who has seen this movie and has seen it badly, I would refer them to the review of this film by Roger Ebert. He is one of the most respected critics in the industry and gave him 3 1/2 stars. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie. Maybe it's not perfect or spectacular, but I liked it. The Chorus line is not a story but a group of stories about the life of Broadway's hope. I read reviews where people said that too much time was wasted on romance between Zach and Cassie. This is a wrong view. This is another story with all the other stories told about every hope of Broadway. People do not realize that those who are Broadway dancers go through the same things that an ordinary person goes through. And I think it's really about the whole program. It is about showing not only the talent of these exceptional dancers, but also about giving us some of the moving things to consider in relation to life in general. It's a study of life as a Broadway star. Anyone who has dreamed of becoming a Broadway star is watching this movie with a great deal of affection because he has gone through exactly what the characters are going through. <br /> <br /> It's a great musical. It has its slow points, and sometimes it is a bit mistaken to walk on certain lines of the story, but I liked it altogether. Take a closer look at the film, and then you can understand what I'm talking about.
