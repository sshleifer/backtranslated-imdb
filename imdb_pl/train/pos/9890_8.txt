Unfortunately, this movie has never been on a DVD. I saw it when it was first released in cinemas in 1983 and then again when VHS was released in 1992. When I recently saw a copy of VHS at the flea market, I bought it immediately. I was not disappointed. First of all, obvious: Claudia Ohana is beautiful and joy comes from it. But the film takes you into an unreal world where you have to think about your values ​​and decide what is really important to you. The film is about many things. It is about how the World Bank and large corporations are using and enslave developing countries with their capitalist programs to force them into debt that they will never be able to repay. It's about how our economic system uses us, forcing us to borrow using credit cards, mortgages and car payments. It's about trying to save innocence, which we may have never really had, and maybe we can not really save. It's about good and evil and how hard it is sometimes to say one thing from another. He raises many questions, but he does not give an answer. I think it is good sometimes. For this reason, it is a movie really worth saving and seeing.
