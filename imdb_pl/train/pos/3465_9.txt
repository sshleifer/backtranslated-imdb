I sat down to watch this movie with anxiety and little hope. I did not think that this film would be able to meet his topic. But absolutely yes, then a bit. First of all, I must say that Jared Harris did an extraordinary job as John Lennon. Sometimes it seemed that Harris was in charge of Lennon. The similarity was often amazing, and he clearly studied Lennon's manners and vocal reflexes. Aiden Quinn was quite good as McCartney, which also had a striking resemblance to Macca, although he occasionally traveled over his accent Scouse. <br /> <br /> This work of fiction was well-written and well-directed. Of course it was pure fantasy, but sometimes I felt like a voyeur peeping through the keyhole during this meeting. The roof stage was particularly moving, because McCartney told Lennon what he had never heard as a child - that he was dignified and important, and that it could not be his fault, that he had been abandoned by his parents. I also liked the park scene, where the couple danced with the absolute abandonment of the reggae band! <br /> <br /> My only complaint would be: I'm not sure John was as pathetic as he was in the movie at this stage of his life. The home situation was quite pleasant and he was actually known as friendly when fans approached him. Only a few years later, he was very friendly when his assassin first asked him for an autograph the day he was murdered. <br /> <br /> Mostly this movie has resumed these feelings about what it may have. Whether John lived a little longer. I'm sure the Beatles would come back together at some stage. I'm sure Lennon and McCartney will still be friends today. <br /> <br /> Bravo, VH1. I will watch it again and again. <br /> <br />
