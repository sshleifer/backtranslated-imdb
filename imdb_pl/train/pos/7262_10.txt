My daughter, her friends and I have watched this movie literally dozens of times. I bought it twice, and some little girls escaped with it. Then I rented it many times. It's just never getting old !!! Blockbuster is no longer on his list and I tried to buy it, find it, rent it for over 5 years. No doubt this was and is my favorite childhood movie of my daughter ... she has it all! We laughed, we cried, we talked about real life and how difficult are some children in the world. Nothing succeeded in this movie. We referred to every second and every line of Bill! I thank the millions for restoring our faith in human nature. Yours sincerely, Shelleen and Kailin Vandermey. Craven, Saskatchewan. CANADA, eh !!! :-) <br /> <br /> August '07 update: <br /> <br /> Who we are to assess whether a rich woman falls in love with a poor man; or a man who has love, chooses to raise a child who is not his own. It may not be mine or your life. This is not only reliable, but it happens every day. Thank God! Keeps my faith in human nature! celebrate!!!!
