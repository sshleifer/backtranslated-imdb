After a short prologue showing a masked man haunting and then slashing an elderly gentleman on an abandoned, urban Australian street, we meet Julie (Rebecca Gibney) and Peter (John Adam) when they go hunting. They manage to get a loan for a fixator on an elegant Sydney street, but it turns out that physical destruction is not the only problem in their new home. It can be haunted. <br /> <br /> 13 Gantry Row combines an unforgettable yet somewhat trite story with Catherine Millar's good or middle direction in a slightly above-average shock. <br /> <br /> The biggest disadvantages seem partly due to the budget, but not completely justified for this obstacle. The key problem appears at the beginning of the movie. The opening "thriller scene" contains several failed editions. Frozen frames and series of photos are used to hide the fact that there are not too many actions. Suspension should be created from staging, not fancy techniques, "fix it in a mix". On the stage there is a great atmosphere from the place, lighting, fog, etc., But the camera should slowly follow the killer and the victim, crossing the back and forth, following the street, showing their growing closeness. Tracking and cutting must be slow. The attack had to be longer, clearer and better blocked. In the current situation, the scene has a strong impression "for television" and low-budget. <br /> <br /> After this scene, we move on to the present and the flow of the film improves significantly. This story has many similarities to The Amityville Horror (1979), although the budget enforces a much more subtle approach. Millar and screenwriter Tony Morphett effectively create many slyly frightening scenarios, often of a dramatic nature, instead of special-effect-oriented ones, such as a mysterious man who comes to collect old iron plates that are strangely attached to the wall. <br /> <br /> For some fans of horror, the first part of the movie can be a bit heavy compared to the realistic drama. At least the first half hour of the film concerns mainly Julie and Peter, who try to organize home financing and then try to settle in it. But Morphett writes a good, intelligent dialogue. The material is performed well enough that it is often as uncertain as the more traditional aspects of the thriller that appear later - especially if you have been through similar difficulties while trying to buy your own home. <br /> <br /> Once they appear Settled and start to be stranger, although special effects often leave much to be desired, ideas are good. Performances help create tension. There is no abundance of death and destruction in the film - there are more abundances of home repair nightmares. But neither the threat is important. <br /> <br /> It's about interpersonal relations. There are many interesting form arcs. Home is more like a metaphor and a catalyst for stress in a romantic relationship that can make it sour and can destroy it. The fact that he is in an elegant neighborhood and that the relationship between two successful yuppies, shows that these problems affect not only those who can blame some external disaster, such as money or health problems. Peter's character evolves from an outgoing corporate employee with "ordinary" work-based friendships to someone who is more desperate when he becomes subversive, intrigued to achieve something more liberating and meaningful. At the same time, we find out how shallow these professional friendships can be. Julie undergoes an almost literal nervous breakdown, but finally he finds liberation when he frees himself from the failure of a romantic relationship. <br /> <br /> Although 13 Gantry Row never quite exceeds his patting television, like a TV movie, it's pretty good, with admirable ambitions. Anyone who likes movies about haunted house, psychological movies or horror movies / thrillers with a bit more metaphorical depth, should find a lot to offer. Certainly, it is not worth spending $ 30 on a DVD (it was the price that my local PBS station asked for a copy of the film after it showed it (factoring in shipping and service costs)), but it is worth renting it, and it is definitely worth watching free.
