Reed Hadley is doing better foppish Don Diego than doing thrilling and bold Zorro, but that makes almost no sense, because this series contains the colorless best song of the series, ever - and the best version of the famous stagecoach Yakima Canutt feat. There are also other good acrobatics and lots of action, as well as a lot of hair ending chapters with clifftop hangers, but if not for another reason, you need to see this movie to watch stagecoach acrobatics and then watch them in slow motion. It's unbelievable, and despite the lower budget for this chapter, Yak does better with this feat than in the much-more-known Stagecoach movie. Indiana Jones, eat your heart: This is a real bargain!
