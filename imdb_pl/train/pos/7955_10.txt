This is one of the largest children's films ever created. I'm crying every time I see Shadow shouting, "Wait, wait for me, Peter!" When the family car leaves. This is a must see if you love animals! The best movie ever! The lines in the movie are sometimes stupid. Just as Sassy talks to Chance; "Cat's Rule and dogs drool!" I could not get around these lines, but when I was six, I'd bet that I loved this line. The plot may seem strange to some, but I like it. Shadow as an older dog who prepares a Chance to take him over when he leaves, really moves when you think about it. It reminded me of my childhood dog. I think everyone can find a piece of themselves in Homeward Bound.
