A modest, subtle and thin film "Man in a White Suit" is another breath of fresh air in the film format from the Ealing study. Although I suspect that some modern viewers may initially find it unclear, I doubt that many will be enchanted by the expert approach of the story, the themes and characters are lazily conveyed during the course of the film. <br /> <br /> The truly wonderful Alec Guinness presents another great characterization of the film, which may not be as obvious a virtuoso as inspired by Ealing's "Kind Hearts and Coronets" from 1949. This time he plays only one character, not eight, but as an unearthly inventor and scientist Sidney Stratton, he always finds the right tone and expression. Along with the subtle, expressive performance of Guinness, the rest of the cast is effective. Among the main players, Cecil Parker and Ernest Thesiger stand out. Thesiger is extremely absurd, like a paralyzed but influential entrepreneur, while Parker is reliable as an ineffective but key owner and father of the mill. Father, I mean Joan Greenwood, a cleverly cute comic actress who is on her unbeatable summit in this film. Dazzling and seductive in terms of aspect and diction, in this film is quite sublime, a great contrast with the equally unusual, but more maltroist guinness. The scene in which he is trying to tempt him is played so skillfully by a couple that he is both deeply moving and funny ... The themes are treated very effectively, without easy morality. The complexity of the relationship between science, business and workforce is thoroughly and pleasantly studied. Experimented by Alexander Mackendrick, this film is technically proficient in all areas; suggestive photography, matched sound effects and music, and a wistful scenario, everything quietly impresses. A fully satisfying film in which Guinness and Greenwood are great. <br /> <br /> Rating: - **** 1/2 / *****
