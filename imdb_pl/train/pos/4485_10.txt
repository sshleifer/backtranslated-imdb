This is my favorite of older Tom & Jerry cartoons from the early 1940s. The original version from Mammy Two Shoes is included in the Tom & Jerry Spotlight Collection 2, the first album, and presents a great detailed animation of early cartoons. Gags are not crazy about Avery, but more subtle and directed to anyone who's ever slept late watching scary movies (or radio programs)! Tom listens to a terrifying radio show, and Jerry decides to play some tricks to scare him. Nine live kneels are well done here and I do not know how many times I tried to make a vacuum and a sheet that was terrible when I was a kid. When the owner of Tom is awakened by confusion - Mammy was NOT a maid, it was HIS house - she gets one surprise with a big laugh. Prepare your pause button, it's worth it!
