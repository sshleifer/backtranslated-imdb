Collecting old stories is a challenge for the production team, how you can upgrade this classic character and make it interesting enough to capture new audiences and stimulate memories from the old audience. In my opinion, their mission has been implemented. Must see for young children, teens, teenagers and their parents. OK, there are some terrifying moments that are solved in a short time, but parents with small children should sit still, the movie goes to better things. I intend to follow these insightful reviewers who emphasize that Emma Roberts provides us with a positive role model for young women, and is not a syrup for that reason. Nancy balances her femininity with a mental career. It laughs a lot of things that can not be taken too seriously, the real mystery to be solved (one that you can imagine as an extra bonus, and nice characters.) In my opinion, Nancy Drew even makes a good movie with a date.
