I thought it was an absolutely charming movie focusing on the life of the character Mary-Kate and Ashley Sam and Emma Stanton! They both try to make themselves and their parents happy, but; Unfortunately, it simply is not that easy! I thought it was a charming and sweet movie, and if you're a real fan of these wonderful young ladies, I'm sure you'll agree with me here! If you have not seen this movie yet, I say that you really missed it; great time and you should definitely take some time to see it now! This movie is a real winner! Yours sincerely, Rick Morris
