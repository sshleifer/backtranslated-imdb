This program is worth watching. He has the best cast of talent I've seen in a very long time. The premise of the series is unique and fresh (I think the ABC directors are not used too often because it was not another reality show). However, this program was credible thanks to nice characters and wonderful storylines. I'm probably not in the age group I'm expecting, like in my forties, but many of my friends also loved it (late 30's - mid-1940's) and die because of high-quality programs with talented cast members. I do not think this concert has enough time to win the audience. I believe that taking into account more time, this show would be very successful. Once again, ABC does not give real potential to a show with real potential. With so many shows, the chance for a chance and almost not worth it! They must give the quality of the shows real chance and time to really click and win the audience. I really loved characters and could not wait to watch each episode. I watched episodes on ABC films, and the series was getting better and better. Although I think they owe us one more episode (number 13?). We want to watch what we can! Bomb ABC using emails and letters and see if it is possible to save this show from extinction. It certainly worked for Jerico. Some things are worth saving and this program is definitely one of them.
