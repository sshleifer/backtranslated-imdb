I remember this concert because it became a regular watch on a Saturday evening. <br /> <br /> Sabrina is a young girl who introduces herself to her aunts, which turns out to be witches, and she is one. So Sabrina must learn to control the powers and use them effectively. He must also deal with the school of a nasty rival named Libby, her best friend and boyfriend Harvey Kinkle ... <br /> <br /> The show was fun and funny. He kept Saturday evenings entertaining for a 10-year-old boy ... and made him laugh ... And flirt with 'Libby' ....
