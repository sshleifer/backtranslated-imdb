It is interesting how the research turn can take place. I began to look at the article about "Gates" Cristo in Central Park. The article states that Maysles have been filmographers of Cristo for years. Hmmm ... Then I looked at their work. I believe that one of them has gone through, but the other one still turns Cristo and Jean Claude on their stages of creation. The Gray Gardens sounded very interesting. Video Station, in Boulder CO, is a place where you can look unclear or unconventional and of course have them in stock. DVD and VHS. Edith and Edie are women who have lived in the past and oh what a great past it was. Edith was wealthy, she was born as Bouvier, she got married well, she had some great relationships and she became a singer in her forties. Her daughter Edie was a d√©butante, a model and she had a lot of beau. She never married, and at some point in her thirties she came home to regain her strength. He seems to have some nervous disorders. You are worried too much about things. But this is only the shadow of the world in which they live, because Jackie O. came and created a place so that her aunt and cousin would not be evicted. It is a two-room residence, which is worn and destroyed. But in the film you will notice fresh paint on the walls. If you look closely at the newspaper clippings, you'll see that it was a very dirty mess. The outfits that Edie makes up are very clever and creative. The viewer has the impression that Edith likes to walk naked, but she is not in the movie. Edith was really beautiful and you can still see the shadow of her beauty when she sings "Tea for Two". Edie was also beautiful in her day and pretty attractive at 56. It was a good movie, though not for everyone. When a cat urinates with a portrait of Edith, he says: "at least someone does what they want"!
