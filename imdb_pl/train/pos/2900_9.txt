If it was an American movie, I would rate it at 7: we've seen it before. Being this Argentine film and being myself an Argentine, I would like to give him 10, because this is the kind of quality that I expected, rather than expectation. This great quality is amazing, taking into account all the constraints imposed by the third world ... <br /> <br /> I can not forget the scene where Díaz forces Silverstein's fiancé to admit - you know what I mean if you see a movie . I think that this is the key moment of the film, maybe not surprising, but original. Then the real action begins. <br /> <br /> Before watching the movie I always try to collect some previous information. Being the mainstream, satirical, commercial, I press "Play" and suspend reality and logic, I would say that the best state of mind allows you to enjoy such movies. It is impossible to discuss the credibility of the entire story, but it is somewhat reliable. As far as I am concerned, I could not stop laughing at every joke and commentary - "little sauce" ("you're mean") ... put in the mouth of Díaz, the biggest one. <br /> <br /> I'm rather tired watching movies "intended for" Peretti. I know he is a great actor, but sometimes I feel that his roles unfairly opaque the rest, the role of Luis Luque in this case. I do not like Argentine TV, so I have not seen much work with Luque, but it's obvious that he is a great performer. His physical role, his looks, his attitude in this film made me fall in love with his performance. I think his role should require modernization to show us how great it can be! <br /> <br /> I do not know if Szifrón plans to do a sequel or not. I know he will not do it if he follows the rule that "the other parts have never been good", so if he does, I will see him. And I hope that in the future we will consider the possibility of providing Peretti partners with the same opportunities to develop their roles. <br /> <br /> A great movie, great performances and lots of laughter!
