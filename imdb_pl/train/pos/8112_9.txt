The geniuses William Cameron Menzies and Herbert George Wells create this remarkable film with expectations whose ambitions and scope are difficult to find today. They anticipate the Second World War and the way of attacking Great Britain, as well as the fact that after the war there will be a space race. They change the time; in the film war and space exploration are much longer, but there are so many qualitatively correct things that it is amazing. We even see a helicopter (the film is older than them). <br /> <br /> Unforgettable gigantic planes and futuristic meritocracy of scientists who seem to be Romans with bubble helmets: if you can see these funny costumes, you can appreciate the state of architecture of the art of the 30s masters, the vision of a rationalist society, interesting reflections on the nature of power and John Cabal as the archetype of a bold and resourceful man who chooses the shape of reality rather than being shaped by him. <br /> <br /> 9 1/2 of 10. Inspiring like the last monologue of John Cabal.
