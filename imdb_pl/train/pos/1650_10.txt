An excellent series, masterfully played and directed, but unloved (as I was told) by Mr. Deighton and withdrawn by him after one presentation. Currently, it is available only in private collections and through the British Film Institute on special request. Very unfortunate, because the nuances of Ian Holm in the form of tired but determined Bernard Samson are wonderful; one of his best performances. Supporting cast, including young Amanda Donohoe and Hugh Fraser, are great. With Melem Mart playing a conflicting and traitorous wife, and Michael Degen as Mercenary Werner, history has a positive effect on the tragic and fatal personal consequences of the great game.
