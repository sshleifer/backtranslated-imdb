I just saw this movie for the first time and liked it. Her dance was very funny. I read somewhere that she got a role in this film because she knew how to dance. The scenery was great too. Yvonne is such a talented and beautiful woman. We were laughing at stupid kissing scenes, but it's great in old movies! I grew up with her at The Munsters and I enjoy watching her in earlier movies. Not everyone can be the best there, but it's still worth watching to see and sing. I slowly buy all of her movies and watch them when I pick them up. I have a large collection of her souvenirs.
