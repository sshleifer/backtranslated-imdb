Not for people without a quick mind or without a drop of Balkan blood in their veins. If you do not have any of them, you can not understand. And if you do not understand, you can not enjoy it. :) For example, if you think Picasso is the name of a car made by Citroen, probably if you see a Picasso picture, you'll just walk past it, deciding it's a nightmare of some street painter. :) So do not judge before you try to understand it :) In the end I think it MUST be for everyone with open minds. Still my N1 remains The Shawshank Redemption! And remember that not all things can be put in frames. Because there are things in this world, no frame just fits.
