I remember seeing this movie years ago, I think, BBC2. I would love to see him again - does anyone know how I can get a copy? As I remember, it was a particularly powerful film, in particular the distinctive stage is horses in gas masks. Besides, I really can not remember that story too much - that's why I want to watch it again! I have entered the network, but I can not find a copy, which is unusual in my experience - maybe there is no DVD or VHS of the movie on the market. He will be grateful for any help anyone can help me with this. Thank you in advance for your help. Best regards, Albany234@googlemail.com
