I, like many horror fans, have been feeding me with the same banal, large budget remixes in Hollywood and MTV school flutes for the last 20 years. In the end, it is an original movie of the horror genre that meets all the relevant requirements. <br /> <br /> You want a hot leading actress, you want vampires, you want cool weapons, you want cool vehicles and you want blood, a lot, thanks to the load of the bucket - you get it. <br /> <br /> Thanks to the excellent choreography of the fight and the supporting role of the Queen of Hammers, Stephanie Beacham, these are really fantastic things. <br /> <br /> Despite the low budget, choosing the option of 35 mm and adding high-quality CG effects to the mix, director James Eaves created something that seems much bigger. <br /> <br /> The Necessity of the Old Horror Fans.
