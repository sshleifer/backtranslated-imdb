All Dogs Go to Heaven is playing the dog underworld. Film is a joy for children with a comical and dark, but satisfying and happy story with lots of songs and dancing. Includes an outcast of Charlie, another dog criminal who is murdered, but returns from the dead. He meets a homeless human girl who looks at him and thanks to this relationship he realizes the meaning of life and sacrifice. This is a lovely animation that is loved by my eyes as a child. I highly recommend this film to children. I'm not sure how adults will react to it. (I tried to watch it a few years ago on VHS, but these recordings do not last long, right?)
