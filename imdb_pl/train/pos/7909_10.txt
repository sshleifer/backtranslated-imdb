When it came out first, my dad brought him home - we were surprised - it was so different from anything we've seen before. I was looking for a specific movie last night and found "The Mind's Eye" again. The box is falling apart and I'm surprised that the tape is still working! Although it is not "finding quality Nemo", it is still very good. They should sell it again - it's the hallmark of computer animation. I would highly recommend! <br /> <br /> Here's what it is: <br /> <br /> "Eye of Mind" is a spectacular odyssey in time. Your journey begins at the dawn of creation and passes through human development and technology. Travel to the world of abstraction and further into the future thanks to the breathtaking images of computer animation. <br /> <br /> "Eye of Mind" connects the imagination of over 300 of the most talented computer animation artists with a powerful, original music soundtrack. This unique collaboration will take you on an amazing journey to "The Mind's Eye".
