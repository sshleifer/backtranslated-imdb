If you like CB4, you have no idea what is missing if you have not seen this video yet. This movie is crazy funny and contains much more about the hip-hop industry than any other movie of parody ... It's a pity that this movie was not released on DVD, because it's one movie that everyone watched and loved copies. If you really want to laugh and you like hip hop and you're a bit familiar with some of the old school performers, definitely rent this movie. There are not many places to rent movies that have their copies, but if you come across such a place, you will not be disappointed.
