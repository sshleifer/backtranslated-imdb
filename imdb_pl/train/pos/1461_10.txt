The film reveals the glaring exploitation of a Chinese worker - generally women - collecting film footage from a Chinese company owner who shares his shameless delusional point of view, his American counterpart also as without shame and delusion, oppressed workers who receive voice and drunk Americans who wear necklaces with beads thoughtlessly celebrating in New Orleans. <br /> <br /> A ray of hope appears when some Americans are really outraged that people who make their beaded necklaces earn $ 0.10 per hour. You also have the impression that employees may have a chance to escape from work in the bead factory, but they will probably do it if they have enough criminal treatment popular with the factory owner and / or simply be too tired to work up to 20 hours a day of hard work. <br /> <br /> I wondered where these necklaces came from, not realizing how exhaustive and tedious it would be to make them. I really appreciate this film because it beautifully depicts the influence that American indulgence has on what we consider relatively harmless in our society on people on the other side of the world. An award for Wal-Mart. It is simply amazing. And clearly, just the tip of the iceberg!
