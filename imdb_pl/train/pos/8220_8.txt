The fourth in the "Dirty Harry" series contains one of the vilest, ugliest, unlikely, blasphemous, disgusting women I've ever seen in the movie: "Ray Perkins," played by Audrie Neenan. It is a modern, nasty version of "Detour" from 1945. "Ann Savage". <br /> <br /> Her disgusting lips and attitude have discouraged me so much that I never watched this movie until I acquired a filter of profanity that closes it ... or at least some of it! Then I could enjoy the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Wherever "Harry Callahan" (Clint Eastwood) goes, violence occurs immediately ... within minutes! It happens so often that it is almost fun, but it makes the fast-changing entertainment movie have a satisfying ending, because all villains are eliminated one by one. <br /> <br /> It's a very sophisticated movie that appeals to our base instincts ..... and links, sad to say. Most of us like to see these dirty balls in the end and who better than Dirty Harry?
