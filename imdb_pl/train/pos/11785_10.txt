I do not quite know how to explain "Darkend Room" because, to sum up, it would not be justice. This is the quintessence of Lynchian's short film with two beautiful girls in a strange, mysterious situation. I would say that this short is definitely more at the end of the Lynchian show "Mulholland Drive" as opposed to "The Elephant Man" or "The Straight Story". It is hidden on the Lynch website and is worth looking for.
