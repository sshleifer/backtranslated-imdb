*** 1/2 Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinnear, Hope Davis, Adam Scott, and Philip Baker Hall. Director: Richard Shepard. <br /> <br /> Well-formulated story and film together, Brosnan has never been better in the film role except Bond. After 2004, "After sunset," his latest role brings laughter and a great time. A professional hitman, so to speak, Julian Noble at work in Mexico City ends the meeting with the exact opposite of himself business man Danny Wright (Kinnear, probably one of his best roles) also in business. The two on the screen produce a comically charged, laughing riot and can not help laughing. Davis in one of his best roles since "American Splendor" gives another charming and witty performance. One of the most enjoyable and best movies of the years. My final rating 9/10
