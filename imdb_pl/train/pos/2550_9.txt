This is really one of the "Golden Age" of Hollywood, such as they no longer do. This is a unique, fun movie that lets you guess what will happen next. <br /> <br /> All the actors are perfectly manned and they are all great supporting actors. This is the first movie I've seen with Ronald Colman and I've been a fan since then. Reginald Gardiner has always been my favorite supporting actor and adds a certain quality to every movie in which she is located. Although he played a different character here, he still added something to the movie, which another actor in this form had not added.
