FLAVIA THE HERETIC is a strange entry in the nunsploit genre - sleaze with equal parts, feminist journey and "history" when we follow Flavia in her strange journey. <br /> <br /> We start with Flavia in the monastery. he is not too happy there because he does not believe in all the male-dominated "rules" and the macho-ismum of the world around him, and he escapes from the monastery with his Jewish friend Abraham. They were eventually caught, and Flavia was brought back to the monastery, where she joins another "unbelieving" nun, speeding up the Muslim invasion. Flavia meets with Muslims who take over the monastery and become "busy" nuns in a strange set of scenes. Ultimately, Muslims and Flavia are punished as a traitor to Christianity in another extremely brutal scene ... <br /> <br /> This one has almost all the things that I like to watch in a movie that uses the '70s - a bit of a good gore, including the removal of warts nipple, and a nice scene with skin on the legs, a bit of decent nakedness - including the necessary full frontal and decent plot. I will say that it stretched a bit in a few points, but not enough to really be bored. I strongly recommend this fans of the nunsploit / 70's exploits ... 8/10
