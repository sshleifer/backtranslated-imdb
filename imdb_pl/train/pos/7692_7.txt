First of all, I will give my assessment for the whole series; ******* 7 out of 10 stars. I took three for a slide, which this series suffered after the departure of John Amos. Do not get me wrong, there were heavy episodes of strokes later, but only after Esther Rolle left for the season and return. <br /> <br /> In February 1974, the premiere of a great sitcom (with dramatic accents) by CBS. It was the first TV show about an African-American family living in Chicago Projects in the '70s. Created by Norman Lear as a "Maude" spin-off, he once again hit the right chord of viewers. <br /> <br /> Since then, I have not seen a situation comedy direct about the struggles of families from cities. (Well, in 1994, there was "South Central" Fox, but it was not renewed.) <br /> <br /> John Amos as James Evans Sr. he was the father's highest figure for this family and he acted as every father of his family should do together and his children would go down the wrong path of life. <br /> <br /> Esther Rolle was a wonderful, non-sensual mother figure who was on the same page as her husband when it came to raising their children. <br /> <br /> Ralph Carter as Michael a young but very smart young man of his age, but stuck in a school system that does not meet his academic needs. The name of his character is the same as the founder of the series Mike Evans, who was Lionel Jefferson in The Jeffersons. (Mike Evans died in December 2006). <br /> <br /> Thelma is a young girl aged 16 or 17 and has to deal with the dangers of being a young woman in the streets of the ghetto. Jimmie Walker as J.J. Evans Jr. he is a typical young youth who can not take life seriously. <br /> <br /> Simply put, all my favorite episodes are with John Amos, except for Penny, feature lines by Gordon / Janet Jackson. <br /> <br /> After the fall of the character of James Evans, the series lost their stability and the viewers left. Esther Rolle left for the whole year, not wanting to play the violin in JJ's intelligent "Dyno-mite"! <br /> <br /> She returned the next season, after getting a guarantee that the writer would be leveled out. Florida's neighbor, Wilona Woods, was a divorced woman who adopted the adoption of a tiny girl named Penny Gordon (played by Janet Jackson, 10). Offspring mother Penny played Totie Fields, mother Kim Fields. <br /> <br /> In August 1979, the series ended and all projects left a better life. JJ, the artist sold the idea to the comics company, Michael went to campus in college. <br /> <br /> Wilona and Penny, Thelma's husband and footballer, Keith + Florida, moved to the same building in uptown Chicago. Not the most realistic ending, but until then it did not matter.
