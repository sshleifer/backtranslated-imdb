"Pickup On South Street" is a high speed drama about a small criminal who suddenly becomes involved in the activities of a group of communists. The action is presented in a very direct and dynamic style, and the momentum is maintained thanks to a great edition. The use of a wide range of different camera angles and effective close-ups also contributes to the overall impression of continuous movement and vitality. Director's style of Samuel Fuller and photos of Joseph MacDonald are excellent and there are many scenes that thanks to their composition and lighting give a strong sense of mood and atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Pickpocket Ace and repeat offspring Skip McCoy (Richard Widmark) gets into deep water when he steals the wallet of a young woman named Candy (Jean Peters) on the New York subway. The former boy Joey (Richard Kiley) used it to deliver to one of his contacts in the communist organization and he was not known to her, she had the secrets of the American government written on microfilm. Two FBI agents followed Candy and witnessed the theft. One of the agents drags her back to Joey's apartment, and the other, Zara (Willis Bouchey), visits the police captain Dan Tiger (Murvyn Vye). Zara explains that the FBI has been tracking Candy for several months as part of the pursuit of the communist group leader. <br /> <br /> To identify a pickpocket, Tiger calls a "stool" called Moe (Thelma Ritter) who, after receiving a detailed description of the "cannon" method, draws up a list of eight possible suspects. When Tiger sees the name of Skip on the list, he is immediately convinced that he is a man they must track down and sends two detectives to arrest him. When Skip is brought into Tiger's office, Zara tells him about the microfilm, and Tiger suggests that he drop any fees if he cooperates in the investigation. Skip is nonchalant and arrogant. He clearly does not trust Tiger and denies all knowledge of the theft in the subway. <br /> <br /> Joey tells Candy to find out who stole the microfilm and then regains it. Candy pays Maybe for Skip's address, and when Skip returns from questioning by Tiger, finds Candy by searching his home and knocking her unconscious before stealing her money. When he recovers, Skip demands $ 25,000 for the microfilm. He tells Joey about Skip's request, and Joey's boss gives him a gun and orders him to retrieve the microfilm the next evening. <br /> <br /> Skip and Candy are attracted to each other and it is because of their restless, developing relationship that the means by which they can shake off the police are evolving. Soon, however, it becomes clear that solving problems with the communist gang will only be achieved through more direct action. <br /> <br /> The performances of Skip, Candy and Moe as heroes living in a dingy world, where they are forced to face serious threats every day are powerful and convincing. <br /> <br /> Moe's job as a police informer depends on her knowledge of the people in her community, but also those people who know what makes them can take revenge at any moment. It seems to be crafty and streety, but it also has its sensitive side because it describes itself as an "old clock running down" and saves money to be able to decently bury yourself in the exclusive Long Island cemetery. Her belief that "every goat has its own meaning" leads her to sell all information regardless of danger, friendships or rules, and yet there is one occasion when she refuses, and it turns out to be fatal. Thelmy Ritter's performance certainly deserved the Oscar nomination she won for her role. <br /> <br /> Skip is a violent criminal who does not care about his victims and has already been convicted three times, lives under constant threat of being detained for his life if he is convicted again. Nevertheless, he continues his criminal activity and, oddly enough, is only philosophical when Moe reveals his whereabouts, and then even assures Moe will receive the kind of burial he so highly valued. Candy is a former prostitute, and someone who constantly exposes her to danger, but behind her hardened outer surface, becomes more and more visible. Widmark and Peters are perfectly suited to their roles and, like Ritter, present different aspects of their personality with great style and conviction.
