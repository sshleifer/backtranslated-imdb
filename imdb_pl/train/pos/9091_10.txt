Fantastic movie. With everything you could want in the movie. Huge battle scenes and many other actions. Suspension and romantic love story. <br /> <br /> A bit like an old movie with swirls. Completely fun from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> Editing was fast and you never get bored for a second. History is like a classic tale of troubles in the Royal Farm. The actors are beautiful and the sets are wonderful. The costumes are spectacular and stunt work is ingenious. Special effects are also amazing. <br /> <br /> Gary Stretch is really impressive as an actor and great to watch. It looks like a sure bet for Super Stardom. <br /> <br /> John Rhys-Davies is wonderful as usual. He is one of the great actors of our time. <br /> <br /> And Cindy Burbridge, Ex Miss Thailand is perfect and perfect for a leading lady, she even makes an English accent with amazing success. <br /> <br /> I learned that the film has won many awards and I can see why. <br /> <br /> In total, this is an amazing independent movie. See it for sure. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it. And give him TEN + !!!
