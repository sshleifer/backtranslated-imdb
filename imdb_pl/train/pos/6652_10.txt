I saw the movie and I really could not hold back my tears. His tragedy is that India does not have such leaders after freedom who dare to give justice to their children when they do not behave properly. In the current generation, politicians bring their children into politics without measuring their caliber and skills. I remember Gandhi's dialogue: "What kind of society do we want to create / create with such people (about Haril)?" No wonder it will be a dream that India will hardly have such a leader in this or the next generation. Einstein was right to say about Gandhi, "After 50 years, it would be difficult to believe such a person with body, soul and mind (Mahatma Gandhi) ever lived on this earth. I wish THANK ANYA kapoor, Feroze khan and all film actors / actresses for this wonderful film about a great person and a relationship with my son. All father and son should watch this movie once and take lessons for both roles.
