Have you ever wanted to escape from boring and stressful life at school or work and embark on your own magical adventure with one of your closest friends, standing alongside all kinds of dangers and villains and discovering the mystery of a lost civilization waiting for someone to discover all her secrets? Even if you are not a fan of fantasy, have you ever wanted to simply experience what it's like to be a child and not have care in the world for just a few hours? <br /> <br /> That's exactly what Miyazaki's 'Castle of Heaven' is all about. Pazu, a young but very brave and ambitious engineer, lives in a village life in a mining town, until one day a girl named Sheeta falls like an angel from heaven and takes him on a journey far beyond the clouds, while all the time they have hot pirates and individuals military. Simply put, it is simply an amazing adventure that every child dreams about, and I can not help but feel that my worries melt away every time I see it. <br /> <br /> As this is one of Miyazaki's older works and takes up a lot of space in the everyday world, the film is not as spectacular visually or deeply in its plot as Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle, and even Princess Mononoke. Still, it's hard for me to say that any of these films are better than the other, because all three of these films are at one point mystical to such an extent that they are enigmatic, if not embarrassing, especially for the youngest viewers. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, "Castle in the Sky" does not try to be any allegory, nor is it a story of puberty; it is rather one of the best representations of the interior of the child's mind I have ever seen. The graphics are not only beautiful, but the use of perspective from children's eyes is simply amazing; regardless of whether it is a "camera" panning to see huge trees or clouds overhead, or an incredible sense of altitude from looking at the earth or the ocean, while hundreds of feet in the air, I just can not help but FEEL I am with Pazu and Sheeta, just a child from another world, far from reality. <br /> <br /> Even the children themselves do not have complex relationships that suggest the need for hope, like Ashitaka / San or Chihiro / Haku; Sheeta is an angel from Pazu, who one day fell into his life from heaven, an absolutely perfect person from the very beginning. As the film progresses, more and more of their true, courageous childhood spirit appears thanks to pleasant words and beautifully realistic facial expressions. Not only are they a charming reminder of who I was, but their endearing friendship never goes down in the whole film, and it becomes stronger and stronger until the last frame. That's why I fell in love with these two more than any other Miyazaki pair. <br /> <br /> At the same time, "Castle in the Sky" is such an easily accessible movie because no matter what kind of ordinary film-goer you are, you will definitely find your patch here. Mystery, action, drama, comedy, suspense, science fiction, romance, even western ... it's all here, almost everything that people go to movies (except maybe a horror movie). That is why I can easily recommend him as Miyazaki's first film; is perfect for those who have no expectations that they have already seen the incredible unearthness of some of his latest songs. <br /> <br /> Even the final song of the film, translated into English, gives a sense of longing for the discovery of some lost civilization and a kind of soul mate who can not be found in our daily lives. "I miss many lights because you are in one of them ... The earth is turning, carrying you, carrying us both who will surely meet." Miyazaki has always provided poetic lyrics for making songs from the great scores of Joe Hiasashi, but it's the only one I've seen, both a moving love song and an inspiring dream. I just found myself close to tears, listening to him. <br /> <br /> "Castle in the Sky" is perhaps not the most developed, spectacular or significant work of Miyazaki, but it is absolutely perfect for what it really was: a real vision of children's fantasies and a great escape from reality for all adults who want to have the same great imagination they had when they were just carefree young children. Sit back, relax and love what it is.
