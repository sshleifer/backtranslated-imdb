Greetings from the dark again. Insight into the mind and motivation of a wonderful artist. How strange it is for most of us to see someone who MUST work ... regardless of the conditions, otherwise his reason for life ceases. Seeing Goldsworthy's sculptures that come alive and see his reaction to each of them are extremely warlike. This artist creates because he must - not for money or fame. It's his life force. When you see his failures, the energy seems to be expelled from his body like a hot air balloon blast. It is not the fear of restarting just because it draws energy from its work. Watching his creation just to take over nature and remember that his work is a bit painful, but still breathtaking. He discusses flow and time in a minimal dialog window and it seems that there is no doubt that the artist and the earth are one in the same. When he says he needs land, but he does not need it ... I am begging you to differ. The only complaint is that the score seems to slow down the pace that is relaxing at best.
