I watched SHORE LEAVE one day. I've seen it so many times and I never get tired of it. Oddly enough, every time I watch him last time, I go back to the first time I saw him. This time. It must be a sense of mystery and "what's going on here?" About it. <br /> <br /> Strangely, one part of the story that ALWAYS seemed uncomfortable and uncomfortable to me, this time had a huge impact on me ... Ruth. I think that a lot is the result of Gerald Fried. It's a real masterpiece! The romantic section has been re-used - much wider - in THIS SITE OF PARADISE. But of course he made his debut here. I have the impression that of all the girls that Kirk had known over the years, she could have been the "sweetest". When she said, "Do you have to go?" In combination with music, I really felt the pain she must have felt, unable to stop it. <br /> <br /> Someone commented that Ruth looked older than him, and yet she should not have matured for 15 years. What makes me think ... MAY, she was one of the teachers at the academy. Kirk was having an affair with an older woman! (Perhaps he returned to this in "MIRI" when Janice said: "I never engage in older women." Maybe he meant "... already." <br /> <br /> Reading ST reviews the second day, I see where somebody was comparing WHAT ARE SMALL GIRLS DONE WITH A MUDDH, but it seems that SHORE LEAVE should be there too, to "The Old Ones" from the previous episode? Whoever it is, it seems to be one of the RARE cases in ST in which you have a race that is actually "better" than ordinary thinking. Yeoman Barrows seems to be doing so for Yeoman Rand. Considering how much attention Dr. McCoy devoted to her, this is just one a frustrating example of a potentially good character that appears once and then does not appear anymore! /> <br /> One of the last few that I saw when he sneaked in was missing, Spock smiled, he was! I saw him, I really prefer to know that there are two sides to h I go inside all the time, not this "submerged" business. When he said, "Enjoy, sir." at the beginning it was obvious that it was not just a speech to the superior, but to talk with a friend. And finally, when he unnecessarily says, "Completely illogical!", I can not help thinking that he is doing it only to trigger a reaction. He may not smile or laugh, but I think he likes when his companions around him are happy.
