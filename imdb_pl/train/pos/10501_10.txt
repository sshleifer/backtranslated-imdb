Super Mario 64 is undoubtedly the best game ever created. It's so addictive that you can play for hours without interrupting your work. I defeated the game 4 times, but I never got all 120 stars ... (I got 111) ... but I hope that I will finally achieve them. Although I did not officially play this game until the age of seven, I loved watching my sisters. Now I'm 13 and I'm still playing, deleting games and starting again. <br /> <br /> The graphics are unbelievable for the early N64 game. The game is addictive. The controls are great. Levels are difficult but not impossible. Bowser's fights are difficult. <br /> <br /> I would like to tell you more, but why do not you just get it for yourself? Put down X-BOX 360, PS3 and Wii and find yourself Nintendo 64 and play this amazing, great game.
