History: On the island of Texel, photographer Bob, who is doing a photo shoot to the warehouse, meets the mysterious Kathleen. Her free spirit and lust for life intrigues Bob who has previously experienced very traumatic experiences. Her life is not as easy as it seems. Thanks to Kathleen, Bob entangles himself into a dangerous network. Will Kathleen be able to win his trust? <br /> <br /> Review: The dialogue in this film is very natural, and the story develops nicely, although it remains a little on the surface and it would be nice if the form of 'psychology' would be developed a little more. Why do these people do what they do? What motivates their choices? This is what gives you film depth and something to think about. History never reaches an emotional climax, even though the characters pass enough to justify it. So you do not recognize characters at this deeper level. The actors do a good job and play in a very natural and "credible" manner, but I think it would be better if the film was played by a younger actress because the naivete of this character does not work well for an adult woman. Working with the camera is nice and there are some great pictures of nature on the island. I give film 7/10.
