Paul (Jason Lee) is an inexperienced one who is engaged to an A-type princess named Karen (Selma Blair). He chooses his clothes and his daily schedule. At his bachelor party, Paul gets a bit too drunk and somehow ends up taking a nice dancer named Becky (Julia Stiles) for his dig. "Nothing has happened," they say, but the duo wakes up in the same bed. Suddenly, Karen's phones. He is on his way to Paul's apartment. Understandably, Paul brings Becky out of the way, although her panties are left behind. But we have even more fun ahead of us. During a family dinner at her parents' home, Karen Paul strikes Becky again, learning that she is Karen's cousin. Discuss some explanations! But instead, Paul decides to pretend to be a stomach problem and hides in the bathroom. Will Karen know that Becky spent the night with Pawe≈Ç? And what are the consequences? I am sorry about the critics who make such films. They should definitely brighten up because this movie is fresh and funny. Of course, it does not hurt that Lee is a consummate funny man, Stiles is a charming beauty or that Blair is natural, how pretty, but anal fiancee. The rest of the cast, including James Brolin and Julie Haggerty, are also pretty good. The look of the movie is great, as are the costumes and settings of California. Most importantly, the script is ingenious and inspired, creating big laughter for the audience. In short, if you want to tickle the proverbial funny bones, get this movie tonight. It may not be an Oscar material, but it is absolutely guaranteed that a bad day will be good.
