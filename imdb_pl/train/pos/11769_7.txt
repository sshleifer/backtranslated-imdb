I bought this movie a few days ago and thought it would be a pretty shitty movie. But when I put it in the DVD player, it surprised me in a very good way. James Belushi plays very well as Bill "The Mouth" Manuccie. But especially Timothy Dalton plays very well as a sheriff. The "final" scene in Bill's house is very perfect, good camera work, nice dialogues and a very good game. Bill "The Mouth" Manufcie stole $ 12 million from the mafia. He and his wife live in South Carolina in a witness protection program. But the mafia follows him and wants $ 12 million. Bill can trust only the person he knows with his own eyes.
