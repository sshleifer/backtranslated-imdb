This is a strange film for me because after reviewing the nice film of the new filmmaker (DALEKO Phila Muccie), another writer / director, Ryan Jafri, contacted me and asked me to watch and review his film THE CURE. I usually do not review movies this way, but what the hell - I love shorts and I could not wait to see another one. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, as it turned out, I liked THE CURE, I was unhappy about it and let Jafri know. In his favor, he encouraged me to go through it anyway - giving him a sincere appreciation. <br /> <br /> The film has a huge style and when it comes to directing Jafri, it is unique - especially for such an inexperienced film creator (this is his first movie). The combination of unique choices of color, stimulation and music that fit the film well creates a great sense of atmosphere. You're really caught up in the movie and it's the merit of making a movie. However, I did not like writing. While the basic idea was great, the ending was too easy to predict. I would really love the ending if it was more of a surprise or an unexpected turn of events. However, considering that this film comes from someone who should not be able to make such a professional film, considering his experience, bodes well for his future. Good job.
