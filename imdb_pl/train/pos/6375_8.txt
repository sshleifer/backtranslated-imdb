While I have great respect for Disney animated films, lately they were not really what I called them "must see". Atlantis looked intriguing with the first poster and trailer of the film and, fortunately, met my expectations. <br /> <br /> Atlantis is a more "mature" Disney movie in the sense that he lacks songs (a very unusual feature for Disney Film) and focuses more on activities and discoveries than on any other newest Disney offerings. The world of Atlantis, hidden under the core of the earth, is fantastic, depicted as abandoned caves with ruins, and then slowly transforms into real ecosystems, which, although usually contain a reminder of roughness, become more and more intriguing until the tropical paradise itself is reached. Presentation of the landscape and scenery of Atlantis, without unnecessary joyful song, gave the kingdom a much more beautiful and intriguing look. Inclusion of the Atlantean language, as well as attempts to connect it with the mythology of ancient civilizations in life, adds to this and works quite well. <br /> <br /> Also with the exception of some of the scenes with Mole's Practical jokes, there does not seem to be a lot of "childish" element that I usually associate with Disney movies. Instead, the main elements were the struggle to reach Atlantis and the constant discovery that took place in Atlantis, as the outsider Milo was able to learn everything he ever needed to know about the place, helping the Atlantis to discover parts of their own history, they did not know about that. Part of this concerns the Atlantean "weapon", which is used in a very high-level climax, which is quite exciting for lack of a better word. <br /> <br /> Certainly not the whole story is full of meaning, and the movie does not contain any amazing new computer-generated visual effects, but apart from Toy Story movies, it's the most entertaining Disney movie I've seen for years.
