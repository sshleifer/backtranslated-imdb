I watch most of the movies Nick Mancuso plays in because, honestly, I love this guy, even though he's usually cast as baddie over the years (longtime fans should remember that he's blond for some reason). This is a pretty well-known movie in terms of story (but most movies these days are not entirely original), but Rick Roberts is attractive as an imperfect husband, Martha MacIsaac is as attractive as her daughter, and Mitzi Kapture does a good job if it was her goal, being bad and sometimes very difficult. Nick still has it in the sense of showing charm and psychosis. However, too much of the story takes place outside the screen - like motivation, past behavior, good times and bad times - and things that seem obvious to the characters never reach the audience (ie, I). The final scene leaves everything you need in the category "but what about ..." and in general, I can not say that I really cared about any character. Having said that, it was just that - quite an entertaining way of spending the afternoon - and I still like Nick.
