This movie was amazing. I recommend it to everyone, much better than what I predicted earlier. It was definitely a moving spectacular film. It's an amazing story with amazing actors and creators. Definitely another great movie with Denzel Washington. (no one should be surprised) Derek Luke also did a great job.
