When I started watching them, it became one of my favorite programs. Melissa Joan hart is very funny and talented, just like her aunts and other characters and the Salem cat star, he was incredibly funny. The first few seasons were in my opinion the best when Sabrina was a teenager in high school adapting to the life of witches. they were the funniest, the most entertaining and the most ... good. I'm not a fan when they started introducing Brad and Dreamer, because I liked Valerie very much, but they were fine, the problem was that they were only in one season. if you want to have new people, at least stop them. I did not like Josh to be creative, I preferred Harvey, but then he disappeared. and they got rid of Libby! it would be great if you were arguing in those seven years. and your craft, if he and Zelda get married, it would be gold! then Sabrina moves out of her home, ciotek, to the house of Roxie / Miles / Morgan. I also did not like these people, I did not think they liked Sabrina. Sabrina seemed to be losing her charm, and her aunts seem to be excluded from their lives and these are their own stupid stories. at some point I stopped watching him, and the old replays were back and I was like a whoo-hoo! LOL. I must say that the last few seasons were absolutely horrible. They got rid of their aunts who sucked because they were a big part of the show. then he suddenly allows the two Freemasons to enter a nice home when he treats him like dirt. and now he's working in a magazine store, so they put stars on the show if they're in every episode that's ruining. the program really went down and lost its shine. I saw the last episode. she had aunts in her (Zelda was reduced to a candle) and she would soon get married, but she escapes with Harvey. I would like to know what happened next. Well, that's my review and all I can say is the one thing that remained appealing for seven years is Salem's cat.
