I remember watching this movie on TV on Saturday afternoon in the 1950s or 1960s. It was well presented, but I remember that there was a message of hope transmitted from the transmitters separated in the lamposts in one of the last maniacal executions for the approaching liberation. I'm not sure if I agree with the facts. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the movie is well done. The German Supreme Command reports pitifully emotionless "The Russians are moving down The Fredrich Strasse", as if everything went according to plan. <br /> <br /> I had the impression that this film and the later American did for television off was based on the British historian Trevor-Roperze under a similar title Last Days of Hitler. I was surprised to see no appreciation for Trevor-Roper. <br /> <br /> I agree that the latest German movie on the subject DOWNFALL was just as well done as the classic one. The American knockout was a bit flat. <br /> <br /> Few people have attracted so much attention from the cinema as Adolph. It is interesting, however, that none of the many films and books that have appeared says about Hitler's double reference to the wonderful historical work of John Toland. <br /> <br /> Is gibs?
