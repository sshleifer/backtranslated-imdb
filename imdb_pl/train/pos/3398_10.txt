I saw Soylant Green in 1973, when it was released for the first time, and maybe eight times over the years on TV or video. It has always been one of my favorite sci-fi movies and / or Charlton Heston. <br /> <br /> Recently, an Egyptian theater in L.A. he had twelve films Retrospective of Charlton Heston. I flew from out of state to see six movies in two days. Soylent Green looked great on a large Egyptian screen with a great new print. The film was fantastic from its initial assembly, to the home scene, and the ending. <br /> <br /> Charlton Heston as a policeman who lives in a dog world, eat dogs with little natural resources and do not understand the world was once and Eddie Robinson as a man who remembers the past is great. <br /> <br /> Their chemistry is great. The film looks much better in a great 35-millimeter print. Fleisher really knows how to fill the screen, and cinematography, writing, used music and everything works in it. The film is also very powerful in its gloomy and very possible look at the future. Just think about how the world population grew, the rain forest disappeared, the resources were consumed, the greenhouse effect deteriorated from 1973. I'm just wondering why this movie has not played in theaters all these years. His reputation should be better. <br /> <br /> Speaking of reputation, people often talk as if Charlton Heston was not a great actor. Seeing him in El-Cid, Soylent Green, The Warlord, The Omega Man, Will Penny and Major Dundee back, I am convinced that he is one of our best actors. Of course, he has made about a dozen other great films and for those who care about it, you know what they are. <br /> <br />
