This film is wonderful in every respect, because modern adventures are not. Take some time. Relax, enjoy yourself. Think. People who see the movie as slow, boring or boring, really have to take a week off and watch it a few times, until their mind focuses on the opportunity to get involved or even beautiful story in a beautiful place for no other reason than because I am in no hurry to make points that you so much need in such a short time. At the beginning I was afraid that Brosnan is playing the Native American. However, taking into account the plot, I think it's a good throwing. Returning to my hermitage. -Jahfre
