Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega are an unmatched couple who get into the car and perform tasks according to the needs of one or the other. Morgan Freeman is wonderfully human, associated with one and all, while Paz Vega is a sharp cashier behind the line of "10 items or less", intimidating customers and bored with the mind. Together, they discover, discover and learn from each other. To do this, of course, they must be vulnerable, interested in change and have a sense of humor that both of them have. I would like this movie to be realistic, I would like this type of story to happen more often, I would like us not to go to the cinema to realize that we can really connect, even if we come from very different backgrounds. The message of the film is based on an open heart and makes us reflect on the possibility of another world in which we meet from there - in a world where peace could be possible.
