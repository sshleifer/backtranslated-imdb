Not a movie for everyone, but this movie is in my top 10. I'm a fan of black comedy. The cast included Richard Dreyfus (Vic), Jeff Goldblum (Mick), Larry Bishop (Nick) and Gabriel Byrne (Ben 'Brass Balls' London). The supporting staff is almost dead. Counting minor flaws in the film: makeup Ellen Barkin gave her face a washed-out look; there were a few scenes from gimme Joey Bishop and Richard Pryor, which did not bring results, and the time on the screen of Michael J. Pollard was too short. In total, the cast was amazing without ego to destroy the great script. If you've seen the movie of Larry Bishop (screenwriter, director), Underworld (dark detective story), you'll like this one. His next performance (screenwriter, director, actor) is Hell Ride with Michael Madsen and Quentin Tarantino.
