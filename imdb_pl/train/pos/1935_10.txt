Writing something real and real is a challenge. Knowing how to shoot it and compile it without making it trivial is even better. Ishai Setton's film is one of those in which you can recognize life in all its simplicity and beauty. He touched me with "Big Bad Swimming" and from now on I will promote him as far as I can. It is a pity that I can not show something to my friends (you know, for example, DVD ???), because the conversation is good ... but giving something to see is better. Everyone can not go to festivals to discover such pearls, and this film is really worth to put there! A big THANK YOU for the staff of this masterpiece and look forward to its distribution.
