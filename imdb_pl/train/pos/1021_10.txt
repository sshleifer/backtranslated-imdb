The first and second seasons began uncertainly, with good episodes placed between the average and sometimes resorting to stereotypical tales. But when he started to create the universe in which he exists and began to develop his characters, he became much more entertaining and entertaining. <br /> <br /> The main reason that this performance goes is four men: Richard Dean Anderson, Peter Deluise, Joseph Malozzie and Paul Mullie. Richard's dry sense of humor makes the show much better, Peter's direction is excellent and makes every episode much more entertaining, and Joe and Paul never stop creating a fun, interesting episode. <br /> <br /> Once you understand what's going on in the show and meet the characters, I doubt you will like it. For people entering the series I suggest episodes of "The Other Side", a good serious episode and "Window of Opportunity", a classic comic episode of relief.
