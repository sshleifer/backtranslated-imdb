almost every review of the movie I saw was quite bad. It's not quite bad, actually it's pretty good, though not great. Judy Garland's character might get angry, but she would not allow it. Somewhere along this line, I became a fan of Van Heflin's overbearing, overbearing thoughts, at least in the early 1940s. Judy's singing is great, but the movie lost a great chance, showing no more of your relationship. I gave him 7.
