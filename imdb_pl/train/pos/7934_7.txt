According to this table, I think you either love her or hate her. Usually, as with all movies. However, there is no need to tease others. Everything we do here is giving opinions. I rented this movie last night and I want to come and quit my opinion in the mix. I was surprised by how many people do it. There is a difference between a movie fan and a horror fan. I'm a fan of horror movies. Most ordinary film fans do not like horror films. These days, there are so many low-budget movies that look like cameras. It's hard to keep up. And what makes it hard to stay in these movies is their evil. I wanted to come and write a review about "Hood of the Living Dead" because it is damn good compared to the rest of the trash. It's nothing special, but it's the horror filmmakers who try to be too serious and end up making horrible horror. That's what I really like. Are you telling me that there is no effort at all? And one more thing, I bet you all have all the huge DVD collections you're so proud of, not just Major Motion Pictures? There is nothing wrong with that, but you must know how to appreciate an independent budget. I knew what I had when I watched the movie. I will not be upset because I thought it would be a movie worth 100 million dollars. Some of you may want to keep watching the Matrix and stop trying to compare everything to the Matrix. And if most of you are under 24, it explains everything. Good movie people, check it out.
