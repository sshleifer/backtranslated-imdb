about a year and a half ago my dad told me about The French Doors. I thought it sounded interesting, but I did not try to find it anywhere. About a year ago, I remembered the movie and thought "hey why not" and tried to find it on the Internet. finally after about a week of searching I found him on atomic films. I called my dad to the computer and told him, "Hi dad, I found this terrifying movie that you told me about centuries ago! He smiled at me, turned away, turned off the lights, so that he was pitch black, outside the computer screen, and made me watch it. I started well ... Then, when he started to worry about what was there, I found it very annoying. I finally pushed back the chair and stood up ... it made me jump! even after the fourth or fifth time, it still worries. <br /> <br /> GREAT MOVIE!
