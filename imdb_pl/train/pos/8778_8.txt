James J. Corbett, heavyweight world champion in 1892-1897, proved to be Errol Flynn's favorite role. Perhaps because he did not have to wield a sword or be in the western. He got tired of the crowds and said in his autobiography that he felt bad in westerns and could not understand why people liked him. It is a nice movie, but it hardly tells the true story of James J. Corbett. <br /> <br /> As a portrayed Corbett, he was the first science boxer who won in the heavyweight category, a man who used the brain and speed more than brute force to win. He defeated John L. Sullivan and lost to Bob Fitzsimmon of heavyweight. He was also a compulsive womanizer and in this he was very similar to the man who introduced him. Of course, it was not visible on the screen. The character Alexis Smith, the daughter of a banker who falls for him, has no basis in reality. Corbett was in fact twice married and was blatantly unfaithful to both his wives. <br /> <br /> Also after he lost his title and after the end of this film, he experienced a great personal tragedy. His father at the time of depression, probably over finances, because he lost his son's bets to defeat Bob Fitzsimmons, shot his mother, and then turned the gun on himself. Murder / suicide almost disagrees with the happy clan led by Alan Hale. <br /> <br /> One of the things that I liked in Gentleman Jim. Ward Bond got a career in life by playing John L. Sullivan. Director Raoul Walsh had a great performance with Bond as a shaky but nice Sullivan. Even taking into account some of Sullivan's bad points that do not reach the screen like furious racism, Bond's portrait is the quintessence of John L. and the best thing about Gentleman Jim. <br /> <br /> Speaking of racism, one should say that during the championship Sullivan refused to meet Peter Jackson, who was black and came from Australia and probably the best weight of his time. I say probably because, as a rival, Corbett met him and fought him for 61 rounds to draw. This fight more than any other cause the demand for the Sullivan-Corbett title. Of course, when Corbett became a champion, he refused to give Jackson the title. Maybe he did not want another marathon of 61 rounds with someone who could be better on this particular day. <br /> <br /> Jim's gentleman is not Jim Corbett's story, it's Errol Flynn's movie starring James J Corbett. But Corbett lived in 1942, he would undoubtedly love the film and love Flynn's image in his life. It is as if he wanted to be remembered.
