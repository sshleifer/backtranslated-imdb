I was in sixes and sevens while watching this. Altman's touch with zooming in and out was there and I expected that these devices would comment characters and situations. Unfortunately, as far as I could see, they were sometimes unjustified, sometimes witty, often infertile, because they did not point to some ironic or other connections. In particular, the two deductions from the gilded dome in the savannah were simply embarrassed. To be honest, several zooms (out and ins) for Branagh increased his stupor, la Pudgy McCabe or Philip Marlow. In general, the magnification was, well, inconsistent, and sometimes banal. <br /> <br /> Other Almanian devices, such as many panes between the camera and the object, have been successful, suggesting the character's sollipsism or narcissism or opaque states of knowledge. I felt that the car windshields, house windows and other screens were effective and quite consistent, referring to the PLAYER, and even LONG GOODBYE. A few catchy cuts, especially in suggestive TV commercials, reminded me of such use in SHORT CUTS, with a sardonic effect. <br /> <br /> But in the end, the mismatch between the very personal style of Altman and the pure weight of the momentum of the Grisham genre did not excite me. The director's masterpieces from the '70s have revised and deconstructed various classical genres, including Chandler's detective film, which in a way reminded him; this time the director seemed to have too little shot in his anal whiplash to hit a significant blow to the soft underbelly of this animal species. Perhaps he was punished by Mammonians? Or maybe I miss something because of my poor knowledge of the genre that is taking here? <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the casting was perfect: Tom Berenger (for his frightening ferocity), Branagh for his (empty) pride, Robert Downey's pheromone mist, Robert Duvall's basket method, and David's lurking femme fatality were almost perfect choices. And apart from a few cases from Georgia to Chicago from the side (brunettes?) Daryla Hannah, the accents were convincingly southern. <br /> <br /> The suspension and mood were engaging, even if the story was not quite riveting viewers. The mood of the coastal barometric current before the hurricane was excellent, scrupulously rendered - I wanted to shout at the janitor to activate the pronto cooler. <br /> <br /> Torn, I finally rated him on 7. <br /> <br />
