"Dressed to Kill" is certainly one of the best horror / thriller movies ever made. It is a tight, stylish and extremely tight mix of sex and violence. Acting is pretty good, orchestral score Pino Donaggio is unforgettable and there are plenty of surprises "Dressed to Kill" is the secret of murder involved in a sexually frustrated housewife (Angie Dickinson), her teenage son (Keith Gordon), her psychoanalyst (Michael Caine ) and a girl with high prices (Nancy Allen). The murderer in the film is a transsexual named Bobbi, who is also one of Caine's patients. The film is full of breathtaking moments: the infamous murder scene from the elevator is unusually stylish and pretty, as well as very bloody.
