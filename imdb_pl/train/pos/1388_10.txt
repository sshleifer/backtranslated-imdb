"The day is over" is an amazing picture. in some respects this is better than "close encounters of the third kind". (I prefer cheesy independent movies for large budgets). The special effects are poor, but it's a big part of the fun. Jim Davis gives an excellent performance in this film. it's probably one of the best roles he's ever had in a movie. The musical score is very good. history does not make sense. BUT IT WILL ONLY DO ANY MORE. like many of the best works of art, "the day is over" is not afraid to be subtle and ambiguous. "The day is over" may be a low-budget independent film, but it is not too difficult to compare with "existential" European films from the 1950s and 1960s. (many of them are independent productions with a low budget).
