Wonderful Barbara Bach plays Jennifer Fast, a TV reporter who travels with her team (Karen Lamm and Lois Young) to Solvang, California, to take part in the Danish festival. The problem is that their accommodation has fallen, and all hotels in the city are full. So they are leaving the city to a distant place and enjoy the hospitality of the seemingly friendly Ernest Keller (phenomenal Sydney Lassick). Would you not know that Ernest and silent partner Virginia (Lelia Goldoni) are hiding a big secret in their basement: pathetic, deformed, clad in "Junior" diapers (Stephen Furst, in an unusual performance) that ultimately terrorizes girls. <br /> <br /> A deliciously dressed Lassick plays a real monster in this disturbing little horror movie. It is built slowly but surely in intense confrontation / culmination, delivering horror in small doses up to the last half hour. The hotel and basement have a bad feeling - big echoes of "Psycho" here - it's a great setting. First of all, the perverse plot includes incest and parricide, thanks to which the film acquires a truly dark quality. And yet it is also moving when we realize that Junior is not a clearly evil bogeyman, but as a victim as girls. The last shot is particularly sad. <br /> <br /> "Invisible" is a solid little horror worth discovering. <br /> <br /> 8/10
