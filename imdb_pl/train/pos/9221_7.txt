Once again I browsed the rebate bin and picked up the movie for 4.88 USD. Fifty percent of the time, which films in the basket are pure shit (I mean horrible, unbelievable), but in the middle they turn out to be surprisingly good. This movie is much better than I expected. I find it very addictive, although of course made by an amateur. <br /> <br /> The direction is not special, but the story is intriguing with a few good chills. I expected it to be more comedy, but I was not too disappointed. <br /> <br /> In the case of a thriller, this movie is surprisingly good-natured. There is no bloody violence, profanity, nakedness or sex. Typically, these films require all four elements. The rating of the PG is well-deserved - not like "Sixteen candles", where the word "f" is used twice and a short, unpaid naked scene appears. <br /> <br /> I just wish the romance between Corey Haim and his interest in love could be more developed. The film tends to be heavy in the story, and potentially good side motifs are pushed aside. Instead of developing chemistry between them, we end up watching their unwary three minutes on their romantic endeavors. In the end, they kiss at the end, but there is so little chemistry that it seems to be forced. <br /> <br /> "Dream Machine" is not a jewel, but it's good, pure entertainment. This is completely forgotten - especially in the cast of unknowns, with the exception of Haim - but it is also much better than one would expect. <br /> <br /> My result: 7 (out of 10)
