Here's a real freak for you. It starts with the next start on the PSYCHO shower stage, on the campus, and then becomes more and more crazy when several Coeds and their inept guys go south to Spring Break. The problem begins when they enter Redneck, ruled by the deadly sheriff Dean. One of the sailors from college goes to the forest, witnesses the sheriff's murder and opens his head. Then it allows you to break away from the time line of MACON COUNTY when Dean follows, traps and kills thoughtless witnesses one by one. Tony March is the target of the attack as a bad, happy shooter Dean. The overall tone of the movie is really worrying. The ending is so violent that you almost think that the director ran out of the movie; it is also a study in despair. SHALLOW GRAVE is a must for misanthropes, misogynists and nihilists around the world.
