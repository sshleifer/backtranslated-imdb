In "Anne of Green Gables" (1934), Marilla Cuthbert (Helen Westley) and Matthew Cuthbert (OP Heggie), middle-aged siblings who live together in Green Gables, a farm in Avonlea on Prince Edward Island, decide to host a boy from distant orphanage to help their farm. But an orphan sent to them is a prematurely born 14-year-old girl named Anne Shirley (Dawn Evelyn Paris - veteran of the Disney series "Alice", who later adopted the name of her character). <br /> <br /> Anne was only 11 years old in the source novel Lucy Maude Montgomery, but the same actress could not reliably pass from the age of 11 to the student age. The film suffers a bit from this concession, because many of Anne's reactions and much of what she says are more fun than the eleven who comes from a teenager. As in the book, Anne is bright and fast, eager to please but dissatisfied with her name, construction, freckles and long red hair. As a child of imagination, Anne draws a lot of joy and quickly adapts to her new family and the environment of Prince Edward Island. <br /> <br /> In fact, Anne is the original "Teenage Queen of Drama" and the screenwriter decided to focus on this aspect of his character. Which transformed the basic genre from a gentle amusing family drama into a comedy. A change that delighted the audience and which still frustrates reader purists. <br /> <br /> Because the comedy is largely in the spirit of Montgomery's story, I see no reason to question the changes, but let it be a fair warning to anyone who expects a completely faithful adaptation. The element of comedy is the power of the film, because it is one of the earliest self-reflective parodies of Hollywood conventions. Actress Anne Shirley was one of the most beautiful Hollywood beauties, and the film is black and white. So much entertainment is that the endless lamentations of the title character about her appearance and hair color are contradictory to what appears on the screen. Anne regularly regrets her nonsensical rural comrades with melodramatic lines like, "If you refuse, it will be a sadness for me all my life." Perhaps the funniest moment is to correct the spelling of her name on the school board. <br /> <br /> Tom Brown is doing a good job as a love interest Anne Gilbert Blythe and Sara Haden steal all the scenes where he appears as a pompous neighbor of Cuthbert. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
