MATADOR is a hit movie lite .... if you can say about the movie with a hit. Violence is never really shown, but often introduced. At the beginning I was afraid that I was in another retread of a gangster-murder-fashionable-dark-dark comedy in the mid-90s. BUT I was surprised when I realized that it was a sweet and funny story about friendship. There's nothing terribly exciting going on in this movie, but each of them makes me smile. Three wires have the best chemistry that the big screen has offered in recent years and it looks like they had a great time creating this movie together. Writing is harsh, although sometimes it seemed that the script was adapted from a stage game because of one dialogue scene. This is a good movie that I will probably not remember for too long, but at the time it was full of joy. Good film.
