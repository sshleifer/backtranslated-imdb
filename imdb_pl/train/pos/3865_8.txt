"Stories of the Century" was a half-hour series and appeared in the first cycle of syndication in the television season "54-55". It was also the first western television series to win the Emmy Award. In the role of the main detective Matt Clark with the participation of Western western actor Jim Davis, the series filmed Clark and his colleagues (Mary Castle as Frankie Adams in the first half of the season and Kristine Miller as "Jonesy" in the second half) against historical west outlaws from different periods from the mid-1960s to the early twentieth century. The series was very satisfying, easy to watch and quite realistic, mainly thanks to the easy charm of Jim Davis in the lead role. He looked like a real western hero. One more note. When Matt Clark came to the city after a long drive, he looked like he was on a long horseback because he would be covered in dust. <br /> <br /> A very good early adult western.
