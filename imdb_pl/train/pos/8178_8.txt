Not many movies really used the fear of going to a dentist who has many people. Those of you have really intimidating-looking instruments. Give writers Dennis Paoli, Stuart Gordon and Charles Finch the opportunity to get the maximum shock value of "make-you-squirm-in-your-seat". <br /> <br /> Corbin Bernsen, in a nicely nuanced performance, is Alan Feinstone, a dedicated dentist, whose train early jumps off the tracks. Unbalanced obsessive-compulsive, he begins to think about the disintegration, even imagining it where they do not exist, and equating the breakup with society's corruption in general. Seeing how his unfaithful wife Brooke (Linda Hoffman) begins to take care of her, decides to punish her. At the same time, he is under the pressure of smarmy I.R.S. agent (Earl Boen, best known as Dr. Silberman from the Terminator series), to do a favor in exchange for an agent keeping his mouth shut about Feinstone's financial matters. Feinstone begins to perceive everyone around him as spoiled in one way or another, and he continues the murderous madness when police detective Gibbs (always welcome Ken Foree) takes his lead. <br /> <br /> Director Brian Yuzna clearly has great fun with the script. This allows for really nasty and extremely funny scenes from gore, which equally well create sympathy for the victims, which grab the audience. The script gives Feinstone some small dialogue lines and is quite cunning and funny, with large doses of black humor (such as Feinstone telling the victim to "get rid of the tongue!"). Brooke and I.R.S. an agent in particularly effective torture scenes. The makeup effects are mostly good. And the film does a great job, maintaining its dynamic development, because Feinstone, with its relentless pursuit of perfection, changes from a recognized professional into an awkward killer in record time. <br /> <br /> Foree, always cool and pleasant to watch, is rather wasted as a detective with a standard number, but it's a bit of a pleasure to watch Boen playing his slim part on the hilt. Hoffman and Christa Sauls provide very attractive eye candy. And premature Mark Ruffalo can be seen in a small supporting role. But all this is very Bernsen's show, which sinks teeth (sorry for the use of this expression) in its plum part with total conviction. <br /> <br /> "Dentist" is one of the more original and interesting horrors from the 90s. <br /> <br /> 8/10
