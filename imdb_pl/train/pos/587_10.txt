One of the things in the movie that warmed up my strings of hearts was that catching a dry fly was the main part of the scene. From time to time I was fishing with dry flies, I had my own flies attached, and my brother and father accompanied me, spending a day on one or another river, trying to tempt the elusive Brown Trout to rise and take on board which was offered to them. <br /> <br /> When we had such occasions, all the differences between us disappeared, and all the pressures of the world disappeared to replace them with the glory of being consumed by the activity and surroundings of the place where we were. <br /> <br /> It was one of the amazing things that were presented to me in the film as a minister and his two sons, Norman and Pauly, performed a ritual. In fly fishing there is something ritual because there is something ritual in so many pastimes. You can not just start throwing lines and hoping for the best. You need to tune in to the place where you are, you need to scan the surface of the water, taking into account how it flows and where it is best to put your fly and, depending on your skill level, you can even get your fly to land there long enough to the fish could record it and hit it. "Art of Fly-fishing" was directed and represented so well that they themselves can be qualified as artists. <br /> <br /> The title of the film could not be more accurately chosen because the river actually ran through the life of his father and two sons. The film, however, is spreading wider than the family and community in Montana, on the Blackfoot River, where the film takes place. It has the ability to draw you, enchant you, capture you when the history of the family, community and period develops. The story told is not just a family story, but a Life story. What can be classified as the "river of life"
