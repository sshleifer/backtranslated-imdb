"The father is still in business" was the review headline after the premiere of "Promise Me This" in Cannes. I understand why many believe that Kusturica's same but unique expression is still present in his new film and that's why critics can not touch him. I had two hours of pure energy without rest. Even when Kusturica suffers from a lack of concentration or fear of empty space, it is still unique and uncontaminated. Surprisingly good results of Stribor Kusturica. Much more close-ups and fewer landscapes than in "Life is a Miracle". Marija Petronijevic has a femme fatal world potential, please, do not spoil it. I certainly recommend everyone to see this movie.
