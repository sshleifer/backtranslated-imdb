Okay, so I've come a long way from Houston, but whenever I see this movie, I go back to the little cowgirl's dream to go to Bull's Gilley one day. (It burned before I finished drinking.) <br /> <br /> If you grew up in eastern Texas, then you know that this movie is an accurate representation of modern life. If you do not trust me and watch the movie. Or you will join many who love him (and at the same time they strangely repel), or at least you can laugh at the red necks. (There are loads of play materials.) This movie does not try to be P.C. (what it was in the 80's) or hide the white element of rubbish and is honest to time and place. <br /> <br /> It must be 10 for me!
