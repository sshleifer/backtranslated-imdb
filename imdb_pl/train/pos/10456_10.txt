This movie is not about entertainment or even the movie you want to see to pass the time. This film is a real show of true love that can only come from God. You can not help but deeply touch this movie. We have several dimensions of love that contribute to the value of this movie. God's divine love is beautifully presented. God's love transcends the heart, mind and lasts and is eternal. Love is in a marriage. While the main character is struggling with his wife's illness, he realizes thanks to God's love that he loves his wife more than he could have imagined. He knows that he and his wife are one and can never be separated. Finally, you have the love of a child and a parent. Children in the family meet and realize that nothing else matters, except that love overcomes fear. Dear friends, love is not love unless it comes from God, because God is love and love comes from God. Talk to someone and let them know that you love them. Love does not do anything good unless it is passed on to another. I pray that this film will inspire and change the lives of everyone who sees it. Amen!!
