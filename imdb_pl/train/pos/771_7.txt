I watched the film together with a homophobic friend, my wife and her friend. So I had views from different directions. Mainly the movie made me laugh, the sexual tension did not really exist, and the only noticeable actors were Tudor Chirila and Maria Popistasu. Yes, I think she played her role well, even if the script was not right. There were good Romanian actors around, they just did not have complex roles. Applause Puyi enters the film industry. I do not know why, but I think he's a good guy, I just hope he'll be a good actor. <br /> <br /> However, my wife loved this movie and I think that there could have been chords and I did not have an ear. If the film tried to present unusual sexual behaviors and their consequences in present-day Romania, it failed. There were no consequences. Imagine that girls are actually a boy and a girl, and the same story becomes a boring, uninteresting story. <br /> <br /> I have no idea why she received all of these BAFTA awards. In my book, he should receive the award "Better happiness next time". (bafta = good luck in Romanian).
