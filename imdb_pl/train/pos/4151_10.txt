The time of the condemned service is approaching to give the Cold Case unit information about the murder of a police officer committed many years earlier. The murder of Sean Cooper, a good policeman, has never been resolved. Of course, detectives believe that new evidence will help them collect all the pieces of the puzzle that frustrated their colleagues. <br /> <br /> In the flashbacks, we are taken for the baptism of the child James Bruno. Sean and Jimmy were partners. There is tension when Sean, who is the godfather, arrives disheveled and late for the rite. Eileen Bruno does not seem happy. The real secret is revealed by her. She caught Sean, who drank with Jimmy in the yard, kissed her husband and shocked her even more, Jimmy reacted eagerly. <br /> <br /> Somehow, at the station, the partners become the center of gossip. Sean did not enjoy his superiors, because he discovered the involvement of a criminal in his area that controlled the drug business. Sean realizes that this man is in the company of a strong drug man, because he always justifies to release the sacks with the scum that Sean and Jimmy are pulling at the station all the time. The pressure is too big for Jimmy. Sean feels comfortable in his homosexuality and wants to be honest. Cooper's own father does not want to have anything to do with the strange son. Even his superior, McCree, wants him not to have jurisdiction, but the matter is complicated because Cooper comes from a long line of Irish men serving in the police. Sean is killed because of his homosexual state and too much knowledge about the involvement of his peers in taking dirty money. <br /> <br /> Tom Petit wrote this honest image of a policeman's life in the closet and his secret love with another fellow policeman. We thought it was an honest account of a serious matter that no one was talking about at the time. Sometimes people involved in the show, fearing reprisals from sponsors or networks, have no courage to present these real situations. Jeannot Szwarc shows a sensitive approach to this sensitive issue, which is considered without sensation. The case could be shown with another team. <br /> <br /> There is a rare appearance of Chad Everett as the elder Jimmy Bruno. His shot is accurate with a bit of sentimentality that does not get out of control. Shane Johnson brings great contributions to the show as Sean Cooper. The cast is great and contains good performances of everyone under the direction of Mr. Szwarc. <br /> <br /> In this episode, Nick Vera approaches his neighbor, the mother of the basketball player, which the detective took away. Nick is aiming for a romance with a woman!
