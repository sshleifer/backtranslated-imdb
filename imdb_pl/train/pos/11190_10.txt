One of the best (if not the best) Stephen King shows. Dark as dark can be a surprising ending not Hollywood, terrifying atmosphere, amazing adaptation of the book, outstanding cast, educational (do not play with the afterlife), in short - everything that should be a great horror ... <br /> <br /> My favorite horror, simple 10+.
