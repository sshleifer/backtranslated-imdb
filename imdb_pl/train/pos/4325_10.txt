This version of Bleak House is the best adaptation of the classic novel I know. The representation of the Chancery court as a "character" in the drama is great. Acting is great, from sinister Tulkinghorn, to Dedlocks, Smallweed, Crooke, Miss Flyte and two young lovers. But this spider's office network keeps the whole together, and the photos are great. What error did the BBC make of copyright, which meant that this version could not be seen in the UK on video or DVD for many years? I tried to find out from them, but I looked at the stone wall. In the end I got a copy of a DVD from Canada.
