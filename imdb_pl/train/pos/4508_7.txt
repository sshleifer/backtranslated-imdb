I was impressed by the beautiful photography in this film that was shot in Alaska. Although technically it is a melodrama, we see many activities involving Eskimos, such as hunting, dancing, building igloo, etc. And their habits, such as offering wives to visitors, are routinely in history. Hunting sequences sometimes came from footage, because it was easy to recognize some of the projection scenes on the back of the animals, but even those were fascinating. Catching salmon by spears, hunting for walruses, caribou, and even a polar bear and a whale made it seem like a document sometimes. There was no casting list that strengthened the documentary taste. The creators of the film tried to make it seem very authentic, and the natives only spoke in the Eskimo language, which was translated by someone on the screen or by subtitles. In the introduction it was stated that with the exception of white traders and Royal Mounted Canadian Police, there were no actors in the film, but this was not true. The two leading characters, played by Mala and Lotus Long, were Eskimos by birth, but were professional actors with earlier films and sometimes you could see makeup. But they were great in their roles and had a career in Hollywood. In total, the movie is definitely worth seeing.
