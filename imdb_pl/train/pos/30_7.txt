The old family story told to the two young girls by their grandfather comes alive 16 years later, as he foretold. <br /> <br /> People are murdered and blood is spilled, rats are rushing all over, and naked bodies are suspected. Kitty (Barbara Bouchet) is suspected, but we know he is not a killer. Is this Franziska (Marina Malfatti)? Is Evelyn coming back from death to revenge? Is this a conspiracy to steal the estate? The color is excellent in this thriller by Emilio Miraglia, who, as far as I know, only made one Giallo. <br /> <br /> The only thing that broke the movie was the look that several frames had been cut out. Someone is calling the police and they are suddenly trying to save Kitty.
