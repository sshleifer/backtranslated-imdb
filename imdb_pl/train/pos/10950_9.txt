When I saw this program for the first time, I thought it looked interesting. I watched it, I saw it revolve around Sarah, just like a figure sees the world ... circling around her. I got it, but I did not laugh too much. <br /> <br /> On the stage and in her show she is racist, primitive, insensitive and extremely self-centered. At the beginning I did not get it and I understood it all. Then I saw her movie, Jesus is magic. I think it served as a primer for Sarah Silverman, explaining to me what "language" she says. It's like Marilyn Manson, working so hard to give us disgusting ideas and images, but in the end you realize that this is not an attack, it's a statement. And once you understand this, you will discover that you are glad that someone finally gives you that. <br /> <br /> I do not want to imply that only wise people will understand, or that you hate this performance, it will prove your idiocy. Although I like many "smart" programs, I still do not see Curb Your Enthusiasm's humor. I have the impression that it is good, but I just do not understand it. Many people will never receive the Sarah Silverman program, but I'm glad I finally came. <br /> <br /> The creators of this program are working hard, each episode is loaded not only by dialogue and story but by song or dream sequences, production numbers. These people do not prepare something that would fill the time window and satisfy the advertisers, they seem to be on a mission to make the best show they can make. If I had to predict the future of this series, I would say that it will go to Arrested Development and Freaks & Geeks. It will be canceled ahead of time and live in the hearts of fans and DVDs. But think, the creators of the SSP, your audience IS there, and we will watch as long as they let you do the show.
