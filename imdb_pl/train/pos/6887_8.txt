This is a unique and brave movie. He is energetic, with highly developed characters. Very good performances. <br /> <br /> I love directors who are not afraid to ask the audience to think ... <br /> <br /> Bret Carr dares to look inside himself, ask questions and dig under the surface. Due to the nature of the film, practically it requires that the viewer also looks inside. It can take some courage. I see how some people with limited minds can find this disturbing. However, I was convinced that it was a provocation, something more than just entertainment. <br /> <br /> Bret Carr is really an original filmmaker, with a vision. I'm curious what he will do next. <br /> <br /> Follow him.
