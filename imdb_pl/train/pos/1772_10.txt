what a relief to discover that I can not imagine this program! The summary from the taxpayer is great. I also remember that it was haunting, not particularly family. I had to have 10/11 the moment I watched him. I think that for a girl who is part of the age, the attraction was very light lead hair and its permanently sad condition. The theme was played on a flute, which I remember - though I do not remember how it went. I think the intro showed him how he was playing - or maybe he was playing the flute in the program, especially when he was sad? Maybe I never know how it ended, whether I saw a clip or heard a melody, but at least now I know it's not just me.
