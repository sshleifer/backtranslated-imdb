Undefined and challenging, beautiful TESS STORM SOUND is the daughter of a fisherman crouched on the ground of a rich man. Spiritual and courageous, he gives the heart to the son of a millionaire, but violence, terror and sudden death are what persecutes her immediate future before she can get the sweet peace of happiness. <br /> <br /> Mary Pickford is absolutely charming in this wonderful, moving movie. She believed that Tess was her favorite role, and filled her with all the bold joy and enthusiasm that made her the most popular movie star in the world for years. The story has all the necessary elements of a modern fairy tale, in which Mary is a charming, worried hero harassing all dangerous, stressful situations. The atmosphere is first-rate, and the sets of the fishing village in the open air are particularly well thought out. <br /> <br /> In the cast, Jean Hersholt stands out as a wicked villain who tries to force Pickford to marry him. Hersholt, a very gentle soul from the screen, perfectly manages to present the complete moral corruption of his character. <br /> <br /> It was the second time Pickford had shot TESS. The 1914 version was one of her first major films, but her production values ​​were a bit outdated in the 1920s (for example, no close-ups) and Mary, producing her own films and powerful enough until 1922, to do everything the film she wanted, decided for the first time in her career to make a movie. The end result certainly met her expectations. Both films were very popular at the box office. <br /> <br /> A fascinating study for some future film researcher will be the influence of Christianity in the life of Mary Pickford; it certainly works like a gold thread in the silent films that she produces. Although the romanticism inherent in the very nature of silent cinema can make these spiritual feelings somewhat awkward today, we are forced to accept them as sincere reflections, thanks to their repetition, from Mary's deep beliefs. There is one beautiful scene in TESS: Pickford learns to read with the help of the Bible. He points to Lloyd Hughes (who plays her beloved) word on the back of the book he does not understand. He imitates it for her (the word is, of course, "crucified"), and eyes turned to heaven, when the full meaning of the Sacrifice arrives, the face of Mary becomes positively blessed. <br /> <br /> A great new TESS orchestra score was provided by Jeffrey Mark Silverman, who perfectly highlights the beauty and pathos of this amazing film.
