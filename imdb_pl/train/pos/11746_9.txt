Incredible acting, music. A simple and clear storyline, but it attracted me and delighted me all the way. I do not know why it was so fantastic, but it just was. So many characters were so real. That moved me and made me think that I would like to see more in this way. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​a school trip as a forum for such an amazing story was a brilliant idea and so many people were like people were similar to those encountered everyday by teachers in the classroom. <br /> <br /> The film addresses issues of religion, prejudice, drug friendship, memories, difficult experiences and simple diversity of life.
