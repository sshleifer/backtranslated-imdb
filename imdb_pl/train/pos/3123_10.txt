This is the first 10 out of 10 that I gave to the movie. What made this movie so good for me? Permanent action - there are no spare parts, great acting, intelligent writing. I also liked the style of filming, in which trembling and different angles made you feel part of the scene. Finally, I see an action movie that does not try to satisfy all sectors (ie There is no compulsory romance). <br /> <br /> I liked the first two films of Bourne, but I liked this one. <br /> <br /> Note - after watching this movie you will be full of adrenaline and you can calm down before driving a car!
