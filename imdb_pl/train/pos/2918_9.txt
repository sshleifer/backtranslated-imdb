... I saw it on the cable in the late 1980s, when I was a huge stock fan since 1986. I saw it on the VHS in the basket for sale and I bought it. <br /> <br /> In 1998 I started training as a wrestler after the Air Force and I always came back to watching this, to see how it is a very accurate picture of people involved in wrestling (families and friends who do not understand us, travel, heart occupation etc.). Henry Winkler is funny and sometimes sad when no one else can understand who a creative genius is. A great way to separate yourself. The character of Fonza, which he played on Happy Days at the time. In addition, look at the cast ... William Daniels (Knight Rider), Polly Holiday (Alice) and wrestlers Roddy Piper and Chavo Guerrero Sr. If you have a chance, look at this.
