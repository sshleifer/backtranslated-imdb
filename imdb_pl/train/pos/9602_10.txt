Darius Goes West is a film depicting the American belief that everything is possible if you try hard enough. This wonderful, fun-filled and sometimes painful movie shows a young man who never expected, but he wanted to see what was beyond the borders of his charming city of Athens, GA. Darius wanted to see the ocean. His longtime friends Logan, Ben and a few other good friends decided to fulfill Darius's wish. They started from a small age - Ben and Logan's mom started an e-mail campaign to realize the Darius state: Duchenne muscular dystrophy and raise funds for peasants to take Darius not only to see the ocean, but also to see these great United States. To say that young college friends have managed to bring hope and awareness to this terrible disease would be an understatement. They became aware of Darius' dream and then a little. They stop their lives by showing Darius love, care and a lot of fun, helping Darius see how he can show the same qualities to others who suffer from DMD. Darius volunteered for the Red Cross - sitting in a chair collecting money (along with his buddies) in front of the local grocery store. His wonderful smile tells the world that dreams come true - all you need is hope and a group of college friends who support and care for you. Give Darius and all the Oscar guys - no one else deserves it. Martha Sweeney.
