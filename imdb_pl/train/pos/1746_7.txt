Bela Lugosi can play one of his rare good roles in the series based on a long radio hit (which was also the source of the feature film in which Lugosi played the villain). Lugosi cuts a beautiful figure and is sad that he did not get more roles in which he could be a guy in a good way. Here, Chandu returns from the East to help Princess Nadja, who is being hunted by the leaders of the Ubasti cult who need her to bring back a high priestess of their cult from the dead. This is a good looking serial series that is great fun. To make sure that the stimulation is a bit looser, more similar to one of the Principals (production studio), it is an adventure with roaring roars, but it is still pleasant. It plays better than the two feature films that have been cut from it, because it allows things to happen at their own pace, instead of feeling rushed or having the feeling that "hey, I missed something." One of the trilogy of the three good series Lugosy, the others are SOS Coast Guard and Phantom Creeps
