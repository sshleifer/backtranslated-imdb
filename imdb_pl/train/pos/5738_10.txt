I just bought and watched the DVD of this movie. The DVD transfer comes from last year 2001. This 1988 movie is a really great little movie. Overlooked by most people. I saw it in the theater in 1988 and since then I love it. I love the first shot of Pittsburgh (not Baltimore, as another user commented). It makes Pittsburgh look like one of the most beautiful cities in the world! And I must say that Pitts' trip to a Nicky garbage truck is very picturesque, interesting! Tom Hulce, as everyone said, gives a remarkable, wonderful performance. DVD is a good transfer, without any additions, but in a panoramic format. I recommend it to those who love this film.
