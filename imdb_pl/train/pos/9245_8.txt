Jean Harlow and Clark Gable were a great band on the screen and it could be their best movie together. <br /> <br /> Yes, Hold Your Man can be tacky and predictable, but that's not what I love about the movie. I love watching Harlow and Gable together, and in this movie they are just wonderful. It's obvious that they really liked working together and that's part of what makes this movie so great. <br /> <br /> Witty dialogue, great script and attention to detail are other things that make it such a good movie. I loved this movie for the first time when I saw it and every time I watch it I always notice at least one new detail. For me, this is a sign of a great movie. <br /> <br /> Dialogue and scenario are better than most films from this period (early 1930s). I love classic movies, but I admit that most of them are just average and sometimes I'm not interested. Hold Your Man is one of the exceptions. <br /> <br /> It has a lot to do with the fact that Hold Your Man is a "pre-code" movie. (Hays code was not enforced for a year after Hold Your Man.) This movie could not be created under the code. Well, you could do it, but it would be a completely different story. Fortunately, the code was not put into effect until 1934. Otherwise, we would miss this gem.
