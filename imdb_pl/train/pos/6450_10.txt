This is absolutely one of the best movies I've ever seen. The queue of emotions takes me. I laugh and cry and I am disgusted, happy and in love! All this for a little over two hours! <br /> <br /> All actors are brilliant! I must mention the main character, of course Michael Nyquist. He's doing an amazing job !! I also admire the actor who plays Tore, who plays this young man with mental disability in such a convincing way! He reminded me a little roll of Leonardo di Caprios in Gilbert Grape! And then there is the most beautiful song in the world: Gabriella's s√•ng. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to everyone so that they can see and enjoy!
