Animation always seems to be a fringe. In Japan it may not be like that, but in Europe and much more in the US, the animation has a large fat marker "CHILDREN". France is probably one of the more comic-liberal countries, the homeland of classics such as Tin-Tin, Asterix, Lucky Luke, Valereon etc. (If you have never read them, it is not too late, they do not have an upper age limit and they do not carry the mark of suckers DC or Marvel) It seems that in France there is a movie like this one. It suits my prejudiced image of the French as art lovers, anti-American and talented film makers. Fortunately, there is also a "dark scanner" that suppresses this view - it seems that art is quite international. <br /> <br /> In any case, as you might expect, the renaissance is artistic and French. If you're a normal person, you'll be scared of it. However, there is no need! Under his cool, elegant look is a good thriller and a good movie. <br /> <br /> It was one of my fears before this movie. It's very easy to turn spectacular animation into a trick, just like Sony and C: they do it with their Pixar outbreaks. I expected a confusing, sometimes boring and not very addictive movie, but fortunately I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I would love it because of neo-noir, but it's good that it was worth this level as well. NOTE: I saw a French dub, which was fine, as far as I could see. English can be more interesting, what about Craig and everything. <br /> <br /> The last word of praise for the animation. It was amazing. Futuristic, well-made, cool camera, intelligent solutions (for example, eyes looked very good, which is difficult to do) and so visually stunning. I felt like I was exploding. "It's so damn impressive!" On the other hand, I really like animation and I appreciate the effort that the studio put off, so my verdict is slightly biased. <br /> <br /> A good movie definitely lives out of the "grip".
