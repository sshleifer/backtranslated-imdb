It's a road movie, with a killer on board. Brian Kessler (David Duchovny), a sophisticated writer, wants to do field research on American serial killers. But neither he nor his girlfriend, Carrie (Michelle Forbes), have money for a sightseeing trip around crime scenes, so they advertise someone who shares travel costs. With whom the young couple ends, Early Grayce (Brad Pitt) and his girlfriend, Adele (Juliette Lewis), two better examples of the "poor white basket" that you will never find in the whole cinema. <br /> <br /> Indeed, Early and Adele are what makes this movie so much fun, that they mumble, grunt, confide, make speculations, salivate and behave differently I've seen replays of The Beverly Hillbillies. California's early idea: "People think faster there, because of all the warm weather; cold weather makes people stupid. " That's enough to convince Adele: "I think that explains why there are so many stupid people here." To which Early responds with pride: "That's for sure." Early instructing Adele about California: "You never have to buy any fruit because it's all in the trees ... and they have no speed limits and I hear that your first month is free, state law." <br /> <br /> But poor early has some, well, psychological problems that are becoming more and more obvious to Brian and Carrie when four travelers are heading west through the US as they enter the Southwest deserts with their beautiful landscape, "California" begins to look more and more like "The Hitcher" (1986), and Early begins to more and more behave like John Ryder, a manic hitchhiker, whose horror seemed so unstoppable. <br /> <br /> In "California", the action is uneven. Duchovny's performance is flat. Brad Pitt is surprisingly effective, even though he sometimes abuses. Michelle Forbes is great as an avant-garde photo artist. But my choice for the best performance goes to Juliette Lewis. With her nasal voice and heavy southern accent, she is stunning, like a naive, highly animated, childish Adele. <br /> <br /> In the end, the movie is heading to the Twilight zone when our travelers enter the nuclear research center in Nevada with a ruined old house full of test dummies. The plot dissolves rather sloppily in unnecessary and unreasonable violence, which was somewhat disappointing. <br /> <br /> In general, "California" is a fun movie, thanks to a clever concept, great scenery, especially in the second half, good photos, great dialogue and this wonderful performance by Juliette Lewis.
