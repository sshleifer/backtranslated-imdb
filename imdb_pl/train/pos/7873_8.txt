Page 3 is definitely fascinating and captivating, opening eyes that cleverly exposes the hypocrisy of the lifestyle of the Bombay elite. From false kisses to plastered smiles, they leave no stone in the unveiling of the rich and famous shocking life. Backstabbing, gossip, corruption and scandal lurk in every dark corner of the world of glitz and glam. Humanity and generosity are analogous to the oasis of the desert in this world where social Darwinism is the dominant mentality. Everyone still wants more money, greater fame and higher reputation, forcing them to do the most shameful things imaginable, from signing movie contracts at a funeral to child molestation. Everything is possible in this metropolis, where there is such a big difference between social classes. The audience sees the ugliness of both these classes through the eyes of the hero. He observes the suffocating atmosphere and the stunning madness in which the socialists live. Bollywood, business moguls, politicians and the underground are entwined in a completely intricate chaos! Kitne Ajeeb Hai is a nice song, like the fucking Kuan Main Doob Jaongi. A great movie with great character development!
