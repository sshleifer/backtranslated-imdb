Lupine sets out for Morocco, looking for a legendary treasure. His only clue is an interesting jewel that an old man gave him. It is a nice, different location for Lupine, with a desert and a hot exotic feeling. <br /> <br /> An interesting thing about this movie is that Jigen has a much smaller role than usual, usually in a different location than Lupine. On the one hand, they lack classic dynamics, but this is a change of pace. Plus, in this way Lupine can focus on the ladies ... <br /> <br /> Fujiko it regulates. Throughout the film, he seduces Lupine and the audience. Then there is Lara, a lady of this special story, and she is quite nice. This one has more nudity than any other Lupine anime, which is a nice distinction. <br /> <br /> He is a very funny effeminate ninja who is the best villain in this game and naturally has a great fight with Goemon, as well as some funny scenes from Fujiko. Inspector Zenigata is of course in great shape here. <br /> <br /> Basically it's a smooth ride with Lupine. The plot is average and there are free places, but in total this movie is a real pleasure. Enjoy.
