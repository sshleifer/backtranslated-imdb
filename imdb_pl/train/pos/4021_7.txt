A complex story set against the backdrop of the division of Bharat. An honest Muslim who kidnaps an innocent Indian girl and an educated Indian who burns the harvest of a Muslim man - but eventually you will like them both. The story is powerful, but the scenario and flow are uncertain. Background music and songs are outstanding. Next is the unforgettable performance of veteran Urmila Matondkar. Photography perfectly reflects the time, violence and taste of rural Punjab. Other actors either did not work well or did not have the opportunity to act. Direction is really the weakest link. Characters were not well developed. Not sharp, unlike "Earth", where even a staff figure leaves a trail. The end is very interesting. This story can have several different ends - and all of them could be just as good.
