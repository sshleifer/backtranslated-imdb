Very close and sharp description of the bubbling and dynamic emotional world of the only 18-year-old guy who makes his first experience in gay love to another boy, during the holidays with part of his family. /> I liked this movie because of its exceptionally clear and surrogate story, with all this "sound approximation" and quiet moments that were full of intense moods. <br /> <br />
