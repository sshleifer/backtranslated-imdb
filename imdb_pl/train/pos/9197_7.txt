It is a really neat, small movie, made without an absolutely perceptible budget, with a clip on the video. It takes some time to warm up. Acting is so bad that it quickly gains the charm of Zen. After a few scenes you stop noticing uncomfortable lines or repeated sounds of some shipments. All characters develop a bizarre charm, especially "Richard." Forget Anthony Hopkins, Maidens is the guy I hired to play a raging psychopath. It seems that it pleases him so much! Blended with scenes of crazy gore and plague of zombies are some really visually effective shots of the title character, "The Midnight Skater", bringing campus in a black hoodie, looking for the whole world as the intersection Grim Reaper and, say, The Silver Surfer. These shots sometimes make the funny things that the heroes talk about the skater seem almost ominous. The soundtrack contains very funny Garage-Punk tunes and a harsh, noisy sound that blends well with the mood of the movie. Thumbs upish, I say.
