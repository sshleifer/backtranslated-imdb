is a great movie that makes the 1950s look beautiful. Kim Novak is intriguing and convincing as a modern witch with one leg in Manhattan and the other in infinity. All support shows are great, from Jack Lemmon, who interferes with Nicky, after Ernie Kovacs as the author of Magic in Mexico, who works on Magic in Manghattan, Elsa Lanchester as a slightly indulgent and charming Aunt Queenie. And then there is a cat - I have no idea how many witches (except me) exchanged the Pyewacket cat, but it suggests a million. Jmes Stewart looks out of place, but only to the same extent his character is absent in this strange sub-world of magic and spells. Ideal. And it has a perfect romantic happy ending that we believe in because the films of this year have these happy endings. Gillian and Shep will certainly have as many chances of happiness as Rose and Charlie Allnut in The African Queen (another great movie)
