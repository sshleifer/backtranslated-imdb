Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of the series South Park, come back with something completely different. They create a new sport that combines baseball and basketball. This sport is known as the baseketball. in the title there is one more letter e. Here's how you play: you just shoot the ball while those two guys try to distract you from making a shot. Simple sounds. In fact, I could try one day. on the streets, will soon become a great success. Who would know that two immature friends can come up with a sport that has become so successful? <br /> <br /> My opinion <br /> <br /> "Baseketball" is a very primitive and stupid false filled with a lot of violence, but in reality it provides some laughter and lots of entertainment. A definite recommendation for those who like slapstick and naughty humor.
