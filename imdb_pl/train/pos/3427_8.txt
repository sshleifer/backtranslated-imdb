This film illustrates the worst part of the war, memories. For many soldiers, both men and women, returning home can be the beginning of real problems. I am reminded of my father and his brothers returning from World War II. For one of my uncles, the war never ended. He survived the D-Day invasion, something similar to the first 20 minutes of Saving Private Ryan. For him, memories not only remained, but tortured him. He became an alcoholic, like a few of my cousins, his sons. Skip for 60 years and put soldiers in another war, in another country, the result is the same. When I saw this at KC FilmFest, I remembered that there is something about a war that will never change. Idealistic young men and women do not spare the emotional torments of what happened in Iraq, and especially if you are against war, you will come out with more sympathy for soldiers who are trying to do what they believe or say they are right. <br /> <br /> The story from the war movie in Vietnam says it all. "The first victim of the war is innocence."
