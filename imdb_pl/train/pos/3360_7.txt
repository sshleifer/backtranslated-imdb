She stays alone in her home when her spouse must attend a historic ceremony. Then they both develop a very nice relationship despite the differences. The action takes place at the historic meeting of Fuher Hitler and Duce Mussolini along with other authorities, like Count Ciano and King Viktor Manuel III, describing events using a radio voice that is sometimes irritating. <br /> <br /> This is a romantic drama carried out with sensitivity and sensitivity. An inexorable passionate romance between two contradictory characters. Great performances by two professionals create a great movie that is worth seeing. Of course, the sensible scenario of Ruggero Macarri and Ettore Scoli makes it always interesting, sophisticated and sentimental. Colorful and romantic photos of Pascualino De Santisa. The emotional musical score of Armando Trovajoly with a delicate leitmotif. The film won the Golden Globes 1978 for the best foreign film. <br /> <br /> The imagination of the director Scola brightens limited scenarios in which the drama unfolds.
