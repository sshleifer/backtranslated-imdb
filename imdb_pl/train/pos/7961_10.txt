"Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey" is one of those great old films about domestic animals. He deserves a place among the great films of this genre, and even generally in the world of cinemas, along with other animal films such as "Old Yeller", "Napoleon", "Fluke" and "Air Bud". It means it's more than just a movie about animals. <br /> <br /> Can this be just a "remake"? It's too good to be a "remake"! I know it by heart, from my early teenage years (when I was 12). <br /> <br /> This is a family movie of treasure. Is emotional, thrilling, adventurous, exciting, funny, full of humor, charming, sweet, nostalgic, beautiful, cordial and sometimes dramatic. This is one of those movies that makes you smile on the faces of those who appreciate this kind of movies. <br /> <br /> There is no lack of quality in this film. It has a well-thought-out history, pleasant characters, an excellent and relaxing instrumental soundtrack, dazzling landscapes / landscapes of the magnificent Sierra Mountains (in Oregon). Speaking of views, not all mountains: forests, trees, rivers, waterfalls, sunsets ... at the end, all the wonders of nature - a real panorama. <br /> <br /> The main human figures are nice, well-developed and well presented by the right actors. Robert Hays is amazing as a kind father, Bob Seaver. Kim Greist is good as Laura Burnford. Veronica Lauren is as good as Hope. Kevin Chevalia is conventional as the youngest and sweet brother of Jamie (his appearance reminds me of Kevin Corcoran in "Old Yeller"). Benj Thall is great as Peter Burnford. <br /> <br /> Regarding our quadruped buddies, Shadow is my favorite. Shadow is a loyal, wise, mature, beautiful, caring and loving old Golden Retrieve (wonderfully expressed by Don Ameche). Chance, American Bulldog, is the opposite of Shadow. He is carefree, stupid, impatient, restless, clumsy, funny and loves to play (the voice was taken by talented Michael J. Fox). Chance just can not stand. Sassy is the embodiment of a cat's image: elegant, independent, very confident and proud of the typical attitude of a cat, but with a certain cat's charm. Sassy is a Seal Point Himalayan cat, one of the most beautiful breeds of cats. Sassy is voiced by Sally Field who also does a good job. <br /> <br /> Our four-legged friends are naturally great "actors": Ben as Shadow, Rattler as Chance and Tiki as Sassy. <br /> <br /> It's an underestimated movie, but classic as such. Its sequel is clearly worse. <br /> <br /> It definitely should be on Top 250.
