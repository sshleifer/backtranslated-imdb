Daniel Day Lewis is one of the best actors of our time and one of my favorites. It's amazing how much he throws himself in each of the characters that plays, making them real. <br /> <br /> I remember many years ago we had a party at our house - friends came, we sat around the table, eating, drinking wine, talking, laughing - having fun. The television was on - there was a movie that we did not pay attention to. Then suddenly we stopped talking and laughing. The glasses did not buzz, the forks did not move, the plates were getting cold. We could not take our eyes off the screen where a young crippled man whose whole body was against him and who had only control over his left foot raised his foot with chalk and made it seem that eternity tried to write only one word on the floor. When he finished writing one word, we all knew that we witnessed not one, but three triumphs - the triumph of human will and spirit, the triumph of cinema, which was able to capture the moment in the film and the triumph of an actor who did not act, but became his character. <br /> <br /> "My Left Foot" by Jim Sheridan is a riveting, unsentimental bio drama about Christy Brown, a man born with cerebral palsy in Dublin slums; who became an artist and writer and who found love for his life. <br /> <br /> I like each of Day Lewis's performances (I have mixed feelings about his performance in GONY), but I believe that his biggest role was Christy Brown in "My Left Foot"
