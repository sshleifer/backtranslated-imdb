I saw it in the early 70s (when I was 16) and despite a long slow configuration, meetings, riots, etc., When the desert section began, everything came into context and I liked it a lot. (Still yes, it was very old.) At that time I was in something that seemed to be a small minority. All criticisms seemed to focus on the lack of action and narrative. Fortunately, I am no longer in such a minority. <br /> <br /> Cleverly shows (in a somewhat prophetic manner) political tear, anxiety, confrontation, brutal repression, commercialization and deception that awaited you. <br /> <br /> I have grown up and appreciate this main movie.
