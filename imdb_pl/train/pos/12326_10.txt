I saw this movie for the first time at the Berlin Film Festival and never before seen the cinema in Hong Kong. I wanted to sit in a roller coaster: the action was so fast and there was not one boring moment in the whole movie. He has martial arts, love, special effects and a fantastic story. My favorite scene is Taoist drinking, singing and fighting for myself - one of many scenes emphasizing the unusual musical element of the film. This movie is definitely necessary !!
