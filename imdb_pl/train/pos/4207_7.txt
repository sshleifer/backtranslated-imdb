Skip McCoy (Richard Widmark) chooses the Candy's (Jean Peters) wallet, which contains an important microfiche for the communist cause. Two federal agents follow her, waiting to pounce on her when she handles the microfiche to her contact. However, Skip steals his bag in the subway under the noses of everyone, so both the police and Joey (Richard Kiley) and Candy begin to hunt him, wanting a microfiche back. Skip can only be traced through Moe (Thelma Ritter), who sells criminal information. It is obvious for Skip that what he has stolen is important and both sides want the film, but intend to keep the price high. This leads to the hunting of Joey and the conflict between Joey and Jean, who fell in love with Skip. Joey has a deadline to deliver the microfilm to his boss. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie and it has a good start and it will draw you right away. It's a bit unrealistic how Jean Peters immediately falls in love with Widmark, but this point is necessary, or else why she would refrain from joey later. It's a good movie.
