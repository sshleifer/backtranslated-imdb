This film really did not surprise me, as it just got better and better. I thought, "Paul Rieser wrote what? Well ... we'll see how he'll do it ... "Then I saw Peter Falk in him. I appreciate Colombo. Although I have never been a big fan of the show, I've always liked to see Peter Falk. <br /> <br /> Piotr and Pawe≈Ç's performances were so natural that I felt like a fly on the wall. They played together so well that I practically felt dizzy with pleasure! ... I did not even drink! <br /> <br /> This movie was so well done that I wanted to call Paul and let him know how much I liked it! but I could not find his number. It must be unlisted or something like that. <br /> <br /> It was one of those movies I did not know what it was about, who was in it or whatever. It just came out and I thought, "Eh, why not? Let's see. If I do not like it - I do not have to watch it ... "... and it ended up being loved!
