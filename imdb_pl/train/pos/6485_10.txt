The world in war is one of the best documentaries about World War II. <br /> <br /> 24 episodes talk about the war and about how it was in the countries that involved it. The first episode tells us how Hitler came to power and how he managed to build one of the strongest armies in the world. They also deal with warfare undertaken during the war and the Holocaust. One of the strongest and best documentaries ever made. You all have to watch it. Perfection! 10/10 <br /> <br />
