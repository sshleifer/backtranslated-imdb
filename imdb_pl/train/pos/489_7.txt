Returning home after the film, I hummed the famous music of the waltz, which Natalia and Alexandre danced to. I heard it before - where? Ah, with Kubrick's "Eyes Wide Shut" (track 2), "I got it when I got to the door. It's "Waltz No. 2 with Jazz Suite No. 2 "composed by Dimitri Shostakovich, performed by The City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra. Yes, I went and took the soundtrack from the tower. What a treat! The realization of Alexandre Desplat's film was satisfying - there are fifteen tracks besides the two tracks of the amazing waltz. Nowadays, we often do not get a soundtrack entirely devoted to a comprehensive film score. It reminds me of Maurice Jarre's favorite songs, Ennio Morricone (the initial notes of song 6 have traces of "Nuovo cinema Paradiso"), Georges Delerue and John Barry. There are subtle nuances of tensions and notes from strings, celeste, piano and harp. <br /> <br /> Emily Watson and John Turturro presented reliable, paired results. Love story, their intimate relationship, is very much between Alexander and Natalia - his childhood and masculine inner world, as well as his generous and courageous understanding of him - the only relationship for both of them. Director Marleen Gorris of "Antonia's Line" (the best foreign language film from 1996 in the Netherlands) gave us a quietly sensitive film - not without disturbing human conflicts, intrigue, obsessions, family efforts, love and respect. The theme is the mental game and mathematical logic of chess. Under it may be a gentle squeezer of drama tears from the late 1920s. Pictures reflect the serene beauty of Lake Como in northern Italy near the border with Switzerland. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend the soundtrack if you do not feel like going to the cinema. The lyrical Alexandre Desplat movie "The Luzhin Defense" is complete.
