I still love it 17 years after I first saw it, in fact I discovered that I lost a copy of it and was very upset. Despite the lack of connection to the original (which I have never noticed as an infant and as an adult I do not care), that's what comics should look like *. It's enough dark enough to be interesting and light enough for everyone to enjoy it. I am more than glad that my parents raised me on this type of thing, not on the drawings we see today, and that do not teach our children anything. The music is great and stuck in your head forever ... I downloaded the entire soundtrack in one place or another.
