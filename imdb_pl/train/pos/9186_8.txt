Adrien Wilde (well played with considerable intensity by Michael Callan) has terrifying nightmares in which he brutally murders his models. When cute ladies really start to worry, Adrien worries about being a killer. Screenwriter / director William Byron Hillman tells a captivating story at a steady pace, builds a sensible tension, delivers some terribly effective moments of wild, misogynist violence (one woman who has a plastic garbage bag with a rattlesnake above her head as a clear distinction that causes twists), puts a refreshing emphasis on nicely drawn and engaging characters from life, further consolidates everything in a credible everyday world, and also complements nice, tasty feminine nudity. Great acting has helped a lot: Joanna Pettet as a sunny, charming love Mindy Jordache, James Stacy as macho Adrien double-amped BJ brother, Seymour Cassel as Adrien interested psychiatrist Dr. Frank Curtis, Don Potter as pugnacious Adrien gay assistant Louis, Pamela Hensley as brave detective from the homicide department Sergeant Fountain, Cleavon Little as a sharp police chief and Misty Rowe as a sweet, sparkling Bambi model. Polished images of R. Michael Stringer occasionally use breathtaking panoramic aerial shots. The sinister result of Jacek Goga's rattling is also successful. Appearing in cool parts is Robert Tessier as a rough bartender, Sally Kirkland as a snooty whore, Kathy Shower as a fierce wrestler B.J. he grabs in the ring, and Frances Bay in one of his standard roles of an old woman. A solid and pleasant picture.
