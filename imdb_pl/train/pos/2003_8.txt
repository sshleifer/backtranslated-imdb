The main problem of the first movie "Vampires" is that none of the characters was sympathetic. Carpenter learned from his mistake and this time he used a sympathetic vampire hunter and a charismatic vampire. Una's vampire is certainly the coolest vampire since Deacon Frost. Unfortunately, although there are good ideas, such as a cool scene in a slow-speed restaurant (why did not Carpenter use this more?) This movie is not as good as it could be. I was expecting to see strong vampires in action and at least one lasting, nicely directed combat sequence (for example in the city) and I was a little disappointed. While "Los Muertos" progresses at a faster pace than its predecessor, in some parts it is still a bit long (though not as bad as "Vampires"). Like "Vampires", but the culmination of this movie at the end is not very intense. <br /> <br /> Most of the above may sound like "Los Muertos" is a bad movie, but it definitely is not. It is generally pleasant and counts for better entries in the genre. This is neither a Dracula's un-original remake (like almost any other vampire movie), nor an unintelligent action show like Blade II. It could just be a little more exciting. <br /> <br /> I would really like to see the third installment made by Carpenter, but it probably will not happen. <br /> <br /> The SPOILER's ending was too predictable. Una should have escaped - it would make the movie quite unusual.
