My, Kasia Lemmings is certainly a beautiful woman. This movie is a lost jewel, a dead satire "mockumentary" from the early 90's in the hip-hop scene, when MC Hammer just began to disappear on this good night. We follow the three members of the NWH who set out on their spicy journey of would-be riches and fame. And like Nickolas Nickleby, at the end they end their journey near the place where they started, but at least a little wiser and less naive. This is one of the best movies that no one has ever heard of, but it's a kind of movie that you either love or hate just like a "Man of the Company" in this regard. I consider this movie to be 1000 islands of the state of New York: it's a wonderful little secret that you want to keep for yourself.
