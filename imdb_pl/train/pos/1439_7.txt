CITY HALL is a slightly mixed bag. Partial vignette of political life in New York and moralizing part. Al Pacino, Dukakis-esque Boss with presidential dreams, often gives gloomy and depressed performance. It is several times when it chews the scenery, and in the case of MIEJSKIEJ HALI, it shines there. John Cusack gives a subdued and generally flawless performance, without going into the caricature of the New Orleans dialect, nor moving in the melodrama during the culmination of films. Danny Aiello as the head of the political boss is also very good. I also love showtunes. <br /> <br /> The main problem with CITY HALL and a good movie in many ways is a general sense of lack of momentum. It's more like a document than a movie. We see the action or follow the story from a separate perspective and of course the viewer does not get involved. When the viewer does not get involved to a certain degree, he becomes apathetic towards the characters and ultimately the plot. <br /> <br /> It has a tendency to alienate, and what should be riveting, a detailed disclosure of the finale, he left as "Hmmm ... uh ... okay." They say, "You can not fight the town hall," how the used clich√© is going. However, he still can not stop you from thinking about what could have been if they had just sharpened the script and the pace of the movie.
