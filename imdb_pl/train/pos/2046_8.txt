Although the soundtrack is a bit outdated, this story is more appropriate in the US now more than ever. With not only blue tasks, but orders of all employees commissioned by American corporations, while the government gains and suffers from the Americans. His wife is well portrayed by Pamela Reed, who is very realistic, trying to support the family with her two children when Emory loses her job. The mill is closed under the pretext of mismanagement, but there are also embezzlement and cheaper wages, where they can pay one metallurgist in one month (outsourcing), which they would have to pay to Strauss / Emory in one day. It does not matter that these people are good loyal employees who have values ​​and try their best for their family. <br /> <br /> John Goodman, Gary Cole (as brother of Strauss) and several other collaborators are also affected. It is very disturbing and realistic. Some scenes between Emory and his father move. Emory hopes his local relationship will be able to reopen the mill because they promise to do so. <br /> <br /> Brother Emory, Lee can already see the inscription on the wall. In the rusty belt (Ohio) there are no tasks and they have to go further. But where can they move in the United States? Where will it be better for a worker of working-class steel? <br /> <br /> At the end there is a scene in which Emory and his crew fill the loading dock with steel products. The guard allows them to do it as the last gesture, one of the men committed suicide and empathy. <br /> <br /> In general, a good movie about hard times in America. Something few people have to deal with until they are touched personally. 8/10.
