Forget about camp "religious" films that monopolized the television / film market ... this movie has a real atmosphere. Although it can be considered a film that has cheap emotional drawings, it also has a message of forgiveness and generally good morality. However, I did not like the lighting in this film ... it was too clear for a film dealing with this subject. I felt it differed from the overall attractiveness of the film, which is an almost unforgivable sin, but the recognizable cast and their performances counteract this omission. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing ... buy a DVD.
