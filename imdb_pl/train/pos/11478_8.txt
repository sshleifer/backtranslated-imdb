Chris and Andre are two average, ordinary teenagers. Misunderstood by some and chosen by others. But they stand together and everyone will pay. Together they form the 'Army of Two'. They plan and plan "Day zero". On this day, they decide to attack in high school and inevitably murder 14 people in cold blood. Narrated by the tapes that created "Zero Day", it is just a fictionalized story about the Columbine tragedy. <br /> <br /> "Zero Day" is one of those movies that will later spoil your head. The two main actors (Calvin Robertson and Andre Keuck) do such a good job that their characters seem to be almost every childless teenager walking down the street. Their performances were very reliable, you liked these guys and it was terrifying. Making a movie almost completely from the teenager's perspective "Zero Day" seems very real and authentic, just like you are there. These children are trying to rationalize their actions towards the viewer, and the actors sell them to you. But beware that it follows a tragedy from the beginning to the end, and the ending is shocking and restless to some.
