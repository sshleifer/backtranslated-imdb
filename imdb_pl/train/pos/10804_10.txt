I was stuck in a hotel in Kuwait and happily switched to the channel showing it at the very beginning. Pachelbel's first cannula brought a lump to my throat, then the sight of Tiger's Pier (which my grandfather, my father and I flew) caused a slight dampness around my eyes, and then Crowe's name caught me completely. I was delighted with this film, Crowe's performance (again), the topic (and how debt we owe), how things were dealt with and dealt with, flying sequences (my father also flew Avro Ansons), history - and, as he noted another associate, Crowe's High Flight recitation. I will not ruin the film to anyone, but separated from my wife by 4,000 miles, as a former army officer who was sent for several wars and as a private pilot, I confess to weeping a few times. Buy, rent, get, start, borrow or steal - but look. <br /> <br /> PS Did I spy on Bristol Blenheim (in yellow training colors) on the ground? It looked like a twin-engined plane with twin bronze .303 in the dorsal turret.
