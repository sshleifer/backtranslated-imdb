The memory of "The Last Hunt" has stuck in me since I saw her in 1956, when I was 13 years old. It is a film that at that time far outstripped others, because it concerned the treatment of the natives, the environment and the ever-present contrast between the short and long-term effects of greed. This is just as valid today as in 1956, a cinematographic discussion of the greatest depth and meaning. In addition, the setting is beautiful and the photos are excellent. The memory of this movie will be with me until the end of my days.
