The intelligent, stylish and fascinating thriller of the great Brian De Palma is a modern classic that definitely counts among his best films! <br /> <br /> When an anxious housewife is brutally murdered by a strange stranger, the victim's son joins the prostitute to discover the killer. <br /> <br /> Dressed to kill left a strong impression on the audience that day and for good reason. De Palma creates a wonderfully dramatic story that begins with an intriguing configuration and turns into a shocking secret full of strong tension. The finale and the conclusion are especially "nightmarish". This is the real edge of your shocking seat. Even more impressive is the elegant direction of De Palma, which gives this film not only a tight character, but also a unique, dark atmosphere. Dressed to Kill is also a very erotic movie, but most of all strangely beautiful. Pino Donaggio also gives a beautiful musical film. <br /> <br /> Cast is another strong point of this movie. Michael Cain makes a great turn as a psychiatrist. Angie Dickenson is great as an unfortunate housewife. Nancy Allen's performance as a committed street walker is solid. Young Keith Gordon also turns out to be a worthy supporter as an investigative son. <br /> <br /> Many criticize De Palma's films for having Hitchcock elements and this film was no exception. But all the similarities between the works of Hitchcocks and De Palmas can be seen only as a good quality, because calling this film a "rip-off" would be degrading to a good thriller. Dressed to Kill is a must for all cinema fans. <br /> <br /> **** with ****
