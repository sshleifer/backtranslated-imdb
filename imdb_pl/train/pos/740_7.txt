"Lisa" is a serious look at the consequences of growing up too quickly in the 80's. And in contrast to the comedy about the sex of teenagers who have eclipsed it (Porky's, Fast Times in Ridgement High), the film keeps going well with time. <br /> <br /> His teen topic is just as important today as he was 25 years ago and Jodie Foster and sk8er afraid of Scott Baio (remember him?) lead a great young cast that is worth watching. <br /> <br /> The film is followed by four girls from Southern California, who are undergoing a bloodless existence of sex and drugs and deprived of their parents. Teens spend days at school and beyond, and nights at parties, concerts or on the street. They are rarely at home because immediate gratification is a pill, party or boyfriend. <br /> <br /> But instead of condemning them, the film is full of compassion, blaming absent, indifferent adults for forcing teens to grow up themselves. A charismatic cast can not be disliked. <br /> <br /> Opening the movie? a long and loving pan - it sets the tone for what follows. We see girls sleeping at dawn amid the objects that define a girl's teenager, from Twinkies to the photo of young John Travola, while Donna Summer's On the Radio is scored below. <br /> <br /> From there, the movie picks up speed as the girls go to school and live. Annie (Runaway rocker Cherie Currie) is a wild child who lives behind another party or pill. Deirdre (Kandice Stroh) is a crazy queen of dramas. Madge (Marlilyn Stroh) is a shy girl on her head. And Foster is the one who has a plan. Her job is to keep this team together long enough to finish high school, and also to hold a divorced and desperate man fishing for the mother in the line (Sally Kellerman). <br /> <br /> It's almost impossible and Foster finally fails at. <br /> <br /> Despite their age, "Lisa" is a pleasure to watch. Dated hair, clothes and references to the Olympic skater Dorothy Hamill did not harm the film. <br /> <br /> The pictures are simply stunning, with breathtaking filtered shots of the pool L.A. at dawn, at dusk and at night. Giorgio Moroder adds the soundtrack from the 80s with Donna Summer and Janis Ian. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the biggest disappointment of the film is that the young stars around Foster never exploded like "St Elmo's Fire" (1985) or "Empire Records" (1995). The foxes show why they should. But maybe just like in the song Bowling for Soup 1985, they just hit the wall.
