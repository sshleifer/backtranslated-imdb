Michael Kallio gives a strong and persuasive performance by Eric Seaver, a restless young man who was horribly treated as a little boy by his monstrous abusive alcoholic stepfather Barry (a truly frightening portrait of Gunnar Hansen). Eric has a compassionate fianc√© (sweetly played by charming Tracee Newberry) and a job rewriting autopsy reports in the local morgue. Haunted by his grim past, dictated by the bald, glowing Jack demon (really terrifying Michael Robert Brandon) and sent to the brink by the recent death of his mother, Eric goes from a deep end and embarks on the brutal murder of revelation. Directed by Kallio (who also wrote a concise, insightful script), with a well-balanced action by the sound no-name casting (Jeff Steiger is especially good as guardian angel Michael, wanted by Eric), rather rough, but generally polished film by George Lieber, credible real life characters, shocking explosions of harsh, shocking and steadfast violence, moody, terrible result of Dan Colton, uncompromising ending, grungy locations of Detroit, Michigan, gloomy serious tone and tight, thrilling narrative that stays at a constant level, unusually the powerful and rough thriller of psychological horror makes watching is often absorbing and disturbing. Real sleeper.
