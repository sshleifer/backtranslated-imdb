Watching Cliffhanger makes me feel nostalgia for the early 90s, when practically every new action movie can be described as "Hard Hard in / on a". Cliffhanger is "Die Hard on a mountain" and quite good as it is. <br /> <br /> But unlike Passenger 57 and Under Siege, which are decent Die Hard blocks on their own terms, Cliffhanger will give up the closed feeling of many action movies and includes breathtaking landscapes that are immensely overwhelmed and trivializing conflicts between people fighting and dying among the peaks. <br /> <br /> Years before other films such as Prosty plan and Fargo dramatized crimes and murders in snowy places, director Cliffhanger Renny Harlin saw the visual impact of a combination of brutal violence and a grim struggle for survival with a cold and indifferent natural environment. <br /> <br /> The opening sequence has already received a lot of praise, everything deserves it: its intensity allows us to forget about the artificiality of the camera and actors and just to believe that what we see actually takes place. Even Harlin's shot of a stuffed animal, which is very effective, but still threatens with a joke (and which he repeated in the Deep Blue Sea), or a ridiculous face on Ralph Waite's face, can dim the power of the sequence. <br /> <br /> The next impressive element is the shooting and assault on the plane. As Stallone and Michael France, directed by Harlin, wrote, the audience plunges into action, not knowing at the beginning which agents are involved in theft, and who do not: bloody double crosses are completely unexpected. As Roger Ebert pointed out, a stuntman who made an air transfer between planes deserves special recognition. <br /> <br /> Later, during an avalanche sequence, one of the terrorists / thieves seems to actually fall down a wall of snow carries him down the mountain. As far as I know, no one died during the creation of this film (a small miracle, considering the extreme nature of some stunts), so of course the manikin was used for the shot. But the shot itself remains impressive, because we wonder how Harlin (or rather one of the directors of the other unit) knew exactly where to place the camera. <br /> <br /> I will take Sly Stallone as my action hero every day of the week, because he is one of the few movie stars I have ever seen, which is completely convincing as someone who can withstand a lot of physical and emotional pain, and at the same time he feels this pain. The role of Gabe Walker really complements the strengths of Stallone: ​​the game of an older, more sensitive action hero, giving an impressively low performance as a mountain rescuer who must redeem. <br /> <br /> Unlike many of today's post-matrix, book-inspired action heroes, Walker Stallone is an ordinary man who becomes a hero with no paranormal or computer skills. In Cliffhanger, the hero almost dies to death, and his clothes begin to show great tears when he barely escapes from one dangerous situation after another. He curves when he is hit and bleeds when he is cut, especially in the cave sequence, when he performs Rocky-style jumping from one of the crazy dogs. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that wholly villainous villains really contribute to the effectiveness of the movie: when I first saw this movie as a teenager, I supported good boys at every step and predicted when another bad guy bites the dust (or rather ice); at some point I was really cheering when one of the coldest characters in the movie deserved a sharp fall. <br /> <br /> British accent by Lithgow is as unconvincing as an occasional plane model or a model helicopter, but he is basically a good actor and one of the few who can perfectly recite a stupid dialogue: in one scene, looking at his hostages Stallone and Rooker, trying to decide which tasks to give them, in fact says: "You, stay! You bring it! "Even a better actor like Anthony Hopkins could have trouble with this line. <br /> <br /> Even if Cliffhanger rejects credibility from time to time, it does so only because of the more entertaining program. <Br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie, for example, Lithgow speaks openly to one of his people: "Retire [Stallone] when he goes downstairs." No true master of crime would make this mistake, even unconsciously: his carelessness allows Rooker to shout a warning to Sly on the rock face, and this triggers a thrilling tug of war between Stallone and the bad guys trying to pull him over the rope tied to his leg. <br /> <br /> Lithgow could have given his order with more subtle means, but the sequence might not have been so pleasant to see if it did not give Rooker the opportunity to oppose the arrogance of his abductor. <br /> <br /> Made in the style of a Saturday morning or (sometimes) of the West, Cliffhanger is built on such a solid basis that it will survive several weak elements that have undermined the smaller film. <br /> <br /> In addition to the painfully obvious aircraft models mentioned earlier, the weak moments include several scenes shot on cheap interior sets with REALLY artificial snow, as well as two other scenes involving bats and wolves, which seem unnecessary in the story being told . Finally, Harlin's decision to film some death scenes in slow motion seems pointless because the technique brings nothing to the scenes. <br /> <br /> It's a pity Stallone is too old for action movies because his character in this movie seems so credible that I inevitably wonder what he would look like years later. But maybe it's best that Cliffhanger is alone all the time, without continuing: there are already tired and outdated films. There was an unofficial continuation, which was called Vertical Limit: compared to this clinker, Cliffhanger belongs to the list of 250 best IMDb's. <br /> <br /> Mark: 8 (Very good, especially when considering most other Stallone movies).
