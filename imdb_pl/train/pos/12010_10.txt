Warning: mild spoilers. <br /> <br /> The story of Joseph Smith stands out as an amazing - even touching - episode in American history and the history of world religions. This film presents events in the life of Joseph Smith, whom the Mormons venerate as a prophet to restore the true Church of Jesus Christ on earth. So far, I've seen this movie twice in the first month of the public screening. <br /> <br /> Joseph Smith was shown to be the youngest of three brothers (Alvin, Hyrum and Joseph), who had a very young age, needed surgery. The operation performed without our modern facilities was bloody and difficult. The stage helped show the coherence of the Smith family and the bonds between the brothers and between Joseph and his parents. <br /> <br /> The religious confusion of Joseph and the later prayers that led to what the Mormons call the First Vision were interestingly presented. The face of Jesus is never shown, but you see clear traces of nails in His hands. Rejection by religious leaders and many in his small New York community is at least slightly sweetened by the marriage of Józef and Emma. <br /> <br /> This film does not clearly show the events of the history of the Mormon church, but only jumps from stage to scene. This is not a critic - just a note about style. <br /> <br /> The practice of tarring and plowing is shown, and especially dramatic and moving, when Joseph preaches the love of the Savior with scars on his face, he has recently been attacked. <br /> <br /> The movie masterfully presents the joy and development of Mormonism as a newborn church, while still deepening the opposition, which has spread to the heights of local governments. br /> <br /> The film shows many scenes from Józef's life, including several beautiful moments showing his relationship with Emma. An attempt was made to show the depth and complexity of Joseph's life, including his fierce love for his wife, unending love for children, his wit, courage in the face of dirty and dangerous opposition, his religious feelings and compassion. <br /> <br /> When Joseph and Hyrum go to Carthage to never return home alive, most of the characters from the whole movie whose life has been touched by Joseph are shown along the way, helping to strengthen what has already been seen but setting the final scene was more powerful. <br /> <br /> Finally, the martyrdom of Joseph and Hyrum is presented, and viewers have the opportunity to reflect on the events they have witnessed. <br /> <br /> When I first saw the movie, I assumed that the Church introduced Joseph Smith to non-members. I do not think so, although I hope the movie can do it. As confidential, I think that the film is a celebration of Józef and perfectly strengthens the good things that we already know about him. I wonder how people from outside will watch this movie - whether they will see it as a propaganda, epic story of an American religious man or something else. <br /> <br /> The movie is beautifully filmed, family friendly, moving around and hopefully something good for everyone. The fact that the presented events did indeed take place in these United States of America is interesting in the light of many aspects of our culture - including the freedom of religious expression and respect (in general) for law - we, the contemporaries, consider it obvious.
