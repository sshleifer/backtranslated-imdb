As other reviewers have noted, this is an unjustly neglected film from the era of depression. Directed by Frank Borzage (two Oscars) and written by Jo Swerling (Leave Her to Heaven, The Westerat, Lifeboat, etc.), It is a difficult, well-organized and revised movement for the inhabitants of New York. . They are griffins, beggars and women forced into prostitution, but they are a community of people both good and bad, with loyalty as complex as any group. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most important among the many admirable features of this film is the contrast between the characters Spencer Tracy, Bill and Trina Loretta Young. He talks hard, is physically aggressive and apparently fearless - but Bill is not a character who gives this film a steel sense of survival. While he gets into trouble, Trina really hangs (if this term can be applied to a woman so feminine). Her devotion to him is obvious and complete. When she gets pregnant, she says she'll raise him up if she wants to leave, or "I'll even give it up if you're happy." Such is the dignity of Loretta Young's performance (at the age of 20) as a fairly simple character who does not seem to be weak or dependent, but rather a woman who recognizes happiness when she finds it, and wants nothing more.
