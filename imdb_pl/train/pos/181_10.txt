UC 0079, the one-year war is coming to an end. Neutral colony Side 6 was attacked by Cyclops, task force Zeon. Their goal, a new Gundam built exclusively for Newtypes (supposedly built for Amuro Ray from the original Gundam saga) inside. When the little boy Al Izuruha, Zeon MS fan, meets Zak after the battle of the colony, he befriends the new pilot MS Benard "Bernie" Wiseman. Both have become good friends, Al is treated as an honorary member of the Cyclops team. Through the performance, Bernie appears as a father in relation to Al (whose real father always works) and it seems that he was taken with the Federation pilot Christina McKenzie, but in the end they must meet ... in battle. Al quickly learns that war is not a child's play, and Bernie must make the final sacrifice to complete his mission. <br /> <br /> For just 6 episodes, the Gundam 0080 is a well done performance. The mobile suits are extremely well designed, and the animation may look outdated, but it really shows the emotions in the characters. If you liked 0083, check it, and if you're new to the world of Gundam, it's a good start. If you look at the show for the development of the drama and characters, this is one of them, it focuses more on the fight against mobile suits. I would judge it more as a drama than action. <br /> <br /> Gundam 0080 mobile coverall, War in your pocket. <br /> <br /> Sometimes you have to lose to win.
