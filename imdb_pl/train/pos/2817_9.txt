This review is for the extension of this movie. <br /> <br /> I saw Dragon Lord for the first time when I bought it on DVD many years ago. I've always liked this movie and you can read some of the more positive reviews of this movie to get an overall idea. <br /> <br /> That said. I've always considered the story to be a bit misleading. The film is a love story. And it always seemed strange to me that the love story should end with a 20-minute battle scene. <br /> <br /> Well, it's not like that in the extended version. The old "original" version begins with the great barrel-climb / rugby sequence, which is the new final sequence in the extended version. The opening sequence is Dragon (Jackie Chan), who revolves around his home and pretends to train and recite whenever his father is around. <br /> <br /> Other sequences have also been shifted or extended in an elongated cut and the story makes a lot more sense when you watch it. Stimulation is also better and generally works better. It feels more like a love story and leaves no questions why it ends so dramatically and dramatically as a regular version. <br /> <br /> I would suggest anyone who is a cinema in Hong Kong, or just an ordinary fanatic, Jackie Chan, to capture the expanded version and watch the movie in the way it was originally intended (or so I think it seems It was intentional, why would they do it and change some of the scenes) When I watched it, I felt that I was watching a completely new movie by Jackie Chan, although most of the sequences were the same.
