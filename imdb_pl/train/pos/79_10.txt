I loved The Real Mc Coys (1957-1963) It is a pity that Lydia Reed decided to be forgotten and not appear. She was excellent in the series. Of course, Walter Brennan was great, just like Tony Martínez. I loved it when he called Amos Señor Gramp. I bought season I on DVD and can not wait to buy Seasons 2-6. The show appeared briefly in the summer of 1999, but then disappeared. May God bless all the dead cast members and please, Llydia Reed, reveal yourself in public. You are loved and respected. Real Mc Coys will live forever.
