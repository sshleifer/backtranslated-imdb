huge Ramones fan. I like Ramones and I suppose if you hate them, apart from being an avid Bush fan, you may not like this classic. <br /> <br /> This is immeasurably better than John Hughes' teenage movies and how this littered 80s. infinitely better than the American cake that is plaguing us now. <br /> <br /> There are several other great high school movies: Switchblade Sisters, Fast Times ..., Class of '84, Three O'Clock High and tacky but catching (it does not seem possible) River's Edge. But RnRHS will always be my favorite, because it's the funniest and the most fun, and you can get up and dance with it. <br /> <br /> I love you, Riff Randell. <br /> <br /> 10/10
