My family and I have often watched this movie for years. She is clean, healthy, painful and cordial. Showing us the compassion between the two families of two countries, thousands of miles away and the most amazing coincidence, almost as if God's hand had to intervene. <br /> <br /> 5 years old Jodelle Micah Ferland, who plays Desi, a little girl, has a great job, playing her role, and for me she was the chosen Priam for the main role. <br /> <br /> In total, 10 out of 10. There is no disadvantage to this sweet human story. Children of all ages will cry, and then happily watch what the viewers bring to the family with a smile and good feelings.
