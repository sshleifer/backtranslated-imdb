It's been so long since I saw this film (at least 15 years), and yet I am still stalked by the vivid picture of the terrible consequences that prisoners of war may face despite the terms of the Geneva Convention. <br /> <br /> A unit of Australian submarine demolition experts is captured in the archipelago of Japan after a successful missions setting in the Japanese port. <br /> <br /> In prison, these men expect the same treatment as other prisoners of war, but to their horror they soon learn from a friendly Japanese prison guard that they are tried as spies because they have not been unified when they were captured. The consequences of such a violation, by the Japanese martial code, are execution by beheading. <br /> <br /> Despite their requests and requests from a friendly prison guard, the day of settlement approaches like a ticking time bomb. The tension is so high that you actually hear the ticking, though it may be your chest that hits the percussion of the marching unit. <br /> <br /> The ending is in fact too painful to reproduce in my head much less write it here. But I can promise you - you will never forget. Good luck finding a movie in the US
