A perfect interpretation of Jim Thompson's novel, this neo-noir thriller has all the necessary elements - a mad old boxer who became a vagabond, an alcohol widow with sinister desires, a former policeman who became a small cheater and intrigue of kidnapping. However, the film never enters the film, but it remains fresh and intriguing. All performances are great, especially the role of Bruce Dern as a wicked sleazebal, Uncle Bud. The film's movement has tense uncertainty which, deliberately or not, contributes to grim behavior. Highly recommended.
