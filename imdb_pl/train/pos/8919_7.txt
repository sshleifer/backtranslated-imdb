Who would have thought that Anden Griffith's "Helen Crump" (Aneta Corsaut) had Steve McQueen in his movie? But this is just one of several strange and wonderful things about the final movie from the 1950s, which can be described as "Rebel without a cause", and God knows what from the cosmos. Rebels are Steven McQueen (who would soon decide that "Steve" sounded less prissy), a good boy with so much wild nature to be interesting; a very healthy but forgiving girl is the aforementioned Aneta Corsaut. It was bad enough when their date was disturbed by teenage hot rodents, but they are much more clumsy when they encounter a gelatinous, man eating What is it that descends to the ground with its own meteor hotrod - and begins to devour the people of the city right and left. But will adults believe them? Of course not, what they know, they are only children! <br /> <br /> The film is a tiny bopper at its best. The actors are very serious about the rather pretentious scenario, with many expressive eyes, and the "adult" cast probably says "Children!" A very third sentence. But the real pleasure of the movie is a creature that is well-imagined, well-made and often manages to get a surprising degree of tension. And although definitely on a cheaper side (check out these miniature sets, guys!), THE BLOB is actually a fairly well made movie - and there is this catchy little themed song thrown in for good. The 40-plus crowd (including me) will enjoy the film as nostalgia, but it will not prevent them from jumping with the younger set with the sensitivity to all milk and white bread from the 1950s, and the film will be a great choice for a family movie night as well as more sophisticated "only for adults". Make a lot of Jello cubes for movie snacks! Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
