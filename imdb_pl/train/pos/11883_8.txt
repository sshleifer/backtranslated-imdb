I saw this movie a week ago and I still think about it. I was very moved by this film. I found characters that were very reliable and pleasing almost by fault. Just like in real life, although sometimes people are disappointing, as in the case of Leo, who even though I liked his character, I could not be more disappointed when he was willing to have unprotected sex, although he was fully aware of his HIV status. I was also disappointed with Leo for rejecting the drug he was given and the horrible way he treated Marcel when he decided to send him home by train. I think that this film showed in a very real way why the number of HIV grew in young homosexuals. In no way does this aim to break up gays (I'm gay), and the film could very well be made about a young, simple person who makes bad choices and seems oblivious to consequences for himself and others. The only part of the movie that I could not understand was why the family (gay-friendly) did not want to turn Marcel into Leo's disease to such an extent that he would not let him go to the funeral. <br /> <br /> I think the biggest message of this movie is that regardless of whether homosexual or heterosexual is NOT SEEKING UNPRECEDENTED SEX!
