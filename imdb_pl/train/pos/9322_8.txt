I am glad that someone made a film about how difficult it is to risk your heart a second time. Or third. This movie is exactly what it promises - beautiful, funny and gives this feeling of well-being around the heart when it ends. The plot may not be too inventive, but there are millions of ways to tell stories and they have not yet been used. The cast is perfectly matched, although Scott Wolf does not look like the father of an eight-year-old child, even when wearing a suit. So sparks are in all the right places, cast support is greatly supported, and although you can probably predict the whole movie, you do not want to switch the channel. It's just the right kind of entertainment for a Sunday evening.
