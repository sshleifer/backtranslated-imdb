Fox's epic tale of one of America's greatest pioneer efforts hits the DVD with truly unique "additions". BRIGHAM YOUNG ("Frontiersman" was added to the European edition), telling the story of a great pioneer leader who inspired the Mormon faith (Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) to the Salt Lake Valley in 1847, after the crowd murdered their prophet / leader, Joseph Smith (played by Vincent Price) was brought to the screen in 1940, just as America was to enter World War II. It was a bold move on Fox's boss, Darryl F. Zanuck, and it was a breath of fresh air for the Mormon people, because it was the first film attempt to show their faith positive on screen. Now Fox, collaborating with James D'Arc, curator of the excellent film archives at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, introduced the film to a DVD format in a unique edition. Mr. D'Arc, who made a doctoral dissertation about the film a few years ago, provided one of the most in-depth comments on DVD recordings. It separates facts from fiction and allows listeners to understand why these films were so valued by church leaders, even though the beautification of the truth went through the whole film. One of the interesting information concerns Dean Jagger, the actor who plays the title role. Many years after the film, he married a Latter-day Saint woman and eventually converted to LSR faith. You can learn a lot from D'Arc knowledge and it's great to have it as part of a DVD! The album contains over 100 photos from the Fox & BYU archives and film chronicles with an amazing premiere in seven theaters in Salt Lake City. Thanks to FOX for another great DVD - and thank you, James D'Arc for a great comment!
