It was a pretty good movie, I liked it. I thought it was a pretty accurate look at bulimia and how it is not about diet, but about pain so deep that they have to find a way to deal with it and choose it. Beth was a very good character and in the scene in which she confronts her mother with eating disorders, you can see the pain in her and hear her in her voice and you know how deep is the pain she feels. I also think that one of the best lines in the movie is that Beth is shouting the words "It's not about you." her mother. These words were so real and added so much to this scene in the movie. I think this scene was by far the most important scene in this film.
