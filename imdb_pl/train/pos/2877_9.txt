I do not think I have to tell you this story. Because it has been said for years and years. I will simply share my feelings. I saw Cinderella for the first time when I was five. Since then, I was a good Disney child. Animation now seems childish and old-fashioned, but now it is part of her charm. Now, in the era of High School Musical and computer-generated images, it seems that people have forgotten about the genius and magic essence of early Disney movies. Fortunately, I was born earlier, so I got acquainted with this classic. And no matter how old I am, I return to this five-year viewing of it on VHS. What is the real magic of Disney.
