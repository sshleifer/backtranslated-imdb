IQ is a charming romantic comedy with two great actors who seem to click well on the screen. The plot is a typical guy who is wrong for a girl, a guy gets a girl's format, but it's a solid point that you have to love with your heart and not your mind. The addition of Albert Einstein and his group of geniuses provides excellent comic relief. Generally a good movie. Not great, but good
