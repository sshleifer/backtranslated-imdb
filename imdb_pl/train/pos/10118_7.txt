I really like Miikes about Yakuza, the one I saw about two years ago and who really looked up. I've never seen such a sick and twisted thing before. The story is good and the actors are doing very well. I have not seen the British or Japanese version, but I must say that I believe that the German DVD is somewhat censored. If you have not seen a movie and you live in Germany, maybe you'd better look for a DVD from Nederlands or Austria. The I-ON disc contains many very difficult and nasty scenes, but during the game I felt that something is missing, about one or two very short scenes. <br /> <br /> All in all a good perverted movie with crazy characters and high levels of violence, that's what I like about Miike!
