Let's start by saying that the English title of the film "The Power of Kangwon Province" is absolutely misleading. This is because in the film Hong Sang Soo there are no real shots of wars, troubles and conflicts. the province is neither appropriate nor important in the context of this film. If we rated this movie by title in Korean, "Kangwon-do ui go" will appear as a mysterious statement about the emotional turmoil of his young heroes whose minds are not resting. Hong Sang Soo also directed a very prolific visual documentary about the irregular choices made by people in their lives. The people in question are a pair of young girls who constantly show their moods, whims and preferences. If the creation of a film from nothingness can be considered a merit of the filmmaker, Hong Sang Soo must be saluted as a brave film producer whose films talk about the ubiquitous nothingness of human relationships, feelings and life. is the only right conclusion that can be inferred from this particular film.
