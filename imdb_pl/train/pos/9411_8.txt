Sidney Stratton has problems with maintaining jobs in various textile factories, mainly due to experiments in textile laboratories. Stratton is experimenting with a recipe for a new fabric that will create the ultimate fabric that never gets dirty, never wrinkles or consumes. When Stratton eventually creates fabric, he creates enemies in all textile workers (who will lose their jobs) and owners (who will lose money because one mill has exclusive rights), so Stratton in his white suit becomes the most prosecuted man in England. The film is perfect and only Ealing could do it. The Guinness performance (and a great support cast like Greenwood, Thesiger and Parker) and Mackendrick's direction make the film a delight, but the real hero is history itself, a nice satire about business and industry with additional elements of drama, romance and tension. Rating, 8.
