I began to watch the repetition of this television movie on Sunday afternoon, thinking it was just another stupid crash of the plane crash. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> "Pandora's Clock" is an intelligent political thriller that goes far beyond the quality of most television movies. He might as well have debuted on the big screen. <br /> <br /> The cast is outstanding, including veterans Richard Dean Anderson, Edward Herrmann, Robert Guillaume and Robert Loggia. Daphne Zuniga performs in one of his best performances as a medical specialist working for the CIA, and Jane Leeves Frasier is also very good. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is well-written and the story is addictive. In fact, the last hour is so full of twists and turns that you can not leave your place for a second. If you have the chance to see this movie, invest time - almost four hours. You will be richly rewarded!
