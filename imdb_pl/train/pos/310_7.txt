Dramatic license - some people hate it, although it is necessary to repeat every life story. In the case of "Lucy" the main points of the youthful years of Lucille Ball, early career and a 20-year marriage to Desi Arnaz have been included, albeit in abridged and converted form. <br /> <br /> The main emotional points of Lucy's life are clear: Lucille's struggle to find her niche as an actress, and finally blossomed into a genius comedian who made the heroine Lucy Ricardo a legend; her stormy, romantic and ultimately impossible marriage with Desi Arnaz; Lucy & Desi form the first television empire and forever secure their place in history as the most memorable pair of television sitcoms. <br /> <br /> As Lucille Ball Rachel York does a praiseworthy job. Do not expect to see the same wonderful transformation as the one that Judy Davis did while playing Judy Garland, but York makes the ball strong, yet nice and in itself is very funny. Although her comedy time is different than Lucy, she is still credible. The film never includes details about her perfectionist behavior on set and mistreatment of Vivian Vance during the early years of "I Love Lucy", but watching York depicts Lucy by privately trying to include it. <br /> <br /> Daniel Pino is thinner and less charismatic than the real Desi, but he has his own charm and performs decent work with Desi's accent, especially on the opening scene. Madeline Zima was decent, if not too memorable, like a teenager in the age of Lucy. <br /> <br /> Vivian Vance and William Frawley were not very grateful, because Rebecca Hobbs and Russell Newman were not very convincing in their roles. Not that they were not good actors, they were not just as good as the people they played. Most of the actors came from Austrailia and New Zealand, and suppressed accents are sometimes detectable. <br /> <br /> Although the main structure of the film is based on historical facts, there are many deviations, some of the seemingly inexplicable reasons. Jess Oppenheimer, the lead radio writer for Lucy's "My Favorite Husband," which began in 1948, is presented in this movie as arriving on stage to help in "I Love Lucy" in 1951, completely ignoring the fact that he was the main creator! This film also presents Marc Daniels as the main director of "I Love Lucy" throughout its duration, completely ignoring the fact that after the first season, he was replaced by William Asher! In addition, although I think it was due to budget constraints, Ricardo lives in the same apartment for the entire stay in New York, when in reality they changed their apartments in 1953. the original also. The house in Connecticut looks very close to the original, except that the right and left sides of the house have been condensed and restructured. <br /> <br /> There is also Desi, who is talking about the purchase of RKO in 1953, during an incident with red lips Lucy, despite the fact that RKO did not hit the market until 1957. work on the transmission of the main facts, but would it hurt them if they showed a little more respect to Oppenheimer and Asher, two important characters in the history of "I love Lucy"? The biggest gaffs appear in the recreational scenes "I love Lucy", at least a few of them. It is always risky to recreate something that is captured in the film and was seen by billions of people, but even more when the OWN CHANGES are made. The scene with gigantic bread was cut off and anyone who was familiar with this episode would immediately notice the differences! The "We have a child" number was also shortened, but otherwise it was practically dead. The scene of "stamping grapes" was definitely the best, and Rachel York really put on Lucy's manners. The producers made a wise decision not to try to directly play the bits of "Vitametavegamin" and the confectionery factory, instead showing how the actors try them. These scenes proved to be effective thanks to this approach. <br /> <br /> The main mistake of the movie is that it assumes viewers know very much about Lucy's life, because many of them have been omitted or omitted altogether. In general, it gives a decent portrait of the marriage of Lucy and Desi, and the actual mistakes can be neglected when character development works effectively.
