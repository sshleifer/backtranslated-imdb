It was one of those wonderful rare moments in T.V. which I would like to capture forever in VHS. Will it never be air again? <br /> <br /> It was so creative and I remember that it was broadcast once a week, and waiting for the next episode was terrible. I want to see it all again. I want to buy it. I want what I can not have. Even on EBAY. <br /> <br /> So, after we talked, it was definitely one of the best editions of the 80's series. It should be considered classic, but lost in space. At least this website and Wikipedia mention it. Sat. <br /> <br /> It was very attractive, funny, flirty and original. Maybe not as in the original Sherlock Holmes, I think that Quintin is much more attractive and has a better chance with his leading lady than stiff and chalk Holmes.
