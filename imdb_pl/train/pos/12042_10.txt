........... like when I saw this movie) I will never watch this movie again, not because it's a bad movie, but because it scared me so much! As I said, I was 14 when my English teacher decided to show it to us; The reason for this is that we have read a part of the book. <br /> <br /> All the girls in my class were TERRIFIED when the Woman in Black passes through the window and hovers over the Kidd bed, although just before that there is something that also scares us when Kidd finds a toy soldier under the pillow and he hears the voice of a child who says "It's for you." This scene is still haunting me today, almost 7 years after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> If you are easily scared, AVOID THIS FILM !!!!!!!!
