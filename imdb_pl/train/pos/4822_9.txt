Does anyone have to hold your hand when you go up the stairs? Are others supposed to taste your food before you eat it? Are you dealing with an overloaded mother? These are just some of the obstacles that young Victoria has to face in this film (there are also various struggles for power, as well as attempts to live her life). Needless to say, it makes viewing very fascinating and informative. <br /> <br /> Before, I only saw Emily Blunt in The Devil Wears Prada (and not much more). Just like in this movie, it's unique again. I was very impressed by her image of young Victoria and I thought she managed the role very well. He makes the transition from the young Victoria we meet at the beginning of the film to Queen Victoria who later becomes completely credible. Blunt is perfectly cast in the role, showing all the different sides (from sensitive, to strong, from young Victoria who makes mistakes to the queen who takes control). You can not say enough about Emily Blunt in this role. It is - simply - exquisite, directing your attention every second on the screen. It keeps you fascinated and contains the final shot of the film. <br /> <br /> Rupert Friend also turns out to be well manned as Victoria's love (and possible husband), Prince Albert. Actors have cool chemistry and you absolutely believe in their developing relationship. They have their misunderstandings, but you can say that they are in love. Blunt and Friend are perfect for any scene they share, and you're interested in what happens between Victoria and Albert. Other actors in the film are also very good. Paul Bettany as Lord Melbourne, Miranda Richardson as Princess of Kent, Mark Strong as Sir John Conroy and Jim Broadbent as King William. There is not a single bad performance in this film. Less concentrated people are also well presented, considering how little time they have on the screen. Even the dog Victoria (Cavalier King Charles Spaniel named Dash) is unforgettable and has an impact on the film. <br /> <br /> Although the movie tends to overlook more than a few aspects of Victoria's life - especially at the end - and instead * tells * us what happened (with her and Albert) on the screen, the most important thing is what * we see *. It is finally a movie about "The Young Victoria" (not "The Middle-Aged Victoria" or "The Old Victoria"). Although there are several decorations from history in this film, he remains focused on what he intends to do - tell us about how the young princess came to power. <br /> <br /> The movie looks amazing, the costumes that Emily Blunt carries, are visually stunning, and the music only adds to the movie, it never diminishes. It is extremely curly and, unlike many films these days, this movie is really long because it does not last so long that you lose interest or feel that it is unnecessarily drawn. <br /> <br /> It goes without saying that this movie is Emily Blunt. It is in great shape here, changing another excellent performance and raising the film beyond what could have happened if another actress was cast in this important / historical role. This is one well made movie with excellent performances, which should definitely be visible. If you have appreciation for a fascinating look at a woman who was extremely important in history, then you must see.
