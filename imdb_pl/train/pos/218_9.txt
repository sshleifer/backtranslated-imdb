Taking over the roles that Jack Albertson and Sam Levene played on Broadway, Walter Matthau and George Burns play several old vaudeville comics, a band in the tradition of Joe Smith and Charles Dale, who seem to have a different view of life. /> <br /> Walter Matthau can not stop working, the man never learned to rest, take time and sniff roses. He is an old, recalcitrant mutt, whose best days are behind him, and his nephew and agent Richard Benjamin is working less and less for him. <br /> <br /> It hurt a lot that about 15 years earlier his partner George Burns decided to retire and spend some time with his family. A workaholic like Matthau can not understand this and take Burns' decision personally. <br /> <br /> Benjamin hits brainstorming, re-joins the boys and does it on a special TV show. What's happening here is quite funny. <br /> <br /> Sunshine Boys is also a sad, bittersweet story about old age. Matthau is on screen for most of the movie, but it's Burns, who graduated in the form of an Oscar at the age of 79. <br /> <br /> Burns brought a bit of personal character to this movie, okay. As we all know, he was a simple man of the great comedy group Burns and Allen, from which he borrowed a lot of Monty Python. In 1958, for health reasons, Gracie Allen retired and George reached the age of 100. At least almost as an active contractor. <br /> <br /> The Sunshine Boys is based on the Smith & Dale team however, and if you like The Sunshine Boys, I definitely recommend seeing two Broadway tickets to see a couple of guys who entertained the American audience at the turn of the last century. The sketch of the doctor who makes Matthau and Burns comes directly from their material. <br /> <br /> And I think you'll like The Sunshine Boys.
