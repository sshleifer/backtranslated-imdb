The film about the discovery tells the story of the life of one family living in a sleepy town on an island in British Columbia. Angry and sleepy people are happy, letting life go on around them until a young, freshly baked teacher, with new ideas, appears and brings life from the land. Slowly waking up is their lazy state, the father (and the director of the local school) is looking for excitement, mother for stability, the oldest daughter for love and the youngest for power. Although this is not an amazing or groundbreaking piece of cinema, the film is pleasant and pleasant for a tired night when the wind blows. Unfortunately, I doubt anyone from outside Canada will be easily accessible.
