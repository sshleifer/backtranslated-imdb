Playwright Sidney Bruhl (wonderfully stunning Michael Caine) would have killed for the hit. Go to the young wonderful kid (solid Reeve) who just wrote such a play. Get involved in Bruhl's overly hysterical wife (greatly played by Cannon) and the German psyche (very funny Irene Worth), and you have a wonderfully funny, uncertain movement. <br /> <br /> Although you can not "sleep" "standards," Deathtrap "is a very capable, full of surprises comic ride suspended based on the great game of Ira Levin. The performers apparently have a day with the material, and Caine in particular delivers enthusiastic lines. <br /> <br /> The movie loses some energy, and the ending is much less satisfying than fun in the original game, but in general "Deathtrap" is a solid, well-preserved and full of tension fun.
