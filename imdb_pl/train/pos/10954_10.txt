Sarah Silverman is like a completely manic Zooey Deschanel and I think I'm already in love. Yes, if you loved Jesus, it's magic, you'll love it. If not, how are you? Recognition for the Comedy Channel for throwing it into my face. My life finally makes sense, and "Your car smells like farts" is my kind of humor. I'm a happy guy. The first episode made me laugh hysterically and I am eager to wait for the next week. This is how Grease meets South Park. Completely outrageous. Sarah Silverman is someone I could see by reading the phone book. Its delivery is precise and so much fun. It never skips the rhythm. Think about it, it's not so much the choice of material. by the way, these are really good things, because it's the way you decide to deliver it. Thank you, Sarah Silverman! Thank you, Comedy Channel!
