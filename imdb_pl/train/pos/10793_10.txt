There are several spoilers in this comment! <br /> <br /> Unlike the comments I just read through nativetex4u and a few others, I really liked the movie and would like to see it as a weekly series. <Br> I'm a fan of Judson Mills, but also a big fan of Chuck Norris, and although I admit that a few action scenes could stretch the line a bit, the story fits into the other weekly series that are currently being broadcast. <br /> <br /> The first fifteen minutes, when Deke escapes bad people after their rockets were planted, was packed very much. I do not understand how many "professionals" were not able to hit a moving target, but the action was definitely and Deke, being a hero, had to survive. <br /> <br /> Regarding the commentary on the need to "get a movie in a can to fill the time range after the playoffs". This film was not originally scheduled by CBS for January broadcasting and filming was completed in May 2001, Good 4 months before US terrorist attacks <br /> <br /> If the commentary's author drew attention to the film, instead of trying to avoid it, maybe they would understand the plot: Rashid, a character similar to Bin Laden, planned to set off in the US for a nuclear device. The President's Man was called to locate and eliminate the problem. <br /> <br /> Maybe the writer should WATCH the movie before trying to comment on it. <br /> <br />
