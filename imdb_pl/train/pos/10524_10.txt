Jane Austen would surely praise it! <br /> <br /> Gwyneth Paltrow does an amazing job of capturing Emma's attitude. It is fun, but it is not too stupid, but elegant. He puts on a very convincing British accent (not being British, maybe I'm not the best judge, but she cheated me ... she was also excellent in "Sliding Doors" ... Sometimes I forget that she is an American girl!). <br /> <br /> Also brilliant are Jeremy Northam and Sophie Thompson and Phyllida Law (sister and mother of Emma Thompson) as Bates women. They're almost stealing the show ... and Mrs. Law does not even have any lines! <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it.
