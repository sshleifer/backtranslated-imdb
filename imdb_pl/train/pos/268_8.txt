I loved Dedee Pfeiffer (is it well written?) In Cybil. I did not see her for a moment and I forgot how much I missed her. I thought she did a great job in it. The supporting staff was also quite good. In some ways, the daughter even looked like a young Nicole Kidman. The kidnapper was quite terrifying, and the story generally had some good twists. The young boy was a hottie. I thought that my husband certainly had something to do with it. <br /> <br /> I just got Lifetime Movie Network for Christmas and I love these movies. I kept my interest and I will see them again when they are repeated. Can anyone recommend similar films? You can send a message in the forum or send me a private e-mail if you want. Thank you in advance. Aboutagirly.
