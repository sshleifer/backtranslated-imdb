Kristine Watts (Molie Weeks) is shattered, missing her lover; he can not overcome his love for him who has gone missing in the past. He employs a stranger (Douglas Davis) and gives him a list of errors that need fixing. But time is irreversible and sometimes the cure for pain is a tragic end. <br /> <br /> The first point that impresses in "The Cure" is a stylish cinematography, which is alternately black and white with color. A concise and sharp script is able to develop a tragic and grim story of love with an unexpected thread at the very end in less than eight minutes. The soundtrack is beautiful, but the volume is a little loud and is connected with the fact that English is not my native language, at some moments I had to repeat the words whispered by the narrator. Unknown main actress has a great performance and is amazingly great. I hope that I will have the opportunity to see her again on the screen. Last but not least, the debut of the director and screenwriter Ryan Jafri could not have been better. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
