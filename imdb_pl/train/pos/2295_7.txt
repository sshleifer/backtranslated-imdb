In this film is very clever humor, which is both parody and tribute to the actors. However, after some time it seems that it is a style exercise (despite great gags such as Balasko continuing the role of Dussolier and very good acting of all concerned) and I wondered why Blier made the film. All this reveals at the end when Blier, directing Claude Brasseur, receives a phone call from his dad (Bernard Blier) - from heaven and has a chance to say how much he misses him. An effective emotional and, of course, cordial whim. But there really is not enough dramatic tension or emotional involvement to make the rest of the movie interesting all the time. However, some really nice scenes and sequences, and anyone who likes these "mosntres sacr√©s" of French cinema, should get a lot of fun from this film.
