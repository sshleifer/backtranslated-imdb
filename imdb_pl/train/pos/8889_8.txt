I lived in those days and I think that the program caught the heart of the era. I believe that he should have dealt with the Afro-American question, but I think there is a lot in the program. It was terrible to sit and watch the riots on T V, hoping they would not go as far as your families and that it would not burn. I thought Jerry O'Connell did a great job presenting the vet returning from the war. I went to school with the guys who came back. Some have changed more than others and some have not changed so much. It worries me when someone comments that the problem has not been solved enough or was not enough fun. Experience it and then comment. I thought that the film is great and that everyone in it did an extraordinary job. Thank you for the trip (sad and good) down the memory strip.
