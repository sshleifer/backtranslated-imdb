We showed this film at the local Film Association, and the crowd from the house of art had the time of their cinematic lives. It is tasteless, groovy and very funny in the style of the sixties. The sketch of the Kraft Kitchen recipe made them laugh like maniacs. The rest is a mixed bag, but the highs definitely beat the lowest levels. By the way, whatever happened to Ken Shapiro ??
