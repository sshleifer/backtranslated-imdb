After the brutal murder of their daughter, Julie and Allen flee from the city to find consolation and mourning in a lonely cabin on a distant mountain. Allen's intentions are good, he wants his wife to get out of depression, resuming photography. Julie came across an ancient prison and sees the perfect, frightening, decaying setting of her photography. But when the photos are developed, they are full of dead people, and Allen quickly discovers the tragic story of suicide in their new mountain. "Dark Remains" is a pretty decent indie horror flick. It offers some real horror and a lot of tension. Acting is quite good and the photos are great at 7 out of 10.
