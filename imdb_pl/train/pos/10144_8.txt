But the fun is on the go. <br /> <br /> I think this film is very pleasant, not only the two leads are extremely easy for the eyes, the humor of the cast and jokes really made me laugh a few times. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's predictable anyway, it's a banal romantic comedy. But the point is that it is a sweet story, the message of finding the only true love also rings in a lot of ways. <br /> <br /> The dialog box is dead and works well on all parts, and on top for a comic effect. The Bulgari scene is worth its weight in gold, the actress there deserves to be honored! For those who thought it was predictable - If you want a movie with twists and turns that make you guess ... then you want to have a thriller. It's a romantic comedy ... it moved my heart and made me realize that I was lucky to find my true love in life, and it was worth every effort along the way. <br /> <br /> A great date movie, a great movie for happy crying ...
