A FLYING MAN ... tragic victim of a space race, MELTING died ... he never understood the LONG GONE BY race ...! <br /> <br /> The man (Burr DeBenning) burns the hand of a kitchen stove. But instead of shouting something that a NORMAL person is shouting, he's shouting something that sounds like "AAAAATCH-KAH !!" This movie you're in ... is not a normal movie. You just took your first step in THE INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN, the famous movie from the '70s, which includes the great effects of Rick Baker's makeup. Baker was on the verge of becoming a superstar and he did it at the same time as his famous "aliens" at STAR WARS. For some strange reason, STAR WARS have become a home name, and an AMAZING BURNING MAN no. <br /> <br /> It may have something to do with the fact that this movie is just awful horrible. From the initial credits ("In the main roles of Alex Rebar as an UNBREATING FAT MAN ..." actually says!), To a plump nurse running through a glass door, to a fisherman's head passing through a waterfall and breaking down on some rocks, this movie provides many, many moments pure incomprehension. "Why are they ... but where does he ... why are they ...?" After a while, you quit wondering why and watching what it is - a very funny piece of rubbish. <br /> <br /> Astronaut returns to Earth in a melted state, radioactive; he runs away, and his mind is falling apart in the same way as his body, he begins a crazy meltdown of deadly madness. The authorities quickly decide that the melting man must be stopped, but (probably not wanting to "panic") wants him to be captured as quietly as possible. So they send one guy with a Geiger counter behind him. Wow. <br /> <br /> Historically, surprisingly little happens during the movie. The melting guy wanders around killing people. The doctor is looking for him using a Geiger counter. Various characters are introduced, ask questions and leave. In the end, the doctor catches up with the drowning man, but is shot dead by the bodyguard for a reason after he explains that he is "Dr. Ted Nelson." Melting man goes away and eventually dissolves in a large puddle of spit. The End. <br /> <br /> It's so thoughtless that it ends with great fun, despite quite slow ending. Apparently, it is planned to release a widescreen DVD. A very special movie.
