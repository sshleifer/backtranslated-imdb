At the beginning it comes from England, so of course I had a 98% chance that it will be a smart and very good movie. I've never heard about this movie before. From the moment I saw Helena Bonham-Carter, I said to myself: Oh! This is the feminine version of My Left Foot. I was right, but I was wrong. Wrong, because both films are very different. My left foot was a film similar to John Ford, and this is a film similar to Chaplin (not because it is fun, but Chaplin in this great sense of melodrama that brings tears to the eyes). I was right because in 1990, handsome Daniel Day-Lewis becomes a little ugly, playing a crippled person and did it with a great sense of reality. Here the very beautiful Bonham-Carter did exactly the same, but with very feminine emotions. The story is well written and very intelligent. For me, Miss Bonham-Carter gives one of the greatest women in the 90s, with Emily Lloyd in Breaking The Waves. Ooops! And look at her eyes! She had the most beautiful eyes of cinema from Jobyna Ralston, Louise Brooks, Michele Morgan and Ava Gardner! It is also a real talent, as seen in many other films. See this one, you will not regret it! And Branagh's very good job!
