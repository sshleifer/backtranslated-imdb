Having the opportunity to see some of the photos in the Slavic Village-Broadway area, I could not wait to see its final copy. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie at Cleveland Premier last Friday, I did not laugh for a long time loud in comedy! It's a great slapstick. Russo Brothers did a great job. The whole cast performs their best comedy acting ... Without slow and dry fragments ... George Clooney is one of my favorite actors and is great as a crippled safe breaker in this movement. I was the most astonished William H. Macy as a cheater "Riley", and Michael Jeter as "Toto" keep you in "seams". I believe that they have the funniest roles in the whole movie.
