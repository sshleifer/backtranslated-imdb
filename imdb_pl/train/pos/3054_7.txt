"Panic" is a kind of crime comedicram with William H. Macy, Donald Sutherland and Neve Campbell in the main roles. Alex (played by Macy) is a guy who kills people to life. But for now, he faces depression and that's why he meets a therapist. There he meets Sara (Neve Campbell) and he falls in love with her. He is also facing another problem: he wants to quit his family business (murders), but now he does not know how to tell his father. <br /> <br /> Below is the story of a guy during the midlife crisis, in the face of regular problems: falling in love with a pretty young girl and everything that goes with it. <br /> <br /> Pretty good performances. Macy is perfect as depressed Alex. I had high expectations in relation to this and it was a good movie, but he is not able to realize it. The story was rather flat and banal ... <br /> <br /> 7/10
