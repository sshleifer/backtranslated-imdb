Anyone who has experienced fear of divorce, gets in the way of the hero of this indie, terrified boy who believes that the zombie is hiding in his wardrobe. Does Jake (mesmerizing Anthony DeMarco) simply "transfer" the trauma of two argumentative parents to an understandable picture? Or maybe the creation could be real? Scenarist / director Shelli Ryan carefully balances both possibilities and lets you guess the audience. Her choice of using one setting - a suburban house - contributes to a sense of desperation and claustrophobia. <br /> <br /> Brooke Bloom and Peter Sean Bridgers are very convincing as bad but loving parents. However, it's scary little characters, Mrs. Bender (Barbara Gruen), clumsy babysitter and Sam Stone (Ben Bode), a poor real estate agent who stays in the mind. Jake's Closet is a darkly inspired portrait of childhood as a special kind of hell.
