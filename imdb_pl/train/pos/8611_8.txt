I really enjoyed watching this movie. I made it during watching so I could see it later. On the other hand, I liked it more because I could absorb more clever dialogue between the two main characters, Natalie and Adam. I thought the way this story evolved was very provocative. I was intrigued by the way Natalie interacted with her daughter's friends, initially it seemed that she was going to spit out many animosities, but when it began to be more pleasant to contact, I had to see how this visit would develop. I was not disappointed. Gradually, the secrets that Sara kept in front of her mother began to reveal a daughter who was not so perfect, a flawed human being, like most of us who wanted her freedom from a dominant mother who thought she knew her daughter, but unfortunately she had to teach a very painful way that sometimes you really love someone, you have to give him freedom. The viewers who got stuck in this movie to the end saw a very moving performance of Diane Keaton (which is always great, even in some of her less well-received films - think Town and Country). It was worth waiting for the end of the Diane Keaton scene on the way home, revealing that everyone who loves another man must learn that we must live our own lives, we love others, but we are not their owners and ultimately we must let go. This is a difficult lesson, but it is worth considering from time to time. Thank you CBS for this broadcast, it was worth a long wait.
