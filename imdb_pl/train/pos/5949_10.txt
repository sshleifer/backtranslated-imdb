Hello again, I have to comment on this wonderful, exciting and credible tale of romance and intrigue. Music in a wonderful and unforgettable. A very good color film. Another film that I liked later was the High Society from Bing Crosby. Beautiful music. Thanks for listening, Florence Forrester-Stockton, Reno, Nevada
