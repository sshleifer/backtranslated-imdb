My family returns to New Orleans at the end of the 17th century at the beginning of the 17th century and, watching the film, I knew that it was a story that my grandparents never talked about, but we knew it existed. I have cousins, of course, black aka African Americans and others who can "pass" as white and did not want to. It's a difficult story to watch when you realize that it's your family they're talking about and that Cane River is part of this story. It makes me want to cry and makes me want to kick the ass of my great-grandparents who were the owners of these plantations and wonder how my great-grandmothers of African heritage lived under this oppressive, yet aristocratic existence at the same time, When I did not get out of this story, I probably would not be a woman of business success, with whom I am successfully living in a fairly integrated world today. Acting was both excellent and honest, depending on the actor, but it's a movie they NEED. Anne Rice is amazing and I ask myself why he symbolically writes about my family and I do not. I recommend this movie to everyone. Leza
