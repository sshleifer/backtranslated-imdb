Jazz enthusiasts will appreciate this classic shortcut showing one of the best jazz men who do their thing. It's like watching today's no-frills music video. <br /> <br /> Jazz men give us an additional feast in the person of Marie Bryant, who sings the classic version of On The Sunny Side Of The Street. I've never heard her sing before, Bryant sounds amazing like Billie Holliday. It's a compliment, people. <br /> <br /> Their instrumental work is also the best. At a time when black cinema was feeding on many white stereotypes, this film is to be viewed and appreciated. No great production values, just a lot of good music.
