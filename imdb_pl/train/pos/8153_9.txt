It's a really funny movie, especially the second, third and fourth time you watch it. It's quite a short movie and I definitely recommend watching it more than once, "you'll get it" more for the second time. <br /> <br /> It's like a lumbar puncture, but a rap version. It has a lot of attitude, which may be negative in rap-inspired films, but it's just a total game and is not a problem because of the irony it creates. <br /> <br /> A lot of different bits, one of those types of videos where you can find quotes with your buddies, and that will make you laugh. <br /> <br /> My favorite part are "partisans in the middle" Section. Great video, great!
