When it came out first, my dad brought him home - we were surprised - it was so different from anything we've seen before. I was looking for a specific movie last night and found "The Mind's Eye" again. The box is falling apart and I'm surprised that the tape is still working! Although it is not "finding quality Nemo", it is still very good. They should sell it again - it's the hallmark of computer animation. Highly recommended!
