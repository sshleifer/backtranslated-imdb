Contemporary viewers know this little film primarily as a remake model for The Money Pit. Older viewers are watching it with nostalgia today: Cary Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas were "superstars" in an easier, less complicated era. Was it? Of course, time has a way of modifying perspectives, and with so many films that are really failing today with social and political commentary, there is a natural curiosity about controversy over older, seemingly less provocative films. In "Mr. Blandings is building her dream home "so it can be more than what the audience was looking for in 1948. There is political commentary, however subtle. Finding a home in the late 1940s was a really annoying experience, only slightly softened by the advent of Levittowns and the like. Politics in the film? Blanding children always seem to be talking about progressive ideas that they learn at school (which would actually lead teachers to accuse communism). In Myrna's real life, Loy was a housing activist, a democrat and a feminist. Melvyn Douglas was no less democratic: he was married to congresswoman Helen Gahagan Douglas, whose young Richard Nixon accused him of easing communism (and who ruined it). Jason Robards, Sr., has a small role in the film, but his political activity was no less noticeable. More importantly, his son, Jason Robards, would have been a very active liberal democrat for many years. An almost strange companion was Cary Grant, whose sharp conservatism reflected the majority of political sentiments in Hollywood that were already escaping. But it was 1948: communism was a real threat, and the black list was just around the corner. It would be another decade before political activism would reappear in mainstream films, and then not so subtly.
