I originally rented this movie to my daughter because she is interested in football - and I was not disappointed in this way (with the exception of the plot interfering in the football scene). As a dad, I suppose I was a little surprised by the introduction of lesbianism - but I must admit that as a parent, these problems are now fully available to children (as uncomfortable as it is). In a sense, this emotion was part of the main message of the movie - at a certain age, you have to trust your children to make their own decisions. This dilemma was introduced by a young, British-born teenager - Jasminder (Jess) - about the East Indian legacy that dreams of playing professional football. The expected marriage of her older sister in a traditional Hindu marriage provides her with many rich opportunities to discover (in a nice way) her hopes and fears for her future. <br /> <br /> The multicultural challenge was a very interesting technique to investigate Jess's frustration because of her parents' expectations for her - a non-differing being from most child-parent relationships. <br /> <br /> IN SUMMARY, the football scenes are GREAT (a lot to learn in slowmo) and although I did not need a story - something was needed for the film to survive.
