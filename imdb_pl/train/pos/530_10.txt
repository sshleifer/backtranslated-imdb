The great talents of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressberger are noticeable in their wonderful "A Matter of Life and Death". It was part of a recent homage to Mr. Powell, who played at Walter Reade in New York. In particular, this movie shows us one of the best British films from this or another era. <br /> <br /> "Matter of Life and Death" has a brilliant photo of Jack Cardiff, a man who knew how to do wonders with the camera. The contrast between the monochromatic tones broadcast in the sky and the colors when the action returns to the ground is particularly impressive. It was quite a coup and far ahead of its time. The black and white sequence including the long stairs where Peter and Conductor talk, must be one of the most amazing things in any movie. <br /> <br /> Much has been said in this forum about the film, so our commentary will refer to the great acting action of Powell and Pressberger from a great, outstanding cast who reacted wonderfully to directors' hints. <br /> <br /> David Niven, it's Peter, whose plane is a hit and the best as a result of this friend dies. This film was one of the most important events in Mr. Niven's career. He was a great movie actor, as he shows us in this film. Kim Hunter is surprisingly good as June, a woman who spoke to Peter when his plane was falling from the sky. Fate would like Peter and June to fall in love at first sight. <br /> <br /> Some of the best British film actors are grateful for this movie with their presence. Robert Coote, it's Bob, a man who has been accepted into heaven, but is surprised that his friend Peter has never traveled with him. Excellent star rotation of Marius Goring, who steals film as director 71. Mr. Goring, who worked with the directors, is one of the best things in the movie. Also, Roger Livesey, as Dr. Frank Reeves, performs one of the best performances in his career, as well as Raymond Massey, who is seen as Abraham Farlan. <br /> <br /> "Matter of Life and Death" is a timeless film that will always be visible with gratitude to its creators.
