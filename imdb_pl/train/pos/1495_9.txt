This is an amazing horror anthology Amicus, with 3 great stories and fantastic performances! Only the last story fails. All characters are amazing, and the movie is quite cool and tight, and Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee are amazing! This is very underrated, and my favorite story must be the third "Sweets To The Sweet", and all the characters are very nice. Some of them are predictable, and the last story was incredibly disappointing and rather bland! But the ending was really cool! This is an amazing horror anthology Amicus, with 3 great stories and fantastic performances, only the last story is disappointing! I say it must be seen! <br /> <br /> 1st story ("Method of murder"). It's an incredible story, with a lot of uncertainty, and the killer Dominic is really scary and is very well preserved! It was the perfect way to start a story, and most of it is unpredictable, and the double ending of the action is shocking and quite scary! Class A <br /> <br /> Second story. ("Museum of wax figures"). It's a solid story around, with great performances, but the ending is quite predictable, but it's still scary and it's a lot of tension, Peter Cushing did an amazing job and I could not believe how young Joss Ackland was, I really enjoyed the story! Klasa B <br /> <br /> 3. history ("Sweets to the Sweet"). This is the best story here because it is incredibly terrifying and unpredictable all the time, it also has a nice turnaround! Christopher Lee did an amazing job, and Chloe Franks did a great job as a young daughter, and the ending is quite shocking! I do not want to spoil it, but it's one of the best horror stories I've seen! Klasa A + <br /> <br /> 4th story ("The Cloak"). This is a terrible story that is really weak and inconsistent Jon Pertwee annoyed me, but the ending surprised me a bit, and Ingrid Pitt was great as always, but it is just boring and it was done many times, and where was the creativity ?? Klasa D <br /> <br /> The direction is great! Peter Duffell does a great job, with amazing camera work, great angles, adding a little frightening atmosphere and keeping the movie at a very fast pace! <br /> <br /> Acting is amazing! John Bryans is great here, the narrator had great lines, I just wanted to have more time on the screen. John Bennett is very good as Det. And he was quite intense, he was especially good at the end! Denholm Elliott is great as Charles, he was defenseless, he showed fear, he was very nice and I loved his facial expressions, he rocked! Joanna Dunham is stunningly beautiful! And she coped well with what she had to do as a wife, she also had great chemistry with Denholm Elliott! Tom Adams is extremely frightening like Dominic, he looked terrifying and did the job very well! Peter Cushing is amazing as always and he is amazing, he is nice, focused, charming and, as usual, he had plenty of class! (Cushing's rules !!). Joss Ackland is fantastic as always and he looked so young here, I barely recognized him, his accent was not so dense and he played a different role that I liked! (Ackland rules). Wolfe Morris is terrifying here and he did what he had to do well. Christopher Lee is amazing as usual and is amazing here, he is incredibly intense, very focused and as always had a wonderful, intense expression, he was especially amazing at the end! (Lee Rules !!). Chloe Franks is cute like a daughter, she's a little scary and she gave one of the best children's shows I've ever seen !, I loved her. Nyree Dawn Porter is beautiful and she was perfect as a babysitter, I liked her fate! Jon Pertwee annoyed me here, and he was quite insipid, and completely absurd, he did not have chemistry with Ingrid Pitt! Ingrid Pitt is beautiful and does his usual vampire thing and does it right! <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is ok. Generally, you have to see! **** from 5
