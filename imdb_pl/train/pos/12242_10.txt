I consider this movie a masterpiece, but it took me at least 4 hours to see it, what a great movie it was. First, he describes a face from World War II, which we usually do not see in Hollywood movies. In particular, German soldiers, the army and the Nazi government are more "humanized". One of the facts that made the biggest impression on me was the late movie about the murder that took place in the forest in the last 20 years ... this forest is the place where the last chapters of Berlin's Alexanderplatz take place: these are forests, which Reinhold kills Mieze. Another indication for those who like details is the presentation of the door. Fassbinder is obsessed with changes in people every time they walk through the door or the door opens. Many doors are displayed on the screen, opened and closed. And characters change their personality, their actions, etc. At any moment. Have you noticed this?
