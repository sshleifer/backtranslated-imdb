One of the most nihilistic and violent movies I've ever seen, but also one of the most tragic and moving. It is a melodrama of action that the world has never seen before. Sometimes the conspiracy brought me closer to tears, and in the next moment he issued shocking revelations like hitting the bones in the stomach. Cooling efficiency Edison Chen. The story of HK-Cop and the Cambodian killer hunting each other, while losing mankind a little, is strong. "Dog Bite Dog" is very clean HK-Bloodshed without Heroism.
