Probably the most capricious edition of the first season of "Shore Leave" has its ups and downs; some parts go on for too long, and others are unambiguously shortened, but you can not deny that they have dropped everything except the proverbial kitchen sink to make it a funny episode. It seems that Kirk and his crew have found the perfect planet to go ashore after a long business trip that made everyone on board need rest, relaxation and so on. For all intents and purposes it seems to be an uninhabited Earth, with beautiful landscapes and ideal climate. The first sign that something might go a bit wrong is that McCoy, leading the team ahead of time, notices Alice (from Wonderland) following the big white rabbit in her vest. Kirk beams and discovers that others report similarly strange events and meetings. The only thing they have in common is that every member of the crew was thinking about the person / place / thing they discovered before they were discovered. It does not disappear immediately with Kirk or anyone else. There are more strangeness, including the observation of Don Juan, a Siberian tiger, a fighter plane from World War II, etc.; Kirk meets Ruth, a great old girl (of course) and a tyrant from the Academy, Finnegan. The scene of chase / fight with Finnegan takes too long, but at the same time McCoy is driven with a spear by a knight on a horse and apparently killed. Finally, an older man appears and explains what is happening. Planeta is a futuristic "theme park" where visitors only have to imagine something that will appear. Nothing is eternal; McCoy is not really dead. Once this is clarified, Kirk decides to book a holiday for everyone. Despite the ending "everything was a dream", "Shore Leave" continues as the next episode of the first season in Star Trek.
