I just saw this cartoon for the first time and recognized the caricatures of well-known black artists ... Cab Calloway, Bessie Smith, (not Josephine Baker or Sophie Tucker, who was white), Thomas "Fats" Waller, Bill "Bojangles" Robinson, Stepin Fetchit ( regardless of) Louis Armstrong and the girls from the choir are outside the famous "Cotton Club" in Harlem. The truth ... there are stereotypes, but it was ... and these stories were meant to be entertainment for adults in your local cinema in front of the main movie. <br/> <br /> The Harmann & Ising cartoons tended to be more "cutesy" and more exclusive (in the end ... we're talking about MGM) than the standard animated short remixes in Warners, Paramount, Universal, Fox, RKO or low columbia. Even the very early Mickey Mouse Disney had a lot of humor before Uncle Walt cleansed him just before "Technicolor" went. <br /> <br /> Disney had some cartoons with caricatures of black artists ... for example, Silly Symphony "Woodland Cafe" from 1937. But we must remember that these films are part of a certain time and place. In 50 years ... Simpsons videos, Family Guy and South Park will also be analyzed, analyzed ... and even slandered by future viewers.
