The movie is absolutely stupid. <br /> <br /> But did you expect a high-class intellectual film based on a comic called Slam Dunk? Really? Jaya Chou's acting is not the most moving thing I've ever seen, but I definitely enjoyed the movie. Was it anywhere near an awesome level that someone like Jet Li or Stephen Chow could produce? No, not really. Was it totally fun if you just take it to the surface? Absolutely. It is a film about Chinese idols and musicians who can play basketball at an unrealistic level of knowledge. There's a bad Triad-style guy and a crazy intriguer who's all involved with Jay Chou. Interest in love. It's formal, but really, hang a moment of disbelief. Come on. It's called Kung Fu Dunk. What do you really think? Do yourself a favor if you watch it - I found a copy with some English subtitles that made the movie almost unintelligible, but we managed to laugh at it. It would seem that they are very focused on Jerusalem and numbers 1, 10. <br /> <br /> I laughed, cried, threw. I would watch it again. <br /> <br /> Especially for this battle scene in the bar. Well choreographed and well done. I especially like the billiard table with plexiglass lighting - I would love to play on one of them. <br /> <br /> Enough for me, but I'm digging in the trash cinema.
