It's one of the best comedy / music bands I've ever seen (and because I'm now 40 and I see it now, I'm not an expert, but I've seen all the well-known movies there)). When there are a lot of actors who start to lead for a few minutes, comedy usually disturbs the musical beats and very often the music breaks the flow of comedy. Call me in a crazy mood, but when I saw it at TCM Europe, I was laughing aloud with pleasure! So who gave me laughter? No doubt Mischa Auer has provided me with amazing laughter, even steals the ending, it was great! Speaking of which, I think why this movie works, because although L & H are the selling point (and why I got attached to watching this (they and Hal Roach), I love them in the early editions of Hal Roach), it keeps them minimal and remain entirely on the ADULT tariff (according to the standards of 1930, not so far from today's standards, if you read between the lines). Jack Haley is also great to watch, I admit that I know him only from W O OZ and I loved him there, and I also laughed here with his waiter on the show. Patsy Kelly is the only "ugly" femme in movies from the 1930s that really turns me on (something tells me that she was a real gunner in real life); and the music numbers have the true quality of professional production (Busby Berkley'ish), which distracted me from what I'm used to in this genre. I could continue and continue, but you can be sure that I really liked the movie. 8 out of 10 I saw it at TCM Europe and recorded it to watch again with my wife at TCM USA. Good stuff!
