After reading other warm reviews and comments, I felt that I had to come to the cinema for this movie. <br /> <br /> Roeg movies usually have nothing to do with each other and expect it to be like one of what you liked, it's probably out of reach. <br /> <br /> What the film is about is a thoughtful and relentless look at religious faith. The only other film like this - in terms of religious message - would have to be "Capturing" Tolkin. <br /> <br /> I am amazed that someone could say that history is confused or supernatural. It's a simple movie about Catholic faith, miracles and redemption - though you would never have guessed it completely. This is also the only movie I can come up with, whose resolution is literally turned into a word game. <br /> <br /> As a happy (fallen) Catholic, I know what this film is about and I find a kind of passion in the final innocence of God and man. But if you are not familiar with the type of theology on which the film rests, it will come straight into your eyes. <br /> <br /> As a film unlike history - "Gold of Heaven" is not a breakthrough. While "The Rapture" is heavy with pictorial meaning and cinematography, "Cold Heaven" belittles its own cinematic features. There are no striking shots, no sharp effects, no attempts to match the content to the form. It's a shooting, but toned down. There is also no dialogue or action to classify him into the drama class. It is a simple story that develops simply. It may seem strange; but finally the secret is revealed. It looks ambiguous; but with one line the ambiguity disappears in the breeze of the Catholic dogma. <br /> <br /> In this regard, the "Cold Sky" has in its heart exactly the same kind of thing that drives the movie, like "Sting," or "Sixth sense" or "Final Descent" or "Pure Formality" by Polanski . All these are films with a trick in their sleeves. They can frustrate you along the way, but they really have a point - obvious - but the fun, at least partly, was taken. <br /> <br /> Still, even if it seems more than a story about a shaggy dog ​​with a punch line, it's worth observing how it directs - and guides - you. Try it - especially if you are or have ever been a Catholic.
