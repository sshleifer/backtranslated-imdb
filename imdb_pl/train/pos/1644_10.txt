I saw the other half of this movie about a year ago and I was very happy that I finally found it on DVD. I recently watched several reality series on PBS about ranching, etc. None of them were as close to telling a story as this movie. Based on real reality, without punch, gloomy, happy, tragic and enlightening, it is a film that should be shown to students or anyone interested in early life on the border. The great acting of both Rip Torn and Conchaty Ferrell add a well-written script. The introductory act states that this was done through funds provided by the National Endowment for the Humanities. If such taxes on products could go, I would love to see more. I highly recommend him and I would encourage people to tell a friend that you have seen him and enjoyed the movie.
