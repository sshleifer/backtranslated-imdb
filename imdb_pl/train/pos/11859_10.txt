In MTV sheds, all the ballers and shooters shoot from the DVD collection. It might give you an idea that Scarface is a "gangster movie". Of course, there are gangsters and crowds in it, but this is not Scarface's goal. Tony Montana (Al Pacino) is simply a Cuban refuge looking for a new way of life. He falls into a mafia group and becomes a known drug lord. Montana was for what you wanted to do with your life. The classic sentence: "Say hello to my little friend!" Is in Scarface. This quote always comes to my mind when I think about the film by Brian DePalmas, Scarface. It falls into my top 10 favorite movies. I would rate it *** 1/2 (with ****). Definitely a movie that you have to see. PHENOMENAL.
