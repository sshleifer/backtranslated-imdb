Five deadly venom is a great movie of kung-fu action wrapped in a secret. There are all the typical signs of kung-fu flick: great choreography, horrible dubbing, various "styles" of fighting and a wide range of very exaggerated, often cordial human emotions. However, the plot is certainly better than average. It is interesting and attracts attention during scenes without a fight. Sometimes it is even able to shoot an audience, for example when the character X gets terrible injustice. <br /> <br /> Another thing I love about Five Deadly Venoms is the beautiful simplicity of morality and movie themes. Almost everyone gets what comes to them. Cowardly, greedy and corrupt, they lose. Bad people, absorbed in selfish greed, are eventually destroyed by their own betrayal and stabbing in the back. Good people use teamwork, planning and honesty to overcome opportunities and get to the top. <br /> <br /> The rocks of the poison clan!
