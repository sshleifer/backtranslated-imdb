Like his earlier film "In a Glass Cage", Agust√≠ Villaronga achieves an intense and highly poetic canvas that is even more sophisticated visually than its predecessor. This is one of the most refined visually and haunted images you could see. Increased drama, intensity and tons of violence threaten melodramatic or farcish, but never come into play. In this way, he moves away from an almost impossible feat: to be so exaggerated, yet so painfully restrained, to be so charged and yet so understated, and even explosives are virtuoso feasts of the eye. Undamaged, gorgeous and very tight ... this movie is simply great!
