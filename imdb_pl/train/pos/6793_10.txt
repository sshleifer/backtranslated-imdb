I love this game to death. Since I was 9 (I am 15 now). It has great graphics, characters, magic, weapons, accessories and do not forget about the amazing forms of the dragon! I'm still waiting for a remake, prequel or sequel to this spectacular video game. <br /> <br /> You play as Dart, a young swordsman who has the potential to be a hero. In this adventure, you meet wonderful creatures and battles with the boss. Along the way, you also meet friends who have their own special element. Such as fire, darkness, water / ice, thunder / lightning, earth, light and wind. There are also items called dragoon ghosts that allow you to transform into magical creatures of a legend. Dragons, wizards, creatures called winged and evil creatures will have to face this adventure full of emotions and excitement. One of my favorite games, The Legend of Dragoon!
