74. Oscars were very good. Whoopi's job as EmCee was very fun and light. Personally, I loved her last look, which brought me some cool reviews because of the harsh language and joking jokes, but fine. The audience seemed to like it. Halle Berry, Denzel Washington, Ron Howard, Woody Allen and Sidney Poitier have prepared this Oscar TV show to remember. <br /> <br />
