It is an old-fashioned, wonderfully funny movie for children, certainly the most attractive witch for beginners. Unlike many of today's stories that seem to delight in dark sorcery, this is simply a magical tale of a hocus temptation that is charming, light and adorable. <br /> <br /> The story takes place in 1940 in the English village of Peppering Eye, in which three children of Cockney, Charlie, Carrie and Paul Rollins are evacuated from the dangers of city raids from World War II. They are mistakenly sent to Eglantine Price, who studies correspondence to become a witch. Eglantine and three children use a magic bed to travel to London on their flying bed. Here, they meet Emilius Browne, the fraudulent director of the correspondence school training the Miss Price spells. Miss Price decides to work on spells that are to revive non-living items. In the meantime, they must also deal with a suspect figure called Bookman and his associate, Swinburne. <br /> <br /> Angela Lansbury is of course wonderfully endearing as an eccentric training witch, Miss Price. David Tomlinson stars as Mr. Browne, the director of the nonexistent school of spells, who has now become a street magician. The actor was previously cast as the father of children in the movie Mary Poppins. In fact, this movie is a story reminiscent of earlier Mary Poppins, both wonderful fantasy tales for children. Perhaps this movie does not have such memorable music as Chim-Chim-Cheree, but it can boast of several attractive, small melodies. Some of them were critical, but the film offers excellent special effects. In summary, the story is a charming family entertainment. It is a pity that modern children are too sophisticated for this charming and captivating story that should appeal to the child in each of us.
