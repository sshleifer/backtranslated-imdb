Wow, I can not believe that I've been waiting for this movie for so long. I just never looked back. The plot has nothing that interests me. I do not know anything about football (football). I'm one of those American fools who have no idea. I've never seen David Beckham before. I decided to ignore the noise around the movie when it was released in America. It's enough for me. <br /> <br /> In truth, it was a mistake to ignore this little piece of film heaven. What a cool movie. It is full of colors and enthusiasm. Throughout the movie I had a stupid smile on my face. Parminder Nagra is so cute and nice that you can not help her. No wonder the American television program E.R. he kidnapped her. I have new appreciation for Indian culture. These people know how to have fun. Wedding scenes are dazzlingly beautiful. <br /> <br /> The only problem I had was to decipher some British slangs and dialogues through accents. I turned on English subtitles to make sure I did not miss anything. (This is not a movie critic!) I am sure that the audience around the world has problems understanding the ever-changing slang in American movies. <br /> <br /> This is the perfect movie with the date. He has a great sports story, such as Rocky, and a strong sense of feminism that strengthens the position of women. I watched it with my wife and sixteen-year-old niece and we all loved it. I would highly recommend.
