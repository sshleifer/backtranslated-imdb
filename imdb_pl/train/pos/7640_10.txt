Mr. Destiny - 3.5 / 5 Stars <br /> <br /> Subject "Mr. Destiny's "comes from many movies from many years. His subject ranges from recent parodies on such plots (see "Scrooged"), to the same, more serious and dramatic concept that worked in "It's a Wonderful Life", and also a hundred years earlier in the history of Scrooge, as Charles Dickens said in "Kolęda." "It is connected with the fact that the ungrateful man is taken on a guided tour of his life and a witness, how his life could be (or would be) first hand. <br /> <br /> In most of these films the Guardian Angel saves man from ingratitude and shows him his life in retrospect, or how it could be. He should have been ... In this case, we were shown a businessman named Larry (James Belushi). He lives with an unattractive wife (Linda Hamilton) and wants a bigger life with more importance. If only he hit the ball in the high school championship many years ago. He is convinced that his life would be better. he remembers this seemingly small moment of his life, because he exerted a big influence on his subconscious side, but I doubt that an adult man would miss one act from high school, but he works in the film. <br /> <br /> In any case, Larry comes back from work one night, where he is a pen with Jon Lovitz, when hello the car breaks down. He goes into the bar looking for a phone and is reluctant to tell the barman (Michael Caine) how his life ends. This is the place where we see for the first time how he mentions his baseball strike in childhood. <br /> <br /> The barman listens and nods, apparently not worrying about other customers. This is probably due to the fact that the bar, albeit old and tattered, seems to have never been occupied by living people except those two men. In fact, Larry even comments that he had never seen a bar before. This is most likely for a reason that the audience expects from Larry. <br /> <br /> So the bartender, who might as well be the angel of God incarnate, like Clarence, fixes Larry's special drink that ends up giving Larry the reverse, showing him what his life will be as if he had hit the house all these years before. But Larry at the beginning has no idea of ​​any change, just as Jimmy Stewart did not realize that Clarence had erased his life until he entered the bar and was not expelled. Larry still does not notice any changes until he goes home to find the lawn outside and the big wrestling man occupying his house. <br /> <br /> Larry quickly learns that his life would be completely different if he went home. Instead of marrying Linda Hamilton, he married Rene Russo and lived in a large residence with children. He learns that Jon Lovitz is no longer his friend but his employee. And the most surprising fact is that thanks to his new life, which Larry always wanted ... it turns out that he craves his old wife, Linda Hamilton; proof that sometimes money and a great looking, but shallow wife do not invent everything in a man's life, like a smart wife, love and true happiness. Just like "This is a wonderful life" showed the audience that man's life is what he does, and every person has an impact on people, "Lord of Destiny" shows us that material wealth is not the same as spiritual wealth, the lesson taught us repeatedly, but never so fluffy, forgotten and really sweet, as shown in "Mr. Destiny." <br /> <br /> "Mr. Destiny "is never too funny, but it is a sweet, good-natured comedy that never takes itself too seriously. The problem with all the current events of "It's a Wonderful Life", like "The Family Man", is that they try to be as influential and memorable as "It's a Wonderful Life". But there are only so many times that you can tear out the famous movie yourself, and "Mr. Destiny "knows it and plays it that way. He does not try to be anything that he is not; it's something that you have not tried to be, and that's obvious to the public. <br /> <br />
