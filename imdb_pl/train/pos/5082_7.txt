The secret fury, in many respects the turbulent romantic drama of tension (directed by Mel Ferrer), boasts excellent directors at Colbert and Ryan; remains puzzling, if not entirely catchy, until the end, when the unbelievable overcomes the suspension of disbelief - as is often the case in this genre. But for some viewers the most important event in the film will be a portrait of Blacha Leah Vivian Vance - immortal Ethel Mertz in "I Love Lucy". Oddly enough, Vance had very few film roles; her real home was Broadway, where (among others) she played the role of Ethel Merman. Here he brings the winning turn as a subordinate maid to play a smaller role in the wicked plan; observe how he tries to drive smoke away without conviction when he catches a cigarette in the hotel's underwear store - an oversight, for which he ultimately pays the highest penalty.
