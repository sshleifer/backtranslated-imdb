"La Bête" by Walerian Borowczyk is based on the short story "Lokis" written by Prosper Merimée. Lucy Broadhurst (Lisabeth Hummel), an American heiress engaged to the son of an impoverished marquise, arrives in the family's crumbling castle and learns about the mythical beast ursynowa allegedly prowling in a nearby forest. It's legendary that you were a housewife (Sirpa Lane) once had a perverse sex with the creature, and Lucy is absorbed in dreams about this incident. "The Beast" is a home-made mix of surrealistic horror, explicit madness and porn. In the priesthood, there is alleged savagery, assault and perversion, abundant false ejaculates smeared with naked breasts, masturbation with a rose and, most graphically, the title beast playing with an incredibly great phallus. This truly erotic movie is wonderfully photographed and tasteless. The women here are stunningly beautiful and most of the time they are naked. Overall, "La Bête" is a visual feast. attention to detail, or visual motifs of pregnancy with information, Borowczyk's masterpiece should be watched with attention and attention. Must see for fans of European cult cinema.
