It's an amazing movie. I do not remember when I last saw a Swedish film with layers. It's funny, it's a tragic, convincing and, above all, a piece of the Swedish town. It crushes stereotypes and lives deeper. It makes you feel connected, not only with the main characters, but with all characters. <br /> <br /> A big girl from the city, returning to her roots, to her small home town, to celebrate her father's 70th birthday, crossing paths with people she has not met for several years. Although the story itself is not unique, it offers a fresh approach. In the center of the story is the relationship between the three sisters (at different stages of life) that are not too close. Or at least do not realize how close they are. <br /> <br /> One of the main reasons why it is so easy to connect with people in this film is a flawless cast. First of all, I am more than happy with the fact that there are absolutely no so-called Swedish actors "A-list" in this film. There are usually a handful of actors who can find the way to almost every major production in Sweden. This time the production company managed to keep reality by throwing actors who seem to love their profession. Sofia Helin is probably the first Swedish actress since Eva RÃ¶se, who proved that you do not need words to convey emotions. <br /> <br /> Writing is also very attractive. Dialogue is more than credible, and in comparison with other Swedish films from last year or two, it overtakes him by a mile. Maria Blom controls everything from the beginning, and if you do not know, you would never guess that it's her first time writing and directing a full-length movie. I can not wait for the next one. <br /> <br /> When you start to watch it, you really want to see it.
