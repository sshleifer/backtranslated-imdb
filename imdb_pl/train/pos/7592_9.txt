I just finished watching the movie and wanted to express my opinion (and justice) in the film. <br /> <br /> First of all, to simplify everything, this film does not pretend anything other than a solid comedy action. It is not intended to revolutionize the film industry and gain criticism, nor does it want to be seen as one. If you really want to enjoy this movie in full, I suggest to reject the critical attitude and longing for a good story because you will not find any here. After this determination, let us enter the movie. <br /> <br /> I had low expectations for this movie because it did not have a strong plot (yes, viewers, I underestimated this movie), but I never expected that I would enjoy this movie so much. I liked it even more than Stephen Chow's cinema (which I consider Kung Fu Hustle to be his best effort and would also judge it as 9). The action is tight and epic, while the comedy suffocates in the right places. <br /> <br /> Alarm SPOILERS, I think that the action may be unrealistic, but why should I still watch a serious basketball movie? There are many other sports movies (drama) that have already done it well, why create more? The end of SPOILERS <br /> <br /> I'm not even sure why you're reading this. Go ahead and watch it. Remember, do not think - just watch, enjoy, smile, laugh and <br /> <br /> Every now and then (the film industry) creates masterpieces such as Pulp Fiction or The Godfather, and sometimes create movies that are better in the heap pile. I'm not saying that Kung Fu Dunk deserves the recognition of previous examples, and then, if we're talking about the comedy of Stephen Chow, this is the top ten. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend, if love: -security movies with really good action -Kung Fu -Death Trance -Kung Fu and comedy-what the hell, look at this. you will have a great time. <br /> <br /> 9/10 for you cast Kung Fu Dunk. ^ _ ^
