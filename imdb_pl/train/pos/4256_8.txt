Such a great movie! It warms the heart very much. You can not resist falling in love with Gigi. He is charming as a child and becomes a sensitive artist. The whole movie revolves around him. He lives in a wonderful world? live all my life? curiosity, desire and expectation. There is an older brother who is trying to steal his glory, but he is really in the shadow all his life. The father is very stereotypically Italian, just like his mother. I wanted my father to come and connect with his mother in the last scene? and let them cry and laugh. I would also like to have something to redeem in relation to my older brother. His personality seems completely destroyed. Passion and enthusiasm? this is the key to life. And looking through the camera? focusing on small details and enjoying the delicate details of life.
