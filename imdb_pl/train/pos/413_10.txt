Of course, this movie is not historically accurate, but it is great entertainment. Most of the DeMille photos, especially later epics, are slow and pulsating, but the action here moves on the clip. History is basically a series of peaks with very little moments of peace. The action takes us from an Indian raid on the cabin; one of the best parts of the movie with Jean Arthur, perfect when trying to calm the natives who were painted during the war. It happens after she and Cooper are taken to a war camp and tortured. Later, the prolonged battle with Cheyenny continues. The whole is funny, but great fun and fun from the beginning to the end. Jean Arthur is one of the best actresses of this era and shines here.
