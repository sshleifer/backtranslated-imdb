This is one of those movies for which they promoted too much. If you're watching T.V., you might as well not watch the movie. Almost all the funny scenes are broken in the preview, except for one that turns out to be funny Jennifer Annisten. This is the typical humor of Jim Carrey and is really funny. Just do not watch this movie, expecting a surprise. In conclusion, if you like Jim Carrey or comedy, then you have to see, otherwise just look up the announcements, and you'll be equally happy.
