This movie was perfect. It details the struggle between the committed detective and the devoted ignorance of the corrupt communist regime in Russia in the 1980s. I give this film high marks for not being exposed to the birth and development of a forensic investigation in an isolated global community (thanks to "Regime"). This is a graphic film. It presents an unresolved picture of violence and tragic remnants. Nothing is "covered with candy" with exaggerated blood or gore to separate us from the cruel reality on the screen. This film is based on the Russian serial killer Andriei Czikatilo. I am familiar enough with the real story to appreciate very much how much the film has been preserved. This is not a comedy, but for those who appreciate dry and dark humor, this film is compulsory.
