After watching the movie You've Got Mail and the feeling of disappointment, I decided to watch the original movie that inspired the movie, The Shop Around the Corner. I was amazed by this movie. It's a real gem and from that moment on, one of my favorite movies of all time. Acting is so perfect, the story is so beautiful that if you did not see her, I would like to convince you to see her today. I'm not against re-make'om, and sometimes I like the new version more than the original, but this time I have to admit that You've Got Mail is a poor adaptation of this classic. Do not miss this, go to the video store and rent the shop The Shop Around the Corner today!
