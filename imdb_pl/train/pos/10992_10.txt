Shit, I've seen this movie at least 4 times and I'm still not bored watching it. <br /> <br /> The graphics are so good and together with the music that is totally amazing and perfectly suited this movie is stunning for me. <br /> <br /> CGI are pretty bad IMHO, but all the graphics with a black and white feel and completely sterile interiors were just ... Just a brilliant combination for such a movie. The whole feeling associated with this feeling is indescribable, the plot is so good. <br /> <br /> However, although the movie had small flaws, such as. Sometimes I thought that the movie is a bit too "slow", but I do not mean the parts of the stage because of this, I loved them completely. <br /> <br /> Very often I was distracted in a completely complicated story, like when it is in an underground digicor-like bunker, where all their data is saved, and has that conversation with the guy downstairs ... but maybe to be just me: the end might have been somehow shown more emphasized, they should have made the memory of the "real memory" a bit longer and "louder", but then without all the flaws the movie would be so good that I would never stop it watch many times. .
