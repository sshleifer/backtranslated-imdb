When I think about Return of the Jedi, I think epic. Yeah Ewoks were there, so what? They are an interesting addition to the film (not to mention that they are similar to Vietconga, which was able to destroy the technologically advanced army with primitive actions). Jedi is definitely darker than the rest of the movies. Emperor Palpatine (portrayed by the amazing theater actor Ian McDiarmid) was one of the best parts of the movie. Palpatine is so bad and malicious, Vader looks like Mr. Rogers compared to him. By the way, Darth Vader, what an amazing end to such a cult figure. Vader is really a contemporary Greek tragedy and I think that people can now especially understand and appreciate it after the appearance of the Revenge of the Sith. His redemption at the end has moved and really brings you a happy but bittersweet feeling. The best part, of course, were special effects. It's amazing how a movie from the early eighties can survive the test of time thanks to its graphics. Scenes in Jabba's palace (Leia looks amazing in this metal bikini) and of course the epic battle at the end is still amazing. In all the deep plot and emotional moments of the Jedi (mainly between Luke Vader and Palpatine, and when Luke reveals Leia's truth) and amazing special effects is the right end of one of the most beloved series in the history of cinema.
