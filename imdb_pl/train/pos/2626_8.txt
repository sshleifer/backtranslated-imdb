"Lion King 1 1/2" is the funniest, non-theatrical Disney release. I recently saw this movie after I have not seen it for many years. I remember the first time I saw him, I had no expectations and I was pleasantly surprised by this watchful and very funny movie. <br /> <br /> Is it better than "Simba's Pride"? In many ways, yes. Although "Simba's Pride" was not entirely evil, he suffered from some problems: lack of good script and bad characteristics, which influenced what was otherwise a good movie. <br /> <br /> In any case: it's nice to see Timon's Personality and Pumba bloom again in the way that we (or certainly me) loved them in this movie; in "Simba's Pride" they were totally annoying and I did not like the "Timon and Pumbaa" series. <br /> <br /> This movie could easily be stupid, but fortunately the filmmakers did not take it in the wrong direction and instead I focused on making this movie very funny at times. There are a few jokes that adults can enjoy themselves. The result is quite good. There are two new songs that are catchy and two new characters, Timon's mom (sonorous recognizable Marge Simpsons' Julie Kavner) and Uncle Max, which are nice. The friendship of Timon and Pumba is poignantly depicted. Emotional scenes are well integrated into the comic story and do not feel out of place, which can be easily done (especially in comedies). <br /> <br /> But is there something that distracts this picture from getting 10 votes from me? This is. Although fortunately they do not affect too much, but I will mention them: 1. Many scenes from the first movie are used in this. Personally, it was strange to see old scenes integrated with new ones. <br /> <br /> 2. During the culmination, some jokes become poor. <br /> <br /> 3. In a nutshell, this is the story of Timon, and although filmmakers try to integrate their story with Simba, it makes the script feel hasty sometimes. <br /> <br /> But hey, these details do not affect this funny movie. This is the only really acceptable continuation of Disney, which should be included in every movie collection.
