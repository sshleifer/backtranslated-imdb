Sopran√≥w is probably the most opening mind you ever want to see. He is clever, bizarre, funny - and he has such a good mafia genre that most people can not resist watching. The best aspect of this show is the overwhelming realism of the characters, set in the underground world of New York's criminal families. Most of the time, you really do not know if wise guys stab someone in the back or buy him a lunch. <br /> <br /> A further addition to the realistic approach of the protagonists of this series is the depth of their personality - they are dangerous people, mostly murderers, but by God, if you do not love them. I laughed at their wisdom, I was torn when they made a mistake, and I was afraid of the sheer ruthlessness of a serious criminal. <br /> <br /> The suburban neighborhood of New Jersey is absolutely ideal for the subtext of this concert - people are not always what they seem, and the sharp contrast between humdrum and the actions taken by these seemingly minor criminals weighs even on chances. <br /> <br /> If you have not done it yet, you definitely should.
