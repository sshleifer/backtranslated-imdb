I saw this movie at the Toronto Film Festival, where he received a standing ovation! This film tells a story I did not know about earlier - namely the creation of the Rosenstrasse (street in Berlin) of German gentile women who married Jews at the end of World War II. As such, it is a unique story, and what's more, it is the only film about the Holocaust I have ever seen, which shows that there were GOOD Germans (for example, a helpful family in "Anne Frank" was a Dutchman) who did NOT support the Nazis and actually had fortitude to oppose the immorality and brutality of their country during the Nazi regime, risking their own lives. Acting is excellent, the story of the setting in New York interesting and intricate, the direction from Von Trotty to perfection in every scene and production value, including great pictures, great. Of course, the family in New York could speak German. Many immigrants in this country decide to talk to their family in their native language - this is a frequent phenomenon. So this criticism is unjustified. To say more would ruin the experience. The film is long, but I did not look at my watch once. I hope this film will gain some distribution in North America, because this film is not only a masterpiece, but it can even help treating any hostility people have towards Germans because of their support for Hitler. If this movie is playing in your area, I WELCOME YOU TO VISIT! You'll be glad you did it!
