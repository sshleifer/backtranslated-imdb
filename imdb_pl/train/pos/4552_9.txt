Daniel Day Lewis in My Left Foot gives us one of the best performances of the actor. He is brilliant like Christy Brown, a man with cerebral palsy who learned to write and paint with his left foot. Deserved Oscar for him and Brenda Fricker, who plays his loving mother. Hugh O'Conner is great because younger Christy Brown and Ray McAnally are great as a father. It is worth to watch outstanding performances.
