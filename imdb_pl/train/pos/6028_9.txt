It is a film in the mid-term of Antonioni, which most critics quickly reject as a "flawed" look at American culture / politics of the 60's youth. For what is worth it, I found it more touching and unforgettable than its more appreciated films, such as L'AVVENTURA, perhaps because it shows more emotion and empathy here than anywhere else. History is simple, but it is used as a frame for brilliant observations and critiques of American consumer culture, student life, counter-culture and the entire anti-establishment, anti-war reaction that was then so visible. <br /> <br /> Even from a purely technical point of view, it is an unusually crafted movie; from the initial sequence of subtitles to the bizarre "love-in" desert, from the use of billboards and up to this stunning, cleansing finale, which uses 17 camera settings (in its own way, as powerful as the climax) The Wild Bunch). In addition, Antonioni chose the hell of a leading lady with Daria Halperin, one of the most beautiful in the world. There is not much "acting" in it, because it seems more like a documentary drama, and therefore the use of non-professionals as the main pair works quite effectively in this context. The soundtrack is not only full of great music, but its use is impressive (I can not forget about the beginning of the movie, mainly due to the selection of music - Pink Floyd - which brightens the visuals so well). <br /> <br /> Contrary to popular opinion, this is quite a good achievement in the cinema, which I would recommend enthusiastically to anyone who has the taste or tolerance for off-beat. It is worth looking for and one of the key films of the 1960s, which requires restoring / releasing a DVD.
