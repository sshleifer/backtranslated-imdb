There are no movies to rent, I chose Freebird. I struggled with the first third of the movie, wondering if the rest would be a loss to see. Fortunately, it really warmed up and I really enjoyed the movie. In the second half of the movie, I smiled and laughed all the time. Fortunately, although CGI fragments were included, they were not exaggerated or widespread. <br /> <br /> But I must say - the actors have heavy European accents, so be warned if you have trouble understanding these voices or their cultural humor. <br /> <br /> I really loved this movie and I will have to order a copy for my collection.
