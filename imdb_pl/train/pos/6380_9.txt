Atlantis: The Lost Empire is a better movie than I thought. I never thought that this movie would lead to my expectations. It's true that this movie started slowly, but as the film wore it, it became more like mine. The story takes place in 1914 and concerns a guy named Milo. Milo believes in the legendary Atlantis. Together with his grandfather's friends he sets out on an amazing adventure. Along the way he must endure friendship, betrayal, trust and more. The voice cast is great. They certainly know how to wear movies only with their voice talent. Music is not anything special anyway, but nice. Animation is not the best, but it's still good enough. Overall, this is a good family movie for all ages. I rate this film 9/10.
