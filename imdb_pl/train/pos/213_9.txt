Walter Matthau and George Burns were the famous vaudeville comedies Lewis and Clark, who have not spoken for over 10 years. Burns retired and Matthau took it personally and has a grudge ever since. This is the premise of this fun Neil Simon game in the movie. Of course, what makes him so good is Matthau and Burns in their prime, and the material is more fun than anything you can find today. Richard Benjamin shines as a nephew and agent of Matthau. There are even old clips of real stars of the golden era that will bring you to the rhythm of the film, and the characteristic actor Fritz Feld starts everything from "pop." Rosetta LaNoire, who started in the 1930s in the theater with Orson Wellesem, and later was a grandmother in "Family Matters", is great in a small role. <br /> <br /> The only problem I've had with it is too picky and / or serious) is the way Matthau treats Burns when she first meets. I admit that he has had a lot of injuries festering over the years, but some of the things he does would be considered rude or just plain bad manners taken out of context. I got used to Matthau playing in this way in other movies, but not George Burns. And, Matthau's roar tends to age. <br /> <br /> All in all, if you need a consistently funny movie to help and forget about the troubles, put in "The Sunshine Boys". They will lift your spirits and make you think about a simpler time and way of life. <br /> <br /> Benjamin: "You have to move it." <br /> <br /> Matthau: "Wait, wait. I think you have to move it. "
