A masterpiece of comedy, a masterpiece of horror, a masterpiece of romance, if there is something negative to say about the Chinese ghost story, perhaps the special effects looked outdated compared to modern technology. The film has a simple assumption: a poor debt collector must stay in an isolated place, trying to collect the debt. Of course, it happens to be haunted. <br /> <br /> I did not expect it the first time I saw this movie, it is one of the most moving love stories I've ever seen; without losing any slapstick comedy that will lead you to the seams. Unlike some movies from Asian cinema, the Chinese ghost story is not difficult to swallow for those who do not know Chinese culture. Indeed, it plays on timeless, cultureless paranormal and romance themes. <br /> <br /> Think of Evil Dead 2 if they threw a great love story into the mix. This movie is real, despite being overlooked by many. This is absolutely one of the best I've ever seen. It is fantastic to combine the best aspects of many species and cross cultural boundaries to attract mankind everywhere. I highly recommend, 10/10.
