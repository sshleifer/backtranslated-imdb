As a pagan, I must say that this film has little, if any, magical significance. It's a "funny" movie about spells and it's not meant to teach us anything except that love is the strongest magic of all and you should never use it in a controlling or vindictive way. This is a lesson that everyone must learn, not just pagans. <br /> <br /> Saying this, this movie is beautifully written and beautifully made by Kim Novak and venerable Jimmy Stewart. <br /> <br /> Hermione Gingold plays the star as Bianca, Elsa Lanchester (with too many movies to mention, except that Mrs. Jane Marbles of "Murder By Death") was great, like absent on the mountain Queenie, absent but life-capable Mrs. Novak. Also with Jacek Lemmon (a great performance) and Jim Kovacks (brilliantly witty). <br /> <br /> "Witches can not cry. Why, they can not shed a single tear because their heart is full of Magic. you do not have time for stupid things like love. "Queenie. <br /> <br /> Gillian Holroyd (Novak) and her brother Nicky (Jack Lemmon) are witches from Manhattan. Deeply cloaked in the secret underground of the Craftsmen, they live among other New Yorkers as one of them, without even raising their eyebrows. <br /> <br /> But then comes Shepherd "Shep" Henderson (Stewart), a steadfast, devoted businessman who is engaged to old rival Gillian. <br /> <br /> A strange accident finds its way into the Gillian building and immediately becomes enchanted with its grace and grace. Using Magick, with a little help from Pyewacket (a friend of Gillian, trained by Robert E. Blair) and Queenie, Gillian begins working on this handsome new dreamer to return to his old enemy. <br /> <br /> But Magick should never be used to control or hurt, and Gillian learns it in his own way in the most bittersweet way. She not only has to face what she has done, but she also has to face Shep in her guilt. <br /> <br /> From a critical perspective; however, the film has a serious turnaround: the effects are very outdated to the extent that they are a pure camp. Part of the scenery was seemingly filmed in the basement of someone's little home, but at least the characters were bizarre and funny. <br /> <br /> Personally, Pyewacket steals the show. Big cat! A great training for Robert E. Blair. <br /> <br /> As a curiosity, this is the roots of the beloved TV series Witch. This introduces the original Samantha and Darrin. All attention signs are present and accounted for. You just have to look to see it yourself. <br /> <br /> It's one of my favorites and I often watch it. <br /> <br /> This movie has 9,1 / 10. .. <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
