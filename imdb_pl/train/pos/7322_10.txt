Halloween is one of those movies that make the skin deep! In my opinion, this is the scariest movie of all time. Michael Myers is the best boogeyman ever! He was so terrifying! What makes Halloween so special is that there were no special effects in which you can say how the computer is animated, it was low budget and had one score, but it managed to scare Hell from people. 25 years and this movie still has the same effect as in the year 78. <br /> <br /> It's about the boy Michael Myers, who kills his sister at the age of 6 and many years later escapes from the psychiatric facility. Dr. Sam Loomis followed him and would do anything to get him back, because he describes Michael as "... pure evil. Darkest eyes, devilish eyes. " Michael is on a mission to kill his second sister, Laurie, played by new Jamie Lee Curtis. She must look after children in Halloween, while her friends play and of course we know the rules, they get it! But Laurie may have a chance because she is a virgin. ; D <br /> <br /> Halloween consists of many Psycho tributes, we have another character named Sam Loomis and Jamie Lee Curis, daughter of Janet Leigh. Halloween is a great movie that breaks the boundaries and makes you close the door, close the windows and turn the lights off! "They will get you! They will get you! " Halloween, the best horror! <br /> <br /> 10/10
