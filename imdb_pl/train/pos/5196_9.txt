Human Tornado (1976) is in many respects a better film than its predecessor. The director knew what he needed to work with and limited himself to the limitations of Rudy Ray Moore as an actor. It's a fun movie that's more technical and works. Contractors do not take themselves too seriously and it seems that this time everyone is joking and goes hand in hand. Rudy Ray Moore seems more relaxed in front of the camera and not as stiff as in Dolemite. <br /> <br /> I liked the movie very much and I highly recommend it. Like his first film, he is directed to a certain audience (I doubt very much that Mr. Moore would try to broaden his audience at this point in his career). Check it out! <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it.
