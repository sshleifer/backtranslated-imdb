This document really opened my eyes to what people from outside the United States think about the September 11 attacks. This film has been professionally submitted and presents this disaster as something more than an attack on American soil. The consequences of this catastrophe can be seen in many different countries and perspectives. I believe that this film should be more widespread at this point. It also helps in the healing process to finally see something other than reports of terrorist attacks. Some songs are really fun but not offensive. This film was highly recommended to me and I convey the same feeling.
