Gandhi My Father is a well made film. It presents the life of the eldest son of Gandhiji Haril nicely. His character, differences in relation to his father, his love for the family, the desire for independence, defeat, ego ... Akshaye Khanna completely justifies the role of Harilal. It was not him, everyone did well in the roles they played. Darshan Jariwala is the best Gandhiji on screen I've ever seen. But I will shorten three points because there were a few shortcomings. <br /> <br /> First, the movie lasted fifteen minutes longer than it should have been. Secondly, the film required further research on the character of Harilala. Somewhere the figure looked incomplete. In addition, his relationship with his brothers was not shown. There was no mention of any other Gandhiji child in the whole film. I believe that a character like Harilal should have at least some differences between the brothers, taking into account the selfish nature of Harilal. <br /> <br /> In any case, despite some shortcomings, I liked the movie. Recommended ...
