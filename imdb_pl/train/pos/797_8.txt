Those who did not follow the case of the murder of Anne Marie Fahey. You miss one of the saddest but complicated murders. The murderer is a popular advocate of Delaware, Tom Capano, and the victim is Delaware's Planning Secretary, Anne Marie Fahey. Their relationship was kept secret until it disappeared and murdered. She wanted to leave him, but he just would not let her go that easy. On the other hand, he had a mistress, wife and four daughters. Where did he find time for two lovers and family life? In addition, the case is extremely complicated and fascinating in a four-hour mini series. While the actress who plays Miss Fahey does a good job, there are no dark long hairs. His other lover is definitely more attractive than a real woman. Mark Harmon has a better look and performs the award-winning Emmy role of Tom Capano. It would be better with real locations in Delaware and Philadelphia. Together with executive production, Ann Rule adds accuracy to Anne Marie's characterization and her personal fight against eating disorders. These pieces of information can be overlooked by any other executive producer or director. If you have not read the book, it is worth it. Ann Rule is a fascinating storyteller of a real crime. It is ironic that Mark Harmon plays Tom Capano. He also starred in the former adaptation of Ann Rule, Ted Bundy, in the next adaptation of the book many years ago. He was brilliant then. He does extraordinary work with an amazing story. Even President Clinton offered his help in the case of Anne Marie Fahey. And now the former Governor Tom Carper is now the Senator of the United States for Delaware who defeated the long-standing, popular senator Richard Roth in the November 2000 election. If you think the film is not interesting, read Rule's book.
