This movie is amazing - it's like a nightmare. A bizarre story, dark decors, everywhere crawling with insects, jumping ideas and surreal dreams ... Really great! People who love iconic movies or very dark thrillers consider it fantastic. It seems a bit like David Lynch's films: a strange story, bizarre dreams, red curtains. Nuit Noire contains almost no story. It is rather a series of surreal events, nightmares and meetings. It's a flaw. If the movie had a really fascinating story full of tension and compelling solution, I would give it 10 out of 10. But it's missing and that's why I gave it to film 8. Nuit Noire is a movie worth watching. Search the DVD and you will be rewarded!
