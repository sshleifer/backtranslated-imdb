It was different, for sure. Just look at the cast! Talk about freaks. <br /> <br /> William H. Macy and Ben Stiller were the stars, although a group of actors almost share that attention, in this farce of superheroes. The most outrageous was Paul Reubens of the fame "Pee Wee Herman". <br /> <br /> There is a lot of humor, noisy colors and no silence. It's quite a funny, light comedy with stupid characters, everyone wants to be a hero and la Superman, Batman, Spiderman, name. However, they have talents in strange areas that true heroes do not (and do not want!). It's stupid, but you know it's happening. <br /> <br /> It's also a movie that you can watch in installments and do not miss any continuity. It's a long film for one so hectic, so break here and there is fine. The language was gentle, so the children could also enjoy it. Actually, I do not recall any cursing here, except the guy in the theater next to me, who kept saying: "What a stupid movie fans". I thought two hours was fun, but I'd rather watch it on DVD and take a few breaks.
