Reign Over Me (titled after song) is a movie that will surely bring a tear to almost everyone. It was a moving story of a guy (sandler) who lost his family during the attacks in the World Trade Center on September 11. Years later, he runs into an old roommate who is not even recognized because of the dramatic stress of losing a family. They both rekindled their old friendship, and the character Cheadle, Johnson, realizes that he must get help from Sandler, Fineman, before it's too late. <br /> <br /> It was the first movie that made me cry for a long time. It is totally worth watching and after seeing this, I am convinced that the viewer will appreciate his family much more.
