This is a poem about the film, wonderfully presented and photographed with delicate artistry. It perfectly reflects the atmosphere of time and place. (Italian lake district in the twenties.) It's a love story with a surprise. The characters are unique and reliable. The settings are wonderfully exotic. Some scenes - a funeral boat in the fog - a long shot of a chess table in the middle of an intricately patterned floor - are beautiful pictures. And instead of the obligatory ending of a happy one, this story has a bitter sweetness. If the film is an art, it is close to a masterpiece. <br /> <br />
