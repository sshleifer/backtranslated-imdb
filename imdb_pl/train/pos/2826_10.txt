I received the opportunity to watch a movie from 1926 in a wonderfully restored theater, which was once part of the extensive Paramount vaudeville network. This Paramount has a Mighty Wurlitzer body? also wonderfully restored - which was used to accompany silent films of the day. <br /> <br /> We were lucky that Dennis James, a key figure in the international revival of silent movies, played for Mighty Wurlitzer. musical and themed compositions adapted to the action on the film. The printout was an almost perfect digital copy of the rapidly disappearing nitrate negative, and the whole experience was a one-time chance to watch a silent movie that was supposed to be watched. <br /> <br /> This was the first American film by Greta Garbo. She was only 20 years old, but in her repertoire she already had 6 Swedish films. <br /> <br /> It's pretty ironic that it's a quiet movie about an opera star; although Mighty Wurlitzer added enormously to the poverty scene, it was necessary to leave a lot of imagination. <br /> <br /> Today's viewers mostly do not understand silent movies? Acting was different then, with expansive gestures and a wide expression on the face. Therefore, the audience laughs at inappropriate times? acting is perceived as "hammy" and reworked? but it was simply a style of the era. <br /> <br /> Garbo, with all her subtlety, did a lot to start a new era of acting: she could say more with half-closed eyes and volumes can read a look down or a simple shrug. It is an example of the truism that "the picture is worth a thousand words". <br /> <br /> Even if it's the first American movie Garbo, it's obvious that the studio knew what they had on their hands: it was MGM's film in the best way. The sets and costumes were great. Special effects ?? which according to today's standards are quite weak? they were still electrifying and amazing. <br /> <br /> Writer Vicente Blasco Ibanez (from Entre Naranjos's novel) seems to have been created especially for Garbo; shows her strengths, heightens her strengths and no problem with the language: a Swedish actress can play a Spanish temptress without suspending disbelief on our part. <br /> <br /> Her star was MGM's answer to Rudolph Valentino: Ricardo Cortez. He's doing an admirable job and did something that few romantic stars would do in the daytime in the movie: let yourself look idle, look stupid and grow old awkwardly. <br /> <br /> There are quite good parts of the characters that are more than adequately preserved? especially when you consider the power that Garbo was. Among them, Lucien Littlefield stands out as "Cupido" and Martha Mattox as "Do√±a Bernarda Brull". <br /> <br /> It was then that an extraordinary operator, William H. Daniels, met Garbo? they made 20 films together. (He was the cinematographer of 157 films, and his career lasted for five decades!) He managed to capture her ethereal beauty and it was his photography that was primarily responsible for the monograph thanks to which he became known: The Divine Garbo. Without his great skills, he would not be the success she was. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie is too rare: if you ever have the opportunity, do not miss it.
