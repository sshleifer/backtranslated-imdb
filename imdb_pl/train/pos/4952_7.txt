Reviewed during the second screening of September 12, 2006 at the Paramount 1 Theater at the Toronto International Film Festival. The film premiered the day before in the Elgin Theater VISA. <br /> <br /> The basic story includes Morgan Freeman, who once played a popular actor who is on the slope of his career and who takes on roles that can be under him, but which he still does with a positive attitude knowing he has to pay rent, etc. The downfall is indicated for a long time between the roles of previous films in bargain DVDs and his chauffeur by a not-so-confident production assistant who throws Freeman out of the local social market, where he intends to conduct research as a supermarket manager. He soon discovers that the real market is managed by an official from the "10 items or less" line, played by Paza Vega. When Freeman's rides never come back, and Vega needs help in preparing the interview, the circumstances make them join forces in a city tour, make Freeman come home and get Vega to get a job that will give her a more mobile career path. <br /> <br /> While the movie was pleasant, it seemed like it was still a sketch or work in progress. There were two extensive musical sequences (one with songs by Vega and Freeman teaching each other songs for children in the car, one literally playing like a music video by Paul Simon), who wanted to pad, to extract time, and even then the movie only had 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> It's good that Morgan Freeman is just as well-liked as he is, because without him it would not be enough. Sure, it was fun in some parts, and Paz Vega is also delightful, but there was not enough to say that it was a complete movie. <br /> <br /> They lost me when Morgan Freeman started talking about stopping the car, ask for directions, and Paz Vega said he never did. Who has ever heard of a guy who would like to ask for directions and a woman does not ?! In the real world it is exactly the opposite. <br /> <br /> Make sure you stay with your credit expense. The piece in which the Target Store saleswoman teaches Morgan Freeman how to speed up sales is simply fun! The early moment Freeman's driver insists that Freeman's voice read "The Book on the Tape" was also quite funny. <br /> <br /> Director / writer Brad Silberling and actress Paz Vega have been there for short questions and screening. Silberling answered one question saying that the script was not written specifically for Morgan Freeman and that when Freeman took on the role, in fact, he did not change much from what was there. Quite a compliment for both Silberling's work and how Freeman can just get into the role and make him feel completely born to play.
