In the early seventies, many of us who embraced hippie / acid / alternative culture wholeheartedly realized that the mainstream society would not change in the way we thought. For me, this movie described the tension "now what?" That many people I knew felt at the time. Do we go to the commune and create our own vision of utopia, or do we radicalize and strive for change? <br /> <br /> From futile gestures to the police, radical rhetoric, Pink Floyd music, to love - creation and explosive images in the desert - so much is there. It captures a significant moment very well.
