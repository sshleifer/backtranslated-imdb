Despite all the madness, respect and recognition of this film from Kung Fu historians, he still lacks glaring in several critical areas: action and fight scenes. But I must say that the plot is probably the best and the most original one I've ever seen in a martial arts film. Five deadly venom is definitely a necessity, not just a movie that can be seen many times; but I must also say that after seeing this, you feel that it could have been even better. Somehow leaves you something to be desired, you want more. Producer Chang Cheh beautifully creates a story for potential masterpics, but does not follow her, giving us more of the action we want. Fight styles in the film really capture the viewer (Centipede, Snake, Scorpion, Lizard, Toad) and are shown, but the battles are noticeably short. The Toad and Snake styles are particularly intriguing and should be shown much more, in fact Toad is killed in the middle of the movie. Interestingly, in this movie, the lack of continuous actions or fights leads to the creation of a great story, it is one of the few kung fu movies in which you really are interested in the story and take care of the result. This film has a dark and malicious tone, and you are getting into the climate. The film uses ominous weapons and tactics of torture that add character to the film. To start the film and introduce the producer of the Clan of Poisons, Chang Cheh takes us to a dirty dungeon. The final battle scenes are certainly good, but they seem suppressed and you somehow expected more. Despite this, this movie is one of the best Shaw Brothers and is quite pleasant. My general impression about the film will end with the following statement: the styles used by fighters are only shown to us and are not presented in detail, but it is sad that the director had something extraordinary at his fingertips and did not develop on it. I wonder what could have happened with this film, though still one of the best. 8 out of 10 on the scale.
