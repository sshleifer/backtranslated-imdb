This first part of the BRD trilogy has more passion and plot density than Lola, but less of the magic of Veronica Voss. Political considerations make sense for them: we see shortages after the war, how black marketers were able to control so much everyday life (a delicious moment when Fassbinder, playing on a grifter, tries to sell a complete set of Kleist to Schygulla, who notices that flaming books they do not provide much heat: they really want wood for fuel). <br /> <br /> There's a bit of awkwardness in the first hour. The scene in Maria's room with the black soldier, interrupted by the appearance of Hermann, should accelerate. The scene of the train, when Maria meets Karl Oswald, falls down when she insults the GI - I cringed, it was so bad. But with the development of history and the passage of years, I was increasingly attracted by this shiny, cold world.
