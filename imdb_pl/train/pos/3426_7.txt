This is not a film criticism, but rather a comment about how we are blind to our past. <br /> <br /> Recently I watched Winter Soldier, and The Ground Truth was like watching a remake or sequel - except that it was more about Iraq than Vietnam. Like Winter Soldier because of the unilateral message, both films illustrate how joyfully we are in a hurry to engage in conflicts based on false claims, and let our young and courageous (and often na√Øve) bear the burden of this greedy speculation in the war. Both films successfully show that a mentality driven into young and willing minds makes them efficient killing machines, but training is pitifully insufficient to teach diplomatic and police skills necessary to effectively win the hearts and minds of people they allegedly have to fight for. It eventually lost the war in Vietnam and will probably lose the Iraq war. <br /> <br /> My only negative comment is that the film is so one-sided that it can easily be dumped as a leftist propaganda. Not by me, I think, but by those who want to discredit the film and the message. A more balanced point of view would appeal to a wider audience.
