A great movie about the life of an old man who looks back over the years. From about 1910, he mentions his boy and his youth; his family, friends, romances, etc. A very nostalgic song about the bittersweet finale .... "all things in life are combined into one whole, and the river flows through it. And this river persecutes me. " Worth seeing.
