"Matka" is a strange low-budget film that touches at least two uncomfortable topics that are usually not discovered in the cinema: denying mother's love for her own son and daughter, and lust and passion in the third century. <br /> The heroes are terrible: May is a disgusting old lady and I believe that she can not feel any sympathy or sadness. She confesses that she did not love her son and daughter. Twice she cheated her husband with an intellectual. He steals his beloved daughter's man, not protecting her from a man without morality who does not love her, but only because he feels horny with him. She tries to organize her life after losing her husband in the worst possible way, destroying her daughter's delusions. Paula, her daughter, is a fragile loser who accepts her life as it is. Her brother Bobby is a man who has lost his savings because of his wife, who insists that her store is really terrible. Darren is an amoral addicted moron who does not like anyone, not even himself. <br /> <br /> Acting and director are excellent: actresses and actors have outstanding achievements, and the direction is very precise. I liked the movie, but I realize that it is recommended for very specific audiences. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Recome√ßar" ("Re-Start")
