Irving Berlin, musically speaking, gave Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers another perfect Top Hat music if it was possible. Although in this case, like Jerome Kern, Robert, in which they were, Follow the Fleet stopped Randolph Scott with another singer, this time Harriet Hilliard. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott is a career Navy CPO and Fred Astaire is a former vaudevillian who enlisted in the Navy to forget Ginger Rogers, his former partner. But now they are both on the shore. Fred and Ginger occupy the place where they end up, and Randy accidentally meets the clever sister Ginger, Harriet, who thrives on true beauty. But Randy is a typical lover and leaves a sailor. <br /> <br /> Again, Irving Berlin wrote a score full of scores, in which he closely supervised production. Ginger makes really great vocals from Let Yourself Go, which later they dance with Fred. But the real hit of the series is Let's Face the Music and Dance, which is the number made at the Navy's show. Sung first by Astaire, and later danced by a couple, Let's Face the Music and Dance is one of the great romantic numbers ever written on the screen. Their dance on this is absolute magic. <br /> <br /> I'm sure when I mention Harriet Hilliard, some young people may ask who it is. But they will know right away when I mention her in connection with her famous husband Ozzie Nelson. This is Ozzie and Harriet. It's a mystery to me why Harriet stopped singing when she became a mother on TV as David and Ricky. Then she did not even keep her name again. <br /> <br /> Neither Ozzie nor Harriet sang on television. Ozzie was a pale imitation of Rudy Vallee as a singer, but Harriet could really wear a melody. She sings Get Thee Behind Me Satan and The Moon and I Here, both with real affection and class. I recommend to see Follow the Fleet, if for no other reason than to hear the dimension of Harriet Hilliard amazingly forgotten today.
