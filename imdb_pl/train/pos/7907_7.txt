I could not disagree less with the rating that was given to this film and I think it's a sample of how the short-sighted majority of viewers are around the world. Really ... Do you forget that Cinema was once a kind of art before some potentates tried to make it just entertainment? This movie is not entertainment, at least not so easy entertainment that can be seen in films such as Titanic or Gladiator. It's got style, it's different, it's shocking ... That's why most of you hated it because it does not try to be nice to you. It's just a story, very strange, which I admit, but in the end only a strange story. This is not a great story, even a great job at the cinema, but I think it's worth getting a 7-star rating only for the courage of both the author and the director to make a story that is not aimed at satisfying the recipients and thus selling billions of copies and makes great studies even richer. This film is, for me, a film reminiscent of European artistic art produced in the USA, and all those involved in its creation deserve respect. Whether for courage or for a unique sense of humor.
