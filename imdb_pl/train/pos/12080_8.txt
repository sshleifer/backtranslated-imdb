Julia Ross (Nina Foch) agrees to assume the position of secretary in the wealthy Hughes family to defeat her boyfriend who leaves her. Almost immediately, she is drugged and sent to her family estate in Cornwall. When she wakes up, they tell her that she is Marion Hughes, she was mentally ill and kept her locked up ... but why? You'll probably guess why, but you do not mind because this one is funny. <br /> <br /> Along with the "Narrow Margin" and "Face behind the mask" this is one of the best B photos ever made. (Photos B were low-budget photos taken quickly at low budgets and without big stars). It's as long as it should be (only 65 minutes), it's well-targeted, fast and exciting. Only stumbles at the end, which I think is unlikely to buy. <br /> <br /> Foch (a good actress) is fine at the head, but Dame May Witty is great, and George Macready is perfect (and terrifying) as a villain. It's worth catching. A great example of how you can make a great movie with a small budget.
