See this movie to see great pictures of Andy Goldsworthy sculptures, and enjoy a completely relaxing experience. Music perfectly complements the material, but never attracts attention. Some commentators called fragments of the interview a weak point, but think about why you would develop this movie in the movie, can you read Andy's reflection in your books for a long time or participate in one of his excellent lectures? This medium is much more suitable to show the ephemerality of the artist's work and is expertly used in this field.
