This movie will not fit well with some, but it has to be seen. I am glad that someone finally raised the discussion about the HOW realities of African couples who worked to form a name in communities and how many of them tried to stay there as "other" African Americans moved in. <br /> <br /> (Minor Spoilers) <br /> <br /> This little Showtime movie is almost like Spike Lee Joint ... you have an African American (Danny Glover) who has worked hard on traditionally white law positions in the Years 70th. Like EVERY American, he moved his family to be compatible with his mobile status, but he forgot that there were still many problems. The only African Americans in those days were maids. One with a house? Wow. <br /> <br /> Then the mixing started. His wife (Whoopi Goldberg) has the task of "getting involved", so she does what all other women in her neighborhood do. And just when a man thinks that he and his family are "in", another African American who comes in next door comes because they won the "lotto" (Mo'nique), and in his eyes I do not want to have anything to do with them because I do not want the neighborhood to think that they are similar to each other. Of course he has a better caliber, his new neighbor is a "ghetto", and it should not be there! Who has a problem now? <br /> <br /> What this movie shows you is the great pains that this family has to fulfill and how they get lost in it. It makes you wonder where racism begins ... and with whom. It shows how no matter what the color and how much money you have, you can still cut yourself off from the real world and help those around you. It also shows how these African children, when they "mingle" with such districts, fall into the trap of changing themselves to fit the culture (full of blond hair and blue eyes, remember!) Around them. They laugh at jokes, not knowing they are a joke and they do not know ... why. <br /> <br /> But in general, this movie is about "people". No matter what race you are, this movie gets into how awful you can be with your neighbor and with each other ... everything because of the fit ... everything because you feel that you have more money than others, so you automatically it creates better - and you forget about the struggles you have and those that follow you. <br /> <br /> Again, NOT for everyone. But look and judge for yourself. <br /> <br />
