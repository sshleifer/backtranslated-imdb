Yes ... I'm going with this 1-0 and here's why. In the past few years, I've watched a few comedies and left only a few gentle laughter and a few fees for borrowing a few movies because the movies were so easy to forget. Then I came across "Nothing." It looked interesting, but I did not expect too much. I was wrong. It was probably one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Dave and Andrew create a great comedy pair, and the humor was catchy enough to remember, but not too complicated, to the extent that he missed a joke. I do not want to talk about any of the real scenes, because I think it is a movie that is worth seeing once. With more and more senseless concepts coming to movies (you know how deadly military jets and "fresh" remakes that ruin old classics), this movie will make you happy to say that you can laugh at "Nothing".
