The problem is that the film was based on a coattails concept created in the 1960s that comics can only be done as a "camp" (ie a Batman show from the 1960s) for television and film. This way you have combat sequences with subtitles (Come on!), Incredibly unromantic Doc Savage (he was uncomfortable towards women in the body, not an idiot), Monk Mayfair in the night sheet (a scene that nightmares you for a few nights), and totally hokey ending with a secondary bad guy locked in gold like Herve Villechez posing for an Oscar. And when they do not do the flourishing results of Sousa's march, the fabulously small "funny" music cuts most of the drama. <br /> <br /> Even as such, this movie is ... fine. It's funny, and when it's serious, it's a very accurate reproduction of the pulp. Except for Monk, as mentioned earlier: he is very muscular, not fat. And Long Tom, who should be a pale, skinny guy with an attitude, not Paul Gleason with an (inexplicable) scarf. <br /> <br /> For example, Green Death sequences are extremely gruesome, not something I recommend for children. But they are very close to the feeling of pulp. When screenwriters and producers are right, they do it well - I will give it to them. <br /> <br /> But if the producers did Doc with love and scripts, say, Reeves, two Superman films, think what we could have then. I think the problem is a schizophrenic film. There is a clear sense of trying to pay tribute 30, but they are also trying to surrender to the attitude "heroes must be camp" created by Batman. You get the impression that it was the first sober design in the style of pulp, then someone came in and said, "Hey, let it be fun - he worked with the Batman series 8 years ago!" <br /> <br /> But Doc lives on thanks to Earl MacRauch and Buckaroo Banzai. If MacRauch does not pay homage to Doc Savage in this movie, this man is really mad. So, when the show actually goes to television (allegedly mid-season '99 -00), Doc Savage, updated to the 90s, will be alive again.
