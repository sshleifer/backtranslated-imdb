He ran 8 seasons, but it is the first, in early 1959, and the last, in the autumn of 1965, was shorter than seasons 2-7. Head of CBS William Paley canceled Rawhide's production after watching the first show of season 8, in September 1965, because he did not like the series without Eric Fleming as Gil Favor, who left after season 7. The last new episode was broadcast in November 1965. A single CBS broadcast from 1966, January 4, 1966, was a repetition. <br /> <br /> I've often wondered why Rawhide did not switch to filming last season? Most of the big westerns from the 1960s turned into color in 1965. In autumn, the CBS broadcasted many of their sitcoms colorfully, but westerns such as Gunsmoke and Rawhide remained in black and white. Gunsmoke was the last western (and the last series of the main time network that switched to color) on September 17, 1966, in the episode "Snap Decision".
