I absolutely loved this movie! I do not refer to all the other comments I have read about at all. I was COMPLETELY charmed with every second! <br /> <br /> I found a story of thrilling, acting intensity and direction on the spot. I would literally jump every time the phone rings near the end of the movie. Even though there was nothing "terrifying" in the story itself, I was still sharp throughout the movie - and for the rest of my evening. <br /> <br /> I discovered that there were so many excellent choices ... casting, script, small pieces of humor that appeared in it. There were so many points where the movie could go for a cheap thrill, but it never happened, and for me I put this movie above so many mediocre thrillers that have recently appeared ... and until the last number of years.
