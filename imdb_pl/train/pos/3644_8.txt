The Rookie is based on the true story of a 40-year-old teacher in Big Lake, Texas, who reaches major schools. Jimmy Morris (Dennis Quaid) is a small-town science teacher and baseball coach. His team loses tremendously until the team reveals that their coach has played in smaller leagues and could throw a 98 mph jump. <br /> <br /> After throwing a bat and placing the bet, Jim agrees that if his team wins a regional one, he will try the major leagues. The film tells a story from Jimmy, who is a boy, to play his first game on major tournaments. This is a great unsung story and a very friendly family film. Dennis Quaid makes the film worthwhile, giving an emotional performance and is supported by an excellent cast, which includes: Brian Cox, Rachel Griffiths and Angus T. Jones. <br /> <br /> The story takes some time to develop, and some scenes are a bit slow, but everything works fine. Baseball scenes are fun, well filmed and perfectly presented. The film is not really about baseball, but about the pursuit of one man to achieve his dream. It's inspiring, emotional and fun. I liked it, I hope so. <br /> <br /> The Rookie. Performers: Dennis Quaid, Brian Cox, Rachel Griffiths and Angus T. Jones. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 5 stars.
