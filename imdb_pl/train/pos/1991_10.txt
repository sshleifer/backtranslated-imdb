Yes, but maybe unbelievable, in 1968 the musical won the Oscar for the best picture - and it was the third musical that won this prize in five years, the first was My Fair Lady in 1964, and then The Sound music in 1965. The difference between My Fair Lady, The Sound of Music and Oliver! however, this is Oliver! it is extremely better! There's no comparison. The first two films are bland wet pasta compared to the extremely solid Oliver !. Acting is great; the songs are great; the story is great and the dance is great. This film is dynamic, up-to-date, connected with human experience and in contrast to the overblown gangs of New York, Oliver! it depicts a picture of poverty in nineteenth-century London, England, which evokes compassion without condescension. Oliver Reed was a great actor and he proved it in Oliver! The other actors and actresses, especially Ron Moody and Shani Wallis, are equally great and offer powerful portraits of characters that evoke sympathy and warmth without caricature.
