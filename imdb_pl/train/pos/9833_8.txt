A terrorist tries to steal a top secret biological weapon, and while trying to escape, he becomes infected when a case containing a mortal agent is threatened. The soldiers are able to recover the suitcase, but the terrorist goes to the hotel in which he tries to hide. In the end, they reach where he is hiding and "cleanse" the hotel and its residents. Unfortunately, they got rid of his body through cremation, and if you saw the Return of the Dead, you know what will happen next. <br /> <br /> Zombi 3 has been widely mastered by critics and zombie fans as a complete mess of the movie. Although it is an honest assessment, it was not without high points. First of all, he has a lot of bloody deaths to make gore-dogs happy. There are tons of zombies that seem to come out from everywhere. They are in the water, rafters of houses, hide in trees and for some reason like to hide under a band of dead brush, to jump into attack, when the heroes try to escape. There is even a flying zombie head that hides in the fridge. You have to believe it because the scene itself makes the Zombi 3 require you to view IMO. He may have some horrible editing and very doubtful acting, especially from a doctor who must be one of the worst actors I've ever seen, but Zombie 3 is still a very funny movie. Sometimes it's nice to sit down and watch a movie that requires nothing more than time and an open mind. Zombi 3 matches this bill, and then a little. It's even nicer if you open a few beers and watch them with similar-minded friends. I give him 8/10, only because of pure pleasure.
