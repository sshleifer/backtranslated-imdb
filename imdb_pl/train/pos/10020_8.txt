The legendary Boris Karloff ended his great career by making four cheap gadgets in Mexico. It is a symbolic, moody period of the gothic horror group. Karloff gives a typically cunning and dignified performance by Matthias Morteval, a senior eccentric patriarch who invites several of his petty, greedy and abusive relatives without resorting to his terrifying ruined castle to read the will. Soon, the hated guests run into deadly, funny people who inhabit this place. The symbol of Mexican sex Andres Garcia from the disgrace of "Tintorera" shows the bold hero of the policeman, and Julissa looks amazing as the only nice female figure. Awkward, clumsy, uncomplicated scenario, ugly, erased movie, funny parts of the murder (a fat fat shot is shot straight into the face by a miniature gun!), Overworked result on the string, morbid, dark atmosphere, mostly bad acting (especially Karloff), cheesy mild gore, bad dubbing and thrilling fiery conclusion - all this gives this pleasantly horrible lemon a certain endearing, primitive, and therefore strangely funny honesty. A real hoot campaign.
