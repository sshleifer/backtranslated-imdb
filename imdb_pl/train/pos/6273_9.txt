I really loved the movie, yes, I know it was quite far, there's no way that Shelby could stay on the road, like the 540i with all the traction control and other gadgets, but otherwise the whole movie was well prepared. Cage was as perfect as usual, and the rest of the cast was pretty good, with the exception of Brit Bad Guy, he was a bit 'no', how do you think? Besides, a great movie, great cars and a great game. On the one hand, I made sure that my car was shut and disturbed in my remote-controlled garage that night. :)
