After an anonymous telephone conversation about a spaceship that would crumble in frozen wood, two policemen find evidence that the event really happened and apparently one Martian went away. They enter the nearby Hi-Way cafe, where buses stop and seven passengers are waiting for the re-opening of the snow-covered bridge. The driver says, however, that when he parked the bus, he had only six passengers. During the interrogation of travelers there are strange things in the dining room, with switching lights on and off and switching the turntable on and off. When the passengers are released, and the bus follows his journey, one passenger returns to the dining room and reveals the conspiracy of invading Earth. <br /> <br /> "Will a Real Martian rise?" is one of the best episodes of this great series. An intriguing story has ironic and witty dialogues, funny characters and situations, and a surprising and completely unexpected thread at the very end. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "About Marciano" ("The Martian")
