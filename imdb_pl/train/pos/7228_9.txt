An undoubted attraction of this film is the performance of Peter O'Toole. In turn, extremely comical and terribly tragic. Does anyone do it better than O'Toole? I do not think so. What a great face this man is! <br /> <br /> The story is strange and quite disturbing and emotionally intense in part (especially at the end), but it is also strangely moving and successful on many levels. I felt, however, that the film basically revolves around Peter O'Toole's luminous performance and I'm sure he would not like it half as much if it was not in it.
