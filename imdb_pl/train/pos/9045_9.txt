There are some curiosities to be mentioned on the stage at the beginning of the movie, where Homer observes the trial of December 6, 1957 (At least that was the video watched on the TV), which showed the attempt to shoot Vangard, who failed. <br /> <br /> Then it is shown by reading or dictating a letter to dr. Von Braun, who expresses his condolences on failure. <br /> <br /> Von Braun was in the Marshall Space Center in Huntsville for the army. The Vanguard project was made by the early Nasa team, which became the Goddard Space flight center. <br /> <br /> The army rushed to Jupiter-C, which was basically a V2 technology made in the USA, but he was working on launching the satellite in response to Russia's success with Sputnik. <br /> <br /> This error could actually have been committed by Homer, because of the publicity of Von Braun, but his team did not fail. In fact, the underlying Redstone flew with 52 and was the first human-rated amplifier used for both Shepard and Grissom's orbital flight. <br /> <br /> That's why this kind of movie is as good as I hope it will inspire people to read and notice these little things, and see what has been done in the process and get inspired to do more.
