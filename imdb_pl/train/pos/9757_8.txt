Richard Willaims is the god of animation. He made it difficult for the producer to direct this film. The final product is a very uneven movie with a very intricate story, but a few amazing moments of animation (such as "Greedy" by Emery Hawkins). Repeated music by Joe Raposo also does not help. It has been made on a wide screen, so VHS does not show it in all its glory, hopefully one day on a DVD with letters. It's still worth watching some popping animations.
