On July 19, I went to a small screening of this film, knowing only the names of several actors and that it was some kind of fantasy / adventure. <br /> <br /> The story really is not what I saw, and the unique story is certainly appreciated along with everything that is currently in theaters or soon. Despite what they can give first impressions, it is not tacky, trashy, cheap or funny, and is really fun and fun. The flow is quite good, nothing rushes or pulls out. The soundtrack, for lack of better words, is magical and adds a lot to the movie, as opposed to simply filling in silence, as is often the case in movies or on television. And though I could know what was coming in the points, I still could not stand the screen; to my knowledge, not one person left the theater during the entire movie. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that there seems to be almost no marketing in this movie, and just as brilliant as I can not figure out why.
