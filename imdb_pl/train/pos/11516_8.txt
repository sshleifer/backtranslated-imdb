I'm not a specialist from John Cleese (although I thought that "Fawlty Towers was brilliant", but I'm a fan, and when I saw this neglected sitting on the shelf in my local Blockbuster, I decided to give it a try, what I got was a wonderful surprise and one of the funniest 50-minute presentations I've ever had. Writing is a typical English "goon show" schtick.In fact, as a skit, it would not be out of place on the album "Firesign Theater", but the performance and time are in place, which raises "Strange Case" for this kind of stunning performance that can create British fanatics of comedy for a lifetime. <br /> <br /> The British have a gift combining satirical pamphlets with carefully observed "tics" of character and time, and the creators use both of these elements for a good effect, he has such a talent for physical comedy that he sticks to his own but unexpected feast here it is Arthur Lowe who plays "Watson" as a brilliant but invincible imbecile with such a great time and delivery that he becomes the best aspect of the film. I have never heard of Lowe before (his origin seems to be vaudeville and musical theater), but justifies his entire career with this performance, if it concerns me. <br /> <br /> Some people may not care about the "Strange Case ...", especially if the British caprice is not their "tea". But I'm glad I could see it before it disappeared from view.
