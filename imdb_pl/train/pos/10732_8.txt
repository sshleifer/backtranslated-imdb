I could see this movie is great. He did not surprise himself when it happened for the truth, in the same way that he flew a flight to the one that did not take place, but that's just such a conspiracy theory. Right? <br /> <br /> I really liked watching this movie when I was a kid. I'm interested in what would happen if it turned out that such a flight really took place, certainly not for faith, because it contradicts logic and common sense. Who from healthy senses is sent to children with a space shuttle to orbit. I really like reading American, Soviet and space programs on this subject. I know that several space shuttle missions were delivered by the CIA with the TOP SECRET clause, they are certainly only my agonies, but who knows?
