Reading some of the comments on the forums here, I was expecting this movie to be a complete disappointment - but when I watched it, I could not stop laughing! Officially, it became my new favorite movie. <br /> <br /> I do not know what's going on with all hatred, maybe because this type of movie has never existed before. I can not call another comedy completely driven by a woman. Many comedies will have one or two actresses at the helm, but there will be many supporting male characters. This was almost ALL of the women - except for Seth Meyers, Justin Hartley, and the short appearance of Willa Arnett - and it worked. All the actresses presented very funny performances (especially Missi Pyle) from a bizarre and sympathetic scenario. <br /> <br /> The charm of this film seems to me in his subtle feminist message: acceptance of who you are, success of women in the public sphere, strength of women's friendship and breaking of gender roles. Still, each of the main characters faces a challenge because their attempt is more "funny", contrary to their feminist values ​​and who they knew. <br /> <br /> Missi Pyle suggested that this movie lost its premiere because of the female cast and the lack of a famous actor who would allow the label to stand behind it and I have to agree. All those who recommended this movie liked it and I think it is a shame that the comedy celebrating the female abyss has not been widely accepted and successful. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie to anyone with an open mind or love of a woman-centered comedy.
