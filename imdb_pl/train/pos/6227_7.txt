Definitely one of the smaller Astaire / Rogers musicals. It is simply poorly drawn and walked. For example, it works only a few minutes longer than Swing Time, but it seems much longer. This is partly due to the second romance of Randolph Scott and Harriet Hilliard. Scott is rarely interesting. I like Hilliard. She's cute and I love at least one of her songs, "But You Are You You?" ("Get Thee Behind Me Satan", her other number is a weak piece from Top Hat, thankfully cut out of this masterpiece). Follow the Fleet would be a really bad movie, if not for three great dance sequences between Astaire and Rogers. The dance contest fights for first place in each of their numbers. The dance is simply fantastic. "I put all my eggs in one basket" presents two attempts to dance, which they have not yet perfected. Its imperfections make it even more perfect. And "Let's Face the Music and Dance" is certainly one of the best songs of Irving Berlin. The film is worth watching for its wonderful moments.
