I am kidding about losing weight; Well, you can lose weight, you never know. Anyway, what can I say, I love this movie. He has the same sense of youth and innocence as in films such as Stand By Me and The Goonies. Jake's Closet illustrates the beauty of the simple things of life and how often we overlook them. The film reminds us of how it is to see the world through the eyes of children and all the magic, mystery and horror that they perceive. Jake's Closet presents an exceptionally human story in his compassion that anyone who has had childhood can relate and fall in love. Watch it with friends; watch him with his relatives; build a fort - optional wine.
