Fred Gwynne, Al Lewis, Sid Caesar and Yvonne De Carlo are playing in this fun, funny movie. The late Fred Gwynne is really great as Herman Munster, who lives with grandfather Munster (Al Lewis), wife of Lily (Yvonne De Carlo) and his son and daughter. Sid Caesar is funny as the owner of the wax museum, which has an entire section dedicated to the Munster family. When the wax figures of Herman and his grandfather begin to terrorize the city, everyone blames them. Now they have to clean up their names before it's too late. You will laugh like me.
