Cinderella is one of the biggest Disney movies, one of those movies that I think you value more, the older you are. Disney creates a magical adaptation of the classic fairy tale. I believe that the film was the largest of his films at the time of its release. Characters have become more dimensional than previous movies, creating more depth to better appreciate the heroes. I think Cinderella is one of the greatest characters Disney ever created. With her kindness and a bit of dry humor she is extremely nice; however, it is an inspiration that ensures that it is memorable. How many people are an endless dreamer and stick to their dreams, never giving up. Even in the most unfavorable situations her dreams last, and she does not let anyone take her away. Her example should serve everyone as inspiration and encouragement to never let go of your dreams.
