I saw this movie when I was about 8 years old and I liked it, but it was not until I saw it again at the age of 13 that I really understood what it was; a cartoon with a criminal dog with a real heart of gold "adopts" a little girl to use her for talents to talk to animals. The star of the dog, Charlie B. Barkin, is murdered by her formal business partner, Carface (who is absolutely diabolical). His soul then goes to a different place than Heaven, only to find a gold watch, which is really his lifetime, which Charlie, being a crafty but nice cad, steals and scrolls, sending him back to Earth. After returning to Earth, Charlie is looking for revenge on the evil Carface. In this way he encounters a young Anne-Marie, a lonely little orphan who can talk to animals Charlie plans to cheat for her talents to return to the enemy of Carface. But bastard Charlie really cares for young Anne-Marie and his plans because she has to make a decision to do what's right after Anne-Marie discovers what her "best friend" Charlie really used to make money for new and better casino for dogs. Now he must save her from the terrifying Carface. I still love this movie even at the age of 22. The idea and the plot are really different and original from many other animated films. I especially like the idea that the dog once plays the role of a villain. Carface was even better than All Dogs go to continue Heaven. In this picture, he seemed rather uncertain about his role as a villain.
