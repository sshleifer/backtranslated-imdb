In Cinema Retro magazine no. 2, it was revealed that Marek Lester's voice was actually named by a 20-year-old woman, Kathe Green. Although Leste was considered ideal for the title role, director Carol Reed was not at all happy with his singing skills. The secret was revealed in a documentary film in Great Britain from 2004 entitled "Oliver! After They Were Famous. " Greene got 400 pounds for her work and had to agree to keep the secret of participation, just like Mark Lester. They kept their word and revealed this fact only as part of the television program of the decade after the film's premiere. As a reminder, Mark Lester retired from acting and is a practicing osteopath in England.
