Earlier, I caught it in 1996 in one week at the cinema. I was impressed by this and my feelings did not change much. <br /> <br /> A documentary about the infamous Edward D. Woodie Jr. telling about his life and films. There are interviews with people who worked with him or knew him. These include Vampir, Dolores Fuller, Bela Lugosi Jr., Loretta King, Gregory Walcott and Paul Marco. Interviews are mixed with video clips or with bizarre games. This is interesting (a bit), but was it really needed? I've seen all of Wood's films and they are just awful. Wood had ambitions, but he did not have the talent to pursue them. I would not say he was the worst director, but he's down there. Do we really need a documentary of a very average filmmaker? I like the fact that they did not try to make a saint out of Wood. More than a few of the respondents (especially Lugosi Jr.) almost hated the man and heard loud and clear. They also completely ignore his films in the adult film industry in the 1960s and 1970s. It's still interesting if you're a fan of Wood. The best interviews are with Vampira (who tears Wood apart) and Dolores Fuller (longtime girlfriend).
