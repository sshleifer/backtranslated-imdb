A man adapts to living alone after 45 years of marriage. He must also solve the problem of the family dairy cow, Tulip, who refuses to allow milking. Until then, he visualizes his wife, who was once a Tulip dairy. <br /> <br /> Tulip is based on a true story told in the Griffith family, about the generation of her grandparents. The film is a nostalgic look at the disappearing way of life, in which people still feel responsible for each other, embedded in lush Victorian greenery (Australian state, not the era). <br /> <br /> Screenwriter and director Griffiths apparently has further ambitions in both areas, and this award-winning 15-minute short is a good start to her drum.
