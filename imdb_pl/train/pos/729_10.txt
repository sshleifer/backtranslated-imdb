I love this movie so much that I never have enough of watching this movie. The only line that I really can not stand is that Riff calls himself a teenage lobotomy, but otherwise everything is perfect. I have never been a fan of PJ Soles and it did not help me to hear that she did not even know who Ramones was until she made the film, but for the most part I can ignore her tiny face. Most people who watch it over and over again are Ramones fans and really ... that's the only reason I love him so much. I never tire of watching DeeDee mess in his pizza lines, or Joey spoils the teacher's name again and again, haha. One of the best parts of the movie is watching their singing, do you want to dance, high school corridors ... I love it. The special edition of the DVD has a good retrospective, which is surprising that PJ Soles is not on it. Maybe she was working on another project * laughs * Anyway, a great movie, even better if you're a Ramones fan.
