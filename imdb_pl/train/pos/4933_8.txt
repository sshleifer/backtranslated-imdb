A refreshing "lost" jewel! Equipped with an effective dialog box combined with excellent performance to identify characters and engage you enough to care for what will happen to them. The characters of Douglas and Widmark are realistic heroes. Palance is his usual bad presence. Widmark wins a fistuff battle scene, car chase lasting less than 60 seconds with a "logical" end and a long chase that will shake exaggerated sequences of the pursuit of modern Hollywood. You know how it's likely to end, but tension and interest persist all the time. The end of the chase is one of the most realistic you will ever see. The movie seems to slow down a bit in the middle, but stay with it to get a satisfying ending.
