SPOILERY <br /> <br /> My friend said that the NEXT FILM was Cheech's and Chong's best film and he did everything to borrow it and BROTHERS BLUES. NEXT MOVIE has no plot, no stimulation, there really is nothing that defines the movie ... but it's fun. And for what it's worth, Cheech and Chong show a little heart. <br /> <br /> Well, in this little paragraph, which I put in the story, but as the fourth fifth of the movie, nothing happens, which is usually the beginning of History. I will only say that Cheech's cousin appears. <br /> <br /> There was no other funny moment when Chong forced Cheech to drink a pee twice? What about the cock? Was this the first Pee-Wee Herman movie? You need to watch the movie yourself to enjoy it. I do not think the NEXT VIDEO has enough strong balls to be amazing, but the movie has a heart and hey, my buddy let me borrow, so he gets 7.
