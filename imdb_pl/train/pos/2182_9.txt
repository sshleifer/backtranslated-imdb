This excellent film refers to many talented actors and musicians at the top of their form - Levant, Crosby, Martin, Rathbone, Manone, who are completely in their own history, which Billy Wilder apparently provided. One would like to know more about how much he had to do because it is an exceptionally clever variety of a sterile tale of a master / prolific servant - almost an allegory of the entertainment industry run by dried numskulls, but transformed into a vibrant world of art and a game used by a subclass nobodies and non-WASPs. Looking at the last six decades of music, television and film in the US, it's hard not to notice the hidden insights of this film as prophets.
