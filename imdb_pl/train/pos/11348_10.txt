I absolutely loved this movie when I was a kid. I cried every time I watched. It was not strange to me. I completely identified myself with the characters. I would love to see it again (and I hope I will not be disappointed!). Pufnstuf rocks !!!! I was really drawn into the fantasy world. And for me, the film was long and long. I wonder if I've ever seen this series and mistook them? Acting, which I thought was strong. I loved Jack Wilde. He was so dreamy for a 10-year-old (when I saw this movie for the first time, not in 1970. I still remember the characters clearly) The flute was completely credible and I can still "feel" bad forests.
