I immediately noticed that this movie was not really based on Dodie Smith's novel. Anyway, it was a nice idea that Pongo and Perdita's son now have their own puppies. The sweetest of the Dalmatians was of course a small Snowball, which was completely spotless until the very end of the movie. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I did not know what to think when Cruella de Vil seemed completely changed. In fact, I often thought about the possibility that she could be friends, but now that she has changed so quickly into "herself" and announced that she is Cruella again, I almost started to really worry about the Dalmatians Chloe> <br /> Actually, the scene, in whose puppies were watching Lady and the Tramp, while Chloe and Kevin had dinner, it was much better than I expected. I also liked the parrot that played the dog, and it was amazing that the dogs learned a lot of tricks for this movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, I was content that in the end the Dalmatians were saved again, but I would like to know what will happen to Cruella after she lost her entire estate. What the hell could he make a dog house with such a huge sum of money? <br /> <br /> In the end, it was quite touching that Snowball also had spots at the very end of the movie.
