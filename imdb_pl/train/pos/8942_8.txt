Many authors mentioned the age difference between Stewart and Novak. She was 25 years old and 50 years old when this movie was released. I think the difference did not matter to the Vertigo drama, but it does matter to the romantic comedy. We can easily understand why his character would be attracted to her, but it is less clear why he would attract her. <br /> <br /> Despite this, the film works like a light romantic fantasy. The scene in which he stares at him through the cat's head, with her dark, painted eyebrows and the sounds of her buzzing and murmuring cat, is real magic. It shakes a little when the scene moves to the top of the Flatiron building, and the age difference is very sharp. When he covers her, he reaches out to pass his fingers through his hair, but stops his movement and lightly touches his wigs with his fingers.
