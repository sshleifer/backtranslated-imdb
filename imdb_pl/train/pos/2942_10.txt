LOL !!! the delirium was so funny ... I was in tears. Eddie Murphys's impressions are absolutely right. The best impression was made by James Brown and Mr T> SO FUNNY !! It's weird how Eddie Murphy was then and how he is now. every time .. This is Eddie Murphy at the best age and you can see where he got humor and ideas for movies like a naughty professor. He also makes impressions of his family, which is really fun. <br /> <br /> If only I was there ...
