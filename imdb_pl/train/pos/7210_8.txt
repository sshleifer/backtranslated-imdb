New York playwright Michael Caine (as Sidney Bruhl) is 46 and quickly disappears; how the film begins, Mr. Caine's latest play on Broadway. Television reviewers play with Caine and he gets drunk. Passing Long Island, Caine lands in Montauk, not his residence in East Hampton. Finally, arriving home, Caine is comforted by a well-dressed wife, Dyan Cannon (as Myra), a poor, high-hearted patient. There, Caine and Mrs. Cannon discuss a new play called "Deathtrap," written by young hunky Christopher Reeve (as Clifford "Cliff" Anderson), one of Caine's former students. The couple believe that Mr. Reeve's "Deathtrap" is a hit needed to revive Caine's career. <br /> <br /> "The trap is set to be maliciously funny, who will do it." <br /> <br /> Directed by Sidney Lumet, Longer Broadway hit by Ira Levin does not deviate too far from the beginning of the stage. The cast is pleasant and the twists are still drawn. One of the things that did not work (for me) was the end of the curtain connection; it certainly played better on the stage. "Deathtrap" is a nice movie to watch again; the performances are dead - but in retrospect the greeting that Reeve gives to Caine at the East Hampton train station should be simplified to the smiling "Hi." The location is not really East Hampton, but the windmill and pond look similar. And the very ballyhooed love scene is shockingly lukewarm. But the play was so good, "even a talented director could not spoil it." And Mr. Lumet does not disappoint. <br /> <br /> ******** Deathtrap (3/19/82) Sidney Lumet ~ Michael Caine, Christopher Reeve, Dyan Cannon, Irene Worth
