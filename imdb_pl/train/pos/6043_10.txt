I saw a movie with a freebird and I think it is great! his relaxed playing, about the time when the British film industry has gone through something funny !! it's good how the guy who met them at the gas station was mentioned in the film by press agents, a nice touch. The acting was convincing (I'm a cyclist) and reminded me of the good times I had on the cycling scene. It was good to see how a film director starts acting, okay! In the end, mention is made of new crops, in Ireland it is the basis of the second film? hopefully they will. Great movie, well-written, realistic characters!
