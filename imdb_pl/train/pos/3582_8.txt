Here's another movie from the 80's that most people just do not know. It's slow, picturesque (Montana's landscapes are breathtaking and reminded me of the last "Open Range" by Costner, in which Robert Duval also appeared), and emotionally satisfying film is the perfect kind of movie to watch late at night when you can sleep or apathetic Sunday afternoon. Those who are in a good mood will be subjected to a detailed and intimate look at the sadness of one family and how they will come back together when the youngest son accidentally shoots and kills the eldest son during the hunt. All performances are of the highest class and quietly refined. Glenn Close, Robert Duval and Wilford Brimley look great in the performances, as do all the supporting players and young actors. I particularly liked the way in which Cain's director (who unfortunately did not direct anything due to the fact that, apart from the first "young guns"), he gives us a silent look at the personal sadness of everyone. We do not see just how death affects a younger brother or parents, but also a confused middle sister, a wayward uncle, his crazy wife and a deceased teenage girl. What we basically get here is a rural response to the Midwest on "ordinary people." There are also David Lynch's Straight Story shades in some Stoic morals of Midwestern people depicted here, as well as in the beautifully persecuted shots of the cultivated land they inhabit. This is one of the better and more realistic "tears of the era" of the era, as well as a nice, small find for hunters of good quality movies.
