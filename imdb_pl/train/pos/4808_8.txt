THE YOUNG VICTORIA is an elegantly dressed and reconstructed piece of history that benefits from the excellent settings, solid direction of Jean-Marc Vallée from the bold version of Julian Fellowes, a young girl who was to become the longest reigning monarch of England - Victoria. Much of the early part of the film, the part in which Victoria is a child whose entry into the throne is questioned by her mother (Miranda Richardson) and Sir John Conroy (Mark Strong), seems to pull and lose variations in many costumes and sceneries. But when Victoria (Emily Blunt) reaches adulthood and is being taken by Prince Albert (Rupert Friend), the film blooms. Blunt is a strong actress and discovers this delicate border between girlish infatuation and royal dignity, which makes her a beautiful foil for people outside who would like to control the "baby queen" - including her secretary Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany). But when he matures for the role of the queen, her eye lives on the elegant German prince Albert, and the affair that lasted in the memories of all joins the idea of ​​joining Royalty with care for his subjects - very due to Albert's sensitivity. The film leads us to the birth of the first of nine children and then ends with a few statements about the influence of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert on various license fees across Europe! This makes the evening a beautiful costume drama and lets us appreciate the growth of two young stars in Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend. A solid, if not transport, epic. <br /> <br /> Grady Harp
