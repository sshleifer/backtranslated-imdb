I am asking for unwarranted Boob references, so I'm going to write a regular review (no pun intended). I love Elvira, not in the way "I'm going to shoot-pres-just-to-impress-jodi-foster-fanatical," but it's enough to say she's hanging around. The movie is played like a movie from a horror movie from the 1950s, much more funny, look for a reference to "Jumping stroking ankle" to know what I mean. what is reflected in the film is the absolute charm of Elvira (or rather cassandras). I saw this movie for the first time at the age of 8 and I have seen it uncompromisingly since ... I really should focus on buying copies, the video version is slightly worse for wear. If any other movie fan wants to tell me about it, feel free. <br /> <br /> p.s another great performance by Edie McClurg (chastedy pariah), an actress who never attracts the attention she deserves.
