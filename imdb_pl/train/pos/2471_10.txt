I never read Shakespeare's Hamlet before I watched him, but I had a book of Shakespeare with me and I could follow her through the dialogue. My view of the film may be partially biased, because I have never read the play before, but I have been drawn into the shot of the film. Shakespeare is undoubtedly one of the best writers who ever lived, and Hamlet's story is definitely one of his best achievements. <br /> <br /> But now for the movie ... <br /> <br /> I discovered that all the actors in the film understood well what they were saying, and that's why they were able to express it quite well. Leonardo in Romeo and Juliet is nothing compared to Kenneth Branagh and the king. I liked the fact that it worked very well as a "FILM" and not as an art you learn. You do not have to be rich in Shakespeare to refer to the entire village of Misery, through which he must go. I recommend this film to a wide audience. <br /> <br /> It's my two cents.
