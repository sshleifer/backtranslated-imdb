While watching this movie I was frustrated and distracted, and at the end I wanted to give the movie a solid 4 or 5. I thought the animation was random and everywhere, and there was too much going on. Even my A.D.D did not keep up. I felt like a light trip with acid. Everything looked flat, there was no dimension. There were so many shapes, lines and patterns. I really wanted to stop the movie halfway and break the burnt copy of the movie. But after finishing watching I went online to read the movie and I should have examined this movie a bit before watching. <br /> <br /> The secret to Kells is loosely based on the true story of the original Book of Kells. The little boy, Brendan, is tasked with placing new pages in what is to be the largest book ever written. This book will contain information that will help "change the darkness into light." Brendan lives in the village of Kells behind the huge stone walls. Uncle Brendana, the abbot of Kells, attempts to build a wall to keep the Vikings in the eighth century. Uncle Brendana insists that he helps to finish the wall, but the traveler and keeper of the book secretly trains Brendan to improve his illustration skills and convince him to finish the book and make the word. <br /> <br /> Throughout the time I watched the movie, I thought I was missing something because I did not really understand what was going on. I thought I just missed the history of Ireland. A simple search on Google taught me everything I needed to know about the original Kells book. After reading many articles, my opinion about the film has changed significantly. <br /> <br /> The Book of Kells is a copied version of the first few books of the New Testament, written in Latin by Gaelic monks in Ireland in the eighth century. In addition to the paleographic and specialized script, the book is also beautifully illustrated in island art, a type of early art known for its complexity, complexity and miniature illustrations. Much of the art in the Book of Kells is portrayed as a lot of art at the time, flat and dimensional, challenged without a perspective. But what distinguishes the Book of Kells from other early works of art is the use of many colors. <br /> <br /> The secret to Kells is very colorful. Initially, I thought that the animation is flat and boring. It reminded me of a lot of cartoon Samurai Jack, who also had a flat and "amine" look. When I learned about the styles of art from the Book of Kells, it is obvious that many styles from the book are imitated in the film. In Brendan's mind are lines and whirls and various shapes. Each time it enters its imagination, round shapes resembling the sun, gears, clocks and wheels begin to fill the screen. The edges of the screen are bound in decorative moving triangles or circles. The passages are filled with color and Celtic knots. From trees to the floor, many things in this world are covered in shapes or patterns. <br /> <br /> Time for 70 minutes minus credits, Sekret Kells is a funny history lesson with a little adventure and stupidity thrown to interest people (maybe only children). I think in general you have to be open to The Secret of Kells as half an art, a half movie about history. Although it looks like an animated one using Adobe Illustrator, it is a very nice movie. But based on 20 films submitted to the Oscar, I do not think that it was worth nominating for Mary and Max. <br /> <br /> ThatWasJunk.Blogspot.com
