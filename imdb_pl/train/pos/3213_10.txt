What a perfect example of "Less is more ..." Kurt Russell (Sergeant Todd) has only 72 lines and about 104 words. What a challenge! Like a black and white photo, when the eye of your mind has to fill in the empty space, facial expression, dramaturgy, moving gesture, all combine to have a stronger impact. This is one of the five best films I can not live without, with classics such as Road Warrior. If you liked it, check out "Mad Max 2, The Road Warrior" and "Braveheart" with Mel Gibson. Also "Gladiator" with Russell Crowe and Connie Nielsen, who was also in Soldier. "Thirteenth Warrior" with Antonio Banderas and "Blade Runner" with Harrison Ford.
