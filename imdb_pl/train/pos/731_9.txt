This movie is funny SOOOO !!! Acting is GREAT, the Ramones are sexy, the jokes are subtle, and the plot is exactly what every high school student dreams about at school. I loved the soundtrack as well as the meticulously placed cynicism. If you like Monty Python, you'll love this movie. This movie is tad bit "esk" (without all the annoying songs). Songs that are sung are pleasant; you can even find singing these songs after the movie ends. This musical takes me second place in musicals (second place next to the blues brothers). But please, do not think about it as about music; seeing how songs are so nice, it's hard to say that there is a carefully directed scene. I think of this film as a comedy with notes of romance. You'll remember what it's like to be a rebellious teenager; needless to say that after watching this movie you will remember your old high school. I highly recommend both for the family (because it is very young, but also for adults, because there are many jokes that are fun with age and experience).
