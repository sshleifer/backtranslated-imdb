This is certainly one of my favorite episodes of Trek. There's so much going on in this one movie that it's crazy. First, the boys fly to an alien planet that will explode soon. They meet a bizarre type librarian (very well played). Then Kirk manages to move back to what is reminiscent of sixteenth-century earth. McCoy and Spock try to follow him, but instead they freeze to death on the frozen version of the world of aliens 100,000 years ago. Kirk manages to quit and accuse him of spells while Spock enjoys a time of amok with a sexy cavegirl who was defeated by this evil guy in this frozen, horrible world. on and gives McCoy a royal bridge when the document suggests that he must look for a way out. In any case, everyone finally escapes, leaving the poor cavalryman behind. Before Spock finally gives up and goes away, you need a lot of convincing. You can literally taste sadness at the end. Leaving the cavegirl alone in its frozen wasteland seems cruel and really moving. Spock had to break free from his ignominious mind to leave the greatest hope for love and being human. Although not very nice neighborhood! <br /> <br /> In any case, you just get so much money for this episode .... Love story, witch trials with Salem, Spock as a man, desperation of being in total isolation ... abandoned and three completely different settings on an alien planet. It's amazing that they managed to do it all in one fifty minute movie. This one is a classic, do not miss it .... I want it on DVD in shuc volcanoes !!!!!!
