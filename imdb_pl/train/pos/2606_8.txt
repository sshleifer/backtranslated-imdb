Maybe some people consider it a slow movie. However, it is this "slow smoking" that allows a deep impact on the viewer. Like this wonderful first scene: first, we can hear voices; then we can see the characters; in the end, the camera slowly moves back and forth, and we see another figure, a young man who just sits there, apparently not even listening to the conversation, or at least not caring. The fact that this young man will play a leading role shows the strategy of the film: allowing the characters to develop and be determined by the surrounding environment, but without paying any attention to the points more than necessary. People come and go, they influence and come out of his life. Although most of the film follows him (and most of the auxiliary characters are seen only when they are close to him, in accordance with the relationship maintained with him), we are convinced that we are objective, so subtle is the director's touch.
