This film probably never appeared on the radar screen, but it has a fairly high quality. It's quite realistic, but you think "It's just a movie." Duvall and Close depict ordinary people, and you do not even realize that they are now known actors. It seems that the jerk in this story is a little too old to pursue Eugene's girlfriend, but I think it's possible. It seems unlikely that the kid himself would travel from Montana to Nevada, but I think it's possible. You might think that family problems in this movie would never happen in your family, but I think it's possible. I remember Glenn Close saying something like, "You think that the work you do is the hardest part of your life, but it's not."
