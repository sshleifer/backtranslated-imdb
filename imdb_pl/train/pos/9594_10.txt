While many unfortunately have passed, the ball stage is still very much alive and continues its heritage. Some are still very lively and quite well, Octavia is more radiant and beautiful than ever, Villa Ninja is very successful and gives great support to the gay community as a whole, Pepper Labeija just passed last year for natural reasons, let her rest in peace. After leaving Carmen, Anja became the mother of Xtravaganza (she was on the beach stage), and she also looks more and more prettier. Some balls have categories intended for those who have passed, let everyone rest in peace. Currently, another project is being implemented, known as "How Do I Look?", You can check at www.howdoilooknyc.org.
