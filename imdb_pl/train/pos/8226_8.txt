We are talking about a low-budget film and it is understandable that there are some weaknesses (no spoilers: one expert for sudden explosives and one meaningless alcoholic); but in general the story interests you, most of the characters are nice and there are some original situations. <br /> <br /> I really like movies that surprise some people who are not the ones they want you to believe in, then twist and turn the story ... I applaud it. <br /> <br /> If you know what I mean, try to see a movie from Argentina "Nueve Reinas" (Nine Queens).
