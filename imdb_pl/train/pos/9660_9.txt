It was only after some contemplation that I decided that I liked the film. And after reading the comments from all the other posters here and thinking about it, I decided that I liked it a lot. I love American films - probably because they are so narrative. They usually have a well-defined beginning, middle and end. On the other hand, "Presque rien" does not make such an attempt. I do not agree with other posters that say it's "too artistic". In all respects, this movie is supposed to evoke sensory memories. So often throughout the movie you feel that you are there ... you feel the summer sun, breeze, heat, winter chill, company, loneliness etc., <br /> <br /> In all respects, the director draws you into the lives of the characters - that's why so many people feel so much that the film failed them. When I finished watching, I felt the same. But after some reflection, I decided that this is what a movie must look like: "history" is not a narrative, it's the emotions you feel (the viewer). and the angles of the camera immerse you in the stages - they are rich, exquisite and vivid with details and nuances. Although I usually can not stand movies without a fully developed plot (after all, it is not a movie "supposedly" telling a story), this movie is definitely one of my new favorites.
