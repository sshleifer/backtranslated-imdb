When it comes to movies, I can be very picky and complain about everything and everything that is badly done. While every movie has its drawbacks, The Night Listener had an extremely low number. <br /> <br /> If you read the last review (it was hard because half of it was caped and did not contain actual information about the movie), you can be convinced that the movie was not very well done. Unfortunately, if you read more than three lines in the same review, you discovered the reason for the poster's contempt: he does not like the director is gay (or that the production team is bursting ... apparently). br /> <br /> So despite the fact that I've never written a review before, I thought that this movie deserves one because of its advantages and not the sexual orientation of its director. Let's get to the quick checklist first: 1. A great plot? Absolutely. I will not give anything, but the plot is very convincing and definitely not what you would expect from commercials. This is a thriller, not a horror story, and it should be approached as such. History will truly amaze you, the more real it is (and the plot was quite true to real events). <br /> <br /> 2. Wonderful activity? Oh yes. Robin Williams has long since freed himself from the chains of comedic castings and has since blossomed into serious roles for which many people would write only ten years ago. Once again, he achieved a high form in his role in the Night Listener, playing a radio host who becomes more and more concerned and entangled in the matter ... well, I will let you see for yourself. <br /> <br /> 3. Excellent direction? For sure. Now, unlike the second poster I mentioned, I know something about the direction. For 3 years I have been dealing with the art of directing at school. Of course, I do not think this is a difference (only what matters is whether you like the direction), but I thought that I should once again determine that I base my opinions here on something significant and important ... for example: no Sexual orientation of the director (or alleged drug habits of the production team, LOL). <br /> <br /> Patrick Stettner's direction was moody and dark, and he allowed angles and lighting to help create the desirable feeling of "tension and release" than the sloppy, fast camera work and quick cuts that he so often we are being surrendered today. Some people can really show the story with the camera, while others feel as if they had to tell the story with the camera. I really appreciate when someone has the courage to just use the camera to be used, which is the eyeball that we all see. <br /> <br /> 4. Lighting, photos and assembly? It's great. I've written so much and I could continue these last three things for the next ten paragraphs, so I'll just describe them. <br /> <br /> In short, see this movie. Do not listen to people who have other motives to destroy them, especially if they are so stupid that they unknowingly reveal this motif 1/4 way through their position. Have a nice presentation! -Ben
