My favorite police series of all time turns into a TV movie. Is it working? Yes. Gee runs for the mayor and gets shot. A "gallery of murder celebrities" appears. Pembleton and almost all cops who have ever played in this series. Many flashbacks help those who have not seen the TV series, but also entertains fans. The last five minutes solve the next murder and at the end even two killed cops appear. And a short performance by my favorite coroner, Juliana Cox. It's a good movie.
