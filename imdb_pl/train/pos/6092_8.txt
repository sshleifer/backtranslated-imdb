Iconic classics are almost impossible to predict. Who could guess that Vision Quest, Fight Club and 2001: A Space Oddysey, films that both critics and the public viewed after they were released, would become extremely popular? Like many IMDBers, I consider myself a film expert. Unlike the majority of those who hated Envy (as evidenced by the grim score of 4.4), I thought Envy was one of the funniest films of the last decade. <br /> <br /> The story is ridiculous. Dialogue is not clever, scenes have little continuity, and the script seems to be written by a fourth-grade student. But that's why the movie is so much fun. You see, to appreciate the casual genius of Envy, you must enjoy the movie with an ironically separated point of view. <br /> <br /> Why do I love Jealousy? Because the film is bad to the point that it becomes good. It's a recipe for an iconic classic, and Envy definitely fits the bill.
