I give him only 9 out of 10, because I have to see him again, in a more current frame of mind, to have a fresh perspective. What I remember is an amazing psychological thriller that blinded my brain and eyes when I watched it. I would watch him every time he appeared in HBO during the day (probably in 1990). I could even record it, but this recording has long disappeared. I'm sure. <br /> <br /> I wrote to GreenCine to try to get this title, but now I do not wear it. I hope to find it in the local video store. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it if you try to find it somewhere. It's at least interesting. If you liked movies like Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice, Gummo or something like that, try this one.
