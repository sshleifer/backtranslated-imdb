I must say that looking at Hamlet from a student's perspective, the version of Hamlet Brannagh is by far the best. His dedication to be faithful to the original text should be applauded. This helps to liven up the game on the screen and makes it easier for people holding the text while watching, as we did while studying, to follow and analyze the text. <br /> <br /> One of the things that I have repeatedly criticized is the cast of the main Hollywood names in art. I think it helps viewers more easily recognize characters, as opposed to having actors who look and sound the same, which helps in the confusion usually associated with Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> His memories also help clear many ambiguities in the text. For example, how far has the relationship between Hamlet and Ophelia went and why Fortinbras has just found himself at the end of the castle. All in all, this version contains not only great performances of actors known and not familiar with Shakespeare. It is presented in such a way that one does not need to be a doctor of English literature to understand and enjoy it.
