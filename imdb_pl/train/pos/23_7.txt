OK, so the music pieces were badly written and generally poorly sung (although Walken and Marner, especially Walken, sounded pretty good). And in the end they destroyed the fourth wall, ordering the king and his noblemen to sing about the "battle" with ogre, and praise the efforts of the Cats in Boots, when they should not even know about it. /> <br /> Who cares? It's Christopher Freakin 'Walken, he makes a film based on a fairy tale, and he sings and dances. His acting style fits perfectly with the role of cunning, mischievous Puss who seems to be introducing his master into deeper and deeper troubles, but in fact has a plan that he thought about seven or eight moves from above. And if you've ever seen Walken in any of his wicked roles, * you know * an ogre bit him at the end when Walken put him in a trap. <br /> <br /> A funny movie and a must-have for anyone who likes Christopher Walken's unique style.
