I really liked the performances of the main cast. Emma Lung is brave and interesting. The director has developed performances in which the heroes are not one-dimensional. A complex story with changes between epochs. The history of unions, which lose the power and influence of a large employer on a small town, was also appreciated. I do not agree with the comment that an older man must be attractive. There are many relationships with older men and younger women - without masculine appearance. The depth of character can speak to not so shallow. The film has a good look and the photos are also good.
