Soylent Green turned out to be a great movie. <br /> <br /> If you like Logan's Run, you'll like it. <br /> <br /> Yes, the film is old and has no special effects, and some acting can be best described in some sense as "tacky", but the story is perfect. <br /> <br /> The story of how the world can be and its impact on society is very poignant. <br /> <br /> After all, the secret was not a secret, but the story developed at an easy pace. <br /> <br /> The closest modern counterpart would be "Dark Angel" when it comes to showing the US to be a third world country.
