If you think "Weird Al" Yankovic is hilarious, you will not be disappointed with THE COMPLEAT AL. This rare documentary contains not only much more memorable Yankovic films (including "Like A Surgeon" and "I Love Rocky Road"), but they are also combined with funny vignettes that supposedly emphasize the parody to fame. Yankovic is not for all tastes, but his humor is harmless and ingenious enough that even non-fans will be at least slightly amused. Undeterred fans will love him not only for content, but also for a relatively early look at the Yankovic career that lasts nearly three decades. Children suitable for all ages will undoubtedly love the fun visuals.
