I just watched the movie again and I'm horrified by the number of cynics who reject him as New Age stuff. A great movie, the development of which takes time, approaches crossing the border, but it is never and ultimately is meditative, influencing and truer to life than most films that people who reject his "cases" see. I was angry when films like "Prince of Tides" and "Bugsy" (though I liked the latter ones) were nominated for the best photo this year (not to mention that "Silence of the sheep" won!) And it was completely ignored except for one nomination for the best scenario. After visiting again, I think that history supports my first reaction!
