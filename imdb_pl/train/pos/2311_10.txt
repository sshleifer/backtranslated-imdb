The first film by Reese Witherspooon. I loved it. The plot and acting were at the highest level. You are emotionally connected with characters. In my opinion, you have to see. <br /> <br /> After watching this video, you'll see why Reese Witherspoon's acting career was so successful. <br /> <br /> The other cast members are also doing a great job. <br /> <br /> The film flows very well. There is no boring moment in the whole picture. The length of a man on the moon is right. <br /> <br /> As I said before, I think this movie was perfect. I've seen it many times and enjoyed every one of those views.
