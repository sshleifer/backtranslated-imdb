If The Girl From Missouri themes sound familiar, it should be. This is because Anita Loos, who wrote the script here, also wrote the classic Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. Unlike Marilyn Monroe in this film, Jean Harlow will accept any type of jewelry from people of average destiny. <br /> <br /> And these are the people that Jean Harlow is after. He leaves the house of hashish led by his mother and stepfather, because she decided that the best way to have an easy life is to marry him. Her talents as choristers are limited, but she will be able to turn into this beauty. <br /> <br /> Her odyssey begins with the fact that she and her friend Patsy Kelly receive an invitation to a party thrown by millionaire Lewis Stone. But Jean does not know that Stone just throws his last flight wildly before he does it himself because of the money he is not guilty of. Still, he pushes away a few balls from him, which is noticed by another millionaire Lionel Barrymore. <br /> <br /> Lionel is amused until Jean sets his playboy son, Franchot Tone. Then he is not amused, and he wants to shake Jean from climbing the family tree. <br /> <br /> The Girl From Missouri went into production in the middle of the adaptation of the Code, so he was subjected to special censorship. I have the impression that we have seen a much riskier movie. Nevertheless, Jean Harlow as a younger and more sireier version of Mae West is always welcome. What a great comic talent the woman had when she saw The Girl From Missouri is a sad reminder of the great loss the movie world upheld when she left three years later. <br /> <br /> Ironically, the cast of Patsy Kelly from Harlow was undoubtedly influenced by the successful shorts that Kelly did with another famous platinum blonde, Thelma Todd. Harlow and Kelly have the same easy chemistry that Patsy had with Thelma. Todd will also die a year later in a strange accident / suicide / murder, which never gave a satisfactory explanation. <br /> <br /> Do not miss The Girl From Missouri, it's light and sassy, ​​it has to be all this shiny jewelry.
