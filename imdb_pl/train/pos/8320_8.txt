Farrah Fawcett spent most of his career on Aniel, embarrassing us, occasionally paying attention to the performance of the actress sandwiched between her Playboy playthings and Letterman's escapades. But when it comes to this, it can not be denied that this girl can act. Far from the story of epic proportions, this well-made TV movie is gentle, quiet and sometimes moving. Fawcett plays the recalcitrant daughter of the black sheep, who returns home and discovers that she missed her mother's last days and funeral, to the disappointment of her more stable and probably more reasonable sister. Brad Johnson plays an interest in love, and history evolves with all the usual elements of television drama - but it's always what Farrah has to look at, and she is indeed extremely attentive. (And yes, I admit I had this Farrah poster on my wall when I came back). Silk Hope gets three and a half stars (out of five) on Corkymeter. Bosley would be proud.
