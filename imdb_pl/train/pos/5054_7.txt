Richard Attenborough, who has already given us great films as "A Chorus Line" and "Gandhi", once again surprises us by creating a beautiful hymn to Nature. Indeed, the extensive and (at the time) unexplored territory of Canada helps to compose the stunning beauty of the landscapes captured by the camera. If the film really is based on a true story, it is once again obvious that "vision people" are in fact people who live beyond their time, from a historical perspective that only Time gives them a reason. The photos are great, for example Pierce Brosnan's cast, whose performance is due to Attenborough's masterful hands. A nice surprise is the appearance of Annie Galipeau in the role of beloved Archie. A film that must appear on the list of those who really love nature ...
