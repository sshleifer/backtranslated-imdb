It's time for Hollywood to sit down and pay attention! If the actors are snobbish, all you have to do is encourage animators who have worked on this little miracle. Renaissance is probably the first animated film that makes you forget that you do not see people. Although the voice cast recordings (Craig, McCormack, Pryce, etc.) are some of the best I have ever heard, but even then the emotions presented by the "cartoons" are annoying. <br /> <br /> This style of animation is not new, but the use of light and shadows makes the film a vivid picture. Ironically, such a technical sorceress makes you forget that it is really a very nice movie. The stimulation and development of the story are wonderful, and the dialogues are clear. <br /> <br />. Story: The disappearance of the main megacorporation employee reveals a tale of fraud and corruption with a hero with a cold heart at the helm. I can not say much without giving everything ... except that while the movie keeps you on the edge of your place, the culmination leaves you without a word. <br /> <br /> You have to watch ... even for 'adults' who smile for 'cartoons'
