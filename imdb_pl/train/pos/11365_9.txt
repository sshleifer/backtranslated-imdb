Okay, let's start by saying that this film is not an accurate interpretation of the crime and legal prosecution of Andrei Chitlylo. Although the Politburo could be an "official policy" that the USSR did not have serial killers, in fact the legal system dealt with others, and the "Killer X" (as it was actually called) was already sought after Fetisov brought Burakov into a suitcase. In fact, as soon as they realized that they had a lot of murders in their hands, the authorities appointed a group of dozens of officers to track down and terminate the madness of the murder of a man who did not match what is seen as an ordinary serial killer parameters. It is good that the director and scriptwriters consistently remind the viewer that the story is "based on actual events", for the docudrama which is not. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS FOLLOW **** <br /> <br /> Having said that, this is a damn good example of a fast-paced Hollywood thriller that still penetrates the basics of what happened . It is easy to follow and has enough truth behind its version of events to ensure attractive viewing. Yes, Chikatilo raped and murdered both children and adults, both men and women. Yes, cheesy laboratory work has allowed him to continue killing for years. Yes, innocent men were accused of murder and "admitted" to their crimes by calling the police. Yes, the gay community was harassed during the crime (though with the help of Burakowa). And so, Chikatilo was brought to confession not by the proclamation of a special prosecutor, Gorbunov, but by a gentle understanding of a psychiatrist named Bukhanovsky (although Gorbunow was really nowhere near the selfish martinet depicted in this film). Apart from the truth and truthfulness, all these events are dramatized in a way that consistently strains tension and fear. <br /> <br /> It does not matter that the director and co-writer Chris Gerolmo has a perfect cast. Increasing emotional involvement of Stephen Rei in murder and development of knowledge in detecting traces, harsh manipulation of the Soviet parties and the subtle spine of Donald Sutherland, which becomes apparent when needed, boiling of Jeffrey DeMunna's rage hidden in fearful behavior Max Boyish excitement of Von Syd in connection with criminal investigation strengthens sharp dialogue and sharp editing in a way that can not be underestimated. <br /> <br /> Given what is, "Citizen X" is almost perfect ("almost" because of one moment of complacency at the end that just does NOT match). I highly recommend it as a well-told fiction, not presented in facts ... but given the junk movies of the "serial killer" that Hollywood usually spits out, it's good enough for me.
