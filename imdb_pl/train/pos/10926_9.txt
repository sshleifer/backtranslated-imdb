If you love kung fu movies and have not seen this movie, you are cheating yourself. This movie is one of the few cheap kung fu that you can recommend to fans of all kinds of movies. Usually, to see something in these movies, you need a passionate fan of the genre, but this one has it all! The story is well told and complete. Combat scenes are great and have a tendency to end before you get bored (as opposed to the Crouching Tiger). Throw some secrets and torture, and you'll get one piece of film. See it at all costs. Heck, my wife liked it. <br /> <br /> Wu Du it! <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10 <br /> <br />
