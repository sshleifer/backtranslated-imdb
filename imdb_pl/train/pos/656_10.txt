Of all the reviews I read, most people were extremely difficult at work with Alexandre. Neither Marie nor Veronika have ever seemed particularly desperate to keep Alexandre, because he is only a little intelligent, though not as intellectual as most of us, although it would be difficult to admit anyone. Alexandre is good at living, he is totally busy, he gets and gives what he wants. girls allow it, veronika loves sex, marie is his patron. Is there anything wrong with all this? is anyone in love? really? I do not think so. Although the French cinema of the new wave is prone to grievances and so on, it is wonderful simply because there is no need for a plot to create emotions. Ease is perfectly beautiful, and anyone who is Alexandre in the city can ask for it. I am looking for a patron, anyone interested?
