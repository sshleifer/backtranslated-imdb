What a nice surprise: the sequel Disney DTV (Direct to Video), which is GOOD. "Kr√≥l Lew 1 1/2" is a comedy affair, in which all the favorite meerkats and warthog, Timon and Pumba participate. It starts with watching the original movie and commenting until Timon complains that "we're not here yet". After a distance fight, Timon and Pumba decide to tell the audience "their story". They start a new movie and laughs start. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I was losing hope at Disney. Most of their tariffs directly on the video were aggressively horrible, and the plot lines desperate to make money on the original. "1 1/2" decides to try something different: it tells the original story from a new point of view. All right, he adds a few things, such as where Timon came from and how he and Pumbaa met, but this is an interesting concept. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella perfectly regain the bond and friendship that made us love them in the first movie. There are also some nice movie parodies (including one scene that is also falsely "Good, Bad and Ugly" and "Cool Hand Luke"), and the script is filled with funny memorable lines. <br /> <br /> the cast includes Julie Kavner ("The Simpsons") as the disturbed mother of Timon and Jerry Stiller as the slightly crazy uncle of Max Timon. Matthew Broderick appears as Simba, and his "teenage" scene reminds me of Ferris Bueller. Everyone is doing well, especially Robert Guillame (do you write that?) As Rafiki, who emits more and more Yoda in this film (Timon comments on it several times). <br /> <br /> "Lion King 1 1/2" is the perfect alternative choice for those who have had enough animation shrekification. 10/10
