This is a perfect fast-paced thriller by Wes Craven (Nightmare on Elm Street), which for 85 minutes leaves something supernatural behind and presents us with something even more scary - the evil of people. It is much more likely that we will meet Jackson Rippner's benevolent evil than Freddy Kruger, and Cillian Murphy (Batman Begins) is doing great as a friendly, even charismatic killer. The performances of Murphy and Rachel McAdams (Claire from The Wedding Crashers) are brilliant. Most of the film takes place at a very intimate level, between two people, their eyes, faces. It is a small-scale action, not a wide range of canvas, and is not less convincing for these restrictions. Cinematography is nothing special, of course, you can only do so much with the camera on a passenger plane, but the dialogue is perfect, the story is tense. There are no entertainments, no story threads to confuse the issue that is in her heart the battle between the main characters. By maintaining concentration and avoiding distractions, Wes Craven is able to make a very minimal storyline and transform it into an exciting, dynamic action thriller.
