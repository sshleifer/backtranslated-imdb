This one has a tendency to be ignored by many critics and fans of Kurosawa, but I thought it was wonderful. This is an episodic multi-tasking study of the poorest of Tokyo, which live in a city literally made of rubbish. Although it looks like it just hit the A-Bomb, the movie has a wonderful beauty thanks to the great use of Technicolor. The title comes from the sound of a crazy young man who drives an imaginary trolley through slums. All characters were wonderful, and all the stories addictive, but perhaps the most tragic are the man and his young son who live in an abandoned car. When they are not looking for food, they spend their free time using their imagination to build their dream home. Moving emotionally and beautifully.
