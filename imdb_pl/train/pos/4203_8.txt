This is another sharp and fascinating film directed by Sam Fuller in the early 1950s. This minimalist and fast-working director has something extraordinary in his earlier films - a cast with several stars. Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and Richard Kiley are playing in this film about a group of communist agents who are trying to come up with secrets from America - and they will not stop at anything to succeed. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with Peter in the subway car watched by federal agents. They know that it is a link in a long spy chain. Unknown to everyone is a wild card in the equation - a small pickpocket (Widmark) is also on the train and manages to steal the secrets that Peters carries. Widmark thinks that this is just another handbag he has plundered - only later does he realize the seriousness of what he has stolen. Now it is Widmark on its own - with Commies and the FBI on its trail. <br /> <br /> Widmark and the rest are unique, and the movie captivates from the beginning to the end. Although she has not received the best bills, special attention should be paid to Thelma Ritter. This supporting actress probably did her life as a table dove. She rarely realized she had the opportunity, and I was impressed by her ability to play the spoiled and sad old lady. <br /> <br /> When it comes to screenplay and direction, they're very good - -But with one small exception. At first, I loved the way in which Widmark and Peters interacted. This is one of the few moments in the movie in which you'll see a woman struck on the lips! Now it is difficult. Later, inexplicably, they become incredibly close - too close to being credible. Still, with such a big drama and an effective film similar to Noir, you can overlook it. See this movie.
