From the beginning to the end I really laughed through the whole movie. It's amazing that "The Groove Tube" is probably a grandfather, and at the same time the most ardent of all skit movies. For 73 minutes, strange, strange humor never ends! Just think how this nonsense of laughter can help you enjoy life easier! Yes, WAY is better than Comedy Central or any prime time! Do yourself a favor and throw away all those soft, lame romantic comedy movies! What's more, tell the money manager that you want "The Groove Tube" to return to the big screen!
