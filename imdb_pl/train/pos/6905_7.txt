I thought that Mr. Dreyfuss was perfect for the role of actor and dictator. His co-founder, Julia, played his role equally well. It was interesting how reluctant Richard Dreyfuss was replacing the dictator against his will. However, with the passage of time he became more confident and comfortable. Because everything happens for a reason in my life, I think he was forced to replace the dictator because he was supposed to stay there all year long. I'm guessing he stayed because he was going to see how well his life was compared to the poverty he witnessed in Parador. I think he took too many things in life for granted and needed a serious check of reality, staying in this country for as long as he did. <br /> <br /> But ......... .. in any case ........... that's why I gave this movie 7 out of 10.
