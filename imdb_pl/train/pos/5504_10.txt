I just saw it last night, it was broadcast in the series "Passionate Eye" Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. It has been shown recently (September 2003) at the Toronto International Film Festival and many others. This is quite an unusual movie. The creators of the film literally stumbled upon the story, being there to make a documentary about Chavez himself. Instead, they found themselves in the middle of events when the coup d'Ã©tat grew. They had unprecedented access to events and people, and mostly let history grow. They obviously have their own ideological perspective (which they reveal), but they stick to the background and instead try to focus attention on events, people, background and history leading to the coup. As a film, it is not a breakthrough in a stylistic or aesthetic sense, and I think it should be like that. What can we see what journalism "embedded" really should be? What we see is an extraordinary report from a country fighting for democracy ... a charismatic leader (Chavez) who really cares for his people ... a story of power and greed as a coalition of corporate / military / media interests come together to bring to the attack of a democratically elected leader ... and unprecedented access to the historical event as it develops. <br /> <br />
