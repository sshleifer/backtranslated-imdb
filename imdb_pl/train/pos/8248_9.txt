When you see the DVD cover, you're convinced it's some cheap, cheap Class B movie, made for $ 1,000 in someone's backyard. <br /> <br /> Wrong! <br /> <br /> This is high quality material and really good. It's a comedy and it's wise. He is also very moving in places with a nice place of politeness. The production values ​​are very good (it looks great), the actors are known, the direction and sets of the film are great. It's amazing. Who would have thought? <br /> <br /> Carrie-Ann Moss, playing against the type, is great, like "Helen Robinson", wife of June Cleaver; Billy Connolly is great like the grunting zombie "Fido". Tim Blake Nelson ("Mr. Theopolis") is a hoot who is a neighbor of the sexy zombie girl "Tammy", and Henry Czerny and Dylan Baker as fathers (check) are great, also K'Sun Ray as a young "Timmy Robinson" no you should overlook this. In fact, it probably has more lines in the movie than anyone else. <br /> <br /> If I explain this story, it will sound so stupid that few of you will watch it. You just have to take into account the words of people who liked it and said it was a very, very pleasant surprise. However, you need a dark sense of humor; recognition of the absurd.
