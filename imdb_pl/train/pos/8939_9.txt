A powerful adaptation of the bestselling book and a robbery on Broadway about the life of Bessie and Sadie Delana, two "colorful" sisters who lived after the age of 100. , tell their story in the flashbacks of Amy Hill Hearth (played by Amy Madigan), a white reporter of the New York Times. Retrospective and contemporary scenes do not have as much inspirational value as in the book, but they are really powerful. However, some aspects of the sisters' life, such as their mother's interracial background and father's raw personality, are not clearly represented. You must read the book to fully understand these things. Which is just as good because the book is just as good! In addition to these disadvantages, it is wonderfully made and made, especially by Dee and Carroll, and a very powerful and educational film.
