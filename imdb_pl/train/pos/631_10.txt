This movie has everything a fantasy film, romance, clever jokes, great acting and a good dose of magic should have. <br /> <br /> I really liked this movie and I was attracted by his original story (based on the novel by Neil Gaiman, which I now want to read) and colorful characters. <br /> <br /> One of the most striking thing for me was how self-sufficient this story is. In contrast to many fantastic science-fiction movies that currently leave open ends and this was a pure tale, satisfying in itself, without the need for continuation. <br /> <br /> The original. Fun. Feel-good Fantasy.
