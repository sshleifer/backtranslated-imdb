I can add that in addition to being an extremely funny movie, the costumes and decorations were great. This nice, funny woman had a lot of money. Unfortunately, she also had two greedy daughters who wanted to get money. This woman was lonely since her husband's death. He offered her in the theater that was to be demolished. To prevent this, she bought it. Her daughters were afraid that she was throwing away "her" money and decided to take action. The actors of the characters in this movie were also a great plus. I would give almost anything to have a copy of this movie in my video library, but it has never been released yet. Sad.
