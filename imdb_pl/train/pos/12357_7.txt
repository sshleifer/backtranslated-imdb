I really liked this movie and came back to see it twice as much during the week. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Detmers was on the show - she was like a hungry cat on the hunt, playing with her prey. He fights with rage and lust, takes a "too-young" lover and smashes hundreds of pieces of her mother's perfect porcelain on the floor. <br /> <br /> The film was full of beautiful accents. Maserati, a wonderful wardrobe, boxes for flowers along the roofs. I especially liked the ancient Greek class and the recitation of "Antigone". <br /> <br /> It had the impression of "Opowie≈õci o O", meaning people who indulge in a free sexual adventure. When she walks around a fantastic apartment, she is calm - and why not, what is to stop the "Devil in the body"? <br /> <br /> The whole movie is a real treat!
