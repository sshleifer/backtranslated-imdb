The Sunshine Boys is a great comedy about two former vaudevilles who are reluctant to join in a special television, despite the fact that they despise each other. <br /> <br /> The comical genius of two masters at work, George Burns and Walter Matthau are stellar! Some of the best scenes are the moment when the duo fights for the stupidest little trivial things! The material is fast and witty, attractive for all ages. <br /> <br /> MILD SPOILER ALERT: At the end of the movie there are some sad moments that indirectly affect the aging of the film. soft, honest, tenderness that shows the reviewer that what the couple really needs for success is each other. <br /> <br /> If anyone loves The Odd Couple, you love this movie. An excellent movie!
