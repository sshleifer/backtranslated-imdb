In this movie, there were no parts that would be fun, mostly plain funny units, but they did not have any parts that were really bad. Sid's voice was the worst. His laziness sura was too big for me. About 5 minutes later I had enough of listening to him. In addition to the annoying lazy voice, the movie was good. There were many side jokes that, if you catch them, will make the movie much better. This is a good movie for children. It has enough to keep adult content and enough entertainment for children. This is definitely worth renting if you have children and want to watch a movie with them.
