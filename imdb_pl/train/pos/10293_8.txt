"Bruce Almighty" will face Oscar winning 14 Oscar awards! It will outperform "Titanic" as the most profitable movie of all time! Jim Carrey's perfection will be at such a high level that he will announce his presidential candidacy for the 2004 White House playoffs. Almighty, then! These wonderful fantasies would only happen if the creators of the film (including Carrey) had the powers of God. The same premise is the most important component of Carrey's new laughter - Bruce Almighty. Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a television reporter who is so obsessed with being the main anchor that he is holding God completely in charge for his own mistakes. God, played by Morgan Freeman, grants Bruce the "Gift of God" (his powers) to challenge him if he can do God's work better. Of course, Bruce is "sculpted" with his newly discovered, blissful abilities and uses them selfishly. Carrey returns in his usual, omnipotent comedy form in "Bruce Almighty." Jennifer Aniston was not "bad" as Bruce's girlfriend. However, my best awards are due to the director Tom Shadyac for not letting the dog out of the house on # 2 and showed us the funniest scene with the bathroom dogs of all time! "Bruce Almighty" is not the most in-depth movie of Carrey, but is still an all-powerful exhibition of "Carreyism"! **** Good
