A brilliant adaptation of mostly internal monologues by Leopold Bloom, Stephen Dedalus and Molly Bloom by Joseph Stric in reproducing the captivating Dublin portrait on June 16, 1904. - Bloomsday - a day to celebrate - a double entender intended! Bravo director Strick, screenwriter Haines, as well as casting director and cameraman in creating this masterpiece. Gunter Grass's novel "Tin Drum" by Volker Schl√∂ndorff (1979) is another great film adaptation of the internal monologue, which I favorably compare with Strick's film. <br /> <br /> Although the original novel clearly recognizes the monuments of Dublin in the film are also recognizable characters, though in a novel with different names. For example, Buck Mulligan, with whom Dedalus lives, turns out to be an outstanding Dublin surgeon. <br /> <br /> This movie with all its perfection is even richer with additional views. <br /> <br /> Brian invinoveritas1@AOL.com June 15, 2008
