One of the few best films of all time. The change from black and white to color for the Sequence of Heaven and Earth was a direct perfection. <br /> <br /> The plot is extremely clever, the whole movie leaves you overwhelmed with all human emotions and, although the war film does not discriminate. I had to see this movie more times than ever and never tired. It's a movie that makes you question your own mortality and beliefs about what's happening after our death.
