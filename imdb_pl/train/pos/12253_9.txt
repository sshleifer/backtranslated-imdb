It has long been one of my favorite adaptations of the Austen novel. Although definitely not in the same category as the spectacular "Pride and Prejudice", "Emma" is a lush and relatively faithful television version of Austen's novel - especially considering its short length. The biggest change between the novel and the movie is good, because the unnecessary snobbery that Austen exhibits at the end of the story are removed here and replaced with someone much more similar to the Emma character in the rest of the book. I thought that the characters chosen to present the roles were well chosen. Kate Beckinsale follows a thin line between a girlish and social snob with a grace completely lost in the Gwyneth Paltrow version of '96. The slender blonde castles of Samantha Morton fit in with her attitude and character, because the simulator accompanying her role in the previous characteristics is replaced by Harriet, which we know from the book. The role of Mr. Knightly is, in my opinion, very well implemented; both the seriousness and the delicate compassion with which the hero is painted in the novel are present in this very neglected, sumptuous film.
