Who would not want to go on a journey with Peter Falk? The right eye of this guy has more character than most actors today. It is a kind of funny and moving movie that we all look for as a counterweight to all bombastic bored special effects. Women love this advice that arouses an affair for men, and men will be delighted with her interesting study of the character of father / son - one big little scene after another. And it has enough edges to be a real indie find. Of course, it's a love job for Paul Reiser, who understands what it's like to be both a father and a son, and also have both laughter and tears as you move through life. However, the coolest part was watching the Reiser Falk watch. It can be said that both his hero and his actor appreciated the new father of Peter Falk. Really delicious. Let's hope that this movie will soon be in cinemas all over the country so that everyone can laugh and cry with Paul Reiser and people.
