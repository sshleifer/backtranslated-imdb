I have not read other comments to the film, but judging by the average rating, I see that it is unlikely that they would be very complementary. <br /> <br /> I watched them for the second time with my children. They liked it very much. It is true that the adults did not hang around the floor, but the sound of children's joy made it seem so. <br /> <br /> This is a real farce of Mel Brooks, with a lot of moral content - how sad it is to be loved for our money, not for who we are and how our friends and colleagues are changing. No doubt there are many other films on similar topics, many of which will have more comic or emotional impact on adults. However, it is hard for me to imagine such an impact on younger family members. <br /> <br /> Hence for children 9/10 from me.
