I think that the creator (s) of the concept of this film deserves much more praise than they probably ever received. This, of course, is not a movie about the caliber of the Oscar, but at least for me this movie has left a lasting impression since I saw it for the first time in 1984 (in the theater). <br /> <br /> I do not think it is (and I hope it is not) a spoiler, but: imagine that you are acting on your impulses. Making the first thought that appears in your head, uttering the first words on your lips ... Without restraint, without awareness, nothing stops you from saying or doing things that, as intelligent adults, we know that we should not really talk or do . If at all, this movie just scratches the surface - it does not go as far as it could. <br /> <br /> At a time when Hollywood seems to be obsessed with remaking older "classics" to try and earn at today's casino, would not it be nice to see their remake of an older film with a modest success, for a good transition to next level? A bit further, and even examine what the original crew did not do, could not or could not cope 20 years ago? <br /> <br /> It's my opinion anyway. : about)
