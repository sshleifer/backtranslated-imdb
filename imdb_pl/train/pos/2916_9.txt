Of all the films that I have seen, and this is the majority of them, this is by far the best film that deals primarily with American airships (Blimps) from World War II. Yes, there are other good films associated with LTA, but most of them use special effects more than any real-time shots. The man's jacket has many more recordings in real time, etc. It's true, many banal dialogues, but that's what makes even more interesting Hollywood movies. P.S. I spent 10 years (out of 20) and have more than 5,000 hours on navy airships of all types, from 1949 to 1959. Proud member of the Association of Naval Aircraft etc. [ATC (LA / AC) USN Retired]
