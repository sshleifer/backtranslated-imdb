After being sent to prison for not less than 10 years and more than 40 years for being drugged and refusing to give up his achievements, Jackie (Erica Gavin from "Vixen" by Russ Meyer and "Beyond the Valley of the Dolls", in her last role in the film) must get used to living in the big house of "dolls", or at least try, in this early movie of Jonathan Demme. Because of his cheesy nature and pure viewership, I would include it in his best films, just under "Silence of the Lambs" and "Stop Making Sense", but so far above his other films. This little classic is just dingy, dingy and fun enough to be a surprisingly good blame and fortunately never exaggerates with the parody of the Women In Prison genre. Almost washed away from my mouth rancid, bad taste ridiculously proclaiming Filidelphia. However, the movie does not go down without a fall ("the extraordinary show is a HUGE job to sit down and it takes a lot too long, Barbera Steele is unfortunately wasted, among other small things) But do not let these obstacles keep you from watching a pleasant movie . <br /> <br /> My degree: B- <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: 5-minute interview with Roger Corman; Cast and crew Bios; Original trailer; and trailers for "Candy Stripe Nurses" (with a nudity), "Big Bad Mama 2", "Big Doll House" (with a nudity) and "Crazy Mama" <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Juanita Brown, Cheryl " Rainbeaux "Smith, Erica Gavin, Robert Collins, Ella Reid, Lynda Gold, and some show the skin
