"Happenstance" is the most New York-based Paris movie I've seen since "When the cat escaped (Chacun cherche son chat)." <br /> <br /> A movie from last year released now to use this attention Audrey Tatou wins the title "Amelie ", Its French title is more accurate:" Le Battement d'ailes du papillon "(The Beating of the Butterfly's Wings), just like in the summary of chaos theory as a control element in our lives. <br /> <br /> Tatou's genius is less irritating here, because from time to time it flashes with this dazzling smile among her unfortunate adventures, and also because she is part of a large, multi-ethnic band so large that it took me a long time, to organize the characters, especially since some of the sweet guys and older women looked similar to me, and some characters fantasized about what they should do to make sure he was not doing it or not. <br /> <br /> But I loved the coincidence of urban coincidences, from immigrants to loving nests to crowded subway cars to hanging around in cafes. <br /> <br /> The inscriptions quite annoyingly gave both parts of the dialogue at once. <br /> <br /> (originally written 12/8/2001)
