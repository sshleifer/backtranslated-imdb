Throughout his life, why did this film receive the rating of R ?! Although it's a zombie that feeds on the body, believe it or not, it's actually a pretty good family-friendly movie - at least if your kids are 10 or older. Unlike traditional zombie movies, this one has a great sense of humor as well as traditional values ​​- though a bit twisted! Language is not a serious problem, there is no nudity, and the movie style is definitely child-oriented (similar to the old television program "Eerie, Indiana") - but some knucklehead hit him in the R category! Believe me, most children have seen worse violence than this and it seems stupid that the audience would think it is an adult movie only. <br /> <br /> The story takes place in a parallel world. While fashion, cars and customs appear around 1953, in this bizarre world there was a sharp plague of zombies that led to the "zombie war" and huge changes in everyday life. At school, children are trained in armed combat, and later in the film a charming scene appears in which the father gives his son a gun and tells him to keep him in the backpack "just in case"! When it comes to life outside of school, it is also quite strange because people have now learned that zombies are not so bad! Hell, thanks to shocking collars and training, they can become slaves, who can do housework, clean the streets, deliver milk or, in the case of a really sick guy, be a "special friend". > This movie concerns one particular family who finally buys his first slave zombie (played by Billy Connally). Mom is delighted, and her son slowly becomes a friend of zombies. On the other hand, Daddy is not convinced - because he was forced many years before to kill his zombie father, and he has not beaten it yet !! Funny, disrespectful and unique - this film has to be watched by a much wider audience.
