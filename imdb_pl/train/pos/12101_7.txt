I remember seeing this movie at the West End theater in Louisville, Kentucky, when I was a boy. The scene in which Dr. Carmus finds the gardener's coffin and the dead body that breathes in it was the most terrifying part of the film for me, strengthened only by the darkness of the film. I was also wondering about the people hanging on the trees at the end until I recognized the part of the movie in which Blackwood's name was changed from the Black Blood, because in the family history there was a character known from many screens of different people. Sir Thomas Blackwood seemed to draw conclusions from adding to the deaths caused by the family. I also noticed that when Foster enters the cemetery gate for the first time, he carefully notices the sharp object of the gate, where he meets his end. I would not hesitate to recommend this movie to horror lovers.
