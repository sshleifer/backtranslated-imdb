The one and only movie. I just finished looking at EncoreW on DirecTV. I am an independent professional wrestler and I thought it was a good presentation of what a professional wrestler's life looks like. Now this movie was made 4 years before my birth, but I do not think that the rigors of professional wrestling have changed so much. Sad, funny and everywhere GREAT !!! **** 10+
