I really thought it was not that bad. It is not a great work of art, but Dermot M was definitely a better performer. Patricia Arquette predominated most of the time. He played the cello, which was impressive, and his lines were never forced. Besides, he is an amazingly beautiful man. Really sexy. Add this to your talent, and most of the things he was in are much more bearable. He always gives his all, even if some of the projects he was involved in did not reach the highest level. In most cases, it is not the actor's fault. Unfortunately, it is in some strange films that simply did not resonate at the box office. Always with the actors from the list, but not always a "hit". But it is "worth every penny" for every rented or purchased DVD. See the date of the wedding with Debra Messing - one of his best films. WORTH EVERY PENNY! ; ) (if you have not seen it yet, do it, you will understand this quote!)
