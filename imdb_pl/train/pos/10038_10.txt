Titanic must be one of my favorite movies. He has his own problems (which films do not have), but he is still pleasant. <br /> <br /> When I come across someone who asks me why I like the Titanic, I suppose my first reaction is "wait a minute, you do not? I know so many people who do not like this movie and I do not say I do not understand why. "Love story is too bad", yes, but is not it pleasant and moving? Okay, the love story between Jack and Rose is very unreal, everyone knows that there is no such love. But this is a film, do not everyone like to watch a beautiful story that allows us to fall into fantasy for a moment? Another complaint, DiCaprio and Winslet, are horrible actors. Well, in this movie, I agree that they do not behave fully. I think, however, that this is an unjust claim that they are terrible actors. Personally, I think that they are both very talented actors who unfortunately are very famous for the movie, in which they are not amazing. But the roles they receive are simple, and the characters seem so real that you can take care of them a bit, but I agree with many people that they did not do it as well as one would expect. <br /> <br /> And finally, if anyone has to complain that he does not like this movie because they hate romance or because they hate history or tragic films, then I apologize, but why on earth went and saw a movie that so clearly presents all these things. It's as if people complaining about Dark Knight is a bad movie because they hate action movies. Simply because you are a movie, and not because you do not like this genre, it's a good movie. <br /> <br /> He deserves his Oscars, especially for the best shots I think are the best I've ever seen in the movie, save the Lord of the Rings trilogy. <br /> <br /> I know that some texts fail, such as the constant screams of their names throughout the movie. Part of the flashback history can sometimes be poor, but overall it is an amazing achievement that makes the Titanic look so real and the drowning is so epic. <br /> <br /> I understand why many people do not like this movie, but most of it boils down to the fact that they do not like a basic idea, such as a love story, and not thinking that the movie itself is poorly constructed. <br /> <br /> I can tell you that I have read over five books about the Titanic, including memories of the day in which it happened, and this film is extremely historically accurate, with the exception of a few mistakes. The only thing I can find is that the pipelines should be threaded with copper instead of steel, and the iceberg looks quite unrealistic, just like the scene in which they hit it. <br /> <br /> I give this film 10/10, not because I like romantic movies, but because it is a great film achievement that leaves a feeling of horror with a realistic adaptation of events.
