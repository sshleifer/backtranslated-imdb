This extraordinary movie can be summed up very easily. First of all, although comparisons to Princess Bride are inevitable, it is almost pointless. While both films combine adult wit and humor with a fairytale background, "Stardust" is so different than any other fantasy / sci-fi movie I've ever seen. It is such a hybrid of these genres, but its plot and scenario are so unique that - along with performances, special effects, cinematography and score - the finished product is simply not comparable with anything that has ever appeared on the silver screen. Secondly, the score is very effective in simultaneously drawing us into the history and fantasy world in which it takes place and pushing history, while creating the right amount of admiration and emotion necessary for the magic to be credible in the sphere in which characters exist. Thirdly, I did not consider the film too difficult to track or misleading in any way. In fact, an interesting game between the three main themes made watching even more interesting. Wonderfully cast and wonderfully preserved. This fantastic adventure (with elements of science fiction) was the best I've seen since the days of "Return of the King" (not that I compare these two at all). OK, so it's not easy to summarize, but do not let any harsh and / or soulless and cynical review or pathetic PR of the movie prevent you from participating in the best time you could spend in the movies this summer (or even probably too long) !
