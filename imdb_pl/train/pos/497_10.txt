Call me a teenager, but I really think it's a great series. If you have not had the opportunity to experience several episodes of the latest Star Trek series, you should definitely watch this episode. Perhaps more convincing than in the case of the Voyager janitor, who launched the series with Cpt. Janeway, Archer's adventures are completely different, but strangely familiar ... Music is also catchy. No real sci-fi fan can go without watching at least one episode of Star Trek - and these installments make it worth the wait.
