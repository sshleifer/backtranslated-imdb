I'm Belgian and grew up in the sixties. Most of the American series was shown here (the original language with subtitles), and Batman was one of the first ones I really wanted. Unfortunately, this caused "panic hysteria" among mothers because Batman was considered too violent. Geez, compare the innocence of this series with the shitty children they see today. Because of my overprotective mothers from the 1960s, I had the chance to see only two or three episodes! I was so frustrated that I started collecting comic cards and chewing gum (I still received them!) To compensate. I even got the View Master slides ... I wanted to see a caped crusader. All children need a hero. <br /> <br /> Many years later I got the chance to see the replays as a teenager and I loved it a lot. Acting would have escaped me if I looked at them as a child, but I understood it at the age of 17. episodes, because they did not release the series on DVD (according to my knowledge) <br /> <br /> That evening I liked "Return to the bat cave" ... it was nice to watch, because it was full of curiosities and internal jokes. To see Adam and Burt was a delight, and this TV movie is simply fantastic in every respect. They play alone, playing their parts in the series. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to people who have produced this wonderful nostalgic "feast" ... I will watch it again. My advice to all Batman fans is: SEE THIS !!! Rent it !!! Borrow him from a friend !!! Buy it !!! I would never expect that I rate it as 9/10 ... Very well done!
