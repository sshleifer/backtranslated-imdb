Simon Pegg plays a rude raw and often uncontrolled celebrity journalist who is brought from England to work in a large American magazine. Of course, its winning ways cause various complications. A fun comedy based on facts in which Kristen Dunst (looking rather like an adult) appears, Danny Huston and Jeff Bridges. It works mainly because we like Simon Pegg despite his bad behavior. We totally understand why Kristen Dunst is still talking to him despite frequent tricks. I liked the movie. It's not all and the end, but it was a nice way to break the evening while sitting on the couch watching movies. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
