This movie exceeded my expectations. I thought and heard it would be rubbish, so I did not expect much. However, I was pleasantly surprised. At first, I did not get along well with the main girl and I did not care if she was alive or would die. After some time she definitely grew up on me and became a nice character. This is not an ordinary movie in which people die for no reason. There is a story that only takes a few seconds of the movie, but it explains a lot. I recommend this movie to everyone. If you're not sure, just look at it, because it's only an hour and a half. You will live like this for 80 years.
