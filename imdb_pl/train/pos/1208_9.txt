Every kid has this movie that pops up to VHS when there's nothing to do, or when there's a babysitter nearby. This was the movie for me. <br /> <br /> I can tell you the full story, I had to see it at least 100 times and I can say it's a good movie for kids / family. <Br /> <br /> I still have a tape, I have not seen it for 5 years, but maybe I will go this week and I will be a child for the whole day. <br /> <br /> You just have to love care bears and their messege. <br /> <br />
