I saw this movie at the Toronto International Film Festival. It is not as much fun as it seems, it is a three-part document (each episode is 50 minutes) with the Slovenian superstar philosopher / psychoanalyst Slavoj Zizka. Zizek takes us on a journey through many classic films, exploring topics of sexuality, fantasy, morality and mortality. The film was directed by Sophie Fiennes, from many talented Fiennes clans (she is the sister of actors Ralph and Joseph). <br /> <br /> I really liked it, although I think it will be even more enjoyable on DVD, because there is a goulash of ideas to digest. Freudian and Latin analysis can be quite hard and watching the whole series at once became a bit confusing at the end of two and a half hours. It did not help that unwise coffee and having a bladder led me to some discomfort for about an hour. <br /> <br /> The only real problem with this is that Zizek chose movies that were naturally filled with Freudian themes. He spends a lot of time on Hitchcock and David Lynch, not on the masters of subtlety. I would like to see him try to support his theories using a wider range of films, although I am really saying that I would like to see the fourth and fifth and sixth parts. <br /> <br /> Zizek is very funny, and some of the humor was that he watched the lecture, inserting himself into real scenes from some of the films he was discussing. For example, we see him in a motorboat on the way to Bodega Bay (from Hitchcock's The Birds) or in the basement of Bates Motel (from Psycho). It does not mean that his theories are not provocative. Even if I disagreed with him, it definitely made me think about the movies a bit. This is exactly what it is trying to achieve.
