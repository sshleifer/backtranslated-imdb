My older sister was born in March 1985 and has cerebral palsy. during the 22 years of her life, she saw nothing but the walls of our home and school, which is also occupied by other disabled children. I was joking all the jokes, because my sister is disabled, and I still think that no one is, will he ever be sick about her and her condition. Then I saw this movie. <br /> <br /> I knew what the Christy family is going through. but they were lucky. Christy could talk, he could communicate and he had artistic skills. my sister can walk, but she can not say a word, and she can not use her hands to do something, but to take hold of various things. but this movie made me realize that other people in the world like my sister and ending (telling the truth) made me cry. AND I WANTED SHAWSHANK !!! This film is seriously underestimated and should not. This movie tells people something. that people should be proud of their lives. thinking that you can not write well? This guy was writing foot. Do you think you are not attractive? this guy was rejected by many girls because of his condition. not the fastest runner? Christy could not even get up. <br /> <br /> My point: parents of small children, I suggest that your children watch this movie with you, so that they will know when they will see someone on the street next time in a wheelchair, do not stare at them as if they were strangers. My sister has millions of glances and my heart is breaking my mind that this is still happening to many people. This film will teach people that people who may not seem "normal" are also people. 10/10
