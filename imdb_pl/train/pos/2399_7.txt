Last year, it was a hit at the South By Southwest (SXSW) film festival in Austin, which featured an excellent cast of Gloria Reuben E.R. and John Glover to chew in the scenery. The film, shot in a small budget in New York, although it looks and sounds fantastic, takes us backstage by trying and editing what the actors call "The Scottish Play", as a reference to the word "Macbeth" thought to introduce an ancient curse. Acting shows all the emotions of the game itself, lust, jealousy, rage, suspicion and some fun. Games begin when the great actor is replaced (in the main role) by the well-known "pretty face" from the television scene of the soap opera to attract more crowds. The green-eyed monster takes over from there, and the drama develops nicely. Great soundtrack and good performances all around. The DVD contains the director's commentary and some deleted scenes.
