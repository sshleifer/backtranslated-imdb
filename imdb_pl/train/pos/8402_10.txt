THE VAN is a simple teensploitation image created especially for discs that make you feel comfortable, providing many opportunities to laugh and cry with your friends. Danny Devito has a small but abundant role as a car wash manager and almost steals the show! All leads are well-preserved, a complex of characters and directing quite suitable for this type of photos. Crown International Release.
