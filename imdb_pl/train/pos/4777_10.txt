Perhaps the most personal work of David Lynch is the most available. This time, instead of having enigmatic thematic structures that may or may not include a conspiracy or represent something more than living nightmares, Lynch provides a reflexive, fragile meditation on the universal objects of aging and family and finds confidence in both. The simple, real story of a farmer from Iowa (Richard Farnsworth) who rides a lawnmower to Wisconsin to visit his detached, afflicted brother, is still a lot of unique and original dream landscapes (some rather striking aerial shots of the heart, filmed by an experienced operator Freddy Francis) to make him undeniable Lynch's effort and his characteristics, which are among his most unforgettable. Farnsworth is splendid in a stoic and at the same time captivating way, allowing the stories he hears on his journey to become a part of his life, and Sissy Spacek engages in his best work a smaller role as his mentally handicapped, but diligent daughter (whose painful secret reveals itself in a moving way through the gentle return of the sensitive scenario of John Roach and Mary Sweeney), but the rest of the small cast for the person delivers indelible performances, one of the most noteworthy is Barbara Robertson, whose accidental killing of Deer is both noisy and sad. But this is Lynch's vintage with his ability to get involved and get off balance. For those who do not know Lynch or know him only because of his violent, disturbing reputation, this is a great place to start; for those who know his work, this is one of the best in his repertoire.
