The assumption may seem silly, but since Murphy's character does not take it seriously, it helps to ease the audience in the combination of mysticism and modern child abduction. A great cast, especially Charles Dance and Charlotte Lewis, and Murphy is at the peak of his 80-year comedy / action career. There is also a great F / X, a very surrealistic sequence of dreams and a rather original storyline. Often overlooked in the pantheon Murphy cinema, but this one is worth watching.
