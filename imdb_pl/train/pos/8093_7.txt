My friend came up with the idea of ​​watching an animated LOTR after watching the return of King Peter Jackson. In the end I bought it from e-bay, thinking that it would suck from the very beginning. Actually, it was not as bad as I thought. The animation was good for its time, they used a unique method of mixing live actions with animation to create interesting effects, and the guy who made the voice to Frodo sounded a bit like Elijah Wood. <br /> <br /> Not the best adaptation of the book, but believe me, I've seen a lot worse. It skips a lot of things because both the Team and the Two Towers are compressed into one two-hour movie. It's definitely worth watching, children can like, but still, absoutley does not compare with Peter Jackson's trilogy.
