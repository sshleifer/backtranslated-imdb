Calling this romantic comedy is accurate, but now confusing. Unfortunately, the genre has deteriorated into cliches, too focused on making the main pair gather together with very little space for atmosphere and other stories, making it formal and too predictable. <br /> <br /> The shop in the corner does not suffer from these diseases: they manage to create a recognizable Central-Eastern European atmosphere and have a strong position beyond (also strong) nominal tracks; I avoid using the words "supporting the cast," such as Mr. Matuschek (Frank Morgan) plays the main role in the film, and his story is as important as not romance. <br /> <br /> The 1998 movie You've Got Mail borrowed the idea of ​​the "anonymous pen" from this movie and was therefore accounted for as a remake. This is not correct and in reality unfair for a new movie - it divides the genre and borrows the plot element, but that's all.
