Monty Berman and Dennis Spooner followed "The Baron" in this fantastic series about the three superhuman spies who had warned "Six million dollars". It was my favorite when I was a young man and I like watching him. Stuart Damon and William Gaunt had undoubted chemistry on screen like Craig Stirling and Richard Barrett, while juicy Alexandra Bastedo pushed her way as Sharron Macready. The late Anthony Nicholls did a wonderfully rough Tremayne. By far the best episodes are those that have been written by Tony Williamson, Terry Nation and Brian Clemens, while Spooner's own "Hearing" is advantageous compared to "The Prisoner". I regret that there has never been a second series; the concept has left so much life behind. Would Craig and Richard be competitors for Sharron's feelings? What would happen if Tremayne learned about the powers of the Masters? Did the Masters have different skills than the ones we saw? We never found out, unfortunately.
