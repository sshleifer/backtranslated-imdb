OK heres, what do I say: <br /> <br /> The movie was perfect. I am a big fan of Nancy and read all 1-56 original books and read more. I am now 96 years old. Watch out for villains who give the film a lower rating than it should. All tips point to a great movie! I liked the whole thing. So what is Nancy in the present time. It's still old-fashioned like in books! People who have not read more than 5 books complain about seeing Nancy. I've read them all and I think Emma is perfect and that Nancy was perfect. I found a part of the movie terrible. I loved exciting car chases and escapes. I loved directions. I solved the riddle myself! It was really great. I suggest that you see this because the people who complained do not know anything about what a good movie is and B o Nancy Drew. Go see it. Maybe this is not the merit of Oscar, but a really good movie.
