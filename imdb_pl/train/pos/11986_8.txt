One night I saw "Speak Easily" and thought it was o.k. but I miss something. Maybe Buster Keaton strangely says he threw me out, or a heavy delivery of the leading lady's line. The next day I was thinking about the movie. I could not get the piece from Durante's head, I tried to remember the first scene of Thelma Todd better, I thought maybe Keaton did some funny downs and comedies. The next night, I watched the scene with Thelma Todd as a girl with a choir trying to impress Buster and Jimmy on her sex appeal. Very funny scene, great actors, their faces, eyes, their silly faces. I watched a different scene, their show opens on Broadway. Buster pushes every act in his blissful innocence. I laughed again, appreciating Keaton's fooling and fall. The next night, I watched the whole movie again and this time I see it for the first time: it's great! This is fantastic! It's lofty! Three great comics! Todd is dancing! Durante is singing! Keaton says! Sure, this is not poifity ... but in this picture there is a lot of laughter.
