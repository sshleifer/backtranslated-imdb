First, when people hear "GUY RITCHIE," they immediately think about SNATCH. Yes, Snatch was a good movie, but the problem is that everyone associates Guy Ritchie with Snatch. They do not expect him to discover new boundaries. This REVOLVER movie is different from kidnapping; it is much darker and very complex. The reason why I gave the grade 10 is that I had to watch the Revolver three times to understand everything. So this movie is playing with your head. It is very cleverly written. <br /> <br /> This movie is different than Snatch. It has been done wonderfully, the pictures are beautiful and you can recognize the personal accent of Guy Ritchie (director style). <br /> <br /> What praised me is the hero's complexity and how we have been asked more than answers.
