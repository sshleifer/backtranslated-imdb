There are films and there are films. Films are more than "cinematic" only cinema, while films are real works of art. Fraulein The doctor is certainly well embedded in the latter. Like most viewers, I was very impressed with the battle scenes, but the poignant character of the central character is what I think is the highest quality of the film. Having done everything possible to serve her country as a true daughter of Deutschland, all the time in the heat of addiction to morphine, Fraulein dies, despite all her efforts, is treated very miserably by the German commands. The scene in which the Doctor is transferred to the backseat of a Mercedes-driven car, lonely, abandoned and sobbing, is probably one of the saddest and truest performances of the "spy" fate in life. Only the emotional pain presented by Richard Burton in the film Spy, which came from the cold, approaches. Fraulein Doktor is a film much deeper than one would expect from a single viewing. I only regret that its producers will not want to release it on DVD, that those who have never experienced it, and those who saw it, could again enjoy this unique film.
