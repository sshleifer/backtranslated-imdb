This is easily the most underrated movie inn from the Brooks cannons. Sure, its faulty. It does not give a realistic picture of homelessness (in contrast, let's say how Citizen Kane gave a realistic view of salon singers, or the Titanic gave a realistic view of the Italians, WHO IDEAS). Many jokes are falling. But still this movie is very nice, there are not many comedies, and pulling it out of the stories of the most traditionally dishonored members of society is really impressive. This is not The Fisher King, but it's not nonsense. My only complaint is that Brooks should have cast someone else at the helm (I love Mel as a director and screenwriter, not so much as lead).
