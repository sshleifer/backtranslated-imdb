Johnny Dangerously falls completely in the category of hits or misses with overblown gags and a complete lack of an extensive script or story that has ANY sense. But that's it, right? <br /> <br /> The cast is nice; Michael Keaton, an excellent comic before he took himself too seriously over the years. Griffin Dunne, Peter Boyle, Joe Piscopo, Marilu Henner and Danny DeVito play with enthusiasm and at least laugh at me. But the complete thief of the scene is Richard Dimitri (sneaking the word "Iceholes" to the story of the film) as a gangster who can best deal with murdering the English language. <br /> <br /> I have many childhood memories associated with this film, I have watched it quite often, so I may be inclined to enjoy it more than many others. Johnny Dangerously is at least a completely innocent parody of a gangster film that even provides some good news about the dangers of smoking (and sex). <br /> <br /> I like it, but it's difficult to recommend. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10.
