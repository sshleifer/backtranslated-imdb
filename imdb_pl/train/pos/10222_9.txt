The unusual duo Zero Mostel and Harry Belafonte work together to give us interesting performances and themes in The Angel Levine. This is one interesting phrase in the subject "This is a wonderful life". <br /> <br /> Zero is the wife of Ida Kaminsky, and they both belong to a special class of older Jews in New York. Mostel was once a tailor and proud of his trade, but his back and arthritis prevented him from working. Kaminsky is usually bedridden. It is limited to applying for benefit. In desperation, like Jimmy Stewart, he is calling to God for help. <br /> <br /> Now, if he got someone like Henry Travers, things might go different, but even Stewart had problems accepting Travers. But Travers had one thing for him, he was over 100 years of this deadly coil and all his connections to earthly things disappeared. God sent Mostel something completely different, recently deceased Harry Belafonte, who should have at least received the basic training for the angels before he was given the task. <br /> <br /> Belafonte did not accept that he moved from life, I still have many problems. He also has a wife, Gloria Foster, who does not know he's gone, hit by a car at the very beginning of the movie. You put his problems and Mostel's problems, and you have a good conflict, beginning with the fact that Mostel can not believe in a black Jew named Levine. <br /> <br /> It was a farewell show for the Poles / Jews, actress Ida Kaminsky, who a few years ago received a nomination for the best actress prize in The Shop on Main Street. Another important role here is Irish actor Milo O'Shea playing a nice Jewish doctor. Remembering O'Shei's accent with The Verdict, I was really surprised to see and hear him take some of the doctor. <br /> <br /> Angel Lewin puts interesting and disturbing questions about faith and race in this society. This is brought to you by the stellar cast and, of course, created by the acclaimed writer Bernard Malamud. Make sure you catch it during transmission.
