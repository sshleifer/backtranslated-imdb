When I saw this movie, I was stunned by what a great movie it was. This is the only movie I think I would give 10 stars. I'm sure that this movie will always be in my top five. <br /> <br /> Acting is great. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslett are in the best shape. I do not think anyone could have a better job than Kate. <br /> <br /> If it's a rainy day and you can not decide what to rent, well, this is the one. You will love all acting, special effects and much more. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie, you can rent it or buy it now !!! You will not regret. <br /> <br />
