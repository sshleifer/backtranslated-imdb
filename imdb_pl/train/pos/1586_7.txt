Rosenstrasse is a more intimate movie than one of the epic proportions that could stop many viewers looking for a plot similar to the Pianist. Fortunately, Von Trotta, a good screenwriter, is in favor of a feminist look at an era overly illustrated with a colorful surface, but too little analyzed in terms of intimacy and from the point of view of an ordinary Aryan German rather from a Jewish point of view. Rosentrasse finds its strength in these underestimated burdens of people trapped in the historical circumstances of which they are victims. The pace of the film is introspective, intensely slow, meditative. In addition, characters are so alive that transitions between generations and the passage of time have been skillfully made. Rosenstrasse is not a masterpiece, and some narrative flaws are well visible. Another guilt lies in a trivial cinematography that can not capture the intensity of the inner drama in which the heroes live. Nevertheless, this movie is worth seeing. Finally, Rosenstrasse is part of the latest trend in German films that moves ghosts of a nightmarish past, a trend that includes such great films as Nowhere in Africa and, more recently, the controversial Downfall. I recommend this movie to those who know how to read outside of the pictures.
