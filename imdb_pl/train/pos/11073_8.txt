I've never seen a movie that would make such a debate in my life. Believe me, when I say that this film will eventually be remembered as a classic classic. I waited in anticipation of this movie, because I loved both Lock, Stock ... and Snatch earlier, but after some negative reviews I thought I would be very disappointed. I really enjoyed this movie and can not wait to see it again. This movie is completely different from both the previously mentioned Ritchie films, and also much better. I have a choice of my favorite directors, but none of them moved as well as Guy Ritchie just did with this movie. I believe that he took the film to a different level (I know that most people will laugh at this commentary, which tells about the reaction to this film, but I believe that time will prove to me right). This movie is very misleading and lasts longer than 2 hours or so long because I could not stop thinking about it or try to put things together. I now have a pretty good picture of everything that's happening in this movie (a few answers from endless hours of thinking, a few answers from reading the movie about other people), and now I'm looking forward to Sunday when I see it again. I only hope that people will go to the cinema with an open mind and hopefully they will be rewarded just like me and many others.
