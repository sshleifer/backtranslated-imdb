I had to see the movie "On Thin Ice" on TV in India. I have to say that the film was really well done and really made me shiver. The basic story makes me wonder what makes some addicts decide to go where others remain addicted ... <br /> <br /> However, I felt that Diane Keaton was in her best position ... in the scene he wants, and starts to rummage at home for cocaine ... he was the best ... both boys are good, and Lynda Boyd also showed who the good actress is ... The script is well done, like the photos and director .. and casting <br /> <br /> He must watch the movie ... for everyone
