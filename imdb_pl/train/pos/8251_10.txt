And this someone is me. And not only me, as I see here in IMDb, or when I leave the theater. Why did people love it? It's obvious: everyone already knows zombies (at least Horror fans by heart and the rest through "Rebirth of the Dead" or Resident Evil movies, etc.) Or at least they thought they knew everything about zombies ... until it appeared this movie. And you'll see the zombies in a new light (maybe). This is not a horror movie, although it contains a few violent scenes, but it is rather a comedy. Exact satire. And you will never run out of steam! That's why I rate it so high. When it comes to wisdom, it's amazing, acting is great, and the script has no (obvious) mistakes ... on the contrary: it's a gem and if you're a bit interested in zombies, you should see it! And even if you do not like them, watch it! Because it's a great (comedy) movie!
