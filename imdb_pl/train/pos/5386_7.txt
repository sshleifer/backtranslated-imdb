This movie is one that played very well in 1932 and probably would not work so well today because its style is somewhat old-fashioned and fancy. If, however, you are a typical person like me who loves older Hollywood movies, you cut the film a little loose and you can enjoy what it is - an interesting soap. <br /> <br /> The movie is set in the department for problem pregnancy. In this large room there are about half a dozen beds in which women are waiting for childbirth - but doctors are afraid of possible complications (jerks - such a room will really hurt mothers!). And just like the episode "Love Boat" or "Fantasy Island", each mother has her own story. With so many extreme and crazy stories you have to suspend disbelief. I could and I liked the movie very much. <br /> <br /> Here are some stories: one applies to my father. You do not see my mother, but he is a very, very nervous father and he is attached to the comic relief. However, he was wonderful here - very moving. <br /> <br /> Loretta Young and Eric Linden are sad. Loretta is sent to the hospital from prison - apparently she killed some terrible guy. You do not know exactly what happened, but you assume he tried to force it! However, she received a 20-year sentence - and her husband is devoted to her and is as much with her as she can. <br /> <br /> Glenda Farrell is a terrible person. She has a maternity hamster instinct - a really, very bad and alcoholic hamster! It's quite fun and worth watching for most of the movie. I loved drinking it from a hot bottle filled with gin and getting nervous when she learns that she can not make money from selling twins !! At the end of the movie, he has a typical Hollywood heart change, which was to be touching - I was convinced that it was invented. <br /> <br /> There is a woman who gave birth to a still-born child. Amazing, after the words, they return the woman back to the same ward as the women waiting for delivery !!! A crazy woman who you assumed a while ago that she had lost a child is leaving the psychiatric ward. He insists he has a child. Later he escapes again and takes one of the children! <br /> <br /> There is more history than this, but the ones I mentioned are the most important. As I said, this is a kind of soap opera and is very funny - and quite sad in the case of a few stories. The ending, in particular, is groundbreaking and exceptionally well done. There were some particularly good performances - especially Farrell and Aline MacMahon as the main nurse. All in all, a very good movie - and I have no idea why they thought they had to make a movie a few years later (which was typical of Warner Brothers).
