*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Well, seeing that I'm a huge fan of H: LOTS, maybe I liked the movie more than normal people. This film, however, is still perfect. He had plenty of surprises and gave some more to close the series. Although I was sad that Bayliss turned into a murderer, the overall impression I felt was satisfying.
