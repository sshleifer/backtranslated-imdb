The French novelist, disgusted with his wife's friends, goes to North Africa for a moment's respite. There he meets a vivid and talented Bedouin girl living in poverty. In spite of his wife, who is affair with Maharaja, he decides to train and educate a girl, introducing her to Paris society as PRINCESSE TAM TAM ... <br /> <br /> The wonderful Josephine Baker is a perfectly cast title role in this very pleasant French film. With his huge eyes and contagious smile, he immediately makes contact with the heart of the viewer. Her excessive personality and obvious joy of the performance make watching her a pure pleasure. Baker makes us take care of what is happening with poor Alwina during her transformation and introduction to European customs. <br /> <br /> Albert Préjean handles Pygmalion well for Galatea Baker; Georges Peclet is equally effective as a half-server servant, and Jean Galland as a mysterious Maharajah. <br /> <br /> The film is very handsome and well made, reminiscent of Busby Berkeley's films produced at the same time in America - although unlike the American films from that period, PRINCESSE TAM TAM has no racism. It should be emphasized that in France there was no Hays office or production code. Some of the dialogues and actions are rather provocative, but I must admit that Baker sings and dances to "Under The African Sky", as well as its climactic performance at the Paris nightclub, two of the most memorable moments in the cinema. /> <br /> Actual filming in Tunisia significantly improves the film. <br /> <br /> Josephine Baker was born in St. Louis in 1906, in a very poor family. However, her talent and driving ambitions quickly pushed her east and for a short time she was a member of the Ziegfeld Follies cast. Realizing that America in the mid-1920s had great limitations for a talented Black woman, she managed to get to Paris, where she eventually joined Foliés-Bergeres and Le Negre Revue. The French loved her and became a big star. A brief return to America in 1935. He showed Baker that nothing had changed for African Americans. She returned to France, became a French citizen and worked for the resistance during the first days of the war. Baker moved to Morocco in time and took allied troops stationed there. <br /> <br /> After the war, Baker's fate began to fall, and she struggled with many financial and personal difficulties. She was even forbidden to return to the United States for a time. Finally, Baker accepted the proposition of Princess Grace of Monaco to live in the Principality. Josephine Baker was on the verge of return when she died of a stroke in 1975 at the age of 68. <br /> <br /> She only appeared in two decent films - ZOUZOU & PRINCESSE TAM TAM - Baker is in danger of becoming unclear. But he deserves his place alongside Chevalier, Dietrich and Robeson, as one of the truly legendary performers of his generation.
