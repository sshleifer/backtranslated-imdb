Corbin Bernsen gives an incredibly intense and thrilling performance as Dr. Alan Feinstone, a wealthy and successful dentist in Beverly Hills who is obsessed with perfection. When he discovers that his charming wife with a blond hair trophy betrays him and the IRS begin to pursue him for tax problems, Feinstone breaks under pressure and violently circulates around the bend. Director Brian Yuzna, working with the appropriate dark, witty and mad scenario of Stuart Gordon, Dennis Paola and Charles Finch, reveals bubbling neurosis and psychosis bubbling under the squeaky, clean, well-groomed surface of a respected wealthy rich American with wonderfully malicious joy. What's more, Yuzna continues to make terrifying intentions with the wickedly twisted sense of gallows black humor. Bernsen positively shines as Dr. Feinstone; deftly designs a truly annoying stupidity that is just beneath the deceptively calm and secure Feinstone veneer. The supporting cast is also great: Linda Hoffman as the bizarre, unfaithful wife of Feinstone Brooke, Earl Boen as a furious, nosy IRS agent Marvin Goldblum, Molly Hagan as pugnacious assistant Jessica, Patty Toy as the dashing assistant Karen, Jan Hoag as the cheerful office manager Candy , Virginya Keehne as a sweet, clumsy teenager Sarah, Ken Foree as an accurate, senseless detective Gibbs, Tony Noakes as an equally clever partner to Gibbs Detective Sunshine, Michael Stadvec as a woman cleaning the pool with muffins Matt and Mark Ruffalo like a robot Steve Landers. First-rate f / x makeup is just as bloody, disgusting and annoying as it should be. Sophie's sophisticated photos of Levie Isaaksa offer many great angles of tilted camera and a few tasty close-ups. Alan Howarth's sensitive, shocking result also hits the creeping place in the body. A pleasant perverted feast.
