Julie Waters is always wonderful, but Adrian Pasdar is a positive revelation in this comedy curve about sex and transvestites, which can not suppress his obsession and the changes he is experiencing after his discovery. Unerringly avoids vulgar, noisy, easy jokes for a real joke and a real insight and has an absolute ball during this. Very nice, low quality, well-being, comedy
