in high school times in Salina Kansas, they filmed what they called "Brave young people from Weinberg" locally, and film crews have been quite outstanding for weeks. in the end, we learned that the movie was "Up The Academy" and was a bit ummm, "the lower forehead" than it was thought. <br /> <br /> I had to see it because I was there, and the audience seemed less than happy with the show. I was 17 years old and I thought that it was rather an uncompromising attempt of an animal house comedy to fart jokes. <br /> <br /> Since then, I have watched it many times, and my opinion has calmed down a bit. it's stupid, but sometimes it catches a bit of the "crazy" humor of the magazine, at least as good as most of the "Mad TV". Ron Liebman may hate him, but he is almost perfect and unforgettable. My favorite moment was a short scene on the Avenue Santa Fe, where I parked the car while I was buying guitar strings. It's a pity for my Pinto look, it usually seems to be cut out for television. I have not seen a new DVD, but if my old pinto is visible, they have sales.
