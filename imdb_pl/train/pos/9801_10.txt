The original animated Dark Knight returns in this adventure movie ace, which competes with the Fantasy Mask in its coolness. There is a lot of style and intelligence in Mystery of the Batwoman, much more than Batman Forever or Batman and Robin. <br /> <br /> There is a new criminal on the streets of Gotham. He dresses like a bat, but he is not an adult Batgirl. And Batman denies any affiliation to her. Meanwhile, Bruce Wayne is dealing with ordinary affairs and detective work. But Penguin, Bain and the local Mob make things a bit more complicated. <br /> <br /> I did not have much hope for it 'un, because I was very disappointed, but weak Batman: Sub Zero I have done so much here!), but I was delighted with ingenious and exciting sets, clever plot and brazen sense of humor. This is definitely a movie, without which the Batman fan should not be. Keep your ears open to the really catchy song "Betcha Neva" that is visible all over the world. <br /> <br /> It's a pity the DVD is not so great. Do not get me wrong, there are some great features (short "Chase Me" is amazing) and very nice Dolby 5.1 soundtrack, but ... the movie is presented in Pan and Scan. Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman was drawn and shot in version 1.85: 1, but this DVD is presented in 1.33: 1 format in comparison with widescreen clips shown on functions that are cut off on both sides. I find it extremely annoying, considering that the Fantasia Mask was presented in the anamorphic widescreen. Warner had to re-release literally dozens of DVD movies, because people complained about the lack of the original aspect ratio available in some titles. Why they decided to re-enter the same mistake here is beyond me. <br /> <br /> I would give this DVD 5/5, but the lack of OAR brings the overall score to 4/5. It's a pity, because a widescreen screen would be a great DVD package.
