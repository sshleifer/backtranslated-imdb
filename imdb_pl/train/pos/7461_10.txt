Comparable to Fight Club, The Matrix, A.I., Sixth Sense, among others. This film approaches the psyche in a way that has never happened before. The first 30 minutes builds an interesting love story between Diaz-Cruise-Cruz. The rest of the movie is, well, misleading, you will choose more each time you watch it (I went to the cinema to see it 3 times)
