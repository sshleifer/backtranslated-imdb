Despite the title, The Sword Bearer and DVD cover (action / herioc poses The Sword Bearer), this is not a superhero movie. <br /> <br /> (Minor Spoilers) This is a story about Sasha, the Sword Carrier who is cursed with a retractable sword on his forearm. You say good, but no, this is real life. If you had such power as a child, you could control it, say, in the face of a madman, or when your mother's boyfriend beats her. And if you do not control how you deal with being a double killer at the age of 12. <br /> <br /> Essentially, this is the place where Sasha meets. Wandering aimlessly after another murder (just like A Bout de Souffl√©). Then he meets Katya, and the couple immediately falls in love, providing Sasha with a real reason to live and try to change their ways. However, his past is still chasing him, in the form of two police officers. <br /> <br /> It is basically a story and there are virtually no actions on the screen, although many, if it is suggested. <br /> <br /> I really like this movie. Unlike many Hollywood "superheroes", we have very little history, there is no evil guy (unless you count the same Sword Bearer) when it comes to heart and good character development. <br /> <br /> It's worth checking if you can find it.
