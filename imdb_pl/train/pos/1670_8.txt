Channel 4 is a channel that allows more naughty things than any of the other channels, this show was certainly rude. The presenter of this chat for adults, the four-time BAFTA win and the British Comedy Award (also twice nominated) Graham Norton was just the perfect gay host of this good program. In the middle were one or more well-known personalities. In fact, they had an idea for adults who would offend, humiliate or humor the guest, but some are not for the faint of heart. They had women playing the dictaphone with their parts, men using their xylophone cocks, women crying up in the tub, men with or without pants under the kilts, and many other thick but fun ideas. This is only for adults, but be happy! He has twice won the BAFTA Award for Best Entertainment (program or series), won the British Comedy Awards for the best comedy program (also nominated), the best comedy talk show, won the Emmy Award for episode # 18 (?) And won the National Television Awards twice for the most popular talk show. It was number 52 in the 100 greatest fun moments. Very good!
