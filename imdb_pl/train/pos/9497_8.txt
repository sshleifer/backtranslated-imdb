Absolutely fantastic trash ... this one has everything: nudity, good fight scenes, gore, action, explosions, etc. It also plays the wonderful Belinda Mayne as Ingrid - not Olga, as another reviewer pointed out - although Olga changes in Ingrid later in the film (you will he had to watch it to see what I mean). <br /> <br /> I do not bother with history because it is too long and not too interesting. The relationship between Ingrid and her brother Bo (Robert Ginty) is interesting - watch the scene of the theft of towels to see what I mean. <br /> <br /> The battle scenes were pretty good right away, and then spoiled by really trashy gore effects that looked like they were made by a band that performed City of the Walking Dead (i.e. strange, colorful blood gushing from neck wounds). <br /> <br /> I would advise fans of a cheap basket to check if they can track a copy - it is quite rare and I have not seen anyone bother to re-issue it, so it will be less common in a few years. <br /> <br /> In any case, I "recommend her only for the great nude Belinda Mayne scenes! This lady is a fox!
