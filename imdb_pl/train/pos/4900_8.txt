This is a bizarre movie that the British are doing well. Low budget, cameo roles, well done. The story is a bit weak, recently widowed Judi Dench decides to occupy "blond bombshells", that is all (almost all) girlish bands that occurred during the war in London. Obligatory son / daughter who thinks she went to the potty. I liked the way the movie allows young people to see that they do not have a monopoly on feelings, love or even lust! That "old wrinkles" can also laugh well Judi Dench was as great as ever, I wish I could see more "blond bombeshells", the end was a bit rushed, I thought. I watched David Jason do even better Patrick than Ian Holm, although he was quite suitable as a transvestite drummer. All in all a cheerful movie worth a night with the girls :)
