What a cool movie-b! Shepis is absolutely beautiful, and Scarecrow is clear and original. He really brought me back to the 80's monsters. The budget is obviously low and not everyone is Pacino behind the lens, but it does not matter because it never takes seriously. Starting from trailers from the trash can to the scarecrow moves in high martial arts, this is a real jewel of the film b. Grab snacks, snacks and a few friends and relax. I liked the movie so much that I bought all three Scarecrow movies. Of course, they are not for everyone, but for each of them. Sometimes you just have to set up your thinking cap and smile.
