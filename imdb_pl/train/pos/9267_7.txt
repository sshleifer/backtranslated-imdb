Nice movie. Somehow I was forced to have the Iranians win the game in the movie, although I do not know anything about football and I'm not a fan. The ending on the bus was joyful. <br /> <br /> The film itself deals with the issue of women in Iran and how they are not allowed to go to sports arenas among men, because their curses are inappropriate for women to hear. Despite this law, some women try to sneak in, but many of them are caught and detained. It is truly amazing that any society can have such obsolete concepts of gender. In the interview, Panahi says that his films are documents of history and injustice, and that one day in the future we will be able to watch these films and see how Iran once lived. One can hope that the future will come sooner than later.
