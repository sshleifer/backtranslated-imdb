I did not expect Gackt and Hyde's performances to be as well performed as I expected and would not be cast in such a well-developed artistic film with enough story to interest you and provide diversity to be original. This film was an unexpected masterpiece for me and I will be looking for the next such film. I particularly like the fact that it is a vampire movie, but it was not a bad movie about vampires, nor did it embellish that fact. All characters had human characteristics. The way it shows the growth of heroes was incredibly tasteful and makes you really regret their whole life. I gave the film two thumbs so far. By far the best movie I've seen in the last five years.
