I was really surprised by this movie. Going to the preview, not knowing anything about the movie, except for one trailer I saw, I thought it would be a Dude Where's My Car. I was expecting bad sexual jokes and farts and a pathetic main character who will eventually be put together, because that's how movies work. Instead, I got a clever, surprisingly original movie about a decent, average guy who never had sex. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie is full of jokes and profanities and from time to time hey-look-unpple !, but it's done in the spirit of Bad Santa rather than the Sorority Boys. All characters are people you probably know in real life, named friends who just try to tie up their brother and live their lives. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie would be a complete shit, and I was very surprised. Yes, it's pretty good (come on, it's a 40-year-old virgin!), But it's very smart. <br /> <br /> After all, you're really attracting this guy to lie down, which says a lot about the movie, because honestly, did you really care if Ashton Kutcher found his car or not?
