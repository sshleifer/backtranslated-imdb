Actually, I never bought this metal as satan and so on, but this movie played on this idea. Although it is certainly not a film that should be taken seriously or judged really high, it fulfills its task because it plays while playing. History has a metal band burned to death in their hotel, one of their fans dreams about this goal and the band begins to rage from beyond the grave. So yes, some storyline "Nightmare on Elm Street". Freddy's consent had never molested a girl in the car. There was another movie with a heavy metal band, but it was very different in how he played because he had a band that took over the children's city and made them crazy. He just has one band fan who helps the ghost killer and then tries to stop him. There is nothing macabre about it, because I do not remember so many bloody killings. Honestly, the scene I remember the most is the scene in which the girl wears headphones and then is molested by some band incarnation. Nothing great but nice time.
