If you have not seen Eva Longoria from the television program "Desperate House Wives," then you miss. Eva will be one of the biggest Latin stars and you will soon see her in cinemas. This was the first Eva movie and it does a great job. She was 24 when she shot her, and then she looked hot. When it comes to this low-budget movie, it's pretty good for the first director, who has the film "Juarez, Mexico," which is currently being played at many film festivals in the United States. In fact, it seems that it may have a limited cinema version of some of the messages. It would be nice to see "Snitch'2" with a higher budget.
