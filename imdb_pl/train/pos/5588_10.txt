For the first time I had the opportunity to see this forgotten classic in the early eighties, in one of our art houses as a revival. When I observed this fever aimed at practicing sexuality in 1930, I thought that YOWZA! They fled with murder in Europe at the time. Unfortunately, this movie has been cut in the original American edition by the blue nosed Hayes Office (an ardent government censorship, initiated by the "holyer than you" biblical whip, Will Hayes ... former postal clerk, if you believe it), due to the general the subject of human sexuality (the prohibition of heaven for people actually did sex in the 1930s). The Ecstasy story is about a young woman (played by Hedy Lamarr) who marries a much older man and later regrets it. She (Lamarr) meets a handsome younger man and has an affair with him, which results in a divorce with her previous husband (another not in Hollywood films then - a divorce!). Despite the fact that the film was made in 1933, the director probably worked for the first time in the sound format (i.e., the film seems to have techniques that were mainly used in silent films - i.e. Expressionism in 1920). It is still worth looking for windows for early European photos to speak, together with Luis Bunuels L'Age Dor (1930) and Karl Gustav Dryer "Vampyre" (1931). It's not rated, but it contains this infamous nude swimming scene and some poorly concealed sexual references that by today's standards would be little more than PG-13 (but would easily land in a terrible "X" in the 1930s if it existed then)
