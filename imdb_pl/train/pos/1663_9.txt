I enjoyed every moment of this beautiful film and was intrigued by this female painter I had never heard of before. So I went on a journey after her life and work. As you might expect, I found out that the film was not exactly historically accurate. I was a little surprised by the very negative comments about the movie due to this inaccuracy. Come on guys, the movie is not and should not be a biography (or a novel!). Every historical film distorts reality because it should be a work in itself. The director has the full right to use elements from reality and history to create his own world. Artemisia is a great movie and I think that it has brought many people (including some who now give negative comments) learning about the life and work of this fascinating artist.
