Reflecting on this film, I can think of two others who will help him look from the perspective. One of the relatively forgetful, but covering the same geography, is the Coup de Torchon, the remaining thousands of miles and a much larger range are the unforgettable Indochina. Claire Denis produced a film that has some of the great foundations of Indochina, the complex and unspoken relations between France and its colonial subjects. <br /> <br /> I was struck by the dignity of Potee, with his fight his dignity among his peers and his white bosses. I was struck by the love / hatred relationship between him and Aimee. The latter gives the film the driving force, the latter combines this film with Indochine. <br /> <br /> It is never certain what motivates everyone, although some characters are obliged to remember colonialism. This is the cynical side of history that connects it with the Coup de Torchon. Their story is more scandalous, maybe even more interesting in a depraved way, but Denis reminds us of how it was with all the tension and unresolved unions. <br /> <br /> An American who gives an adult France a ride at the beginning and end of the movie offers another interesting side of the turmoil we have in the western world when we look at Africa. He says that when he came, he wanted to call all the brothers. He was coming home, but they just thought he was a little fool. France, a character and a girl, grew up in Cameroon, but they do not fully understand what it is, even if they remember what it was like. <br /> <br />
