Absolutely pleasant vocal and dance film with the participation of Frank Sinatra and Kelly, as well as Kathryn Grayson. <br /> <br /> The film won and Oscar for the score of George E. Stoll, and won nominations for the best movie, best actor for Kelly and the best cinematography, as well as nomination for the Best Son Award for "I Fall in Love Too" Easily "sung by Sinatra. <br /> <br /> It was a lovely story about Kelly, who helped her friend Sinatra to get a girlfriend and fall in love with her alone. The charming Grayson (The Toast of New Orleans) dazzled us with her singing, we had many great songs and routines of Kelly and Sinatra, as well as the art of the pianist-conductor Jos√© Iturbi. <br /> <br /> Classical Hollywood music from a bygone era.
