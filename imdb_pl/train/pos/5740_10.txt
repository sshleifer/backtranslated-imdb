Emotional powers and figures of Dominick and Eugene are things that Hollywood does not do anymore. It's one of the most emotional, sensitive and sensitive movies I've ever seen! Roy Liotta, Tom Hulce and supporting actress Jamie Lee Curtis, won the Oscar awards! There are not enough words to express how great the movie is. Of course, people who are not in sentimental films may not care as much as the rest of us about Dominic and Eugene, but for the rest of us this movie goes straight to the heart and the only compassion and humanity. You will never forget this movie, EVER! <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILERY PONIÅ»EJ ***** <br /> <br /> A simple but eloquent story is told in a masterly way. Eugene is an intern at a medical school who is struggling with long hours and demanding work in the hospital. His twin brother Dominick (born 12 minutes earlier) is a bit slow and awkward because of brain damage caused by his father's molestation victim. (A frightening moment when it turns out in a movie that will leave you in tears!) Eugene (a.k.a "Geno") faces a painful dilemma. He must decide whether to finish a medical school, which would mean accepting his residence in another city and leaving Dominick (aka "Nicky") behind him, or losing the rest of his education to take care of him. Nicky helps pay for school fees for his brother's lessons, working as a garbage collector. <br /> <br /> The issues of ethics, morals and duties are masterfully integrated into this landmark film. When Gino thinks Nicky can make progress towards independence, Dominick turns around and ends up doing things like helping a drug dealer or dealing with a faulty cord that is found in a landfill on an electrical device. <br /> <br /> Larry, is a "character" and Nicky's partner on his junk road that fills Dominick's credulous head with all sorts of stories, such as Geno and Jennifer (his girlfriend he teaches in Clinical Pharmacology) by going to Atlantic City and gambling all their money. But deep down you can see that Larry cares for him. In his rounds, Nicky also befriends a little boy who, as it turns out, also beat his father. The end result is also tragic, and the pain you see on Nicky's face, when it happens, says a lot. <br /> <br /> The sensitivity that they share for themselves can not be overstated enough. Everything Nicky wants to do is be loved and look for acceptance anyway. (I mean, he goes to church, he loves Hulk Hogan) Geno loves Nicky more than anything in the world. But can his brother become independent enough for Geno to fulfill his dream of becoming a doctor? A brilliant film that should have gained more recognition than it deserved, but unfortunately it appeared more or less at the same time as Rain Man, who was dealing with a similar problem. However, I like Dominic and Eugene because he has a much stronger emotional component. Please be advised that this video is aimed at tear ducts, so handy Kleenex! What a movie !!!!
