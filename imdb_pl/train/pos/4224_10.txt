I love this episode of Columbo. Maybe it's because Ruth Gordon is in it and she's wonderful as a successful mysterious writer Abigail Mitchell, an American version of Dame Agatha Christie. She is delightful when she looks like a dashing, sympathetic author who suffered a terrible loss when her niece died in the event of drowning. He blames her niece's nephew's husband. He plans to kill him to avenge her death because the police have abandoned her. I would like someone other than Mariette Hartley to play Veronica. I never really like Hartley personally. And of course with Columbo, there is some laughter when he asks Veronica during belly dance lessons. Abigail Ruth is a clever liar, and she fits the cunning of Columbo, always wonderfully played by Peter Falk.
