Pioneering Technicolor Cinematography (Oscar winner for special technical achievements) is really charming. Add an endless variety of great costumes and a romantic cinema dream team like Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer, and you've got a nice "photo". <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the imaginary plot, as well as the exaggeration of blown acting leaves a lot to be desired. Even before this film Technicolor (1936) there were no more breathtaking Technicolor films, and since then there are few that can take a breath of visual impressions of stunning colors. Cinema fans who enjoyed great color photos in Robin Hood (1938), Jesse James (1939) and Gone With The Wind (1939) will not be disappointed with the fantastic work done here. "The Garden Of Allah" will always be a synonym for excellent coloring.
