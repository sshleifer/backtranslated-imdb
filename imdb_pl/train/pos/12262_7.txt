Some thirty years ago, author Numa Sadoul published an interview about the length of the book with the Belgian comic book writer Georges Remi (better known as Herge, creator of Tintin). This movie is catching up with Sadoul today when he mentions the interview while we listen to the tapes (Herge died in 1983) and we will see old photos and photos of the man himself. Some parts of the interview have not been published in the book at the request of Herge, and now we know that they concerned his separation from his wife, after he had an affair with one of his colleagues (who after years became his second wife). An interesting thing about which the film is not moving well is the shift of Tintin's books from early right and imperialist books (Tintin in Congo, Tintin in the Soviets) to rather anti-imperialist books only a few years later (The Blue Lotus). In general, I'm coming out of this movie knowing a few things about Herge and seeing him as a little less likely than when I come to the theater.
