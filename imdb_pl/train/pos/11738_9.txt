ELVIRA, MISTRESS OF THE DARK (1988) <br /> <br /> director: James Signorelli <br /> <br /> in the stars: Cassandra Peterson, W. Morgan Sheppard, Daniel Greene and Edie McClurg <br /> <br /> storyline: Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) leaves her TV show and goes to the little Christian town of Fallwell, Massachusettes to collect information about her aunt's deceased relegation, hoping for big money to open the show in Vegas. Unfortunately, she only gets a terrifying old house, a poodle and a magical cookbook. While in Fallwell, Elvira tries to make money, breathe life into teenagers, win the heart of the stud (Daniel Greene), avoid burning at the stake and keep a cookbook from her terrible uncle (W. Morgan Sheppard) who plans to use the book to end the world. <br /> <br /> my thoughts: I love both Cassandra Peterson and her alter ego Elvira. She is a very successful, beautiful and funny woman, and as Elvira it is all morbid and comically naive, not to mention that she has an amazing pair of rattles. In this movie her charms are well used. <br /> <br /> I loved the whole "fish from water" movie. You have Elvira with her black dress, big black hair and huge "twins", and she is in a Christian city where most girls can not even wear makeup. It also makes her love story with Bob (Daniel Greene) much more fun. <br /> <br /> W. Morgan Sheppard is as wonderful as Elvira Vincent's uncle / nemesis, who steals a book to use it for evil. He has a lot of presence, but he still does not bother and steals the scenes from Elvira. <br /> <br /> What really makes a movie is not a story, but a lot of jokes. Everything from boob jokes to impersonating horror movies is here and makes me laugh a lot more than anything from the sequel of SCARY MOVIE. I heard that there are about 56 jokes about boobs in this movie, and every fan of Roger Corman's B-horror movies will love impersonating this movie. <br /> <br /> If you love Elvira, you'll love this movie.
