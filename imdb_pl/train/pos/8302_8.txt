Shooting with weapons, exploding buildings, smashing cars, and that's only the first ten minutes. <br /> <br /> This action-packed movie involving the wicked ex-CIA mercenary, who seems not to die, no matter how many times he scored (hence the title), is quite decent. <br /> <br /> Hard and biting Gary Busey, usually cast as a villain in these films, has his usual crazy charm, but is a bit more subdued: he finally wears the whole program. Which does not mean that there are not many great supporting roles like William Smith, Luke Askew, Mills Watson, R.G. Armstrong, Henry Silva, Lincoln Kirkpatrick, Thalmus Rasulala and several other "forgotten" actors. <br /> <br /> There are enough smaller action sequences to sustain the whole story: Busey must release a group of "kidnapped" American military elite and return an advanced "supertank" (normal tank with a tacky addition) -on pasted on top) back to the States. <br /> <br /> But does America deserve this killing machine more than bad? This question is obviously asked, as in any film focusing on the CIA ... but without preaching.
