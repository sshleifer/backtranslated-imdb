This is great - great acting, sets, clothes, music - but above all the story itself. <br /> <br /> I'm amazed that there are no more reviews of this movie - definitely one of the best 80s. <br /> <br /> It's also a great movie to see in tandem with the big "Random Harvest", who has the same opening crisis <br /> <br /> - middle-aged, unknown English WWI officer is in the hospital at the end of the war, suffers from shell shock and total amnesia without any idea of ​​his name, origin or wherever he is - proves that he is a very wealthy man - when he "recovers" I do not remember years before the war - <br /> <br /> But the similarities of the films end. <br /> <br /> The most warm thanks to everyone who took part in the film - especially actors Ian Holma, Alan Bates, Ann Margret (what a wonderful and surprising choice), Glenda Jackson, Julie Christie. <br /> <br /> This stays with you forever.
