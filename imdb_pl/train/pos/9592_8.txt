This film was released 12 years ago and was a revelation even for people who knew something about the drag scene in New York. Textbooks on dragging performance do not say anything about these fashionable homes. Anthony Slide's "Great Pretenders" says nothing. "The Drag Queens of New York: An Illustrated Field Guide" by Julian Fleisher with his influence graphics that connects Julian Eltinge, Minette, Warhol's queen and the club scene of the 1990s - and after the movie - completely ignores the houses. Even Laurence Senelick's "The Changing Room" - the closest thing we have to the final book on drag performance - is fast behind the film and does not provide basic information that you would expect from it. <br /> <br /> I understand after the movie itself and various articles that I found on the web that this home system dates back to the past. The main film performance of a house member from before 1990 appears to be Chrystal La Beija in "The Queen", 1968. The historical context is the largest missing part of "Paris is Burning". <br /> <br /> The movie is valuable because it focuses on a scene that would otherwise be ignored. This is a valuable picture of life from 1989. The unfortunate fact that Venus Xtravaganza was murdered during the filming is a very dramatic ending, but it is not the only transsexual movie that contains a real murder. As we already know, Dorian Corey had a mummified corpse in his literal closet, but it did not appear until three years later. <br /> <br /> Of historical significance, but we still need someone to make a book or a documentary that provides more context.
