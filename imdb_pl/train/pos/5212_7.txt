RATING STARS: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Much bad actor, interrupting his (now disappearing) looks instead of any strong dramatic talent, Richard Gere has always held a rather interesting position on the American Hollywood scene, always a sure bet in the leading roles of a man who still has a significant presence to this day. But now it seems that he has focused more on this type of direct roles on DVD / limited releases and as such he can now be more embedded in his forte. <br /> <br /> He must draw from a harsh case here as a hardened, cynical worker, Earl Babbage, one of those employees assigned to several hundred sex offenders in one of the US areas who, along with his new protégé Allison Allthrop (Claire Danes) ) must take up his latest matter, delving into the kidnapping of a young woman, trying to forgive himself for a case that has failed centuries ago. <br /> <br /> This is some diving into the darker side of humanity, treading the material definitely not for sensitive or light-seeking watching. And that is why it is quite a powerful, fascinating movie, unwavering and uninhibited DVD budget. The only thing that really holds him back is the over-used, shaky, quick camera sequences used in more dramatic moments that after a while look a little trite. But it's still one of the most durable materials I've seen in Gere, constantly dimming and going beyond the boundaries. ***
