In a series full of great episodes, this one stands out as one of my favorites. This is not the deepest episode, no meaning or message. But it's great fun, and there are some great performances. <br /> <br /> But what really sets me apart is that, in my opinion, * only * episode Twilight Zone with * double * ending the snapper. The zone is rightly famous for delivering a big surprise at the end of the story. But this time you will get a surprise and think it is, but it turns out that there is * another * surprise waiting. I just like it so much that it is probably one of my two favorite episodes (the other is deeper, more message-oriented).
