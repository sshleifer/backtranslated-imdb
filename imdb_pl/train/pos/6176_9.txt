The 1986 TV movie The Spirit was a pilot of a possible series. However, the creator of the Spirit, Will Eisner, did not like the film and therefore no series was produced. I thought it was a very funny movie and I captured the spirit (sorry) of the comic with a modern twist. I'm sorry he did not materialize in the series. Sam (Flash Gordon) Jones was a perfect Spirit. Nana Visitor was a nice Ellen Dolan and of course later she went to Star Trek: Deep Space Nine years later. Perhaps with the release of the large-screen version of the Frank Miller Spirit, more people will be able to see this rare jewel of the history of the Spirit. It seems that when Hollywood shoots a film from an already established character or idea, someone will inevitably search for previous versions of the property and share it with the video to earn a few dollars. When Antonio Banderas set up the Zorro mask, we were able to get earlier versions of the masked hero on DVD, such as the great version of Alain Delon from the 70s (though all the copies I've ever seen were poorly edited). Here are the hopes that someone will soon release the TV adventure The Spirit on DVD.
