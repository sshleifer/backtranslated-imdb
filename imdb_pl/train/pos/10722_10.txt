Spacecamp is one of the movies that love children, and mom and dad can have fun watching. Growing up in the 1980s, I liked this movie, its plot and all the actors. I recently bought this movie on DVD, so when I have my own children, they will be able to enjoy watching this movie just like me. The plot is fun, a group of children, set out on a journey they never expected when they were launched into space by a successful robot. At first they were at rest, but when they realized they did not have enough oxygen to regain panic. When they recovered enough oxygen from the space station, they returned to Earth as even better friends and a new recognized respect for life.
