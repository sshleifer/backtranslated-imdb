Here's a funny fact, I was a kid in the movie, the one in the crib. :) I'm 19 now. my parents took me to try this role, we lived in Texas then. My parents said I would cry when I was happy and I would be happy when I was about to cry. I was all confused. Strange and funny fact, I think ... and no, I'm not a child actress. I live in San Antonio, I work on walgreens. I graduated here in Texas, but most of my life I lived in Maryland. This film, however, is a great idea. I've seen it several times in my short 19 years.
