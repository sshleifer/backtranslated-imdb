Another demonstration of Kurosawa's genius, his first colorful film is a surreal view of the tragic lives of Tokyo residents in the slums, a series of intertwining vignettes depicting several groups of people who set off into a dangerous existence in the harsh and untamed post-war slum city. This film, going from comedy to tragedy, shows how people deal with the worst kind of life in their own way, mainly retreating into themselves and living in fantastic worlds of their own heads, withdrawing emotionally from the surrounding or drowning in alcohol. Combining the realism of the kitchen with a sink with kabuki-esque theaters, Kurosawa is experimenting with the emotions of its audience, drawing tears and laughter with equal skill. A wonderful, comprehensive experience.
