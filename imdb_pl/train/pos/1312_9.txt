Crop it in the winning column, it was a great movie. The performances were great, and the script was just as great. <br /> <br /> Helen Hunt was great as a Riverside policeman, Gina Pulasky. Gina had a complex form. She was a novice police officer at the Riverside Police Department. She ended up having an affair with a colleague of whom she knew she had a wife and children, all the while undertaking a dangerous task to hide the serial killer. <br /> <br /> Jeff Fahey (Ray Liotta looks similar) did a dizzying job as a confused, often stuttering policeman who had an affair with Gina. He was a stoic officer, but he was completely different when he dealt with his feelings and extramarital affairs. <br /> <br /> Steven Weber, especially from the sitcom "Wings", did a nice job as a quiet, quiet, underdeveloped sociopath. Seemingly he was an innocent loser, but a murderer with a cold heart was lying under the surface. Weber really took on the personality of a childish young adult with an insatiable desire to kill young boys. <br /> <br /> The whole movie was spectacular. Every scene, every verbal exchange allows us to learn more about heroes. The production team performed a phenomenal work with the condensation of days, if not weeks, of events in a 90-minute film. This movie was a good example of how much we do not do enough.
