He has a song. He has a drama. He has a comedy. He has a story. This is one of the greatest films in history ... period. If you can not enjoy this movie, you must either sleep or have some mental chaos. In "Yankee Doodle Dandy," James Cagney sings and dances to the Oscar; but this movie is BETTER! This is James Cagney in his BEST quisessential! It's fast with one liner! It's fast with legs! It is a continuous operation. And the skits for song and dance are classics, especially "Shanghai Lil". And the support cast is great; and the whole movie is optimistic, fast and exudes self-confidence. And although this movie was made over 70 years ago, it is still to be seen, even today. And of course, this movie contains Miss Ruby Keeler (who was the wife of Al Jolson). He's the perfect partner for James Cagney ... and Dick Powell! If you like enthusiastic, fast movies, with lots of singing and dancing, this is a movie to watch.
