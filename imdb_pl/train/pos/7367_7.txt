I currently conduct film studies at the A.S level, and "this is not a love song" is a film that we watched and in my opinion it is a film with a very simple story, but a complex story. If you scratch the surface, you'll see a movie about the thriller, in which two men running around the village from farmers, after committing a murder: - "sounds quite exciting." <br /> <br /> However, you need to go deeper to discover the real sense of the real species. As he suggests, this is a love story between two homosexual lovers, full of trust, deceit and betrayal. We were not told about this "love" directly in the film, but about the events that happened, for example about how Heaton works for Spike, almost shouting at this untouched romance on our faces. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie is a good example of why British movies should not be rejected as "junk" just because they are done at a low budget. <br /> <br /> A good movie with a complicated story, but it is definitely a taste and probably is not suitable for the average fan of Hollywood hits.
