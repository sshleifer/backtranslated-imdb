Please, future writers, producers, directors - learn from this movie! <br /> <br /> I've never seen such a bold and original story created for a large movie screen before. Brave, because the script was constantly taking a step to avoid many fantasy films - a step to something new, creative and bold. only if you think "oh, I've seen it before" or "I'm sure it will happen now" - StarDust would have made an unexpected turn and drew you into the story more and more. <br /> <br /> the actors are great - even the smallest part is performed with such talent that it fills me with admiration for the creators of this film. Robert De Niro is wonderful and plays with such energy that he simply steals the show in every scene he is in. Michelle Pfeiffer is an ideal witch, and Claire Danes is a great choice for an innocent and loving "star", Yvaine. Other big names play outstanding roles. I've filled everyone who wants to do their best for this movie. But once again the story of Neil Gaiman, all the little things that he "invented" for this universe - simply outstanding. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie today before the screening, the day before the official premiere and hope it will be a huge success. There is so much humor, but also tense moments, as well as charming, delicate scenes. A look in Yvaine's eyes, Captain Shakespeare's "frivolity", passion Lamii - witch - impressive, unforgettable <br /> <br /> For me, this is the entertainment film number one in 2007, watch it and enjoy it <br / > <br /> 11/10 - Znakomity <br /> <br /> peace and love
