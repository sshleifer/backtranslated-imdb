It's a very nice and poetic story. Beautiful scenery. Great music. Last year I was twice in Japan, and the movie gave me a typical Japanese feeling. Camera movement is excellent, as are the actors. It penetrates deeply into your feelings without becoming melodramatic. The Japanese are very sensitive and nice, and all of this is very clearly visible on the screen. The director plays great with light and colors and shows the audience that you can also let them enjoy the movie with subtle and fine details. After watching this movie you will want to see more of the same director. It's a really good movie and I can recommend it to everyone.
