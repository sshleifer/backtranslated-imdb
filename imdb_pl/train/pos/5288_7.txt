This funny cartoon Bugs Bunny sees the return of Marvin Martian and his helper K-9 a green dog. <br /> <br /> This time instead of trying to destroy Earth, Marvin has a landing mission, get the Earth creature and take it back to Mars. Of course, the creature he chooses is the Bugs Bunny. At the beginning Bugs thinks that Marvin and K-9 are tricks or tricks, but he realizes that it can not be right when Marvin drastically enlarges the rabbit hole with a rifle. Bugs tries to trick his way out of the situation in several ways, including persuading Marvin that the K-9 is planning a rebellion. In the end, he is captured with the help of the Acme jacket that throws away the bazooka. Surprisingly, in the case of Acme, it works as it is advertised, and Bug's is forced to use his wits to free the K-9, the tables soon turn away, and the two dissatisfied Martians are baffled, and Bugs tries to throw his saucer to Earth. <br /> <br /> I really liked it, although the ending is a bit weak compared to the rest of the story. Marvin's voice has changed a bit here, and when he is angry, he becomes emotionally visible, but that does not make me more or less like him.
