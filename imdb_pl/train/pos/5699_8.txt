One of the most disturbing and tragic periods in American history began. The members of the Summer of Love culture, in the late seventies and early 80s, finally ceased to be prepared for love beads and all-night parties and returned to the mainstream of life, whatever that meant. For those who could not grow up to be their youthful and sometimes irrational enthusiasm, their culture was the land of spells. Love for drugs and a sense of law combined with aversion to authority, values ​​and "establishment" is the world that the film records. <br /> <br /> The 1960s were a time of revolution and sudden changes that ripped apart the American home. When the battles were over, we all had to deal with the consequences of the slaughter. Characters in the Wonderland home are icons of misfits from the seventies; part of a motorcyclist, part of a hippie, part of a cheater, all outcasts. No ideology to express, only a sense of dissatisfaction with everything and loyalty to nothing. Ron, Billy and David like each other like Robin Hoods with drugs. They talk about love and behave violently; they take from the rich and sell the stray; they rob everyone. <br /> <br /> The film is skillfully guided and moved and gives the crazy world of the devils of drugs in its element. The fact that Holmes is a porn star is almost irrelevant. This story was told in "Boogie Nights". This is the history of the transition and forgetful era.
