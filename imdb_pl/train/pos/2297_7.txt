In every movie "Hammer" I see something that really introduces me to a new fantasy world. In the world of "Hammer" movies, anything can happen. "Guardian of the Abyss" is one of those movies. He deeply enters the occult and hypnosis to introduce a different kind of horror. In total, an unforgettable movie. 7.5 / 10.
