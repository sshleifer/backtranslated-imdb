It is very easy to qualify this film: "A PURE MASTERPIECE". This opinion was formulated for the following reasons: the performances of the actors seem to be citizens of this era, 1100 BC. They perfectly personalize the characters. The second reason is that the poetry expressed by Homere in his poem is well served by production. Among other things, the narratives made by the chorus give a special atmosphere that makes us a party of artistic interpretation. The third reason: the design is absolutely perfect, in Mediterranean regions, where the action of the poem took place. And above all, emotions are on a date. I repeat my appreciation: "A PURE MASTERPIECE".
