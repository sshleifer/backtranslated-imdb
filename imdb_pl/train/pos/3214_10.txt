I fell in love with this silent action drama. Kurt Russell and only Kurt Russell could play so well. Raised from childhood to know only war and battle, Todd (Kurt Russell) is abandoned on the planet after he was outdated by genetically modified soldiers. <br /> <br /> The scene is set and the next classic icon of action movies born - SOLDIER. No Rambo, no Schwarzenegger, no Bruce Willis, no Mel Gibson, no Jason Statham - Kurt Russell is the owner of this role and made it his own - original, daring and too human. I miss the fact that sequels have never been created. <br /> <br /> 10/10 <br /> <br /> -LD <br /> <br /> _________ <br /> <br /> my faith: http://www.angelfire.com / ny5 / jbc33 /
