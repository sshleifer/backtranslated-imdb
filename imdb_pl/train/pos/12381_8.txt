A successful young woman is also involved in marriage and has attempted suicide twice in the past, is chosen by the secretive and distant association of Catholic priests to be the next "guardian" to the gates of hell, which apparently passes through the old but well-maintained a residential building in Brooklyn. His tenants take the stairs up and can reincarnate, but apparently they can not escape until the sentry blocks the road. The previous one (John Carradine) concerns the dead, so fate or anything else becomes the next, and the condemned to death must force her to kill herself so that they are free. Many interesting details lie below the surface, her relationship with her father, stories about the doomed, her fianc√©, so you can pass it on as a cheap exploitation horror, but given the sets, great cast and general level of quirkiness, it's definitely worth seeing.
