I resisted watching this movie and I understand why it was not a big hit in cinemas. "October Sky" feels and looks so familiar. And this is. All plot lines and emotions have been studied earlier in other films - and maybe even better. But despite his knowledge and resistance to all Hollywood formulas, this film wins and is pleasant at every turn. <br /> <br /> Sputnik is the inspiration for this journey of heart, mind and soul. Just like the characters from Steven Sondheim's musical MERRILY WE ROLL ALONG stood on the roof of their apartment, hoping to launch their new generation ("What do you call it? You call it a miracle."), Sputnik has a similar effect on young rocket boys in this real story. While the weary residents of the 1950s coal town reject this event, Homer Hickham sees Sputnik as his life ticket in the mines. <br /> <br /> The masterful direction and casting make the journey of the rocket boy Homer and his buddies seem fresh and new. The threads about the poor young teacher of Homer are particularly acute. Remarkable restraint is shown in their delicate relationship. Also worthy of note is the supotot of the father / son who anchors the film. Perfectly played around. Even Homer's mother has her moment without any clich√©s or intrusions. Her ultimatum to her husband is both dignified and hot. "Myrtle Beach" says it all. <br /> <br /> The large video network I despise has a sign next to the movie that says you'll love this movie or refund your money. Once, I agree with them. You will never look at the October sky again. <br /> <br />
