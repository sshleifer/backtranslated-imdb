Attractive to children Louis Sachar is a Disney classic as Freddy Krueger. He has murder, racism, facial disfigurement and deadly lizards. <br /> <br /> Tightly drawn out, it's a multi-layered, connecting story that covers history to discover Stanley's own legacy and the secret behind the holes. From the lush green of Latvia to the marked Camp Green Lake (hint: there is no lake and greenery). <br /> <br /> The first success of Disney is such a convincing reproduction of the novel's surroundings - the set design is excellent and without gloss. The second plus is casting. The rising star Shia LaBeouf (Charlie's Angels 2, Project Greenlight) may not be a fat boy from the book, but his attitude is correct and far from the usual pure hero. The rest of the cast is as well completed as Patricia Arquette as a frontier student who became a bandit and Henry Winkler as a Stanley dad. The downside is the pop soundtrack - a pure marketing department - and at the end of the mood it reached full volume.
