The film, which I thought was perfect, was supposed to be about a romance with little tension. <br /> <br /> Rob Stewart is a great actor. I do not know why people are still raping him badly. When it comes to Mel Harris, she's a great actress, and it's only five years for those who think she's too old for Rob. <br /> <br /> Rob had a major role in his TV series, as well as in the SciFi Channel. I'm sure you remember Topical Heat aka Sweating Bullets and PainKiller Jane. <br /> <br /> He also starred in several television films and is currently creating the Mini TV series. <br /> <br /> must give him more major roles in which he is the best.
