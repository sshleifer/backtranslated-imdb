Fantastic Arab adventure. Former King Ahmad and his best friend, the thief Abu (played by Sabu from Black Narcissus), look for the love of Ahmad, stolen by the new king Jaffar (Conrad Veidt). There is almost no time here. It always invents new adventures for heroes. Personally, I think Ahmad and his princess are a little bit boring (no need to ask why John Justin, who plays Ahmad, is in the fourth place in the ranking). Conrad Veidt, always a funny actor, makes a great villain, and Sabu has a great time as a thief prince who at some point finds a gin in a bottle. I really loved Miles Malleson as Sultan Basra, the princess's father. He collects amazing toys from around the world. Jaffar bribes him by the hand of his daughter with a mechanical flying horse. It will probably be considered one of the great films of all children, but the special effects are terribly outdated today. Children certainly sneer at superimposed images when Abu and gin are together on the screen. And the scene with the giant spider looks extremely horrible. Although the majority of the younger generation probably think that King Kong looks bad at this moment, the stop-motion animation by Willis O'Brien is a thousand times better than a puppet on a string that does not even look like a spider. 8/10.
