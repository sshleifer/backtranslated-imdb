Ella was excellent, Franchot was inevitably exaggerated (but he played similar parts in other movies, such as "Man at the Eiffel Tower"), and Alan almost did not exist, but the movie certainly "delighted". > <br /> * before us a gentle spoiler *: I wonder how many times Elisha Cook has been strangled in his films, but I think I remember other examples. I will avoid naming the murderer, but I think this is obvious due to the story of the "thriller". <br /> <br /> A very well made, but outdated movie (for example: everyone smoked like crazy, and the police were really not figures from dead bodies, in contrast to today's gore festivals.) made in a known short format this period. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10.
