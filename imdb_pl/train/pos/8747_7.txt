* Possible Spoilers * Although the Brokedown Palace was previously (and better) in "Midnight Express" and "Return To Paradise", it still hits me. <br /> <br /> Here is the story of two young girls who travel around Thailand and be arrested on charges of drug trafficking. Was it Alice Clare Danes? Is this Darlene Kate Beckinsale? Was he a handsome stranger whom they met while traveling? Nothing really matters because it's a story of friendship and trust, and limitations that you can resist. Put Bill Pullman as a dissatisfied lawyer, and Jacqueline Kim as his Thai fianc√©e (and a better lawyer than he) and we have a nice little story that catches the public's attention. <br /> <br /> Brokedown Palace is nothing extraordinary, or notorious for some reason - it is not an original concept, it does not show a sensational violence that leads to the fact that the would-be avant-garde crowd speaks of "snappy realism" or "hard" hits "- it's just a good story with some great performances. Bill Pullman is the weakest with his lazy drawing and gravel way of speaking - I was bored with the character. <br /> <br /> Kate Beckinsale, though decent, is nothing spectacular. It works well, but it is not an unforgettable performance. <br /> <br /> However, Jacqueline Kim is in great shape, creating a nice and defined character in which there really is not much to work. <Br /> <br /> But do not be wrong - this is Clare Danes' movie. I have been a fan of her work for a long time and this is not a change. It captivates in every emerging scene, and if it were not for her, the film would probably bend into a boring tariff. I particularly applaud her performance on stage between her and her father Darlene. <br /> <br /> The movie also has a great soundtrack. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
