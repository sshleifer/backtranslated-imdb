I did not read all the comments, but at least one poster mentioned that the 30-minute version could be shortened. Personally, I'm curious because later parts of the movie did not make much sense to me, even when I looked through them. 30 minutes seems really short for the movie in 1917. "Poor Little Rich Girl", which was another Tourneur movie, has 65 minutes, and "Pride of the Clan", which was his previous film, had 84 minutes. I feel relieved to see that I am not crazy, that there must be a part of this lost movie, and therefore the resolution did not make much sense. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to judge or comment on a movie that can only be seen in the middle ... but I still recommend this movie because of the truly fascinating view that provides the interior of the East Coast film studio at the time. This is the earliest film that I've personally seen, based on the film industry itself. The main character is the movie star played by Robert Warwick, who later became the main Hollywood actor and appeared in almost all of Preston Sturges' films. The game of a western actor, perhaps a bit modeled on William S. Hart, which Warwick resembles a bit. After really fascinating sequences in the studio, we see them in a photo session, in which he discovers a village girl (Doris Kenyon) and convinces her to come to New Jersey for a screen test that goes very badly. After this point, the movie seems to be missing the main tracks in the form we have now. <br /> <br /> Again, I recommend it to anyone who is interested in the history of the film for documentary value, but in the form that we have or does not stand the film and is not a particularly good example of the work of Maurice Tourneur.
