Crush provides a combination of drama, humor and irony, which I consider very good when it comes to heart issues. Known primarily for his direction, John McKay wrote this wonderful scenario about three forty-some friends in a small town in England. All three professional women who are unlucky with men have organized a ritual maiden night, collecting gin, fags and sweets. Andie MacDowell once again thrown by the British environment (in which, as I can see, emanates the most) is absolutely charming as the main lady of a prestigious school that engages in a younger man. Rumors about a small town and unhappy jealous friends (great support cast) clash with her relationship. Developing a series of violent, unfortunate events and showing us many difficulties when someone seeks real happiness. Remember that the main premise of this video are friendships, and the ending shows us exactly. It is a kind of movie that you either love or hate, which is why I think that many reviews of mixes did not bring so much success when this movie was released. Because I'm sure most of them are just digging up the movie. I really liked this movie and I highly recommend it to people like "Love Actually" and "Three Weddings and a funeral". Not to mention the soundtrack, it is extremely ideal for capturing these key moments.
