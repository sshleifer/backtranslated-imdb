So many educational films are nothing but noisy grind, saved only by the fact that "MST3K" mocks them ("Why Study Industrial Arts?" Comes to mind). "Hemo the Magnificent" is actually quite well done. It's about blood, heart and circulatory system. I admit that I do not remember everything, but it does well, explaining everything, keeping it serious but fun. I think you can always count on June Foray (the most famous voice of Rocky the Squirrel, she plays a deer here). <br /> <br /> Because the same "Hemo the Magnificent" can be difficult, probably the best place to see is "Gremlins": the class observes it when you create a gremlin.
