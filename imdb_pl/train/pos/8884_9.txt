I really liked the 1960s. Without being of this generation (I am waiting for "The 80's"), it was interesting to see an exceptional four-hour capsule for this era. <br /> <br /> However, one of the main problems in the movie was imbalance the film was in the role of the family. According to the promotions I saw in the film on the NBC channel, the story concerned basically two families struggling with problems in America in the 1960s. Perhaps I missed something, but I think we have learned more about the white family than the African American family. <br /> <br /> I really think that the 1960s use music to better describe scenes than any dialogue that could get out of the actors' mouths (everyone is very talented.) This is very visible at the end of the first part (about two hours ) mini-series. <br /> <br /> Very good movie!
