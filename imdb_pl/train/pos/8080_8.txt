Well, after some time I use to read comments about these films that do not reflect my experiences at all. For me, Amitabh was a better villain here than some of his most famous films. He was a die-hard villain, an ungodly villain. For me, it was a breath of fresh air to see him in a role in which his villain is not cut somehow. <br /> <br /> The kid who played Aryana was probably in this cast. I think maybe the director could do better. But honestly, the best part of this movie was Shernaz Patel. She is an underestimated heroine, a real veteran who is overqualified for every role she offers. However, I must say that I really appreciate her contribution when she was playing the wife of Virendra Sahi. She can do little, but she does everything with complete conviction. I'm sure it flowed right over the heads of most of the audience. <br /> <br /> So if you have the habit of billing with the average Bollywood, you will not have much of this movie. But if you are constantly looking for something more, then it can give you what you missed.
