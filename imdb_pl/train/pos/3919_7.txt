While listening to Carmen from Bizet, Antonio's middle-aged choreographer (Antonio Gades) brings sexy Carmen (Laura del Sol) to the main role. Antonio falls in love with Carmen, who is an independent and seductive woman who is unable to accept possessive love. When Carmen has an affair with another dancer, Antonio is absorbed in jealousy, like D. José in the original opera, combining fiction with reality. <br /> <br /> "Carmen" is another great film of Carlos Saura's trilogy dedicated to flamenco dancing. A dramatic love story develops with the life of artists entwined with the characters they try, and many times it is not entirely clear whether what is happening is a reality (with dancers) or fiction (art). Paco de Lucia is another attraction of this original version of Bizet's famous opera, based on the novel by Prosper Mérimée. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Carmen"
