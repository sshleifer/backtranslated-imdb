Essentially, this is the story of two men who were part of the Portuguese Revolution. It was easy to understand the contest, but usually the directors start with a historical fact to talk about something else, or show the period before or after that, here everything happens during the few days when the revolution works. It can also be seen as a kind of document. The film focuses on these two people, showing them normal, not like ordinary heroes, because the revolution comes from people. Although it was written from a military army by title, you can understand that they were simply "captains" as the main characters. Nice colors and lights throughout the film, excellent work for the director as her first movie, does not fall into a banal way. Well-shown emotions and passion of people and crowd. Maia's character (main) is well done and there is also a good interpretation for Stefan Accorsi, who can show Maia's boundaries without being a hero.
