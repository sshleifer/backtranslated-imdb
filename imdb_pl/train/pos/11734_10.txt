It must be one of my favorite movies, in contrast to the weak "Elvira's Haunted Hills" ... anyway I love the way the movie is a goth / com story "Wizard of Oz" ... <br /> <br / > Elvira is a goth Dorothy, who after the death of the Good Witch (elviras Aunt Morgana) got stuck in an unknown city ... she inherited the ring "Ruby", which is extremely powerful and wanted by Bad Warlock (Her uncle). .. Befriends the four heroes, which unintentionally helps in the development of the movie all the time with the dog. There is a show with her uncle (a wicked witch from the West), where Elvira realizes that he has strength and ends with defeat. In the end, he is thrown out by city dwellers after winning their hearts and finally reaches the Las Vegas destination (Dorothy's home in Kansas). <br /> <br /> There are many references to the wizard with. film ... she and her uncle both quote poems corresponding to their parallel characters. Elvira: "You must be an Aunt Em, and you must be an uncle Remus ... There is no place like home, no place like home!" Uncle Vinny: "I will bring you my beautiful, and your dog too!" <Br / > <br /> There is a sign that Elvira passes when she first goes on a trip that mentions the state of Kansas. <Br /> <br /> But besides, the fact that one of the sequences that "broke up, um ... it's inspired by FlashDance" is a pure genius ... and if you do not laugh, her titty spins under the end of "very 80s" in Las Vegas, and you do not have camp bone in your body ... This movie is Cult / Camp Classic
