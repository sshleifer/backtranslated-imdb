Former film lovers will know why I would call it "Man in a gray flannel robe." Most of the Bible-based films are basically schlock - which can cause smiles and giggles, and how Peck tries to raise awareness about various psychological and social problems with a spear carrying neandertals around him. As a great affair, it falls flat like unleavened bread. But in this movie there is something captivating. Of all the great Hollywood biblical images, the ambivalent attitude of the average American to faith in the biblical God is most striking. Billy Sunday's thesis falls with the antithesis of H.L. Mencken in the whole script. Whoever achieves better results in the synthesis supported by the Heavenly Choir depends on your point of view. In addition, D & B can boast of Peck's good performances (especially on the scene closing penance) and Jayne Meadows as his first wife Michol, a lively moody atmosphere (a good idea to set most of the action at dawn or at night) captivating the Third Third's Psalm at the end.
