Let's start with things: Zombies do not exist, so the filmmaker can have them WALK, RUN, hell even FLY, if he wants. This makes this original zombie movie so good. Everything they did was so damn original. I hate it when filmmakers do everything, like Romero, or when the boys-fans expect everything, like Romero. Some idiots think that zombies should only growl like a typical Romero movie, once again the zombies do not exist, so the filmmaker can make the zombie whistle if he wants to. All the zombies in this movie look very good, but COUPLES are not decaying corpses, since I died! However, they are quite confused and full of chopped faces and blood. One of the coolest scenes was a half-eaten cat. It looked so damn real that my daughter was crying when she saw it. This movie has really good reviews in Fangoria and Rue Morgue, so I wanted to see it. I'm glad I listened. They are always right when it comes to the tastes of real horror fans. 10 out of 10! Go rent it!
