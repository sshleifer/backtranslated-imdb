I think that many viewers completely overlooked the fact that this is of course a parody of Western films. <br /> <br /> This is not a bad movie - it's a clever slap on the topic of westerns. I do not believe this movie is serious for a moment. <br /> <br /> What makes this film even more special is the fact that it focuses on 4 strong, beautiful women, two of whom are black, one Asian and a Mexican / Latin character. <br /> <br /> These are not your typical western women - they are hard - they can quickly draw and shoot straight. <br /> <br /> it's so hard that even the bartender shakes when he pours his whiskey. <br /> <br /> The story that moves this story is typical for westerns - in the style of "you shot my brother - so I" I will get you! Only in this western city was the woman's sister killed, who took revenge on the gang who did it. <br /> <br /> So he goes and sums up his old buddies from the bank robbing the days. <br /> <br /> One of them, Maria, is not really interested in avenging Rachel's sister, but she is motivated by the fact that gold and jewelry are hidden in the city they're headed for. <br /> <br /> There are several scenes that do not make sense, not because they interfere so much that they can be ignored, but I wonder why they were there. The film can then exacerbate a bit, but above all it is a well-made film that did not find an audience that would recognize what it is. <br /> <br /> My only disappointment was that the only lesbian in the movie is a villain - "heroines", one is obviously simple, the other sexual orientations are never revealed. <br /> <br /> 7 stars
