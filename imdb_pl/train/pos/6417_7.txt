Inspirational story of Carl Brashear (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), a black man who grew up in poverty in Kentucky, then joined the US Navy, aspiring to be the first black diver in the history of the Navy. We have been shown a series of struggles since childhood, when Brashear has to defeat to fulfill his dream (and then keep them alive). Not the least challenge was Master Diver Bill Sunday (Robert DeNiro), head coach in a diving school, to which Brashear sends a jacket, which is not particularly favorable to Brashear's goals, but which ultimately becomes an unlikely friend and fan. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie; at a fast pace and with lots of shares, although this is not a photo of "action" in the normal sense of the word. There is also a very human story and an interesting study of racism and the struggle to overcome it; there is also a sense of struggle that took place in the 1960s between older and junior naval officers ("old navy" vs. "new navy"). The performances are quite good - especially Goodings. " I thought DeNiro was maybe a bit ahead of his role on Sunday (though, who knows, Sunday could be such an extreme loose department), and the portrait of Sunday's wife Gwen (after Charlize Theron) also caused me to ask if these parts were "awakened" to provide entertainment value. <br /> <br /> A good movie. I never wondered if it was worth adjusting. <br /> <br /> 7/10
