First, I was completely surprised by the initial lyricism of the film, and then completely charmed myself with the developing story and absorbed the brilliant director. All characters were fully developed, no more than life, but like the people we live in, wherever we are in the world, in Sweden, in Turkey or in America, all completely credible people with weaknesses and nobility. Hollywood could learn a lot from this beautiful movie. It shows that there is no need to enter every detail of every action, to bring out the entire theme bright and bright, and that shows the director's splendor! I heard Kay Pollak thank you and a great cast for this wonderful feast !!
