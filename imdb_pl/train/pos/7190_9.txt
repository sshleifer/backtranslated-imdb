Best of the Zorro series and one of my favorite series, period. This is a series from the era just after the birth of Mexico. The new nation counts on gold produced by this one city to keep the republic as a solvent. However, the golden god, Don del Oro, arouses the Indians and steals gold for himself. His Zorro and his group of people to the rescue. Reed Hadley is a victorious Zorro who extends to a beautiful figure (most of them have been re-used by later Zorro series and other TV series). who is the real bad guy. There's a reason why I've seen it the most of the series I've seen, it's just a great adventure movie. The only thing I can compare is Mark Zorro of Tyrone Power or one of the other slayers of this period. It is great and highly recommended.
