I always knew that Anne DeSalvo was a great actress, now I know she is also a great writer and director. I've been a fan since I saw her for the first time in "Perfect", "My Favorite Year", "DC Cab" and "Stardust Memories". <br /> <br /> It's so rare you can see Lee Grant in these days with anything. She's missing her screen too long. It's also great to see Cloris Leachman in something other than sit-com. This is her best work since "Last Picture Show". If you grew up in an Italian American family, you'll love this movie. I did not expect much when I started watching this movie, so I was pleasantly surprised when I fell in love with this movie. If you have a chance, look at this.
