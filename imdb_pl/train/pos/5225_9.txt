I think this movie is a very funny movie and one of the best films of the "National Lampoon", it also has a very catchy title of parody, which basically sums up the whole movie ... Men in white !!!! History is a trick of many films, including the film by Will Smith, as you might guess, "Men In Black." I will not give up the end, but it has a very good ending is very funny (humor in the style of Leslie Nielsen) from the beginning to the end, especially a little at the beginning, when you are on the street collecting garbage bins (Garbage Cans). In this scene they also have a pretty cool Garbage Collecting Truck. Acting is not great, it's not very good, but it makes the movie fun, it's a comedy, relax !! I love the story, partly because it's so far-fetched, and partly because it's interesting to subtly (or maybe not subtly) rip off all other movies. I'm a big fan of non-serious parody movies, but I'm also a fan of real movies, and thanks to these movies it's hard to decide what's better, the movie is mostly picked up (mentioned earlier in this review) or it's a real movie, but also when it's actually you are making a parody of comedy movies, in fact it makes it even more difficult, but this movie carries it successfully. The two garbage collectors are so funny that it reminds me of the television show "Little Britain". This movie is a must for your collection and is one of the best, the most fun, the funniest, the best feature films so far National Lampoon movie!
