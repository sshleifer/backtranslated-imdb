For 35 years now, Groove Tube looks like real television today! Specialized niche networks (sport nude), television program about stoner drug dealers, called Dealers (ala Weeds, and even Cheech & Chong Up In Smoke from 1978), strange advertising of beer (Butz Beer, no less bizarre than Bud Bowls), dirty-minded kid's clown Koko (shades of Pee Wee Herman), even Chevy Chase doing slapstick humor (brutal vocal barber duet) a year before his debut on Saturday Night Live in 1975. And thanks to the infamous opening sequence that brought Groove Tube the initial X rating, I still do not hear Curtis Mayfield's "Move On Up" without thinking about the hitchhiking hippie dances ---- For similar sketch-style movies see TunnelVision, Kentucky Fried Movie, Amazon Women on the Mood, Monty Python's Beyond the Fringe, Dynamite Chicken and Firesign Theater's Everything We Know is Wrong.
