"Hey Babu Riba" is a film about a young woman, Marian (called "Esther" after the famous American movie star) and four young men, Glenn, Sacha, Kich and Pop, all aged 15-17 in 1953 Belgrade, Yugoslavia. Five friends are friends and crazy about jazz, blue jeans or anything that seems American. <br /> <br /> The very close relations of teenagers are overwhelming and are ultimately devoted to helping one of them a group that has fallen into unexpected difficulties. As a result of the changing communist policy, they go their separate ways and reunite in 1985 (The year before the film was made). <br /> <br /> The film appealed to me with some reservations. Inscriptions to one thing were difficult. Especially at the beginning there were many dialogues that did not contain any subtitles at all. Perhaps this was required by the pace of the conversation, but I could not always read the text and absorb the scene, which meant that I did not always understand which character is involved. I watched this movie (a movie from our public library) with a friend and neither of us really understood part of the story of conquering streptomycin for a sick relative. <br /> <br /> This Yugoslav film about adolescence effectively conveyed a sense of teenagers insensitivity, idealism and strong and loyal relationships with each other. It's the main flashforward, and it was intriguing, keeping me completely on the character of these characters in relation to the cast of 1953 and what actually happened. <br /> <br /> I would rate it 7 out of 10 and I would like to see other films by the director, Jovan Acin (1941-1991).
