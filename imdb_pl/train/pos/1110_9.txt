I think you would have to be from the US to get a lot of jokes. But if you like Princess Bride and Forest Gump, you would like this movie. You can not compare the quality of filming with those that are, of course, but the cameraman trip was of course deliberate. Killer Tomatoes is one hundred times better than Nepolean Dynamite. Only my opinion. I am sure that people from France would not appreciate the French caricature. So this movie is not intended for the global audience. And although I'm not a trained film critic, I know what I like. I could not stop laughing throughout the movie. My sides and jaw ached at the end of the movie.
