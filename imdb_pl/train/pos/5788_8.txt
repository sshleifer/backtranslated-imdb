This episode apparently grew out of the Cold War. There was the holocaust, but somehow Elizabeth Montgomery and Charles Bronson went unscathed. It becomes a battle for turf. It attracts him and vice versa, but survival instinct takes control. It is a calm, slow chess battle because they are trying to gain trust. They reach truce, but mistrust takes control and starts again. Of course, the role of a male woman from the sixties is at stake, and modern viewers may think that her need to follow him is a bit offensive. But it's still addictive and interesting. Because he does not speak, we do not know the mind very well, but in the end we can guess.
