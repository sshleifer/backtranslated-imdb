I must admit that I am a big fan of South Park and I expected that basketball will be fun, but nowhere is it as good as it turned out! I think it happens when you mix David Zucker, Matt Stone and Trey Parker together. This film has such a high replay value and is not serious about it at any moment. Humor in a slap stick style blended with Stone and Parker works fine. The kind of humor in basketball was not popular at the time of its release and if it were released today, it would be a hit. Do not bother trying to be critical, just leave your brain at the door and wait for endless laughter. Recommended for everyone with a good sense of humor.
