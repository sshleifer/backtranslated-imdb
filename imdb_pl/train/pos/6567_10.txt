Most people (36) gave the film 10, and those who are not too critical or can expect something else. This is one of my favorite movies from the 80s that grows on you and has it all. I just got it on DVD, and 20 years later it still does not disappoint, having lots of action, drama, romance, and even comedy. Add to this great car chases, automatic gunfights and lots of explosions, and you will have a great time enjoying the advantage! You'll even humming or whistling the main theme track for a few days after watching it. <br /> <br /> You can watch this movie with your wife / gf, and you'll both be happy. The assumption is the hero of a paperback book, like Doc. Wild, really existing and helping people to fight evil so that he could write this story is almost real. Actor Jake Speed ​​is also a director, producer and author of many films. In this movie, Jake Speed ​​(character) is the type of adventurer from Indiana Jones, he usually uses his head to get out of sticky situations, but sometimes he resorts to brute force of fire (yay !, and also stupid happiness!). Keep an eye on his one technologically advanced "James Bond" equipment, the best SUV off-road SUV. <br /> <br /> The heroine is a very young girl from early vampire Jim Carey's movie "Once Bitten" and here she is a little older and is still a knockout, even compared to her teenage blonde younger sister. <br /> <br /> The bad guys are "real" men and they are the worst miserable scum Love for hatred. The ending is just perfect and can stand alone or invite a sequel, unfortunately it never happened - but you can imagine what will happen next! <br /> <br /> You must see this movie only because it will entertain and entertain you and it is worth the ticket price.
