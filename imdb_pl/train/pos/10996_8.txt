Who can watch the movie, look at Lucy Liu and be not thrilled. This woman is an amazingly beautiful and talented actress. It's a difficult combination to find now for a few days. And Jeremy Northam. I heard his name many times, but I never noticed him. My advice to Hollywood is "use it more". <br /> <br /> about the movie now: I watched it in one of my graveyard changes. I do not recommend it to anyone. It's a bit complicated and mysterious. I still can not believe I have not seen the end. I will not say what will break the film with a hole. even though I say it is bad enough. <br /> <br /> now I suppose that I will give my vote about this film. I love dark mystical history, the actors have done a good job and I love the work of directors (natali) in the past. There is not a large audience for this type of thing, it's also quite risky. You know what, I just give this job 8, because everyone should see it. On the other hand, the deduction of 1 point means that there is always room for improvement.
