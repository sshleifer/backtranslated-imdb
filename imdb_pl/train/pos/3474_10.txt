This film is worth seeing separately for the outstanding portrait of John Lennon Jared Harris. It does not matter that Harris does not exactly resemble Lennon; his manners, attitudes, posture, accent and attitude are pure Lennon. The best scene: Lennon in a local caf√© verbally sparring with a stuttering fan, or Paul McCartney's "Silly Love Songs" and Wings deserve 1 place in America.
