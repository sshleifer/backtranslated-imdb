I love these movies "Baby diapers"! You can not make such a movie today and it is rich in the history of the film. This is stupid and the movie was created to make you laugh, what you do. How did they ever make these children act? I will never know. I think they are valuable, and the children make me laugh, as did the others who created the movie, showing the naivete that existed in the early 1930s. It must be remembered that when the film industry was very young, the stock market collapsed, global depression began and these films were created to give the person a break from the real world. The fact that you can watch movies for five cents is beyond my understanding, but then also a dinner for 25 cents. It was a different time with a completely different set of thoughts.
