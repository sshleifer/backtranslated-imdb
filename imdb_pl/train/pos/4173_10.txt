Type of road movie in old-fashioned trains in the post-war province of Slovenia. At first you see someone in black linen fabric trousers, and when the same young man in black pants walks out of the house with two suitcases, you see that some trousers are missing on the mourning flag (apparently his father died). On the train he meets a young lady and almost no words, but many small gestures begin with a great love story. This is a surreal, very poetic and somewhat bizarre movie with many strange characters and strange incidents. Beautiful photos with love for beautiful details.
