Contrary to what the title might suggest, "Pigs Is Pigs" does not play Porky Pig. It is rather a young pig with appetite more insatiable than the character of John Belushi in the "Animal House". His mother repeatedly scolds him, but it does not do anything good. So much so that he goes to another house, in which a mad scientist forces him to feed him more than any ordinary mortal (but at the end is a surprise). <br /> <br /> I would say that this cartoon seems like a placeholder between really great cartoons (Daffy Duck debuted three months after it came out). But do not make a mistake, they do some nice things here. The whole feeding sequence looks more appropriate today, taking into account the epidemic of obesity, which is ahead of our country. <br /> <br /> In any case, this is not the best cartoon, but worth seeing.
