TIGERLAND / (2000) *** 1/2 (out of four) <br /> <br /> Author: Blake French: <br /> <br /> Over the years viewers have seen and understood war films with every possible view point, and producers and writers always come up with new and innovative methods of presenting different soldiers on the battlefield. Joel Schumacher ("8MM", "A Time to Kill"), easily one of the most risky working directors today, found a resemblance to "The Thin Red Line" in the way in which his new drama "Tigerland" enters the individual soldier's boots . This film, written by Ross Klavan and Michael McGuther, has more courage and irony than "The thin red line" and even "Private Ryan". Although the dramatic impact of the film is somewhat weakened due to the perversity of the current material, we are certainly enlightened by the new perspective of young men training for war. <br /> <br /> I would like to know the experiences of Joel Schumacher with the army. Are men really so shameless and brutal? I'm sure some of them are, but the film sees its uncompromising world through the eyes of a young man named Roland Bozz (Colin Farrell) who rebels against the ideas of war. His personality immediately counteracts several other characters who become his best friend, Paxton (Matthew Davis), and another, Wilson (Russell Richardson), whose fiery temperament often annoys Bozz's tension of going to war. The war presented in this production is not on the battlefield, but on the training ground in the Louisiana training camp, between the concepts and fears of the soldiers during the training. This film concerns in particular preparations for war, nothing more. It ends when the soldiers finally go to war, which is a disappointment, because watching the characters in action would serve as a payment of the supurb. <br /> <br /> Filmed on site for about 28 days using 16mm thick paper and a small budget, Joel Schumacher accurately shows a rough, perverse, cruel and unmerciful atmosphere using hand-held images, unique lighting techniques and direct sound . Grainy and blown images of Schumacher make the film a documentary. This unusual style of filming contributes only to the hard realism of the film, quite graphic in the use of a thick tongue, maybe a little too disturbing. Waves of four-letter words crash into the audience, some shocked by what they hear. Even extreme vulgarisms do not maintain dialogue as dominant, painful, real and emotional. <br /> <br /> If something, "Tiger" gives us a small assessment of how much our soldiers pass through our country in the early stages of the fight. Such courage must take care of the army during the war, knowing about the hardships and threats that are being undertaken. Such inspirational ideas are possible thanks to the poignant performances of young aspiring actors who present different participants. This film is not intended for all audiences, but the one that young men should look at before engaging in the military ... and an adult audience should appreciate the courage needed for this. <br /> <br />
