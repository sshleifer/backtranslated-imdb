Directed by Samuel Fuller, who also wrote the script, Pickup on South Street is a tough, brutal, well-made film about a pickpocket (Richard Widmark), who accidentally acquires secret microfilms and becomes the target of spy agents. Jean Peters is also involved as a tough guy who is being used as a courier by her evil former lover Richard Kiley. It is a noir movie at its best and although the performances are very good, the actress of the great character Thelma Ritter, who steals the film. Because Moe is a weary street trader selling ties to the neck (and who also sells information), she's great in the role that brought her another Oscar nomination. It's amazing that Miss Ritter has been nominated six times for an Oscar and has never won. That should be the role that she advised!
