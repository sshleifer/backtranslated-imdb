My Take: A funny take on THE LION KING, a continuation. Surprisingly fun. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, "Lion King 1 1/2" is in fact another funny movie that is worth theatrical processing. I do not see the reason why Disney released it directly on video and theatrically released bad movies, such as "Chicken Little" and "Return to Neverland". These films are more visible in video stores (in the area of ​​"new publishing houses") than seeing their theatrical posters outside theaters. <br /> <br /> This movie is just a parody of the first movie (although the events in the "Simba Duma" have not yet taken place), in the case of Timon (expressed by Nathan Lane) and Pumbai's point of view (in the voice of Ernie Sabelli). We see them making fun of the events from the first movie. Original voices from the first movie, such as Matthew Broderick, Woopie Goldberg, Cheeche Martin and Robert Guillaume, return to the soundtracks of the first movie, while Julie Kavner and Jerry Stiller give a comic relief as Timon's mum and grouchy uncle. /> <br /> So it does not sound funny. Maybe not now, but go alone. The fact that this story is not so serious makes it more enjoyable. It's a bit like MST3000 with Timon and Puma. <br /> <br /> Video rating: *** 1/2 out of 5.
