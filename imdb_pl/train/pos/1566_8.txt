A series of novels by Leslie Charteris about the adventures of the slightly shaded Simon Templar ("The Saint") appeared on the screen in the late thirties with the upcoming George Sanders as the Templar. It was a careful choice - Sanders usually played villains with occasional "nice roles" (ffoliott in FOREIGN CORRESPONDENCE, the title character of THE STRANGE CASE UNCLE HARRY, the bound "best friend" of Robert Montgomery in RAGE IN HEAVEN). Here his readiness to bend the rules and breaking the law briefly matches his "heavy personality", while his good looks and polite behavior have made Templar a shady hero, such as Chester Boston's "Blackie" and (in a sense) Peter Lorre "Mr. Moto ". <br /> <br /> Movies are not the best series of series about film mysteries - but they are suitable for use. Just like in the series of Rathbone Holmes or the Olanda Khan series, the series often featured actors repeating roles or playing new (the anti-heroine in the film was played by Wendy Barrie, who appeared in the second film in the series). This and some familiar movie sets make the series a comfortable experience for viewers who hear the buzz of this dialogue (always showing Sanders' willingness to stay one step ahead of the bad people), without noticing the obvious flaws of the story. All these secrets have defects due to the fact that even the best genre writers can not avoid repeating old ideas over and over again. <br /> <br /> Here, when it happened, one of the actors confessed to his feelings for Barrie, which she had long been aware of. Shortly thereafter, he tries to protect her from the police. But because the film dealt with the identity of the criminal brain, it became obvious that the person had become so noble that he deserves to be called a mysterious master (ie, the scenario hid him as the least likely suspect). <br /> <br /> Barrie is after proof that her father (who died in prison) was framed by real criminals in a band of robbers. Several people help her - mugs such as William Gargan - and receive advice from the organizer about planning intrusive burglaries that can not be pinned. The D.A. who has been sentenced to father (Jerome Cowan) is determined to take Barrie and her gang. The only detective who seems to have a chance to solve the case is Jonathan Hale, who follows Sanders, but is reluctant to work with him. <br /> <br /> The cast has some nice moments in the script - Hale (currently on a special diet) wants to eat a hearty lobster dinner prepared for Sanders by Willie Best. As a result, he gets a serious stomach upset, thanks to which Sanders and Barrie can escape from Sanders' apartment. It's best to remind him (when he feels better) to go to the place where Sanders told him to go at a particular time. <br /> <br /> There is also the interesting role of Gilbert Emery. He usually plays decent people (such as a painful husband in BETWEEN TWO WORLDS), plays a socially prominent elephant here - whose fall resembles the hero from the movie in Bogart. <br /> <br /> In general, a well-made film for the second half of cinema counting in 1939. It will entertain you even if it does not remain in your memory.
