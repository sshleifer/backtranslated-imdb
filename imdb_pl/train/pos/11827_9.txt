If Dick Tracy was black and white, the Pope would not be religious. Giving a new sense of color concept in the film, we offer a unique experience in the world of comics and this is one of the few films that managed to do it, thanks to a serious script, good direction and great performances (Al Pacino is amazing) and most importantly a powerful mix of cinematography, directing art and costume design. Using only basic colors, the experience is completely different than anything we've seen before. There is also a quite successful homage for all gangster-film genres, virtually extinct from modern cinema. In general, I see this film as a new attempt and a bit of originality in the cinema, which is increasingly based on old and already known formulas. 7 out of 10.
