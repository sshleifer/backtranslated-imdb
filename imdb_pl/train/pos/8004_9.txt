Maslin Beach is a real nudist / naturist beach south of Adelaide, on the Fleurieu peninsula in South Australia. It is also the name of an Australian film that used the beach as a place. <br /> <br /> Maslin Beach is called a romantic comedy. It can be a bit confusing, because it is not a "funny" movie, nor is it romantic in the traditional sense, but has a light moment. Like life itself, there are also moments of sadness. It is also entirely filmed on the nudist beach mentioned above, and the nudity runs through the entire length of the film. The viewer quickly learns to accept it as normal and focuses on the story, not on the abundance of bodies. <br /> <br /> Simon and Marcie (Michael Allen and Eliza Lovell) come by car to the beach car park. They take their things to the beach, and when they go, Simon's voice speaks of his confusion with what true love is. The rest of the movie is exploration of this, bound by one full day on the beach. The basic story tells about what happens to Simon's love life, but there are also many other people distinguished in several separate vignettes. <br /> <br /> When they reach the beach, both Simon and Marcie seem bored with each other. Marcie sees them as a romantic couple "Romeo and Juliet". Simon is bored with all this. Then we get acquainted with Gail (Bonnie-Jaye Lawrence), Paula (Zara Collins) and Jenny (Jennifer Ross). They walk along the beach, discussing Gail's chances of finding the "perfect" man, aided by the "powers" of the necklace that brought grandma's happiness. However, there are many more interesting people on the beach, not all "attractive" and young (part of the realism of this film). <br /> <br /> The patrons of the beach are flatulent, short-sold seller of ice cream with a van. This is Ben (Gary Waddell), Simon's friend, as well as his unofficial adviser. I think this character is the main element of the comic. It is hard to say, because there is nothing about Ben, who would make you laugh, unless you were intoxicated, masculine and very young! Maslin Beach, however, has an important function of redemption, namely that it does not spend too long on any subject. Because the quality of the action is variable, the script is suspicious and everything at Maslin Beach is cheap, lack of continuity is a positive boon. There's something about this movie that appeals to me. It is difficult to determine what it is, but it may have something to do with its sincerity, or even "Aussie attitude" to corporal matters. <br /> <br /> The work of a camera at Maslin Beach deserves attention. Sometimes it is very good, with some wonderful static shots and "pans" of the beach, cliffs and sunset. Since nudity is the main factor in this film, framing is an important aspect of the camera's work. There is no sense of selflessness in framing, which means that the framing takes place so that the camera does not extend to the "private" parts of the body. This helps to alleviate the sense of discomfort of the viewer in the space of the personal subject and makes the film more tasteful. This is not an easy task, considering the location for filming. <br /> <br /> Maslin Beach is not a "skin film" for men after puberty, testosterone, nor a "Mills and Boon" romance for underestimated women. Maslin Beach does not seem to fit any species. Actors are not "attractive" in the sense of Baywatch and are "ordinary" people who can be seen on the beach anywhere. There is no message to convey and would not even act as a tourist advertisement, maybe outside of naturists. In addition to the Australian accent, filming could be in any sunny country. What makes this Australian movie clearly is that it is pointless (cinematography?), And only Australian cinema and other medium-sized national cinemas can consider this option. At the same time, these medium-sized cinemas have space for experiments in the search for identity, and the "flop" will not hurt their reputation too much. It is always possible, considering that Maslin Beach is now a collector's item, the film can become popular around the world, but it is very unlikely. <br /> <br /> During this criticism, sometimes I sound very negative about Maslin Beach. This is not a real position, because I consider the film very easy to watch. I liked it as a reflection of close reality and real people (and problems). The problems faced by the film are problems of everyday life and a bit of a low spectacle. It does not hurt my opinion and I would like more films to be taken care of by such everyday activities. There is a connection with European cinemas, in particular with the French film. They rarely deal with major catastrophes or catastrophes, but with everyday ones. Hollywood opposes this and rides on the back of a hyper-action / drama / wave of anger. Tempo is also much faster in Hollywood, but it is not a reality. Maslin Beach is not exactly "Jacques Tati", but it is on the right track, even if it ignores the issues of multiculturalism, equality, gender orientation, etc. That are so important in the current cinema. I'm sure you either love it or you hate this movie, with a small place for the middle. <br /> <br />
