A very good drama, although it seems that it has several empty areas, which allows the viewers to complete the action for themselves. I can imagine life in this way for someone who can neither read nor write. This movie just hit the real world: a wife who suddenly becomes the only supporter, living relatives and their quarrels, a restless child who gets knocked out, and then usually leaves school, a Jackass husband-nest, and buys a beer with him. 2 thumbs up.
