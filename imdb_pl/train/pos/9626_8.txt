Warning! Spoilers forward! <br /> <br /> SPOILERY <br /> <br /> I saw a movie in German, so it may happen that I missed some tips. <br /> <br /> Despite a certain weakness in the story, it is a movie that has reached me. Especially I liked the acting of Lexi Doig. Sometimes I have the impression that she * is * Camille. But I can not help wondering what happened at the end with Bob, Cassie and the child. I believe that after she was initially focused on Bob, she finally loved him and regretted what happened to his brother and forced him to lie. Otherwise, it's a bit strange that he will carry his child and love them. It is up to the viewer to decide - and I do not like such endings. Dean Cain was as good as ever, Eric Roberts ... Well, I've seen him better, but also worse. <br /> <br /> I believe that the film is a more analysis of interpersonal relationships and reaction in unexpected situations than a detective story. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I liked it a lot.
