Artistically speaking, it is a beautiful movie - photos, music and costumes are wonderful. In fact, this movie is nicer than the one directed by Akira Kurasawa. In this case, he wrote the film only as it was created a few years after his death. <br /> <br /> So, when it comes to writing, the dialogue was well written, and the story was sometimes interesting. However, the story was also quite depressing, but not engaging in any way - after all, it is the story of a group of women who work in a brothel. Interestingly, although prostitution is seen in Japan as a more acceptable business, women miss the better life for a better life. This reminds me of the movie Streets Of Shame, although the heroes of Streets Of Shame are much less sympathetic and more one-dimensional. <br /> <br /> So, in general, he gets 7 - mainly because of everything ALE writing. It is a pity that the weakest link in this film is the history of the great Kurasawa.
