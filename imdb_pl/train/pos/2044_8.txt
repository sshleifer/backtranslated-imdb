This is a good little shock; not perfect by any part of the imagination, but tense, competent and disturbing. An excellent example of a simple idea has evolved into an attractive 90-minute script. <br /> <br /> The configuration does not require any bells and whistles, a long exposure or a weak story; Kate (Franka Pontente), a young German business woman living in London, is sailing away, waiting for the last subway train. He wakes up to find an abandoned place, but quickly realizes that he is not alone. Someone or something is with her, and her intentions are completely malicious. <br /> <br /> In fact, he meets several other characters in his quest for survival, including a lusty work colleague, a homeless couple and a wasteland cage, all of whom add tempo and content to the plot. There is a bit of awkward gear change somewhere in the middle of the movie, when the thriller of tension changes to a top fest, but nothing so awkward that it slows down the hectic pace. For those of you who have a weak temper, it can be a shocking ride; for those of you who like a bit of well-made bodily chaos, it should push all the appropriate buttons. <br /> <br /> The climax of the film is perhaps less successful than the main body of the film, but it is interrupted with a nice moment of unexpected social commentary that ensures a satisfying ending. <br /> <br /> Some may feel a bit deceived by a clear explanation of the exact nature and history of the threat encountered by Kate and her confederates, but for me it was not. A horror writer should not feel compelled to dot each and to cross each t in the same way a political writer would be expected. There are enough clues here to give you a very clear picture of what caused this evil, making a detailed and conclusive solution unnecessary. Keeping a certain sense of mystery should be welcomed and reminds us that in this movie, driving will always be more important than the exact goal. <br /> <br /> I realized that the budget for this film was at least minimal, in which case our applause for this British horror should be all the louder, because at no time do you have the impression that the horns are cut or effects can not be implemented. <br /> <br /> If it sounds like your movie, it probably is. Buy a ticket and get on board.
