<br /> <br /> I question the comments of the second reviewer for the simple reason that it is a MYSTERY FILM, not a supernatural one! This is not the only movie that has a seemingly "supernatural" explanation ("vampires"), but it turns out to be very down-to-earth. <br /> <br /> Other films that come to mind are Edgar Wallace "Before Dawn" and (more famous) "Mark of the Vampire". <br /> <br /> The film does GREAT work in creating a "terrible atmosphere", similar to DRACULY, when Renfield meets the count on the stairs of his castle or in MARK OF THE VAMPIRE, when two people look through the windows of the castle ruins and see "corpses" "Playing on the organs while Luna descends wings! VERY surreal! <br /> <br /> If someone likes these (often quiet) mood accents, THIS film is MUST! <br/> <br /> Norm Vogel
