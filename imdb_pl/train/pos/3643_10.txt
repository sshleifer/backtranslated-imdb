The end of the era was released here in the United States in the spring of 2002. With The Rookie, a Disney live action movie that seemed to be "the best for the last !!!! It was here in Texas! Actually, history began in West Texas, as evidenced by the area code found on that character. It was about a high school coach who was so convinced by his high-class baseball team that he decided to go to professionalism! !! It was a very good sports movie, the trilogy "The Mighty Ducks". He also took film-goers from Texas, somewhere between Panhandle and El Paso, up to Metroplex (where I live). I can tell because I recognize this ballpark (it was "The Ballpark in Arlington", now it's "Ameriquest Field")! It was nice to see Disney's "Golden Age" here in my area !!!!! <br /> <br /> RIP <br /> <br /> The Golden Age of Disney <br /> <br /> The 20s. Spring 2002 <br /> <br /> "It all started with the mouse ... and it ended with baseball. " (szlochy) <br /> <br /> 10/10
