This film is a moving story about the adventures of 15-year-old Darius Weems. Darius has Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, a still incurable disease that took his brother's life at the age of nineteen and is the largest child killer in the United States. He and a few close friends travel around the country to Los Angeles to bring their wheelchair to MTV, Pimp My Ride, one of his favorite shows. The journey begins in Georgia, where Darius grew up and never left. The gang is heading west to go on a trip that all participants will never forget. Darius for the first time rides a boat, rides in a balloon, floats in the ocean and visits monuments that he always wanted to see, like the Grand Canyon and New Orleans. The filmmakers clearly have an emotional connection with the material here. They do not earn from the sale of $ 20 DVD. $ 17 goes on disease research, and $ 3 on subsequent copies. The film won over 25 awards at festivals and I agree with the quote given in the film Variety, "Sure, to arouse hearts".
