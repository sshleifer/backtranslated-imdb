In New York, the family dentist Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle) accidentally meets his ex-roommate and friend Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler) on the street. Charlie became a lonely and mad man after losing his wife and three daughters in tragic September 11, while Alan has problems discussing his innermost feelings with his wife. Alan denies his friendship with Charlie and become close. Alan tries to fix Charlie's life by sending him to psychologist Angela Oakhurst (Liv Tyler), but Charlie has an aggressive reaction to the treatment and is sent to court. <br /> <br /> "Reign Over Me" is a good drama about loss, friendship, family and loneliness. September 11 is irrelevant to the plot; it could be a car accident, fire or other tragedy, as well as sexual harassment of Donna Remar, played by the magnificent Saffron Burrows, Alan. But the family drama works, supported by the wonderful performances of Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle. Liv Tyler is quite unrecognizable, I do not know if she uses excessive make-up to look older, but her face is strange. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Reine Sobre Mim" ("Reign Over Me")
