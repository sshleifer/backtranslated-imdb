As I understand it, after the Chinese took over Hong Kong, the infamous Cat. Three Hong Kong films have disappeared. At least so far and what an amazing movie this is. I knew it was a brutal crime drama, but the first Cat. 3 I bought what was done recently, I was not sure what to expect. <br /> <br /> A Cambodian man goes to Hong Kong to knock out the wife of a judge who is also a lawyer. It turns out that the judge made arrangements with the murderer, because she divorced the judge and threatened to take all her money. All this is known in the first ten minutes, so nothing is given out. After being hit, the police quickly locate the attacker, but by trying to arrest him, several policemen and civilians are killed. He escapes the police, and now the race is about to catch a man before he escapes to Cambodia. It's a movie that never stops and almost does not give the viewer a chance to catch a breath. Yes, it is very violent and intense, many cops are killed because the striker turns out to be very difficult to track down and takes off when they locate him. Along the way, the murderer, trying to hide in a dump, finds a woman raped and abused by a man. He helps her and saves her from the guy, and she persuades the murderer to take her with him to escape. I loved this movie, it's like a roller coaster that moves and moves at high speed, because one event leads to another, and the police sometimes are just as bad or worse as a blow. Acting is exceptionally good, and filming and taking photos in a place is breathtaking. In this film there is no resignation, even with a very amazing ending. The ending is unbelievable, as well as the proper end to all actions and violence. Yes, violence is sometimes brutal, but it is not a senseless crime drama that will knock your socks off. "Dog Eat Dog" definitely needs a more widespread edition, including the R1 version. Great movie, highly recommended.
