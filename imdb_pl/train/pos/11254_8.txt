It's been a long time since I saw this mini-series and I'm glad that her remembered services have stood the test of time. <br /> <br /> Most elements of "A Perfect Spy", the adaptation of LeCarré's best novel, in my opinion, is of the highest class. Outstanding aspects are the musical score and masterful script, written by Arthur Hopcraft, who I think was the screenwriter of "Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy" with Alec Guinness a few years earlier. <br /> <br /> Actors are mostly very good, some outstanding, like Jack Brotherhood by Alan Howard and Ricky Pym Ray McAnally. Peter Egan is fascinating because his face changes with every angle of the camera. The passage of time and the impact on the physical appearance of the character is very credible. So much so that I was wondering exactly how old Peter Egan was during the filming. The only shock comes after the figure of Magnus Pym is moved from the very capable hands of the young actor Benedict Taylor to the hands of the noticeably too old Peter Egan, freshly after leaving Oxford. But it is a small and irrelevant seam in its entirety. <br /> <br /> Egan has problems with conviction only when the text becomes melodramatic and must be "upset" emotionally, i.e. Cry. None of the actors have an easy time with these moments, in addition to the great Frances Tomelty, who plays Peggy Wentworth for everything that's worth her and steals the episode with ease. <br /> <br /> Jane Booker is annoying like Mary Pym. He has some of the characters under his skin, but often shows amateur irritability, which reduces her as a hard diplomatic housewife, which is Mary Pym. Rüdiger Weigang is wonderful as Axel, funny, ironic and brilliant. I also liked Sarah Badel's camp as a baroness. <br /> <br /> The British view of the Americans is vividly portrayed in some dry funny scenes. When the Yankees came abroad to reconcile with Bo Brammell (head of MI6), the American contingent is portrayed as a desert buffoon that seems to remember many long words from the Dictionary and amply spiced them with American jargon and psychic babble, to the amazement of English contempt. <br /> <br /> Humor and sadness are subtly confused. LeCarré has the talent for mixing various elements in his stories, and Hopcraft perfectly captures the melancholy and at the same time longing atmosphere of the original. <br /> <br /> This is not an ideal production (what is it?), yet the best of LeCarré's adaptations has so far reached the film or television. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend to all lovers of spy thrillers, especially fans of LeCarré. DVDs available from Acorn.
