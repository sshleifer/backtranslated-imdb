Robert Siodmak does a fantastic job with this B noir with Elana Raines, Franchot Tone and Alan Curtis. And he does, I can add, without much help from his male actors, Curtis and Tone. It's all Raines, a pretty, leggy actress who, for one reason or another, has never achieved the status of some of its "noir" counterparts. <br /> <br /> Siodmak uses sex, light, shadow and music. really remarkable because it deals with this genre. Shadows, lighting effects and camera angles are effective. The highlight of the film, however, is the nightclub with a very sexual drum riff Elish Cook, excited by Raines. This is the scene that introduces the "Phantom Lady" to the new territory. <br /> <br /> Siodmak's involvement in the material corresponds only to Raines, who gives an honest performance as a woman in love trying to save his man. Franchot Tone called that. Alan Curtis did not seem upset that he could die and did not seem happy that he was alive. And never, except for a short while in prison, he was not in love with Rainesie. <br /> <br /> It is funny in many of these films that as the Second World War progressed the interest in psychiatry deepened. But often terms were used incorrectly in movies such as "Possessed", "Spellbound" and "The Greatest Show on Earth". The sound is called Thomas Gomez's paranoia - Tone probably has some paranoia associated with his disorder, but he seems to be closer to the psychopath. In fact, as evidenced by his headaches, he could have had a brain tumor pushing into the brain. <br /> <br /> The ghostly lady does not have the biggest plot, but it's worth watching.
