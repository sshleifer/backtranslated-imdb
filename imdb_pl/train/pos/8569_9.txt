It's just as good as the original 101, if not better. Of course, Cruella steals the show with her outrageous behavior and costumes, and the movie was probably made because the audience wanted to see more of Cruella. This time we see it much more. I also like Ioan Gruffudda as Kevin, a rather clumsy male leader. Using Paris as the climax of the film was a clever idea. The movie is worth watching regardless of age, provided you like animals.
