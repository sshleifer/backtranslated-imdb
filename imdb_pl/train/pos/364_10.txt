The adaptation of Steven Speilberg's novel Alice Walkers is not without controversy. When the first dismissed members of the black community criticized her treatment of black men, while others questioned why the white man directed this film about black women. <br /> <br /> Here is the story of a young black woman named Celie, growing up in rural America after the turn of the century. He has two children by his abusive father, who are pulled out of his arms after birth. Her only consolation in her miserable life comes from her sister. <br /> <br /> Celie (played in later years by the newcomer Whoopie Goldberg) married her abusive husband (Danny Glover). The husband is humiliated by his sister, so he is quickly removed from the life of Celie. <br /> <br /> This story is often painful because Celie hopes to meet her sister and children one day. Throughout his life, he meets different characters, including Sophia, the wife's hard-wives wife of his half-son, and Shug, a loud and juicy saloon singer who teaches her about love. <br /> <br /> Speilberg's direction is everywhere in this photo that offers brilliant pictures and some star performances. I dare to watch this movie and not be moved! The film "Violet Color" manages to capture the essence of a complicated story. Although he has a tendency to minimize lesbian aspects, as well as African stories that were so vivid in the book, the film remains faithful to its subjects, allowing Alice Walker's voice to shine. <br /> <br /> I could not start to respond to the controversy surrounding this movie. It is enough, however, to say that this is one of the few films I can watch again and again, and which has left an indelible mark on me. <br /> <br />
