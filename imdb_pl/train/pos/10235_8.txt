The extraordinary film of Ringo Lam and the film is strangely underestimated. The combination of kung-fu fantasy with a more realistic representation of swords and spears driven by the body is surprising, especially during the first ten minutes. The horseman is divided into two parts, and his waist and legs are still riding on horseback. Several horses are chopped. This is very unexpected. <br /> <br /> The story is very simple, Fong and his Shaolin brothers have been captured by a mad maniac general and imprisoned in the Red Lotus temple, which seems to be more a torture chamber than a temple. The general has a resemblance to Kurtz in Apocalypse Now, when he releases distorted philosophy and makes terrifying images with human blood. <br /> <br /> The production is very impressive and the surroundings are gloomy. Blood is everywhere. The action is very well made and mostly coherent, unlike many HK action scenes from those times. Sometimes the movie becomes absurd or the effects are poor, but it is never bad enough to destroy the movie. <br /> <br /> Find this one of the best kung fu HK movies from the early nineties. Remember that it is not child-friendly.
