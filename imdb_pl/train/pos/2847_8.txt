As you know, anthological films do not do well with the American audience (I think they prefer one standard storyline). New York, I Love You, is the second phase of a series of anthropological films devoted to cities and people who live and love in them. The first was "Paris, J'Taime", which I liked very much. The film consisted of several segments, each of which was written and / or directed by another director (most of which was French, but it is a very entertaining piece directed by Joel and Ethan Coen). Like "Paris", this is also an anthology directed by several different directors (Fatih Akin, Mira Nair, Natalie Portman, Shakher Kapur, etc.), as well as "Paris'deals with New Yorkers" and why they love the City in which they live. He has a top cast, including Natalie Portman, Shia LaBeouf, Christina Ricci, Orlando Bloom, Ethan Hawka, and such experienced veterans as James Caan, Cloris Leachman, Eli Wallach and Julie Christie. Some stories are really flying and others are not (although I suppose it will depend on individual tastes --- I will not ruin this to anyone else, revealing which ones worked for me and which did not work for me). The word is that the next entry in the series will be Shanghai, China (whether Rome, Italy, Berlin, Germany or Athens, Greece are not an option?). He speaks mainly in English, but has fragments of Yiddish and Russian with English subtitles. Rated as "R'by MPAA" for strong language and sexual content
