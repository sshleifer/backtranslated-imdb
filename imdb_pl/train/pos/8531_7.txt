Although the storyline was sometimes a bit frustrated, and VERY hurried at the end, as if the director ran out of time and had to hurry up and finish the story, overall it was pretty good for Made-For-Backwoods - Cable TV genre. <br /> <br /> However, the actress who played the childminder, Mariana Klaveno, was very good! I hope to see her more in the land of movies. The music was also well done, so that every possible chill dah-DUH-dah-DUH (think "JAWS") influenced the creation of tension based on music. <br /> <br /> I do not think I would like to see "While the Children Sleep" again, but if I do, I would focus on the performance of the talented Klaveno.
