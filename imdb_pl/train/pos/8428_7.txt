If it was done earlier in the Zatoichi series, it could be one of the best. It's good enough, like most of them, but the plot and characters seem too complicated for the series at this point. The situation is extremely intriguing: farmers in the province have two masters, a benevolent boss (once) and a samurai philosopher who begins the type of Grange; they both struggle with the usual local gangsters who want the crops to fail because they increase their gambling income and the chances of getting land; their main or powerful ally is apparently puritan, who is death when drinking and gambling, but secretly indulges in his perverse appetites. (He also reminds Dracula, because the villains in later Zatoichi movies are more and more doing.) These characters have enough meaning, so they deserved to be against Zatoichi as he was originally drawn, but he has lost many of his nuances so far, and changes in some characters, like the good boss and angry sister of Zatoichi's dead man, they need more time than the movie has to give, so the story seems uncertain, as if some of the scenes were missing. In addition, the film shows the advantages of most other series: good acting, sometimes lyrical, creating a lively, credible and exceptionally recognizable landscape (which is not obvious in an occasional episode in which the director just misses it), and technical quality which of nature is hiding: imagination diversified the use of limited sets, so their limitations do not seem to exist. Of course there is also a main actor whose presence, like his performance, makes everything work. It must be one of the best series in the history of the film.
