This film mesmerizes with its beauty and creativity. A deep vision of the artist, his art that intuitively flows from his natural source, gives us inspirational Hosanna, combining his works with trees, white water hitting the rocks, fields and rain ... Andy Goldsworthy makes the viewer feel the joy of life that we are all made of the clay of this glorious earth. It does not spare us occasional frustration, but in general we see the miracle of combining art with nature. Credit goes, of course, to the filmmaker, Thomas Riedelsheimer, who directed, photographed and edited the film with incredible sensitivity and a great sense of time. <br /> <br /> If you have any sense of beauty, nature and art ... do not miss this fantastic movie!
