I did not see restored or any version of "Baby Face" with Barbara Stanwyck until I caught her in TCM. What a great movie! In short, Lily lives in a bar, and from the age of 14 she has been supplanted by her own father! He will then explode and be killed, leaving Lily (Stanwyck) alone, behind her black maid Chico, played very nicely by Theresa Harris. Lily goes to a big city (New York), deciding to have sex to get to the top. It does it in great style! <br /> <br /> He seduces a plump official to come on the ground floor and pass through men like disposable candies! One dumps his fianc√©e and kills his near father-in-law, also daddy Lily, and then commits suicide! Lily barely winks! STanwyck is a wonderful girl who really does not know what love is. <br /> <br /> Then in Paris he falls in love with Courtney, played by George Brent, they get married, but when he is in deep financial fears, she screws. Almost for free with Chico and half a million, she realizes that she loved Court! Lily is racing to find him, but will it be too late? <br /> <br /> This is the Hollywood code at its best. Stanwyck is amazing, and the look and music in the film are excellent. It reminded me of "Original Sin" with Angelina Jolie, another unjustly ignored film with an amoral woman, those who did not like that films of ultra-romantic tendencies, do not like Baby FAce better, those with faith in sex, love and power love it. Highly recommended! Look at this!
