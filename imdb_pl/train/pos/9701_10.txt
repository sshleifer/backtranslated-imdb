Fantastic show and unrealized classic; The gentlemen's league remains one of the largest contemporary comedies of recent years. <br /> <br /> With a dark and bizarre style of humor that dominates over the tired, formal approach of his inferior, but unfortunately much more recognized successor, Little Britain, The League of Gentlemen was really special in a fairly quiet era in British comedy . <br /> <br /> There has never been such thing as The League of Gentlemen before coming to the stage. At first glance, the seemingly simplified sketches display soon develops as a lively, sinister, but incredibly funny universe filled with all brilliant comedy creations. What really sets this program apart from its rivals is the approach to telling us stories. Instead of us re-imagining sketches, barely distinguishable from the next, we see that each person or group of heroes goes through various journeys and stories. No visit to them is the same, and every time they offer us a surprise. <br /> <br /> Gradually, in three series and a Christmas exception, the fictional city of Royston Vasey is playing a grotesquely funny population. And this is probably the main reason why the program is so joyful to watch (and also the reason why the program certainly deserves more series). Unlike other current programs, such as The Catherine Tate Show or, more importantly, Little Britain, the League both knows when the character has his course and has the opportunity to deal with it. A few favorite supporters who would easily be able to keep on playing went out before the series came to an end, giving space to other heroes to expand even more, or letting Royston Vasea's newer residents introduce themselves to stand out. <br /> <br /> Another thing that makes this show stand out above others is that the writing team approaches the scripting process with caution and intelligence. As mentioned earlier, all four members of the League have a reasonable mind when it comes to assessing the longevity of their creations, and when the time comes to name it, it is for certain characters. This awareness also meant that the Gentlemen's League was going through a bold evolution, usually not seen in this kind of performance. Based on narratives and a much darker third series is a bold step in relation to the first two series based on a sketch - and this bold move of the League really pays off. The third series is a less urgent need to satisfy the audience, and like special Christmas, they make individual stories with a clear narrative, in contrast to the more sketched previous series that (successfully) connect different sets outlines a series of long stories . <br /> <br /> The third series is both a refreshing change in the pace of the style and a real treat for fans who have already seen the first two. Despite a polarized opinion on the third series, every real League fan will appreciate what the third series has to offer, and also really enjoys more episodes based on characters that go deep into fan favorites only, but blend and connect characters with wine that could not pass paths before. <br /> <br /> It may take a while before we change to a style, but it is definitely worth it, and in my opinion the third series is the best and is also a strong application for the series. <br /> <br /> The show is not without flaws and very rarely some characters and songs seem out of place, but most of the genius writing, dark nature of the show and a lot of brilliant characters (which are often too close to real life) are a real a feast and proves what a comedy should be and many of the latest, inspired by phrases and often desperate attempts of a comedy of shame
