It's an excellent document, full of racing action, beautiful photos and great history. IMAX cameras provide a very wide perspective because the DVD movie is perfect. You hear that every speaker works almost all the time, the movie is not accelerated and simply gives a natural impression of 230 miles per hour. Of course, some sound effects have been added, but I think they are good, give depth to the driving scenes ...
