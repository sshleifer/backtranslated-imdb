After watching the movie a few months ago, it still comes back to my consciousness and I feel I have to buy it or at least see it again, although I watched it at least three times when I was renting it at the moment. <br /> <br /> I fell in love with Hal Hartley's direction many years ago - I discovered that these movies can make me laugh in a place that is rarely torn apart. It's a strange feeling, I admit, and I assume that most people do not really understand it, or make them feel lost and somewhat uncomfortable - I think I just really understand it - it's as if these movies were created for me. <br /> <br /> Although I do not remember if I really laughed during this movie, it remains one of the funniest movies I've seen for many years. If you do not see the humor of the shopping bag that Fay takes from the street to the church, to the publisher's office of her brother, to her son's office, you may not have the intelligence to be very impressed with the movie. The bag is a silent figure in itself, which is drawn as a motherhood icon, usually a bold, bizarre Parker Posey, which he must bear before the international plot intrudes on the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> I think Henry Fool "my least favorite from Hartley's films. I really do not remember it very well - I think that the hero himself was so mean that I thought it boring. Hartley's forte seems to be a female figure of development. <br /> <br /> In addition to Posey's brilliance, it was great to see Elina Lowensohn, one of my favorite actresses. Her extravagant naivety is perfect for Hartley's direction. His ability to make scandalous seems banal helps to define his style as an excellent chronic irony. <br /> <br /> This film appears in an extremely important international history of intrigue explaining political situations in Afghanistan. It is never suspected at the beginning. The complexity of this film's development is unmatched. <br /> <br /> This is the personification of the "independent" continuation. The less you know about Henry Fool, the more mystery you revolve around him, the less you expect him to appear at the end of the movie - as a device to complain about alcohol-burning chains, throwing insults on his Islamic terrorist who somehow seems to respect him . It's like finding out that Santa is actually a 12-year-old schoolboy. <br /> <br /> Although I was impressed and happy with Hartley's other recent films, "Girl on Monday" and "There is no such thing", Fay Grim "goes far beyond what I expected, with a sense of humor and originality, for which no one would dare to win an Oscar.
