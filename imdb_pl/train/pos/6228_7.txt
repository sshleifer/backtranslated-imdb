Another funny, witty, foamy RKO musical with Astaire and Rogers, FOLLOW THE FLEET is a charming film. Although he lacks the outstanding SWNG TIME melodies (although the final issue of "Face the music and dance" is one of the best bands and rightly so), it is extremely pleasant, because these two can practically do nothing wrong together in the thirties. Once again, the story is light and unnoticeable, but watching the dance of Fred and Ginger is a clear sky. These two gave more romanticism and magic in the dance than many couples in movies on the huge love scene. Although there are better Fred and Ginger musicals, you definitely have to see.
