This game is one of the best RPG games. Fist, In fact, it is more fun than any other due to the combat system (you harm the enemy depending on how you aim at the attack, you can turn into a dragoon, special attack, magic ...). The script is very good. The characters are beautiful and you do not have long dialogues to handle, as was the case with several games from the Final Fintasy series. I was bored by this dialogue about the past, when you just want to continue the story of the game. Ambientation is a jewel in this game, combining a medieval fantasy with futuristic science fiction. It's amazing that the effects of animation are simply amazing, I like them more than others in other modern games (we do not remember that Legend of the Dragoon is 8 years old). Then the map is huge, there are all kinds of places and enemies. Finally, Music is not the best music I've ever heard, but it's perfect for this game.
