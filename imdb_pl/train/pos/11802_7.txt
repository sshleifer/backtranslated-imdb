This is not the best Bigfoot that has ever been made, but thanks to the latest standards of Nature, there have been good films, mainly shown on the Sci-Fi channel, that is quality. He has some action, a bit of humor, a decent F / X and Bigfoot. CG is used, but there are also practical F / Xs that I like. <br /> <br /> In general, a movie is worth watching if you're a fan of horror B / sci-fi and need a correction. It's better than the Sasquatch movie and it's not a continuation, so do not be fooled. <br /> <br /> Acting is better than you can expect in such a movie, and the direction is more than enough. Expect a bit of a lul when the characters are "developed", but know that everything will rise. If you're watching a DVD, you can skip a chapter or two.
