I have read some previous comments stating that this movie is losing strength at the end of the movie, and also that it has a similar ending to Cape Fear. I totally disagree. I intend to provide a simple overview of normal movie-goers. I thought the casting was perfect. I thought it was one of Ed Harris's best performances. What a bad psychopath !!! I have great respect for his acting after watching his performance in this film. I was riveted throughout this movie. If you like mysterious thrillers, it's definitely the movie you want to see. I also noticed the young Scarlett Johannson in this movie. This movie is full of stars and I highly recommend it!
