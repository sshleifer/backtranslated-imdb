A film that dramatized understandable reluctance to face the inevitable coming of World War II, when a Spanish Republican sent by his soon overthrown government (Charles Boyer) infiltrates England, seeking support for his cause, trying to influence rich mine owners not to sell coal fascists in Spain. He will upset the residents, convincing them to be beaten in one scene, and then in the film in the face of the angry crowd of miners who see him as a further threat to their shaky livelihoods. Regardless of the socio-economic hierarchy, xenophobia and world politics, this film cleverly delves into a dark and intriguing intrigue with the unfaithful compatriots played by Katina Paxinou and Peter Lorre and is expertly filmed in numerous dark scenes embedded in the grim hotel of James Wong Howe and manages more than once to get under your skin.
