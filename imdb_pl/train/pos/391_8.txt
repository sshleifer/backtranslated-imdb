"Zu: Warriors from the magical mountain" was and is an impressive classic! You would never guess that it was created in 1983. The use of special effects by Tsui Hark was very creative and ingenious. (He continued in the Chinese Ghost Story trilogy and subsequent productions.) Even now he can face other genres in this genre. "Legend of Zu" is connected with "Zu" warriors from the magical mountain! It is not necessary to see this movie to understand the story of this. The story is a bit difficult to trace. It's a matter of action and adventure! I always wondered what Tsui Hark would do if he got CGI. We now know that he did this movie. Maybe it is sometimes too much, but the overall result is so beautiful that I will not be critical about it. There's so much going on, you just will not believe it! I think it's a great shame that this film was not shown in cinemas here in the Netherlands. the movie screams at the screens in cinemas! This movie can easily overcome large budget productions in Hollywood, such as "Superman Returns" and Xmen 3. The only thing I have to mention is the lack of humor! , fantasy, martial arts and humor, somehow missing in this film, and again I will not picky those little things. "Legend of Zu" delivers the most beautiful special effects you see on the front. A real classic!
