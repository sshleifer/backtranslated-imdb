I saw it for the first time at a foreign film festival. It is a beautifully wandered guitarist about a plot to free Estonian treasure in the amount of about one billion zlotys. All this is shot in a granular, grainy style, which Hollywood rarely uses - but beautifully captures the atmosphere of the newly emancipated Baltic states (note: Tallinn looked much less gloomy in 2003, When I was there). > <br /> There is also a lot of humor and some romance. I do not want to spoil many surprising, but logical surprises, so let me just say that this paranoid movie starts with a great script, and the direction and performances are at the highest level. DARKNESS IN TALLIN is simply the fastest and most moving example of this genre - I would oppose RAFIFI, TOPKAPI and be far ahead of the new OCEAN'S 11, although (deliberately) not so shiny. RENT OR BUY NOW.
