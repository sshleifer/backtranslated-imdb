It was the second of a series of 6 "classic Tarzan movies" with Johnny Weismuller in the title role and Maureen O'Sullivan as Jane. <br /> <br /> As usual, it was a great movie in this series; and perhaps stands out as a "between" film in progression, which could be almost an example of cinema development from the early 1930s to the 1940s. As such, it presented a good pace, though not as good as subsequent films. Similarly, the photos are less successful than the later Tarzan movies in this series. The material I saw was of uneven quality, it contained some grainy scenery and some underexposed and overexposed scenes. There is a lack of a clear demonstration of Tarzan's later films. On the other hand, there is one scene, very early, in which the rapid movements of the camera with the swelling of leaves before it when the camera retreats, showing men safari junkies, were really almost modern in their style and contrasts strongly with stationary shots that make up the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Regarding the story, one of the interesting features was almost the changeability and unsteadiness of Jane, when she was the subject of Martin flirting. Kiss ?? and Jane's reaction is stunned and partly guilty? they announce something to Jane, which we also see in these films. Compare, for example, at Tarzan Finds a Son! Jane's two-handed actions cheat Tarzan and deliver the boy to the family. He later admits to Tarzan that he was wrong. Here, nothing so clear, but Jane "comes back" to Jane Parker from the past and almost a pathetic series of activities, depriving herself of the evening dress brought by Martin and Harry to pull her away from Tarzan. /> <br /> There was a whole series of performances and sequences that particularly hit me in this watching. <br /> <br /> First of all, the image we get from the home life of Tarzan is here, as later, a combination of sensual idyll with always close to the possibility of violent death. This is the very essence of Tarzan's experience for me. <br /> <br /> I was really surprised by some quite violent scenes, even by today's standards. <br /> <br /> There was a whole series of scenes that gave me a special pleasure: Tarzan leading the elephants to the cemetery of the Valley of the Elephants; Tarzan is rescued from water death by a hippopotamus and then nurtured by monkeys; Cheetah will find Tarzan when Jane and the other men are trapped at the foot of the embankment; In particular, a cheetah crossing a river on a log. Recent scenes of battles of savages and lions on earth, savages and great apes on trees. Jane, showing us that she really is now in the Tarzan world, quickly showing her enterprising woodcraft to develop a fire line to keep the lions away. <br /> <br /> The final series of scenes is great: suddenly Tarzan is on stage, throwing savages out of the trees and taking control of the lions, and calling the elephants to the rescue! This last shout of Tarzan's triumph, holding in his arms a happy Jane with a dancing and delighted Cheetah, is an unforgettable image and a really great summary of the story of Tarzan and Jane. <br /> <br /> In total, this is another great classic Tarzan movie. I recommend this movie to everyone.
