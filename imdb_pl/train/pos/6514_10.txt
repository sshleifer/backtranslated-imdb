I thought that the children in the series did a very good job. I especially liked the performance of Emma. Good job! The stunts were quite good for a low-budget show. I managed to follow the movie and enjoy it without looking at my watch every 5 minutes. I liked scenes with a fairy and her smoking. Ghostly revelations of children's souls have been released. Another good point of the film is that it was constantly moving. There were not too many slow scenes. The adult leaders were also credible and that's why they helped keep the show entertained. All in all a nice night watching movies.
