This is one irresistible, great and joyful and technically created movie! <br /> <br /> The movie contains some of the finest sets you'll ever see in a movie from the '30s, although it's too obvious that there are sets, not real places. Often, when the character fell or shook the door too aggressively, the whole set of course moved. <br /> <br /> The best moments of the film were quiet, more old-fashioned, slapstick moments. He shows that the real heart of René Clair was to create a silent movie. The general mood is really great in this movie. Of course, the music moments were more than great. It is a really pleasant light and a simple, pleasant early French musical. Although the best moments are silent moments, this does not mean that the movie is not filled with some great humorous dialogue, which is very well realized by the main actors who all seemed to me stage actors, which in this case worked extremely well for the film's overall style and pleasant atmosphere without worries. No wonder everything went so well because this film is based on the stage play of Georges Berr. <br /> <br /> This is a really great technical film, as well as a great innovative camera and some really great editing that creates a quick and pleasant viewing of nice sequences. There is never a boring moment in this movie! <br /> <br /> René Clair was such a wise director who knew how to build and plan comic moments in movies. It is a very creative movie that despite its simplicity at any time feels like a completely original and cleverly constructed movie that never takes entertainment. <br /> <br /> The last half hour is especially unforgettable fun, without too much depression and is really one of the most wonderful and creative moments in early comedy productions. <br /> <br /> The movie is filled with really funny characters, which are obviously very stereotypical and stupid, and of course they were cast due to their appearance. All this contributes to the pleasant, light comic atmosphere and sweetness of the film. <br /> <br /> One of the most enjoyable movies you'll ever see! <br /> <br /> 8/10
