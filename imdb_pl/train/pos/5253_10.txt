I really do not understand why people get so nervous and look at this movie! Remember people, this is the SNL movie, not something that should be unpredictable and original in the story or in the direction of! The Ladies Man is a funny movie, though sometimes stupid, with a terrifying cast and, as usual, GREAT performances by Will Ferrel and Tim Meadows. Yes, some jokes are stupid and yes, the characters are unbelievable, but his comedy! I really do not understand how anyone could laugh at this funny movie. Anyway, all I'm asking is for people to take it the way it is - the SNL comedy, stupid and dismissive. Nothing to win prizes, and yet some modern comedy gold. "10-4 Morel!"
