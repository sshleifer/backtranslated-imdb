Walter Pidgeon is Braley Mason, a civil lawyer who deals with the criminal case in Unknown Man, a film from 1951 with the participation of Ann Harding, Barry Sullivan, Keefe Braselle and Richard Anderson. A great believer in justice, Pidgeon accepts a pro bono case defending a young man, Rudi Walchek (Braselle), accused of murder and has him acquitted. Shortly thereafter, he realizes that the man is guilty and has forced money for protection from his victim, as well as other shopkeepers in the area. DA (Sullivan) advises him that Rudi is a small change, that to eliminate organized crime, you need to find the highest man. Mason finds a leading man and faces a dilemma. <br /> <br /> "Unknown man" is a small, black and white film that manages to keep the spectator's interest in different twists, although the story is a bit imaginary. It is really a story of a good man who is looking for his god, justice and what he is willing to do to achieve it. And this is the most fancy part of everything. I suppose it was time before O.J., the Menendez Brothers, etc., when people believed in the fairness and integrity of lawyers. For this viewer, these days are already long. <br /> <br /> Walter Pidgeon does a great job - his handsome, elegant style and declamatory voice show us a successful, confident man, but also deeply caring. Pidgeon had a great career that lasted 60 years, but he never achieved perfection. He was a solid actor who could play almost everything and did. Maybe because he was already in his thirties by the time he was run, and he missed being a matinee idol; or maybe he missed something; or that he was first entered as the second leading to a great female star such as Greer Garson. Hard to say. It gives here a sincere and moving performance. <br /> <br /> A very good movie with good performances.
