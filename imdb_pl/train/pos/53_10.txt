Home Room really surprised me. Compared to other films that were written about Columbine High, this one is the best. The home room does not show the school shootings, but rather the consequences and effects of the community and the city. The film focuses on two opposite characters. Alecia (Busy Phillips) and Deanna (Erika Christensen). Alecia is an outcast who witnessed the whole shooting. It seems that it does not show any emotions. Deanna is a popular girl and the only survivor. Alecia is forced to visit Deanna in the hospital to complete her studies. In the meantime, the police are investigating Alecia because she could know that the shooting will happen. Alecia and Deanna are very different and at first they do not get along. In the end, they develop mutual understanding and become friends. (very much like a breakfast club). Home Room Beautifully shows the power of closeness and hustle after a school shooting. I recommend this film to everyone and everything.
