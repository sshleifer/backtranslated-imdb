Bored with the usual popular movies that I watched on Halloween, which I saw over and over again, I took a risk in the Sentinel, hoping that my horror movies would flow again. Remember that I just came back from the remake of "The House on Haunted Hill" in Dark Castle - a complete and full of shit. Fortunately, "The Sentinel" BLEW ME AWAY! In the thrilling story of a model that moves to the terrifying building in Brooklyn Hights, the movie offers everything I hope to find in a good movie - (1) Campus and fanciful lucky characters, exchanges and dialogues, including the cheerful turns of Christopher Walken, Jeff Goldblum especially Martin Balsam, as an absent professor - (2) Terrifying terror! Not to capture the frame, but there are scenes in this movie that chilled me to my pancreas - (3) Fantastic gore, gorgeous makeup and crazy (if very uneven) direction of Michael Winner, who flows rather nicely with this unrealistic cure. If you loved "Evil Dead 2", "Dead Alive" and "Deep Rising" - it will be your favorite queen. To emphasize my love for this film - after seeing it for the first time, shocked, rewound it and looked again. It is now one of the favorites of all time. Do yourself a favor and check it out!
