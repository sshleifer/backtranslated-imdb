People call it a comedy, but when I just looked at it, I laughed <br /> <br /> only once. I think the problem is that for the first time I saw him when I was 14, <br /> <br /> and I was not old enough to understand that he was not to be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> . There were a lot of scenes that were supposed to be fun, <br /> <br />, but I was too concerned about the characters who could laugh at them <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> I suggest you watch this movie the next time you fall in love. <br /> <br /> and try to take it seriously. I think you'll find that despite some stupid mistakes <br /> <br /> this is one of the most moving love stories you've ever seen.
