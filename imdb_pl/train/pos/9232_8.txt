Too many sources routinely evoke this thought provoking drama, partly based on historical facts, along with a superficially similar "nunsploitation" that was the mainstay of the 70's Trash cinema, bypassing the righteous anger that drives the whole venture. Perhaps by chance, it was also a single attempt by director Gianfranco Mingozzi, based on the narrative creation of films outside of many well-accepted documentary films. <br /> <br /> Safely embedded in a historical context, FLAVIA shows the growing rebellion of an Italian nun from the early fifteenth century (Career Florinda Bolkan, even surpassing her steadfast work in the destructive DO NOT TORTURE A DUCKLING by Lucio Fulciego), closed in a monastery by her not so noble father in a desperate attempt to curb the budding sensual nature of the girl. Reflecting on why women are at best degraded to secondary roles in life, as in the holy scripture, they encounter ways in which male domination can tear a woman's life, inspiring rebellion fueled by the rage of half-mad older sister Agata (permanently portrayed by veteran Maria Casarès from LES ENFANTS DU PARADIS by Marcel Carné) and - more constructively - by the Muslim invasion. By joining the persecutors and perhaps unconsciously manipulating them to execute her order, Flavia really becomes an outcast she has already felt with the expected tragic consequences. <br /> <br /> With the breathtaking panoramic compositions of Alfio Contini, who shot Michelangelo the POINT of Antonioni, this is an uncompromising and harsh account of the fierce, but ultimately fruitless struggle of one woman with a patriarchal society that has not granted her any rights outside of parenthood or eccentricity, as Agatha notes sarcastically. Despite the long fantasy invented by physicians, modeled on Ken Ruselsel's much more extravagant DEVILES, the film turns out to be relatively skimpy in the skin department, mocking the reputation of semi-porn. This is a serious work that deserves to be rediscovered and restored to its unfairly damaged reputation.
