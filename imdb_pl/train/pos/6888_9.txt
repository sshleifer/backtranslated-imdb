I watch live movies, choosing the ones that are good enough to separate them ... I reject those that do not cut. I'm not saying that I know more than anyone on this basis, I'm just leading you to the way I came to see the "Gospel of Lou" ... Anyway ... A lot of bad movies are landing on my desk and I'm actually sitting through them all. Actually, I do not "watch" everything, I usually watch TV from time to time, while I work on scanning in search of production value, performance and how well the story is presented. If something attracts me, I will take some time to look at it. "Lou" pulled me in the first few minutes when I closed my laptop and turned the chair over to the TV so that I could tune in completely. Needless to say, I was fascinated by the whole film. The story is well said, the characters are endearing or repulsive (depending on the purpose of the actor and the intentions of the directors for the character) and they are all very well played. Sometimes I have caught occasional amateur errors in camera and editing work, but the emotional nature of this story means that these errors can easily be rejected. I've heard other people's comments say that sometimes the movie brought tears to their eyes, sometimes the extreme elation ... I was laughing for a minute and cried next to me and I was incredibly moved by this movie. Unfortunately, I could not get it because I was - as the saying goes - a week late and a short dollar. That's how it sometimes happens ... but at least I had the pleasure of seeing this and I can not wait to see what the answer is. Good luck and great happiness to you, Bret Carr (if you read this), you are no doubt a talent you can be careful of.
