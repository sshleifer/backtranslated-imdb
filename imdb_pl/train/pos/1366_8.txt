am I the only person who noticed the relationship between the discussion about camus "the myth of the life of Sisyphus and Mary"? in the camus version, a man is doomed to spend eternity with a huge boulder who has to roll on the hill. unfortunately, every time it reaches the top, the boulder slides down and ends at the bottom so that it can begin. in his eyes he could be pecking buzzard, I'm not sure now. in the film, Mary spends her life fighting for a life together, unfortunately, every time she reaches any foot, she falls down and loses everything. An example is a party he throws when he is under the influence of alcohol, he insults his falafel lover and is practically attacked by Liev Schrieber. in case you question this theory, look at how this scene ends when trying to climb the stars, while books fall out of nowhere, making it harder to progress, until it eventually dies. The next morning, when she wakes up, she is still on the stairs, she never reached the top.
