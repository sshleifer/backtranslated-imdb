Dr. Mordrid is one of those rare films that is completely under control, but it's totally worth it. It really reminds me of old TV series from the 30's and 40's. That's why I'd love to watch more movies ... but judging from the rest of Full Moon's production, there just were not enough tits to please a typical audience. Unfortunately, thanks to a completely unnecessary scene of dedication, there are two too many for the family audience - which is unfortunate, because without them it can be the magical style of Harry Potter, who would eat children. Both Jeffrey Combs and Yvette Nipar are wonderful - I was not sure if Mrs. Nipar did not leave A-list on this film, she was very credible. Lightly! In any case - it's a pity that they did not have the money for the Dr. Strange, because I think it could be a total child phenomenon.
