The story of Antwone Fisher on the neglect and exploitation of children is an inspiration for all of us who have witnessed and even experienced the difficult situation of foster children. Abandoned by the restless mother, Antwone never met his father. Growing up with "church-goers" who use the "n-word" not only to intimidate and hurt, but also as a term for capturing, as a young man who witnesses how his best friend dies in an embarrassment, abolishing racist insults and being annoyed during service in the Navy, Antwone's anger slowly turns into positive power when he is advised by a navy psychiatrist and love enters his life. <br /> <br /> The scene in which Antwone meets his mother is one of the most powerful moments in the film. Dazed by the unexpected confrontation, the woman listens in silence to hear how the young man tells her how he lived a life without crimes, addictions to drugs, children's paternity left and right, all despite his completely unfavorable circumstances. <br /> <br /> If this scene was not strong enough, the next one directs her to the house (and opens the flood gates): receiving the welcome home of Antwone; dozens of smiling faces and open arms announcing that he is part of this wonderful family. <br /> <br /> One of the messages of this amazing film is that there are many good and honest people who help orphans and unwanted children. Even if some homes and administrators seem to not care for themselves and do not look like themselves, many of them give their best. The character who found the "file" by Antwone after revealing the circumstances of his birth is one of the "bright lights" in the darkness of the system. <br /> <br /> The DVD contains the French language track, various subtitle options, as well as additional functions and information about foster parents. <br /> <br /> As Clevelander, I appreciate the film material. No matter where you are from, you will be deeply moved by this autobiographical jewel.
