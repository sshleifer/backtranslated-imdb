A series of great comedies from the 90s (two series in total), which suffered in the British rankings due to poor planning. When you oppose recognized comedies, such as "Minder", even the best new comedies will fight to be noticed. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I caught a series from the first episode and followed her. I mentioned this to my friends and family, but everyone seemed to be watching something else. Very, very frustrating. <br /> <br /> In any case, I loved both series and never forgot about it. <br /> <br /> Then I checked it on the Internet and discovered that the ultra-fan tried to release both series "on its own". <br /> <br /> Well, both series are now available on DVD. <br /> <br /> http://www.replaydvd.co.uk/joking_apart_S1. htm
