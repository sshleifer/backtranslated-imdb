When I saw the ads, I was thinking "NO WHAT NICK NICK AT NITE DONE!" because he took the place for a "fresh prince". Well, I still love the fresh prince. but George Lopez is a surprisingly good show. I love how unpalatotic Benny is. carmen is a pretty good character, he is really funny, seeing how sometimes he can be stupid and exaggerated. I feel bad with a guy who plays max, he looks much younger than he really is! but max is a funny character and it worked well. and yes, Angie is a bit stereotypical, but she has her funny moments. ha ha George has a great head! nah, but it can also be really good. funny show! definitely should be more often than at home.
