I really miss the production of good old Spooky movies. If Ismail Merchant and James Ivory were given the task of producing such a film, this could be the one, except for the lack of the world-renowned premium casting. This is one of those movies that you watch alone on a dark evening with pizza and popcorn, and do not even bother to make the dishes until morning because you just want to hide under the covers. Bravo for director Herbert Wise, Writers Susan Hill and Nigel Kneale, top Jon Bunker's production project, John Ralph's Art Direction, and a great cast that makes me tremble and feel so isolated even though I live in one of the most populated cities in the world at the beginning of the 21st century. I gave him a "9" of "10" because in the production and budget restrictions of the television really attracted a great performance.
