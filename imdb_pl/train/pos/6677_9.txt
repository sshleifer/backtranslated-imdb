A film about wills, never-heroes and heroes who do it against all adversities. Where we've heard it before. But when the unfortunates are Shoveller, Blue Raja and Mr. Furious, you know that this is not your conventional story about rags. <br /> <br /> Eddie Izzard's classic performance as Tony P. leaders and Geoffrey Rush as Arch Villain show the real idea in the casting. <br /> <br /> Even Greg Kinnear, at first glance, the strange selection of the role of Captain Niesamowitego turns out to be in place. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you've had enough of the comic - film stereotypes. Why anger can not be super power?
