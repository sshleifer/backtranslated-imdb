EDMUND LOWE (which reminds me a bit of Warren William) leads a nice cast of an interesting little secret that moves at a fast pace and lasts just over an hour. <br /> <br /> Douglas Walton plays an unlucky jockey who seems interested in his own fall (hypnotism, anyone?), and suspects are a large number of supporting casts - all from Virginia Bruce, Kent Smith, Frieda Inescourt, Gene Lockhart, Jessie Ralph, Benita Hume, Rosalind Ivan and HB Warner. An additional advantage is Nat Pendleton as a detective with a dimwit - and, moreover, get an Art Deco decoration for the fancy interiors of a rich home. It had to be a set that was used in many subsequent movies. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, the secret is not so complicated that everyone can follow the story with reasonable certainty that he is not too surprised. For Detective Philo Vance, suddenly everything becomes clear - and then he has the final confrontation with the killer, who gives the film fifty-five minutes of incredible tension. <br /> <br /> Nicely done and spends time in a fun way.
