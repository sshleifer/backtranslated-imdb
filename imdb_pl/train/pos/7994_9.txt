I really enjoyed this movie. it's dark, it's not dodging bullets, and driving your car is numbing your brain action movie. many forms and motivations of the characters are unclear, leaving the viewer with their own conclusions. it's nice to see a movie in which the director allows the viewer to think for himself. <br /> <br /> finally motivated by love or revenge or a desire to repent - he does what he feels "good." "Will God ever forgive us what we've done?" - this is not a question that mortal people can answer - so he does what he feels he has to do, what he is good at, what he has been trained in. <br /> <br /> denzel washington is a great actor - to be honest, he can not come up with one bad movie he did - and has a great cast, I highly recommend this movie to everyone.
