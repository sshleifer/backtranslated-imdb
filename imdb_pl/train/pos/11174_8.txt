Probably the most accurate adaptation of Stephen King. No wonder, since King himself wrote the script. The story is about the relocation of the Creed family to the beautiful Maine home. One of the other residents is Jud, a nice old man who knows a few things about the area. One of them is the highway that runs straight through their courtyard. The second is the path leading to the Seminary of Domestic Animals, where children for decades were buried by animals killed by the highway. Soon the cat, Ellie Creed, the church, was found dead. Fortunately, this happens when the family, except for Louis (father), goes on Thanksgiving. Jud takes Louis to a different place of burial, for Pet Semary, where the church is to be buried. Later Ludwik is greeted (not so politely) by the church. He returned, looking as if he had escaped from the bag in which he had been buried. Maybe he was buried alive. May not. I can say nothing more without ruining the story. <br /> <br /> Of all King's adaptations, I saw it the most frightening. Characters are real and situations are normal. Mary Lambert does a great job by guiding her behavior. Throughout the film, the tension is quite high, partly due to the development of the story. The scene in which Gage will be killed will stay in your mind forever. Then, of course, we have an application. It's easy to tell what's going to happen, but Lambert pulls out truly terrifying and sometimes disturbing moments. <br /> <br /> In general, it's a good movie and perfect adaptation. If you like to be scared and do not mind persecuting some disturbing images from time to time, "Pet Sematary" is just what you are looking for. Non Horror fans will want to avoid this.
