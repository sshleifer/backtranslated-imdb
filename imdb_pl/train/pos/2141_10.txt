Masayuki Suo, who directed this wonderful movie, plays a role. After decent "Fancy Dance" and classic (in any case in Japan) comedy "Shiko Funjatta" Suo followed his own, huge successes. <br /> <br /> History is addictive. We both laugh a lot (Naoto Takenaka is funny, as in the two previous Suo movies) and really the roots of heroes. But for me the great advantage is the look that this film gives the viewer a Japanese society - a real life in Japan. Suo has the talent to show real activities with funny talent. The result is a film that will draw you in, make you laugh, make you think and wake you up and let you meet modern Japan. <br /> <br /> Also look for the 8 main actors from Shiko Funjatta, because they all appear again in different roles, from supporting characters (Takenaka) to short scenes (many).
