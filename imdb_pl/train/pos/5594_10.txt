Ecstasy (1933) (USA 1940) Starring Hedy Lamarr (as Hedy Kiesler) <br /> <br /> The first look at the world of 19-year-old Hedy Lamarr appears in the early moments of this treasure of 1930, When she wanders screen in an angelic wedding dress. This was to be the beginning of a legendary career. It was our glorious introduction to the most beautiful woman who ever honored the silver screen. <br /> <br /> This is the wedding night of Eva (Lamarr), and her older husband seems uninterested in her romantic progress. He retreats to a lonely bed, and on a beautiful scene, plays with his wedding ring when her marriage mistake is realized. The husband seems more interested in neatness and order than in love. Gustav Machaty uses gorgeous camera angles and immaculate framing to capture the considerable talent and beauty of Lamarr. Without the words spoken at the beginning of the film, he is able to understand our sympathy, our hearts and our support. It was this combination that prepared the audience of the thirties for what they were supposed to see when the film unfolded. Ecstasy was considered shocking for its time ... Some people thought it scandalous. <br /> <br /> He returns home after his father's estate and applies for divorce. The next day he wakes up with a full sense of freedom and happiness. It just has to go outside and feel the freedom of the village and fresh air. Eva rides a horse and goes through a beautiful lake. In one of the most famous scenes in the film's history, Hedy Lamarr became the first person who appeared naked in a big movie. Her play in the forest and her skinny adventure in the lake were legendary scandalous. But the audience could not stay away. As with many of today's films, controversy has made the film a necessity. <br /> <br /> Erroneous adventure Eva introduces her into a handsome young man who helps her find a horse who escaped with clothes. After an awkward meeting, they eventually fall on each other. Their first romantic encounter was almost as controversial as a nude scene with glaring waves of eroticism. However, Machata does a beautiful job in these romantic moments. Machaty creates one great moment when Eva literally seems to be immersed in her new lover, using a great early camera trick. <br /> <br /> You can not overestimate how brave Lamarr was. Many would suppose that it was professional suicide. Instead, he gained worldwide fame and attracted the attention of Louis B Mayer, who signed a contract with MGM. In this movie there are some really erotic moments, even according to today's disgusting standards. You can not imagine how they were received in the thirties. Again, Machaty was very clever with his imaginations, leaving much imagination. But we all perfectly understand what we see and it is perfectly done. <br /> <br /> The meeting of ex-husband Eva and her current lover is perhaps inevitable. However, the consequences of this meeting are not. The film performs some unexpected turns in its last act, and all this creates a great story and a beautiful debut at the great stage of the film's fame for Hedy Lamarr. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this once controversial, now tame the movie and get him to look for it in a reconstructed form on DVD. It is worthwhile, if only for the pleasure of seeing Hedy Lamarr. But history is also convincing and the direction is ahead of its time. "Ecstasy" is an unforgettable early treasure. <br /> <br /> www.tccandler.com - TC Candler's Movie Reviews !!!
