This is not a movie for fans of Lynch's usual weird things. Rather, it is for those who either appreciate a good story or have become tired of popular material with overt sentimentality and Oprah-ish "This is such a great movie! You must see it! "- semantics (at least once it is right!). <br /> <br /> History unfolds unmistakably and we are taken on a journey that I think most of us will recognize. A compassionate, existentialist journey in which we make changes changes our past when we approach us inevitably. <br /> <br /> Acting is unmistakable, just like cinematography (sometimes quite brilliant!), And dialogue leaves only for the viewer to capture the details of the story. <br /> <br /> A warm movie. He is not too sentimental.
