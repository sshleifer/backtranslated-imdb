This movie is such shoddy goodness. <br /> <br /> A group of people trapped in an abandoned school. They start to kill, they know they are being tracked, so what are they doing? One girl decides to take a bath, another decides to deceive her husband (who is also there) with an old boy, to somehow find a bed (in an old abandoned school?) And they went to it. <br /> <br /> And it happens thanks to gore and T & A. <br /> <br /> And it's also interesting from a historical / sociological point of view. Where the ordinary 1980's slasher is a reflection of how we perceive ourselves, or how adults perceive young people, or how Hollywood perceives the rest of the country, it has a unique perspective. This is a British film that is to be an American slasher. It's funny how often British actors who try to talk "American", inadvertently come back to their British accents. <br /> <br /> If you like bad slums from the 80's (like Pieces), you'll like this one.
