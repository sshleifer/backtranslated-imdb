I think this movie is absolutely beautiful. And I'm not just talking about breathtaking scenery. It's about two unhappy English housewives who decide to rent an Italian castle to relax from not too happy home life. After all, four women rent this place together, all with different personalities and different reasons to be there. In this magically beautiful place, everyone finds peace, which they miss and, what's interesting, peace comes from internal reflections and resolutions, more than without. I also find it great because of the relationships that develop thanks to courtesy and understanding. Acting is a joy to observe in itself. I especially love the characters Lottie (Josie Lawrence) and Lady Caroline (Polly Walker).
