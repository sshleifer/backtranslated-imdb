I have enough people whining about Ewoks! It is true that they are not the best thing that has ever happened in Star Wars, but they have happened, so deal with it! Besides, they are cute and I do not care if they are available on the market. Yubb Nubb! <br /> <br /> This movie always leaves me in tears. This is perfect. The end could not be better. I am excited about "The Phantom Menace" because it suddenly throws the whole story from Luke to Anakin. I love how it reveals itself at the end - it would be too unresolved in any other way. So those of you who complain that Vader's helmet has been removed, take a moment to think about it. It's very effective. Vader, a man who has been hiding behind a mask for 20 years, is finally revealed as a sick man. It is not completely machine - it is sensitive. <br /> <br /> I do not know how the casting director chose such good actors in A New Hope. Everyone is doing well. They are reliable characters. Hamill copes well with his dramatic character development. Fisher is doing a great job as a female model (I mean, give it a rest!) She killed Jabba even when many others failed!). Harrison Ford - do I have to say more? <br /> <br /> Music is once again brilliant. It's very moving and meaningful when you can choose the characters' motifs in different parts of the movie. The best climax is when Luke yells "NOOO!" And jumps out to fight his father in the Final Battle. John Williams is a genius! What an amazing man! <br /> <br /> Already, the movie is much more important to me because of episode I. I can not wait to see it in cinemas (CAN I WAIT ???) and then re-watch the original trilogy. <br /> <br /> Bravo!
