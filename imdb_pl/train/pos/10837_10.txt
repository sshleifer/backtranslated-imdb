This aging rocker mentions Heep and Quo - my two favorite bands in history - but with an amazing cast (everyone) - and a fantastic story - I just love this creative genius. I can not recommend it more - and Mick Jones added so much (foreign leader and main songwriter along with the biggest rock singer - Lou Gramm) - I watched this wonderful job over 10 times - Bill Nighy - what voice - Jimmy Nail - talent emanates from every season - then Astrid .... and Karen ..... what can an aging rocker ask for !! 10/10 - bloody genius. <br /> <br /> Alastair, Perth, Western Oz, originating from Windsor, England.
