Wonderfully arranged. I would like it to be a continuation of this document to follow the lives of some and to celebrate the lives of others lost ... should be the second part ... real. It was great ... the movie was not long enough .. I would like to know why the filmmaker did not follow !! this is so important for the community period ... if you are reading this, consider another documentary of this type ... I am very tired of hearing from naive writers how AIDS and men go together when they do not; it's actually a straight line in which we have to look at ... this movie did not even bother to mention HIV or AIDS and I'm very happy about it. Thank you so much for making this movie possible.
