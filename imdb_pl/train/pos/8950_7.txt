For those who do not know Jimmy Stewart, this is one of his "smaller" films from a later career. And although it's not a great movie compared to many of his other photos, it's not bad and it's decent passing time - but not much more. <br /> <br /> Kim Novak is a witch in New York and, for some inexplicable reason, decides to cast a spell on poor Jimmy to fall in love with her. Over time, the cold and detached Mrs. Novak also begins to fall in love with Stewart - and apparently in the book about witches it is definitely NO, NOT !! <br /> <br /> The movie is strange in its impressions about witches. They are neither a sacrifice for children nor an omnipotent change. Most of their magic is quite limited and pointless (such as Jack Lemmon using his powers to turn off streetlights). And it is very strange that all witches seem to be artists who spend time in trendy bars, where you can find people dressed in berets and listening to bad jazz. Given what I think about jazz, it really has to stink a witch in the world of this movie! <br /> <br /> In any case, the movie is quite romantic and slightly comedic, but it is not something I could hurry up with. Acting is pretty good, but the scenario does not offer enough payouts to make this movie unique - in fact I almost got the movie 6 - it was really close.
