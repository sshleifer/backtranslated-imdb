Catscratch is the best thing to do with Nickeloden, including Wayne Knight. This performance not only refers to Maori and PI. some people love it and everyone is aussies. At first glance, I admit that it seems a bit primitive, but it grows enormously on you. Also, to improve what one of the other critics said, In_Correct (Tv.com) does not say, "Does that mean you're homo now?" Says "Does it mean you're homo, owww?" This is his phrase in series. Mr. Blik is, I think, the funniest of all, such as Peww-Weww's Playhouse. <br /> <br /> First of all, I admit that the early episode was a bit good. But after a while episodes have become great! And when the series turned out to be surreal, bizarre ... Nickelodeon cancels her! <br /> <br /> I know that Nick is intended for children, but from time to time there is a genius program that can be viewed by teenagers and adults. These exhibitions include Mr. Bean the Animated Series, Charlie Brown, Pelswick, Rocko's Modern Life (sometimes) and Winter Invader. All this had to be considered too good, except for CatDog, because Nick felt the need to cancel it. <br /> <br /> What I like the famous last episode where Gordon fights with the duck. /> <br /> I would also like to see a DVD with lots of audio comments and docos√≥w behind the scenes, including the last episode. <br /> <br /> But of course, what I would definitely like to see if the show will come back on the air. Wake up NICK! <br /> <br /> I would like to have a list with all loans closing the gag on the Internet. Would be great.
