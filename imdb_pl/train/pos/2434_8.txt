I have often wondered how much CASPER was intended for children ... with all the issues related to his identity (in this movie we believe he is the ghost of a dead child because his home is the plot of the cemetery) as well as the disturbing message of this film. Maybe Casper had more in common with morality, and Famous Studios wanted to step into a new level in "real" cartoons. <br /> <br /> GOOD BOOS TONIGHT is a well-animated project - no doubt. But the development of the story with the participation of fox (who becomes a friend of Kacper, but meets the tragic end) is a concern. <br /> <br /> Admit the fame of a well-known studio - fight death with respect ... but the raw picture of Casper's grief is rather graphic and disturbing for children (though the solution offers a happy ending, but I will not give up the end), and violence is quite steep, even for standards from the age of 40. <br /> <br /> It can be a good cartoon for parents to help explain death to children - but I would not throw it into a VCR to break the interrupted cartoon.
