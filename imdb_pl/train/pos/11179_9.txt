"Pet Sematary" is successful in two main situations. First of all, it's a horrifying horror. Those that are simply not produced these days. Second, it is an emotional, clever movie. So if you're looking for thrills, horror, horror and stunning settings, great actors, dialongs and macabre effects; this is the movie you're looking for. Classic now and really necessary for every fan of Horror. <br /> <br /> Probably the best adaptation to one of King's novels. Events are a bit hasty compared to the novel, but that does not mean that this underestimated movie is not a complete achievement of Horror / Drama. <br /> <br /> Stephen King's novel is widely known for being very emotional and macabre at the same time. The film gives the same feeling mainly because there is a great character development and you can feel the loving relationship between its members. Then, when everything seems to be happiness (technically happy, because the title "Pet Sematary" does not offer satisfaction!) The tragic event changes the atmosphere of the film, now it gets very dark. The film has sinister feelings from the beginning, but after killing Gage, the film becomes sad, gray, frightening. Dealing with the loss of a son is something that can ruin the whole family life, and "Pet Sematary" proves it dramatically. <br /> <br /> The legend behind a pet is more than just a myth that no one wants to experience, but sadness and desperation bring the emotionally ruined father to a shot. Unfortunately, the legend works and Gage returns from the dead. The previous meeting with the legend of domestic animals turned out to be a tragedy, but this time it is something much worse. What will happen to the life of our entire American family? Can Pascow prevent this tragedy? What about the surreal nightmares? <br /> <br /> Watch "Pet Sematary" to see one of the most emotional emotional horrors of recent times. You will not regret. Acting is very good, although I did not dig an actor who played his father. He did not seem disturbed enough when the situations begged him for desperation. But that's just my opinion. Denise Crosby did a great job and she worked perfectly as a noble, affectionate mother. Baby Gage was amazing even on its frightening parts. *Chills*. In general, this is a great classic of all times and a disturbing movie that touches the deepest fears of people ... losing someone you love, dead people returning to life and a sense of desperation. <br /> <br /> Something is for sure ... I do not want to be buried, in animal semarars !!
