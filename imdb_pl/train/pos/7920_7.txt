Full Moon High (1981) 3 out of 5 Dir: Larry Cohen Stars: Adam Arkin, Ed McMahon, Roz Kelly <br /> <br /> Tony (Arkin) is an average ordinary guy from high school. Preparing for a great game to return home, problems with girls and growing hair in strange places? But hair in strange places loses control when a trip to Transylvania with his father (YES, McMahon) leaves him with a wicked case. Now condemned to walking the world forever young as a werewolf, how will Adam get some girls? Larry Cohen (Q the Winged Serpent, The Stuff) contains as many gagas as he can come up with as a screenwriter / director. Arkin (H20: Halloween, 20 years later) shows a nice time in the lead role. If you happen to be a fan of parodies like "Airplane" and "Student Body", I think you will have fun with that giggle.
