When I heard about the release of "Hammerhead" on DVD and finally found it in my local DVD store, I thought "well, just another cheap movie about monsters from Nu Image". These guys from Boaz Davidson and Avi Lerner have produced cheap but very funny B - pictures in the last few months, but also some very disappointing movies. So I did not expect much, especially after a few days of disappointing "Shark Zone" earlier. But "Hammerhead" turned out to be a perfect revival of movies from monsters from the 1950s. We have a mad scientist, a group of people in a dangerous situation, women and girls screaming in danger, herbivorous plants, and of course we have a creature, a huge mutant mixture of man and a hammer shark. Everything you need for a fun monster movie. There is only a lack of graphic sex scenes and nudes that you expect in films of this kind, but because the film was made for television, it is understandable why these scenes are missing. Anyway, it does not matter if "Hammerhead" is the best action and horror game. There are, however, two reasons why I gave him seven out of ten points: first, the monster is not often seen, and the exposing of the cards with the destruction of creation is too fast and poorly made, and secondly, William Forsythe is not the right guy for the role. " hero "and to fall in love with the wonderful Hunter Tylo. Besides, I can recommend this movie to any monster movie fan. Take a nice drink and some popcorn, watch this movie and have fun. Jasper P.
