It's a good movie, a good family movie to watch, if you have nothing else to do. If you're expecting this movie to be word-for-word from the book, you'll be very disappointed. I was a bit disappointed because I read the book several times when I was in elementary school. <br /> <br /> It's about a new baby in a city named Billy. He bets the company's school bully and the bet is not like most bets. Billy must eat 10 worms in one day and the tyrant wins. <br /> <br /> Acting is okay, probably the worst part of the movie. The kids are exaggerating in many matters. They think it's an apocalypse if Billy does not eat bugs. Hallie Eisenberg did a great job. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film is good like a movie, but it sucks as an adaptation of the book. I was able to watch this movie without looking back in time ... sometimes. <br /> <br /> In general, it was a good family movie with some weak points. I rate this movie 7/10.
