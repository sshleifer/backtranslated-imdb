An interesting look at Japan before opening to the West. John Wayne as the first US consul in Japan arrives in accordance with the contracts resulting from the diplomatic gunboat Perry. It is not welcome. Wayne ultimately wins a meeting with Shogun after he brought the cholera epidemic, introduced by an American ship, under control. A colorful procession takes place to the capital gifts for Shogun, including a bottle of Old Tangle. Meeting with Shogun, the debate among the Japanese aristocracy and murder during the archery exhibition are an interesting look at the policy of this period. All in all, quite a pleasant movie, and besides, how often do you see that the prince loses the fight with a guy half the size.
