Great movie. Acting - from a doctor to an artist on the sidewalk to a prostitute, with few exceptions, was wonderful; I thought that soni razdan (mrs.noble) and vrajesh hirjee (saurabh) were the best of lesser-known actors. Even Kurush Deboo (Tehmul), who can be accused of abuse, has presented quite a credible and well-known figure. <br /> <br /> Another great thing was working with the camera - and the way in which he captured the energy of the Bombay streets, the peace of mind talking about his prayers and living in tiny apartments. <br /> <br /> I liked the story of the wall, which becomes a temple, and then it falls apart - and the philosophical artist accepts it. <br /> <br /> It's great to watch good movies on Indian topics.
