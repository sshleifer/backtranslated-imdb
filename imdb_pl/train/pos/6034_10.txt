In November last year, I had the opportunity to see this movie at the Reno Film Festival. I must say that it was a lot of fun. Apart from a few technical mistakes, it was a great experience. I loved writing and acting, especially from the guy who played the main role. There is a lot of heart in this movie, a lot of good. I had the opportunity to talk to some filmmakers after they were done, and they seemed really nice. All in all the whole movie was just a positive experience and I definitely recommend it. The story was fun and cool, as a woman I experienced many of the same problems as the main guy and thanks to that I could really understand his problems. The film does a great job, giving us people with whom we can sympathize. Friends in the film are really well written, they are realistic. I know such people, I just want my friends and I could sound as nice as these people when we talk. The whole movie is really cool, I would like there to be more such films. <br /> <br /> - Jayden
