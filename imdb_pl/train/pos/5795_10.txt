This movie is my favorite! You really need to see Michael Jackson in this great movie !! I'm always on the moon watching him !! This is a movie that you really must see, also if you're not a MJ fan, because this movie is written like Captain EO, E.T. and ghosts, some history of film and music !! This wonderful movie, from Michael's feathers, is a must !! I: Smooth Criminal, is really the greatest, exciting and amazing song I've ever heard in my life !! Thank you Michael for this movie and I love you !!! MJ is the best musician who came to this planet, he is a great man and always brings flashes in your eyes when you listen to his music !! Please, if you do not know this movie, watch it and do not miss it, because it would be too bad for you if you miss it !! -Highly recommended movie for every movie lover-
