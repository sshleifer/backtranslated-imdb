People expect nothing less than brilliant when Steven Spielberg directs the film, and this film is no exception. Some of the movies I love are bad at the box office, but I'm glad that this movie is not one of them (over nine million dollars, which in those days seemed bad to me). The characters were funny, the animation was clear and indistinct, and the music was also modern, which is unusual in the case of an animated film. I did not think that Professor Screw Eyes or his "Scary Virus" was too scary for young children (the target group of this movie), but I thought that what happened to the terrifying professor was a bit too dark for a kid movie. In conclusion, this movie is a fun and charming classic that I have loved for many years.
