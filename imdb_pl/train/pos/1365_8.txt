He-he-hello !! It's a really cool movie. Basically, at Party Girl, you have your own fun-lovin ', an independent New Yorker chick from the 90s. Together with his party friends, he meets a mature Turkish seller. This is a story about the coming age for these new adults who are looking for what they want to do. It is comforting that the female loafer becomes a mature woman. Hope is given to all of us who can feel that their only skills are able to stay in check and nack for throwing good parties. <br /> <br /> By the way, Parker Posey makes this movie great. I've never been a big fan of her, but this movie just makes me want to watch all her films. There are subtle manerisms that have improved its character. If you want to laugh and have fun, be sure to watch this movie. Repeated viewing is a must.
