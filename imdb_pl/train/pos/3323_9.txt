I got this movie about a month ago and I'm a fanatic Drew Barrymore's fan. I love the happy ending, and this movie gives a great picture with Red Sox truths! It's about a math teacher who takes some promising children on a math trip to a company where successful Lindsey (Drew) shows them some information. This leads to dates Ben (teacher) and Lindsey. But not everything is easy when he confesses that he is a big fan of Red Sox. <br /> <br /> First of all, everything is fine, but then his baseball stands in the way Lindseys lives. In the end, everything is fine and one photo was enough for Drew to run around the field !! I got him for two quid in Blockbusters, so I was happy. If you like such movies, I suggest you see more Drew's works such as Charlie's Angels and 50 first dates, and even her new movie with Hugh Grant in "Music and lyrics."
