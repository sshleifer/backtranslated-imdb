In 1933, Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler sang and danced through three Warner Brothers musicals, which offered viewers of the era of depression a momentary distraction from their woes. Gold Diggers from 1933, 42 Street Street and Footlight Parade were set in the world of the Broadway Theater, basically the same theme of the program must be continued. In addition to Keeler and Powell, the films contained Busby Berkeley's kaleidiscopic choreography, showing intermittent melodies and many of the same supporting players. <br /> <br /> They are all probably classics of their genre, but I must admit that I clearly prefer Footlight because of my energy and leading James Cagney. Warren William at Gold Diggers and Warner Baxter at 42nd Street are perfectly immobilized as production executives - especially Baxter as burnt Julian Marsh in search of the latest blockbuster hit. Both, however, do not have Cagney's infectious energy, which perfectly complements the crazy pace of Broadway. She is an absolute viper when it deals with production, unscrupulous partners and a golden kicking girl. <br /> <br /> Of course, Cagney himself does not make Footlight that classic. The screenplay is cracked with sharp double enthusiasm provided by a brilliant cast with the participation of Frank McHugh, Hugh Herbert, Guy Kibbee, and especially Joan Blondell, who reduces everyone. Busby Berkeley's dance numbers are surrealistic, suggestive and risqu√© and made just in time for the Hollywood Codex in 34. Unfortunately, the thirties and later will never see such a richly made musical with verve and sass Footlight again. It ensured gentleness and morality.
