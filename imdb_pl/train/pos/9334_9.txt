Sensuous Nurse (1975) is an Italian sexual comedy in which Bond, Ursula Andress, once performed. The man was hot in this film. It was arranged and built like a brick house * @ #%. Ursula was hot in this movie. I had never seen a nurse uniform filled up before. <br /> <br /> Ms. Andress appears as a nurse employed to care for a rich older man. It seems that even one at home knocks on shoes. One night the nurse decides to take the temperature of her grandson and give her some needed T.L.C. to her ancient client. The old man approaches his nurse and annoys the rest of the family. What job did her family order? Will the geezer fall on the car supplier? How can she deal with the octopus cron and the rest of the family? To find out, you need to find a copy of SENSUOUS NURSE !! Italian, but poorly translated into English. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it.
