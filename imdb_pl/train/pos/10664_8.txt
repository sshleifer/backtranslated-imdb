Does someone else cry with tears of joy when watching this movie? I love it! One of my top 10 films of all time. I just feel good. I am watching the closing production number with all casts over and over again !!! Bebe Benson (Michelle Johnston) is a GIRL movie, IMHO! I've never seen art, but I get nervous when I read reviews that say the game was better than the movie. These two are like apples and oranges. The film making process rarely provides a finished product that is faithful to the original work. I believe that it is only because of the fear of public alienation that many well-known works adapted to the screen do not change more than they are. It's a very good movie, it's very rewarding. That's all you need to know!
