Solino really moved me with his deeply drawn figures. Being a simple story about the rivalry of two brothers, it was not just about hatred or jealousy. What I liked most about the film was how I could identify with the feelings that Gigi was experiencing, especially when he had to take his mother back to his hometown in Italy and not attend the festival awards ceremony in which the film came in . Seeing this character who was so struggling with the artistic dream and the innate sense of duty towards her mother was so frustrating. Even at the end, when he makes another attempt to reach his father, he was so brave. And as in real life, most fathers can never cross their walls to reach their children. I could even identify with Giancarlo, a brother who, being more confident and older brother, had so much uncertainty. A really beautiful movie that made me laugh and cry.
