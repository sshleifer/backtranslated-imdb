When the premiere of Good Times took place in 1974, it was the first series of black comedies. He focused on the poor family of Evans from Chicago and their struggles for ending. Most of the early episodes focused on parents, James and Florida Evans, and their struggle to provide a family. John Amos and Esther Rolle were the best part of the show. They were great actors and they had great chemistry as James and Florida Evans. They had three children: J.J., Thelma and Michael. J.J. he was chasing a skirt, but a well-meaning teenage son who made up for his lack of subtle artistic talent. Thelma was an attractive, bright girl who constantly traded insults with J.J. Michael was a wonderful child who was well educated in social matters and was to become a lawyer. <br /> <br /> In 1976, the producers made a huge mistake by shooting John Amos, literally killing his character. It really changed the purpose, not the good that I could add. The shows began to focus more on J.J. and his Buffoon-like behavior that angered black spectators, as well as Star Esther Rolle, who left the next season. Instead of a series focusing on key Afro-American problems that existed in the society at the time, the viewers received shows that were overloaded with skirts and thick jokes. <br /> <br /> When Esther Rolle left, the quality of the show suffered even more. Although it was still possible to watch, it was no longer a great breakthrough show that was once. <br /> <br /> Although Esther Rolle returned for the 1978 season, it became obvious that the show was on its last legs. All loose ends were connected this season and the show quietly disappeared from the air. <br /> <br /> The first three seasons: A. The last three seasons: C +.
