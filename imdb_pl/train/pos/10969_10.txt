I knew it, but I never saw Gray Gardens before I saw the Broadway musical of the same name. Friends warned me that if I did not see the movie, the musical would not make sense. Yes, but it made me borrow a movie. At first I thought it was a train wreck, full of strange, screaming figures, and it was extremely difficult to watch. But the ability to stop him, digest and return to him made me realize why the Gray Gardens are considered an unforgettable documentary. <br /> <br /> Both Big Edie and Little Edie are unforgettable and their total lack of self-awareness is worth seeing. Both remain beautiful despite their age. They have a relationship that will freeze any woman (and undoubtedly some men) and make you re-examine your relationship with your mother. In an age in which the reality of television and cinema is commonplace, it is fascinating to watch Mayleses' work from thirty years ago and to realize what effect this film had to have. <br /> <br /> I repeat what other posters said: how were they allowed to slip into such misery from their family? But besides, how could two people living in the 1970s escape reality in such a complete way? Or maybe they were just too crazy to help them? I highly recommend watching this with a comment, which gave me an additional insight into the film.
