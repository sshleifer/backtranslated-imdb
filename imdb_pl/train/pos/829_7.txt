I admit, I thought that this movie will not be good, but soon changed my mind. In the film, it was possible to guess in what direction it was heading. Pierce Broson is amazing in his role as a hit man who suddenly burns out and asks the man he met in the Mexican bar for help. Greg Kinnear is an amazing simple man, as his role as a gentle, mannered Denver man who begins an innocent conversation with Pierce at a Mexican bar. The movie will make you laugh, because Pierce provides fun liners (mainly sex). <br /> <br /> The imagination in this movie is very well done, especially on the bullfight scene, and when Pierce sees himself trying to finish his last work.
