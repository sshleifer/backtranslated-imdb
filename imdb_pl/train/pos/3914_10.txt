Personally, I think that the film was made very professionally, I loved choreography and acting. The plot is also thrilling and mysterious. The movie itself is very emotional and I like it the most that makes you think later. Antonio Gades has lived his role to the end and I must say that it is one of my favorite photos, and Saura is a great director.
