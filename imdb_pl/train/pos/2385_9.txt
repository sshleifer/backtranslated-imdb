In an old commercial for empty audio cassettes, the line of tags was: "Is it true or is it Memorex?" The same can be said about the episode of this episode - compilation and remix of "The Cage", the first Star Trek pilot. Mr. Spock cleverly commandeered the ship to take him to the forbidden planet Talos IV to allow Captain Christopher Pike, his first captain, who was burned and paralyzed, to return there. Why finagling? Because contact with Talos IV at all invites you to death. Why this is not happening, it never explained to me - it disturbed me greatly - but if nothing else, it adds to the story. After bringing the ship to Talos IV, Mr. Spock turns to Dr. McCoy (the highest-ranking officer, Captain Kirk was out of the ship) to arrest him and says: "The charge is rebellion, Dr.; I have never received an order to take over a ship. There is a court martial in which - thanks to the Talosians - we find out why Captain Pike was so important (apart from obvious paralysis) to get to Talos IV, even risking the death of Mr. Spock. The illusions that Talosai creates, background music and the whole story are fantastic. And Meg Wyllie as The Keeper (Talosian's head) is wonderful. Call me a sexist, but it never occurred to me to have a woman in this role, but she was perfect! Talosai, having abandoned almost all physical activity and becoming almost completely dependent on the power of illusion, are also unisex; you really can not say whether they are a man or a woman and it really does not matter. This episode, more than almost all of this series, makes me hope and pray that there are other worlds and that there are civilizations that are so advanced! What a cool thing if it were! It's one of my favorite episodes and no matter how many times I've seen it (I even have it on video), it never fascinates me. Meg Wyllie LOOKS as a stranger and I do NOT mean this rude.
