From the very beginning, the film is divided into parts. Eddie seems to simply bring this uniqueness to the stage and makes the most basic thing you can hear from having ice cream as a child to a long, old family tradition. Film is very rare in this country, but there is no certainty about availability in other countries. I searched a lot of websites and I still have no luck, I called companies that are looking for rare films and there are waiting lists for them for a year. YES, TIPS ARE VERY SATISFIED. If someone likes Eddie Murphy as a comedian and sees a movie, he's worth the money and he can not go wrong.
