The only other review of this movie from this day really destroys the stars and the movie itself. I usually like to read user comments to give me an idea of ​​what to expect from a movie I do not know much about. This is unfortunate when there are not too many comments for a given tile, because when there is only one review and unjustifiably destroys the film and cast, you do not know what to expect. I have read the review before watching this title and I do not know where all the venom of this film and stars came from. Douglas and Blondell were very talented and attractive people who usually delivered, even if the material was not the best. I found a movie and performances fun and enjoyable. This is not one of the best classic games of all time, but a pleasant and fun diversion - much more than you would expect in most newer movies. If you're a fan of these stars, you will not be disappointed.
