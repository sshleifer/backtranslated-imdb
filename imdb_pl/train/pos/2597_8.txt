Ulysses as a film should not be compared with a novel in any way, because they are two completely different units. Nevertheless, let's say, the movie still keeps many of the elements that made the book work, but because it's a visual medium, it's harder to draw a stream of consciousness. I think it's the best movie they could do with the material ... and this is from someone who routinely talks about movies that do not resemble their literary counterparts. I recommend a book, but the movie is still fun.
