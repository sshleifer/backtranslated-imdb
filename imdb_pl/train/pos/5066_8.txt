I know that some people think that the movie is boring, but I do not agree. It is a biography of a very complex and extraordinary person. I liked the characters from the movie and I think that leaving part of Archie's life captured his humanity with a mystery. I think that the purpose of a good biography should not be to elaborate on someone else's life, but rather the complexities and relationships that make them interesting. And what is more fascinating than someone who invents such a success? "Men become what they dream about - they dreamed well." Good job for Lord Attenborough. I also wanted to mention that Nathaniel Arcand really stood out as a charismatic actor and I hope to see him in the next films.
