The film did not fall well at the box office. <br /> <br /> I saw this in the preview. <br /> <br /> I've always liked the movie. <br /> <br /> I live in one of the cities mentioned in the movie, where the players went. <br /> <br /> This is not the best movie that has ever been shown on the screen, but it's enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Robin did well with his role. <br /> <br /> The best movie line at the beginning, according to the figure of Robin, Jacek: "I was this SOB!". Cleaned here, not to offend anyone. <br /> <br /> It was happy that a DVD screen on a wide screen / mailbox format appeared a few years ago. <br /> <br /> I am not a footballer fan or a real sports fan. But you do not have to be one to like this movie.
