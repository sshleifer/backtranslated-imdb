This short short topic by Joe McDoakes was of course inspired by the Warner Brothers star, Thank Your Lucky Stars, one of all those stellar morale amplifiers from this period. In this one, Eddie Cantor played both himself and would be a comedian who would like to break into the movies, except for the similarity to Cantor. <br /> <br /> George O'Hanlon, who played McDoakes in shorts, is both himself and McDoakes, who just tries to break the movie. Just like in the case of thanks for lucky stars, several Warner Brothers players signed a contract with a free moment by going through this movie. <br /> <br /> O'Hanlon was sent by a central casting to a small role in a film from World War I, but lookalike McDoakes receives a message. The poor guy is so nervous about his big moment that he starts thinking about ways to deliver one line. Maybe it sounds like a real movie star. <br /> <br /> 86 then goes on to annoy director Ralph Sanford and the patient Clyde Cook, who plays a British cockney soldier who found a niche in the film industry for the poor McDoakes. It's worth to see this very funny short theme that has been nominated for an Oscar to find out what's happening with O'Hanlon / McDoakes. <br /> <br /> Both.
