SPOILERY <br /> <br /> In the words of Jean-Paul Sartre, "Hell is other people." In "The Odd Couple", Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau demonstrate how accurate this can be. As Felix Ungar and Oscar Madison, Lemmon and Matthau form two good friends respectively who decide to live together. As the two begin to get more and more frustrated, the laughter comes quickly and quickly before Felix leaves, leaving the Oscar changed and more purely individual. <br /> <br /> Jack Lemmon as Ungar is absolutely wonderful as a neurotic, cleansing obsession with a divorced man dealing with life as a lonely man. Walter Matthau, unlike Lemmon, is as good as a slovenly sports writer who simply wants to play poker to earn his children's benefits. <br /> <br /> Lemmon and Matthau are great in their chosen parts, for some the degree depends on the beautiful scenario of Neil Simon, and at the same time because they work well as a team. As two friends who are inherently different in their lifestyle, although similar in relationships with former wives and children, these two, late, great actors form a partnership that is virtually impossible to reproduce. So great that the world screamed so much for something similar, that two years before Matthau's death and three years before Lemmon's death, the heroes united in the lower part. This idea, following the annoying obsession of Hollywood about the sequels, could work to some extent, but at the same time would never be able to repeat the genius of this original movie. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, it is not really possible to say anything else. With the amazing scenario of Simon, full of humor and laughter, the creators of this film were already on the hit. The cast of Jacek Lemmon and Walter Matthau as Felix Ungar and Oscar Madison is the most important part of this film. "The Odd Couple", with its traditional soundtrack (which even gained recognition in "The Simpsons"), is an excellent script and genius of leading men, a tribute to cinema and a function to remember through history.
