Before I comment on this movie, you should realize that when I saw this movie, I expected a typical crap, horror film B movie and just wanted to have fun. Jack Frost is one that not only provides, but is one of the best I've seen in a long time. Scott McDonald is great as Jack Frost, in fact I think he has a future in being a psychopath in big movies in time if he ever gets a chance. McDonald is a serial killer who becomes a snowman through a stupid accidental combination of funny elements. As soon as the snowman starts to move and kill people, it will be hard for you not to laugh. The lines you say are completely delayed, but really fun. The fact that the rest of the cast is exaggerating, just adds stupidity to the film, but stupidity is a genius. The scene in which the snowman is with a teenager is truly classic in the B-horror movie. I really hope there is a sequel and I will be there to watch it on any cable channel. Of course, watching the first few times is fun and it's not a good film technology job, but I just like it when the idols kill people. I gave him 7 out of 10, a great movie for dates and couples in late hours.
