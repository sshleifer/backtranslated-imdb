Add Pauli's parrot to the beloved characters of the film animals. This movie is a love story - a bird and Gena Rowlands, a bird and a beloved Marie, Michael and Marie. The Russian caretaker helps the talking and thinking parrot find his rightful owner many years after Marie's parents sell him to the pawnshop. Before completing the warm-up of the heart, we learn all the adventures of Pauli. Cheech Marin and his dancing parrots are wonderful. Beautiful photography throughout. A great little movie, the word in your mouth will make you a favorite cult.
