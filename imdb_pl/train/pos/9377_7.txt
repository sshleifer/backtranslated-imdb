An amazing thriller with more twists and turns than a doodle pad. A great cast mixing with an intriguing plot supervised by the influence of Twin Peaks-ish directed by Dahl. Nicholas Cage is a very underrated actor and shows a great creation of a man in prison who is looking for the right thing. J.T. Walsh (RIP is a great actor) is always a great villain, like Dennis Hopper. It's such a shame that he never reached a higher level in business. I am sure, however, that he has his followers. In conclusion, it's a great movie that shows you do not need big bangs or a commercial soundtrack to be an entertainment movie.
