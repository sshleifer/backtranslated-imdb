I saw this document at the Cannes Film Festival, in a small 200-seat movie theater at the top of the main building at the Cannes Film Festival. <br /> <br /> I absolutely committed myself to it. I love the mix of amazingly created fictional scenes. It's an amazing design. The scenes look as if they were filmed in the 1920s and 1930s. <br /> <br /> And the music is so nice. <br /> <br /> I rate this experience 9/10. <br /> <br /> * forward spoilers * <br /> <br /> The documentary tells about amazing blues, with black and white old scenes of a black man playing the guitar and singing. This is really amazing. But it also mixes up with new bands and maybe one thing I may not like in this movie. It's too abundant to use links to modern rock bands playing these blues songs in a modern way. I really underestimated their wasted way of playing such amazing Blues songs. It's the same undetermined musical taste that I found while watching the Wim Wenders Buena Vista Social Club. <br /> <br /> The document was such a standing ovation at this first show in a small cinema that the next day this documentary was shown to everyone and ordinary tourists on the Croisette beach in the open-air cinema. Although the sand, the quality of the projection and the bad sound quality probably made it a difficult experience to enjoy thousands of people who sat on the sand that night.
