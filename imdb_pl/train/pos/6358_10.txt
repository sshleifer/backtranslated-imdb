I love this movie, but I can not find what's in this movie. People who do not like this movie must be Richard Roeper and Roger Ebert. But I can not believe that Mr. Carrey is behind this makeup. I am sure that most of the actors and actresses in the film have made a film before. A new face appears in the movie. Taylor Momsen, who plays Cindy Lou Who. When they open, Grinch (Jim Carrey) comes out of hiding. And it makes a lot of fun for those who are in Whoville. Sicne know that whoever loves Christmas. While Grinch does not like Christmas. And he even makes fun of the small Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen), who is the daughter of the city postmaster (Bill Irwin). The film was directed by Ron Howard. And the voice of the narrator is performed by Anthony Hopkins. And Jeffrey Tambor (Muppets From Space) is cast as whoville mayor. Who does not like to talk about Grinch near Christmas.
