I do not believe that it was an acting challenge for Richard Harris. It was an uncomplicated plot, but interesting. It's a good movie to watch when you do not want to think a lot, you just want to tell a simple story. The Canadian scenery was breathtaking. Beautiful autumn shots alone made the picture worth seeing.
