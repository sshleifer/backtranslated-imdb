It's a great example of what you can do on a small budget. Acting is great, considering the script, and the whole atmosphere of the film is very sinister. Gore is well done and used sparingly (beware of the excellent death of the barbed wire), and the action is strong when it is used. It is true that sometimes in the scenario appear suspicious lines, but compared to other movies with the same (or greater!) Budget, it is not noticeable at all. In general, this is recommended. Trust me, it's better than it seems! 8/10
