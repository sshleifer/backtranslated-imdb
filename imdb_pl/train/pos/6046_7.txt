I was pleasantly surprised by the movie. Let's face it; the premise does not sound particularly attractive when you have to give money for the night movie, but it has an easy nature that wins. There were no moments in which I was noisy and I doubt what I will remember the next day, but it will not disappoint as a pleasant diversion. The funny thing was that I watched them here in Beijing with my Chinese girlfriend who never understands anything I like. I told her that there was a conspiracy - three guys must bring some weeds to London. He barely satisfies her. There is no attack on the camera that I expected after reading some comments. I take the exception, however, for comparisons with Withnail and I; not in the same league and I doubt if it was intended. www.imperialflags.blogspot.com
