Very good movie. A classic science-fiction movie with humor, action and everything. This movie offers more aliens. We see leaders of the Rebel Alliance and most of the Empire's forces. The Emperor is a somewhat original character. I liked Ewoks representing native savages and Vietnamese. (Excellent references) I loved the Vader and Luke duel, which is the best of the saga. In Return of the Jedi, the epilogue of the first trilogy came to an end, and the Empire finally falls down. I also appreciate the celebration of victory in which he fulfills the redemption of Vader and reinstates the spirit of Anakin Skywalker together with Yoda and Obi-Wan. It gives me sadness and tears. This film includes the greatest scenes in Star Wars: When Vader turns on the Emperor. Luke observes and finds comfort in seeing Obi-Wan, Yoda and ... his father (version from 1997, not Hayden Christenssen). The next best scene is when Luke hurries to attack Darth Vader to protect Leia. There is a deep dark side of the movie, although it has a good ending. I felt that it was much more than at first glance. And as always, John William's music will introduce classicism to the universe of Star Wars.
