What does the Marquis de Sade have to do with Egyptian archeology and the cult of siren worshipers? Tobe Hooper tries to answer this question in one weird little movie. <br /> <br /> Genie is a young cutie who visits her nerdy father of archeology in Alexandria, Egypt. Genie is caught by a mysterious whore (and a glaring lesbian) who supports daddy from the side. Daddy is sent back to the place where he discovers the tomb with what looks like a mermaid. Genie meets the descendants of the Marquis de Sade and falls in love with hunky Egypt (providing the hottest scenes in the film). Eventually, Genie learns that she is to be a victim, and the prolonged and bloody peak ends. Around this story there are Marquis de Sade recordings in prison about what looks like Genie. <br /> <br /> Robert Englund is wonderful as both a marquis and his descendant. His acting skills have always been taken into account by his makeup requirements, so he can shine here. His best performance is still in "Killer Tongue" if you have not seen it yet. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast, including young Genie, is pretty and average. However, the script is problematic. You will quickly learn that marquise scenes are completely unnecessary, unless the creators of the film had access to a nice set. The worship of the sirens, which ultimately saves Genie, makes no sense. Who is a mermaid is never explained, and his relationship with Christianity (which appears throughout the movie) is nothing. The film is very anti-Christian, because the archaeologist is the father gushing the Bible, but he likes to be bound by a local prostitute. There are many scenes of depravity and violence, but Hooper probably had no idea what the screenwriters were trying to say. I know I have no idea. <br /> <br /> Why, then, do I recommend this movie? This is weird. There is an extended sex scene. For ladies, the hunky Egyptian horse rides completely naked. Englund is wonderful. Do you like snakes? This movie is full of them. It's like a Roger Corman with a bigger budget. Knowing that Hooper somehow invented the "Crocodile", it is quite sad. "Night Terrors" is not perfect, but definitely worth a batting, obscene look. <br /> <br /> This is rated (R) for physical violence, some sexual violence, gore, profanity, nudity of women, nudity of men, sexuality of content, sexual references and drug abuse. <br /> <br />
