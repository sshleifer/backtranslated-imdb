There are some great things in this movie. Marion Davies could act, given the right ownership; she's wonderful in comedic roles. William Haines could act and see why he was one of the most popular top people on the screen. (As long as the potential scandal did not force him to leave the business). <br /> <br /> The story is a bit banal, but treated so beautifully that you do not notice. The direction of King Vidor is one of the main reasons. Manufacturer? The genius of the boy, Irving Thalberg. <br /> <br /> It's about making movies and you'll see a process like it did in 1928, Cameras, sets, directors 'directors and actors' emotions. You can see (briefly) some of the main stars of the day; even Charlie Chaplin makes a phrase as himself, looking for an autograph. You can also see glimpses of Eleanor Boardman, Elinor Glyn, Claire Windsor, King Vidor and many others who are just names and old photos. <br /> <br /> Please, even if you are not a fan of silence, take some time to catch this movie whenever you can. It's really a great journey in time.
