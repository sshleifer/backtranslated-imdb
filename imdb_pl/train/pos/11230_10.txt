Hidden Frontier was discussed and reported by several news agencies because of their long commitment to creating the best Star Trek stories and providing an example of community that was Gene Roddenberry's mission. Focusing on homosexuality, depression, war and the acceptance of different races is equal to or higher than those from other Trek series and films. The value of production began as a smaller and uncertain, but in 7 seasons of production the acting improved, the stories are more complex and the visual graphics became smoother and more impressive. In episode 1, Countermeasures 6 of the season, one of the biggest space battles in Trek history takes place. The ships are well made, and the space battles are impressive and exciting. The real attraction for Frontier are not ships or backgrounds, but it's people and the interaction and development of the character. There is also a nod to other Trek series and movies with places and characters that we all know. I recommend every Trek fan to check the remedies and you'll be hooked!
