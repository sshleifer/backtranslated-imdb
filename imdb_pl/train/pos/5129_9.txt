I can see why this film was nominated for an Oscar for the best short live action, because it was constructed masterfully. Even if you do not like Blues (although it sounded more like jazz to me), you can easily appreciate this movie. It is simply very well made, but for me I do not know why the director Gjon Mili only had to make one movie - this one. In other words, the film is nominated, and yet the director has not gained any kind of career. When it comes to black performers, I understand that this does not mean that their careers are changing into high gears, because unfortunately the majority of the white society is indifferent (or worse) to black or "this kind of music". <br /> <br /> If you watch this movie, if you do not like the previous fragment, go straight to around 5:50 - where it increases significantly. When the lady stopped singing and the performers began to improvise, the pace improved enough.
