Although I saw this movie years ago, its influence never left me. The description of Stephen Rei's invetigator is deep and moving. His torment because of his inability to stop death is tangible. Everyone in the cast is awesome from Sutherland, who is trying to put him in and give the police order in their efforts, for anxious citizen x. Every day when we're bombarded with stories of mass murderers, I think about the film and the grueling work that people do when they try find killers.
