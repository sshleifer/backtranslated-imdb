It seemed to me that the whole movie played beautifully with fresh pictures and interesting cinematography. The actors were on the top of their character in an almost perfect moment and they looked great. The music was lush and thoughtful. He even had a decent ending. So what's the vote about all this? The story was not entirely fresh (it seemed to be the remnant of the Running Man with the whole idea for a TV program), but the attitude towards Christianity and Judaism about how the audience chose their Messiah really sounded true. It made sense to follow this one man who had been put in front of a modern crowd and put him on a pedestal because of his abilities. <br /> <br /> It's possible that Christians or other religious people will pick up this because the film has the word "God," but it shows what the filmmakers were trying to do to teach people who may have never seen this world, especially in the modern world in which Christianity was more and more accepted and forgotten by some. <br /> <br /> I gave him 7/10 stars here on IMDb. I thought that every ounce of film is fun and original, for the most part. See if you are too offended to see a funny movie from Madrid in Spain about the possibilities of the upcoming modern Messiah on the TV nearby.
