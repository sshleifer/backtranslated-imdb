I'm really surprised that this movie did not get a higher rating on IMDB. This is one of those movies that can easily get someone, but for the romantic comedy "Moonstruck" is really a class in itself. His surroundings and ethnic charm are things that people seem obvious. The casting itself makes it an almost perfect movie. Few films in the 80s were as good as "Moonstruck" and it's fun too. **** outside *****
