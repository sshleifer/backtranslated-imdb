I have seen this movie many times and I can not understand why some compare it to BABE. This film does not concern the mysterious life of ALL animals that can secretly speak. Instead, it's a parrot who learns to talk to help his owner, a little girl with severe stuttering, overcome the obstacle in speech only to early separate her from her in the heart-rending scene. Then a great journey begins. Paulie the Parrot decides to find her great friend, Marie. <br /> <br /> On the way he meets a few wonderful people and many nasty people. He falls in love with a parrot girl and loses it. He is cheated and then captured by an evil scientist who wants to use him. <br /> <br /> Tells his story to the sympathetic Janitor from the Laboratory, who agrees to help him escape and find his beloved Marie. <br /> <br /> Tony Shaloub shines as a friendly Janitor who has an open mind and a big heart and who decides to help little Pauli despite the risk. Jay Mohr plays Parrot's voice and one of the suspicious characters he meets. <br /> <br /> There is a little suggestive language, but this movie is suitable for most children, and even more so if parents join in the fun and watch too. It's a witty, clever, epic tale about the adventures of animals and ultimately a great love story about the Bird and his little girl. He's looking for Marie, which ends with an unexpected surprise for most people who do not know much about parrots. <br /> <br /> Children who saw the wild tribes of Green Parrot in Los Angeles and Pasadena, will benefit especially from watching this movie and understanding that birds, especially parrots, are not disposable animals. All children around the world will see that pets themselves create deep attachments, and the love and loyalty of a dog or parrot is a gift to be valued. <br /> <br /> so there is no BABE here, more amazing trip with a twist. <br /> <br /> Enjoy and try not to get lost during sad parties.
