DOCTEUR PETIOT with Michel Serrault is a brutal story about a brutal man. A doctor who heals sick people in occupied France, even if their ability to compensate does not exist. However, it hunts the weakest among the population. Images and photos are great and give this macabre story an extra gruesome impression. He is a perfect psychopath. Seductive and altruistic, intelligent and caring, calculating and murderous. A movie that the viewer will not forget soon. Recognition for Mr. Serrault for his chilling portrait.
