With actors like Ralph Richardson, Raymond Massey, Cedrick Hardwicke and Margaretta Scott, how can you go wrong. A very unusual set design, especially contemporary. The implementation of a modern machine park is very effective. Here you have ray blows from construction vehicles that help clean up the area, so you can create new structures. Although she is much younger in this film, it's not difficult to find out who Mrs. Pumphrey will be from the BBC series, All Creatures Great and Small! A really effective "appearance" of Raymond Massey and Ralph Richardson. The music score is a well-known Swiss composer Artur Honegger and is also unusual. For now (1936) it looks like they have used really large sets or effects that make them look like this. Finally, it's a really good story.
