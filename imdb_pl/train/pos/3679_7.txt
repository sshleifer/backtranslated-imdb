I just watched the movie two days ago and I was full of expectations, because Paris is my second favorite city in Europe and I spent there very romantic 18 months in the 80's. I was a bit disappointed that most of this group of vignettes, although original and artistically made, did not capture the "light" and beauty of the city very well. We did not see any of the wooded boulevards ... There was too much darkness, not only literally, but figuratively. Some threads manipulated the viewer that seemed to seem, and let him "drop" (Marais sequence, the sequence of hairstyle vendors to give two examples). Uplifting, good: Mime sequence, cemetery, Montmartre (though it left too much to be understood by the viewer), "Cowboy" and Sacre Coeur vignette - they seemed few and I liked to see such a great actor as Orlando Bloom in something which would show its originality more.
