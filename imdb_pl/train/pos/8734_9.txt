The movie was completely amazing and cool. The graphics were great and amazing, especially since Flik was great and amazing in the movie and he was funny, and he was and at times he was intelligent. Circus errors are colorful and are great in the film. Grasshoppers were also great and cool in the film. Hopper was a clean and perfect villain. Even Dot was lovely. When the bird eats worms, this scene was great and good. Even the last scene was amazing and cool. Even Flik's inventions were good. Building an artificial bird is a good idea for scaring off grasshoppers. When the ants build an artificial bird, this scene was good and nice, I really should appreciate the creators of "A Bug's Life".
