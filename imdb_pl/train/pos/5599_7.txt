This was my second time watching the movie (in the French version, unlike the first one, which was dubbed in Italian) and I feel that it improves in subsequent scenes. <br /> <br /> An attractive, if slowly built study of a figure that is beautifully made, and the Parisian settings are equally impressive. In the long run, this is not Polański's highest rank, and I would rank it in the 9th position in my filmography, but it is still a mixture of subtle thrills and, surprisingly, often a wide comedy. He also has a great cast, all of whom are in good shape, but especially Isabelle Adjani, Melvyn Douglas and Jo Van Fleet. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I am a bit surprised by Trelkovsky's sudden pressure to "change" to the previous tenant; in addition to the café owner opposite the apartment building, where he receives everything Simone used to have, without asking him if he wished for something else, there is little indication (as far as I could see it) that this is what everyone wanted him! Okay, so he found Simone's things that were still in the apartment, but what exactly prompted him to wear her dresses and become her (even if he apparently started doing it unconsciously)? After his horrible visions in the bathroom, the last part of the movie (where Adjani disappears) is almost anti-climatic - especially the scene where the owner and other tenants are witnessing his suicide attempt, as if it was the night at the Opera, a concept that was already used 46 years earlier by Jean Cocteau in THE BLOOD OF A POET (1930)! <br /> <br /> The ending is both predictable and unresolved: what made both inhabitants of this particular apartment jump out the window ?! I remember this factor that tormented me during the first watch, and I am sorry to say that it is not brighter now! Remember that the first two thirds of the film are quite solid, but I would like Polański to be less dependent on unclear plot points.
