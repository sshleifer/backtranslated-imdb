The most accessible film by John Waters is one of his better, considering that he limited all the abundance and even vulgarity, which seems to clutter up most of his previous works. Sure, nudity and sexual references are still there, at least it is presented in a <br /> <br /> way, which can not be considered too disgusting or disgusting. Due to some great choices to be cast, this film really drew the stupidity associated with contemporary art and the subjective nature of the contemporary artist. Fun and slightly light (if it's possible for Waters), this is one of those movies that I watched on a rainy day.
