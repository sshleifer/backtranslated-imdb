Why did not Dynamo have pants ?! Where did they go?? It has never been explained. That's why this movie was so amazing. Plus Starsky gave his children AIDS !!!! It works great too. Richard Dawson deserved the award for the best supporting actor! A I D S My favorite line from the movie was "It hit the spot" A AND D S. This movie was for "birds". I tried to give this film a "stinkeye", but I continued the game. What am I doing wrong ??? !!!! I thought "HATEBOAT" was funnnny lol;) I would like it to be a performance. Why did not Dynamo wear pants? I know his arm was curved, but ... What's going on in these crazy networks? Why did the Feud family from the Ray Combs family not get a network? He could use one. AIDSSSSS
