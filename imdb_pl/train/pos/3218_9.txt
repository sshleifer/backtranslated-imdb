Nine in ten may seem like a high mark for a sci-fi film straight from a film that has been slandered in the US box office and criticized as the poorest film about Kurt Russell's career. <br /> <br /> I have my reasons. <br /> <br /> First of all, when you read the negative reviews of this film, they usually start with the wooden nature of Russell's interpretation of Todd, the title Soldier. I will start here as well, with my surprising statement that this is probably the best piece of acting that I saw when Russell withdrew. Todd is an emotional cripple and suffers from intense PTSD - this movie written before the phenomenon was as widely recognized as it is now. <br /> <br /> The portrait is in place. Todd is withdrawn, uncommunicative and lonely. He suffers from irrational anxiety - he is taught a fever by training, which teaches him to analyze every movement and interaction with another human being in search of signs of betrayal and danger. His hyper-focusing brings with it the inability to understand the larger continuum that the task he gets to sit inside - is the scene where he cuts himself off by cutting carrots and continues without worrying about cleansing cuts or blood. Many interpret it as a sign of their physical endurance and focus on the job they do, but it is also a sign that they simply do the memorizing task - not understanding the relationship between the vegetables he prepares and the food that will be eaten later. <br /> <br /> Todd's dialogue is at least Spartan - two large scenes that move, are crucial to the plot of the film and both emphasize the gloomy nature of its existence. We were told that fear and discipline. Always. Fear that you will pump him into hyperactivity, in which the smallest detail will not pass him, keeping him ready to respond to the knife's edge. Discipline to keep him in check thanks to fear to defeat him and play tactically. The conclusion is that there is no time to think and can not afford to feel. Many viewers have different interpretations of his reaction to Sandra Nielsen's grasp - but I believe that you have to interpret it from the perspective of a man who only experiences a grip in a fight - shaking means that he suppresses the instincts of struggle / flight to the fear of being struggled, his movement and vision limited - Really fear and discipline. <br /> <br /> Then there is the subtext of his abandonment (twice in reality) - such a representative for our society of walkers on the rubbish heap of society, when they served their conditions. 40% of the unemployed are former military in OUR world, in HIS it can only get worse. Russell quickly takes over Mace's responsibility for his wife and child - he desperately needs a mission, even one with a high probability of his death. <br /> <br /> Then there is a military subtext - a conflict between the Buseya church and a hotspot from HQ, Mekum. The new Mekum men are faster, stronger, more accurate and more aggressive. Each of them could drive Todd into the ground - but it's not about the tools you have, but how you use them. Encouraged by Todd, who could freely pursue his initiative and act without the anesthetic effect of perceived supremacy, he uses tactics of ambush and tricky tricks to break through a newer unit - sent without support, cover or reconnaissance. It is a reminder that military might can not compensate for failure in leadership. <br /> <br /> There are many other subtle topics. When the film is filmed and written so minimal, it leaves plenty of space for its own interpretations. Observe the Soldier with an open mind and see what he will teach you.
