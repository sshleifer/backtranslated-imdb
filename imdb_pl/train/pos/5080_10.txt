When the film is produced or directed by Mel Ferrer, you can bet your life, each photo will be visible for a generation. Only the appearance of Claudette Colbert, (Ellen R. Ewing), "The Egg & I", "47" and the appearance in the film will make it an even more wonderful classic film. In this movie, Ellen Ewing gets married and then encounters various kinds of mental problems and even murders. The mystery gets very involved, and Robert Ryan (David McLean), "Battle of the Bulge", 65, comes to Ellen's help, and sometimes you even wonder if David is up and up. When you see this picture, you start to understand who the real damn person is and suddenly you start to change your mind about the end of the movie. The great acting of Claudette Colbert and Robert Ryan, who played a completely different role than usual on the screen. I forgot to mention that Mel Ferrer was married to the big movie star Audrey Hepburn. A great classic movie with great classic actors!
