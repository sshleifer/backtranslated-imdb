Do you like to solve secrets? Do you like complex narrations? This is for you. A brilliant, clever film by Francis Leclerc (son of the legendary French Canadian signer Felix Leclerc). A brilliant photo and clever edition is the word Leclerca, strongly supported by Roy Dupuis, who is the conductor in the main role. <br /> <br /> The plot tells the story of Alexandre Tourneur, a veterinarian in his forties who has just woken up disconnected from someone unknown. Tourneur tries to remember who hit him when he was ending the deer's suffering on the road. He has a strange behavior during the fight and it seems that something has taken over. <br /> <br /> Not a scary, but very mysterious and well-played movie. I have a hypothesis about termination (I think the Indian caused an accident), but this ending was open to any explanation. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend 9.5 / 10
