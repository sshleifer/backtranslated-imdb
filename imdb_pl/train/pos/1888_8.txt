"If I wanted to dribble, I would call the nurse." <br /> <br /> "You're not fed up?" ... "More than enough." <br /> <br /> "You got me choo." <br /> <br /> "If I start dying, remove (cowboy hat) my head. This is not the way I want to be remembered." <br /> <br /> Some of the wonderfully humorous and often insightful quotes from of this charming and often insightful film, Dudley Moore is charming, lovable and rich, Sir John Gielgud is aristocratic, charming and loving ... and poor, both have a relationship that is not a father / father and a son who defines the man who is going to become Arthur, will he follow his heart and soul, or simply his wealth? In twenty-five years I have returned to this film with joy, amusement and joy, a film that we come back to, time after time, and remember what is important in life, as short as it is. <br /> <br /> Judge Miller
