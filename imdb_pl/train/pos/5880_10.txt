in contrast to the person mentioned above, I felt that this movie was really funny, especially in scenes where there is a lot of confusion. I do not want to give the plot and story to people who have not seen it yet, but I will say that Paresh Rawal does not have such a broader role as Priyadarshan's old films, for example Hera Pheri and Hungam. Paresh Rawal has an amazing role in the role he was entrusted with, John Abraham does equally well, Akshay Kumar proved that there is no less in this film, as in the case of Waqt and almost all his films after Andaaz. Although all three heroins in this movie were on their debut, they did quite a good job, especially Nargis, who is very handsome and hot. I would say that if you like Hungama or Hera Pheri, this movie is compulsory.
