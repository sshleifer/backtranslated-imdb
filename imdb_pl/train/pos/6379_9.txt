The film "Atlantis: The Lost Empire" is a shining jewel in the ruins of films recently produced by Disney Studios. Parents who had to sit in the "book of the jungle 2" or even in the movie Pokemon, will certainly appreciate this film. <br /> <br /> The film is one of the few who try the original story; previous feature films were only a repetition of existing stories. Films such as "Toy Story", "Finding Nemo" and "Monsters Inc." all do the same, but it should be noted that they were all made by Pixar and distributed only by Disney. The latest films from Disney Studios are mostly released directly on video and are a continuation of a successful movie. The quality of these films gave way to profitability. The new era began with "Atlantis" after "Mulan", "Lilo and Stitch", and more recently "Open Range". The writers created all the original feature lines instead of the tales from the past. <br /> <br /> A large part of the movie is devoted to the search for Atlantis, a task that captured the imagination of many people for hundreds of years. Including this young Milo Thatch whose voice was expressed by Michael J. Fox. Milo is employed at a museum in Washington. His grandfather was a famous archaeologist who dedicated his life to discovering Atlantis. His peers perceive it as a loss and wish Milo not follow his footsteps. After an unsuccessful attempt to convince the Museum's board of directors to sponsor the trip, Milo returns home to find a woman in his darkened apartment. He takes him to his employer, Mr. Whitmore. Whitmore was a close friend of grandfather Milo and wants to send Milo and his team to locate Atlantis. Mr. Whitmore is very rich and paid for all the best. The crew to accompany him is the same as his grandparents. The journey is full of many great obstacles to overcome and is a great fun to watch. The viewer is in a trap if he reaches Atlantis. The plot takes an unexpected turn after the discovery of Atlantis, and not just the discovery of people. It's enough to keep the interest of an older audience. <br /> <br /> The animators have done a great job in the depths of the animation. The film successfully combines traditional animation with computer images. This is not easy to achieve, most viewers quickly notice the difference. The characters are credibly human. There are several nice chase scenes with lots of actions. A few downtimes are filled with jokes that children simply can not get. <br /> <br /> Creativity of writers really shines through. The culture of Atlantis is richly developed, including the entire language. The film uses references to Atlantis from historical sources such as Plato. The disappearance of Atlantis from the world is explained. Probably by the younger audience, this magic really exists. The power of the people of Atlantis is not accurately portrayed as magic, but it is best described in this way. <br /> <br /> Although it was established in 1914, the level of technology is unrealistic. The journey takes place in a submarine, very similar to the nautilus of Captain Nemo, along with sub-pods that fire torpedoes. Giant excavators are powered by steam boilers, so they tried to use some technology. Women's characters are strengthened in a way that women of this age would not be, even acting as leaders. This is not a bad thing. It gives a good role model for my daughter and not for all men. <br /> <br /> One of the reasons why this movie is my favorite movie about other Disney movies is that there is not one song, always. The tradition, which began with the first feature film "Snow White" and continued to "The Lion King", almost every Disney movie is full of optimistic songs. This is great, and what would the Seven Dwarfs be without "Hello HO!"? After a millionth of time, it would be better without it, but it saves the parent. Not every person on the screen suddenly knows the words to a song that no one has ever heard before and explode in the song. I am grateful for that. <br /> <br /> The plot and depth of animation will certainly draw the attention of both parents and children. It's a movie that I like to watch with children.
