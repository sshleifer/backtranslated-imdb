The family (mother-Patricia Clarkson, father-Jake Weber, son-Erik Per Sullivan) go out to the family to meet in some distant home in the middle of winter. They accidentally hit a deer while driving. This is the anger of some locals - especially Otis (John Speredakos) and things slowly (VERY slow) goes wrong. <br /> <br /> I was expecting the worst when I started to watch it. Most of the reviews on this subject on this site are very negative. Well ... I do not agree. First of all, this is NOT a horror story. Horror does not even begin until the end of 30 minutes. The game is more like a family drama with thrown in horror elements. At this level, it's damn good. <br /> <br /> First - bad things: the pace is too slow; Jake Weber is a terrible actor; A WAY OF too many terrifying sequences of false dreams; Wendigo barely appears in the film, and the bright view we get at the end is fun. <br /> <br /> Good stuff: A pretty good dramatic scenario; Clarkson is perfect as a mother; some great direction with amazing sound effects that are a bit scary; quite a clear sequence of hot sex between Clarkson and Weber (which is really necessary for the integrity of the plot!); Sullivan works very well (only 10 at the time!) and Speredakos and a completely unexpected tragic ending. <br /> <br /> I think that many people are annoyed with this movie because it is pushed as a horror movie - which it is not. So if you can ignore it, I think you'll like it. I give it 7.
