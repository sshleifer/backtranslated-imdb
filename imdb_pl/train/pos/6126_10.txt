I saw Jack Frost at 4:00 in my local store and thought it looked pretty good for a low-budget movie, so I bought it and I was right that it was good. For starters, this movie is about a deadly idol, so it's something to laugh at and the way it looks like was fun compared to Snowman on the cover. <br /> <br /> Acting was okay, and the lines Jack Frost said made me laugh: "I just accused you of smoke" and "The most dizzying snow cone", how funny and campy? The story at the beginning was also quite funny and stupid - Jack was agile, Jack was fast, Jack picked his eyes with candlesticks. If you're looking for a B-Movie comedy horror movie that's full of punks, check out Jack Frost. 10/10
