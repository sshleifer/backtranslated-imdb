This movie really woke me up, as if he woke up the main male hero of this boldly different movie from his dream. <br /> <br /> This guy John (Ben Chaplin) leads his average safe life of a banker into a small provincial English town, until a stunningly beautiful, wild girl to die for Nadia (Nicole Kidman), ordered by e-mail from Russia, he comes to life to become his beloved wife, according to Johns' plan. However, there is a fault - Nadia does not say a word in English. Although outside is calm and emotionless, John is so interested in beautiful Nadia that instead of using a full refund policy for a suitable service, he buys her dictionary to start the communication process. <br /> <br /> What's going to happen in the story right now really shakes poor John from his sleepy decent security officer to make a decent decision, a decent form of action, giving the viewer a subliminal message "you'd probably do the same." <br /> <br /> Kidman, Cassel and Kassovitz form a great team playing the Russians and are almost indistinguishable from the real, "almost" only because of a light accent in the Russian dialogues, although small enough to amaze the native Russian with hard work make the words sound correct. Nicole Kidman once again proves his talent, playing a character completely different from previous roles, at least from the cultural point of view. <br /> <br /> The pace of the movie is fast and addictive, and you're definitely not ready to stop watching when the end titles appear, you rather feel like you are in the middle of the story and you are happy to see the sequel as soon as it comes out. <br /> <br /> My advice is to get out and pick up this movie immediately, watch it and enjoy it. In summary, it has an extraordinary plot, great acting and ideas under the surface. Like the idea of ​​"naughty awakening" from the artificial safe routine life of the wheel in the Society machine, the lives that Fight Club members so willingly left and the machine that Pink Floyd sings ("Welcome to the machine!"). I bet John finally was not with Sophia on the way to the unknown before he met her at all. <br /> <br /> I thank the writers for a great story and everything else for this great movie! Make a sequel! And you can do it anywhere and give the name of the location, because the authenticity of this place is irrelevant to 99.9999 percent of potential viewers, I'm sure.
