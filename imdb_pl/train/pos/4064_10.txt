I have never met a single person (out of hundreds) who hated the movie. Bet that anyone who gives it back is a small saboteur or victim of one. This movie has everything. Ask yourself, "Are you a fan ...?" Then go to "Laputa". <br /> <br /> This is not my favorite movie, but my favorite is directed by the same person (Hayao Miyazaki). In any case, this one belongs to my five. And I saw a lot of movies.
