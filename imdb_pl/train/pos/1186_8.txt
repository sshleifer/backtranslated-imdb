Much is being said about "psychological westerns", but it is one of the few that is really in this genre. He has big stars that play very well, but the director makes it such a good movie. Stewart Granger loses his British stereotype of a safari hunter to play a skinny retired buffalo hunter who is worshiped in the West as one of the best. Robert Taylor plays in the foreground (unlike the usual young beginner, Taylor's character is also middle-aged) who wants to kill buffalo and entices Granger in business with him. They employ two other great actors, Lloyd Nolan and Russ Tamblyn, to be their skinners. Granger is haunted by the buffalo he killed, knowing that he could be guilty if they die, knowing that if they die, the Indian way of life will suffer a lot. Taylor soon reveals a sadistic side, but it is a realistic novel, unlike the one-dimensional sadists of contemporary film, created by suckers and dork√≥w. He is uncertain and needs human company. Nevertheless, he will not stop murdering. The end bumps into each other with a startling conclusion. The psychological effects of what they do are well presented.
