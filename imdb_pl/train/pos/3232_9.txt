I went to see this Finnish movie and I have to say it is one of the best movies I've seen this year. The intrigue consists of 5-6 different stories that take place the same day in a small Finnish city. The stories end very nicely, perhaps reminiscent of the way Tarantino films are made. Most of the actors played very well, which is certainly needed in realistic drama of this type. I especially liked the acting of Sanna Hietala, the main actress and Juha Kukkonen. I noticed that IMDB has incorrect information about Sannie. Her name, as you probably noticed in my review;), is NOT Heikkil√§, but Hietala.
