By the end of the first hour, my jaw was lying comfortably between my feet. Film never, and I mean never, does not give up acting. It can be a gentle action, but this action. Once again, each cast member fits perfectly. The explosions were realistic, the chase scenes were possible, and the fights were amazing. Matt Damon will always remain Jason Bourne. <br /> <br /> I just have to say that every Bourne movie gets better and that's no exception. Action, rates, story. If they do, I will never know. I applaud to the man who wrote this screen for each of these films. Because if he had not done such great work with the first film, we would not have had that to say. <br /> <br /> So do not go see it in cinemas, experience it in cinemas if it's still there where you live, but if not December 11, Bourne returns home to you!
