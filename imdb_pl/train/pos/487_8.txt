A film about outstanding splendor and overwhelming and unusual love story, Luzhin Defense shows an intense train between an eccentric genius and a woman of beauty, depth and character. <br /> <br /> This gives John Turturro what is probably his best role so far (thank God they did not give him Ralph Fiennes who would murder him). Similarly, Emily Watson shows the wealth of her experience (from the excellent background on stage). In order to reach a tortured chess master (Turturro), her character must show intelligence and love of a woman. Watson does not represent the sexuality of beauty, but he brings her parts of self-awareness, which is appealing. <br /> <br /> During the accidental meeting of Natalia (Watson) and Luzhina, she casually stops him from losing a piece of chess, which fell into the hole in his clothing - a specially crafted piece, which, as we realize from the later film, symbolizes his hopes and aspirations. Later, when their affair unfolds, he subtly compares the dance to chess (Luzhin learned to dance but never with a partner); he encourages him to lead her with "bold, brilliant movements", and by doing so, allows him to relax enough to later play at his best (and also realize that she is her lover). <br /> <br /> This is a story about a woman who inspires a man to his greatest achievements, and by doing so, he finds his deepest emotional and intellectual fulfillment (or so we believe - certainly, within a time frame, Natalia is rather a liberated woman than someone who becomes a stereotype wife and mother). <br /> <br /> Italian sets are stunning. The complexity of the heroes and the skill with which the dialogue develops them is a delight for the intelligent film viewer, but the film is available enough to become a popular mainstream hit and deservedly so. Chess is just a photogenic background to create an emotional and emotional movie, although the game is treated with enough respect to almost convince the chess player that there were characters. Although the tragedy of unusual heights by a classic author, the final solution is unexpectedly uplifting.
