It is necessary to change the perspective to enjoy contemporary British films that somehow allow them to be perceived in their own right and for their own characteristics, not according to the criteria assessed by American films. Britfilm has to try hard to be hard and it's hard for him to do it, but in the warm British movies he can control his otherwise overwhelming competitor. <br /> <br /> This movie fails not in the content, but only in joining the predecessor, so that everything is easily perceived as the work of the star and director somewhere near the end of their tether. It's a few decades later, Grzegorz teaches, and this time with two girls on his head. He teaches abduction at school against violations of human rights. When students who have fired, find abuses among them, they have to face it or simply talk. <br /> <br /> This is a subversive movie in which there is no ordinary world form of any American movie you expect to do it, but a naive boy who can still put everything in line with the rules. Maybe. Certainly, it is not the number of protests because it is too warm. Where the US film may seem realistic, because it is urban and grainy, this and other British films from recent years - those that do not try to match America for sensitive emotions - are true because British humor reveals the truth.
