*** 1/2 Scarlett Johansson, Woody Allen, Hugh Jackman, Ian McShane, Romola Garia. Directed by Woody Allen. Immediately after working with Johansson in "Match Point" two returns to "Scoop" and Corky, a funny and funny comic ride. When the student reporter (Johansson) discovers a new measure from the deceased reporter (McShane) when he enters the lame magician (Allen). A scoop of the new Tarot Card killer in London, which can be preppy Peter Lyman (Jackman); while Sondra and Sid play detective, Sondra falls in love with a handsome assassin. Allen has finally achieved the goal, not as good as "Match Point", but definitely more fun. I laughed a lot more than I expected, one of the years must see
