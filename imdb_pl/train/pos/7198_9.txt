It's a really good movie that I liked watching a few times. Michael Caine is amazing as always. Michael Caine gained the reputation of someone who plays any role in any movie, regardless of quality or the lack of the same, but makes a good turn in playing Sidney. From the very beginning it is so well written. Who would have thought that Ira Levin, who wrote such frightening things as The Boys from Brazil and Rosemary's Baby, could write something so witty. Let's face it - Michael Caine, Chris Reeve, Dyan Cannon, Henry Jones ... how are you going to go wrong with the cast of this good directed by Sidney Lumet. <br /> <br /> I really do not want to go because if anyone were to convey something about this movie, it would be a crime. Just watch it and adore it.
