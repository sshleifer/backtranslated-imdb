WHO WAS GOLD? is (unfortunately) the last of the HANZO THE RAZOR movies, in which Shintaro Katsu is the title character - a multi-disciplined, efficient officer samurai officer with a "unique" technique of raping confessions from unwilling women informers until "beans" spread and I beg for more .. . <br /> <br /> This entry begins with Hanzo "revealing" a woman who poses as a ghost to guard a lake filled with bamboo trunks filled with gold stolen from the treasury. This leads to the fact that Hanzo discovers a scheme of borrowing money and a ring of orgy led by a blind monk. Fencing and rape / interrogation are required - finishing in a decent end to this strange trilogy of films. <br /> <br /> Not as strong and pleasant as THE SNARE (part 2 of the series ...), but still great for fans of samurai sleaze and Japanese pinky movies. 8/10
