Although jerker tear is definitely a movie "feel good". All the actors were great, and Will Smith always does his job and does it well. I could go on, but choose ten out of the "10" ratings and they said it as well and probably better than me. <br /> <br /> BUT, because I have to put at least 10 lines to post a comment, I will say that Rosario Dawson was largely unknown to me as a viewer. Her performance was the most successful and I can not wait to see her performance in many movies that will come. <br /> <br /> And this movie shows that Will Smith has nothing more to prove in terms of his ability as an actor.
