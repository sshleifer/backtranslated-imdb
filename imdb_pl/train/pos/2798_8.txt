Jess is 18 years old, he is very smart and wants nothing more than to play football. When he joins the local team, he has to lie to his parents time and again, because they would never agree to pursue their dreams, want a nice Indian boy to settle in and learn how to cook. <br /> <br /> Bend as Beckham is a very funny, good movie, which does not have to be deep and complex, it is as it is. The cast is very good and they play their roles very well, the story is simple and predictable, but it works perfectly, and the scenario is very realistic and very funny. <br /> <br /> A great family movie 8/10
