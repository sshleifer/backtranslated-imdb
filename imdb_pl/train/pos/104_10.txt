This movie had an interesting cast, he did not have a cast of the list, but the actors who were in this movie did a good job. I'm glad that we have class b movies like this one, the story is basic, the actors are basic, and the way they are implemented is that you do not need a million dollar budget to make a movie with just a mix of ordinary actors and a basic story. I like the way they had a street for themselves and there was no one else nearby, and what's interesting was that they did not shut down the cafeteria to set up the equipment and that they did it all from the police station. Arnold Vosloo and Michael Madsen did a great job of portraying roles in a hostage situation. It was a great movie and I hope to see it in the near future.
