When I started watching the program, I said, "Oh, no! It's as simple as Elfen Lied and not even so bloody! " And indeed, the configuration is almost identical: a lonely young boy lives alone in a big house, and then suddenly engages in a fantastic adventure, while sexy young girls live with him. <br /> <br /> But where does the similarity end. The love story is almost as subtle and intense as the one in Inuiyasha, while children's remarks and behaviors are very few. The magical configuration is a bit banal, because there are about seven people, with seven servants fighting for the Holy Grail, all servants are famous, half of all masters come from the same school, engagement rules etc. However, it soon eclipses and disappears from the beauty of the drawing and the script. <br /> <br /> Actually, I watched all 24 episodes in one day and, not comparing it with animas, which I liked more, but were from other genres, I must say that I was very happy.
