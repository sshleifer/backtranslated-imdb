Usually "children" films have some annoying trait that makes them too unbearable and unbearable for someone who turns 13. Of course, it has the same moments that often give the children's film the aforementioned quality, but this film does well well away from such conventions. Acting was decent, and the restless dynamics that Stanley had with some of the other campers was more realistic than what most movies are trying to portray. What I particularly liked about this movie is the fact that this movie did not try to break your heart or make you cry. Emotional strength was a little more natural than most imagined, similar to Shawshank's Redemption in many ways (which also has a similar redemptive ending). The only drawback? Lizards that look like hokey. Overall, however, 8/10.
