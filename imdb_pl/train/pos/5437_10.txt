Pandro S. Berman was "responsible for production", but it made him the so-called producer of the line. But who produced this epic, filmed not in Arizona, but in the California Mohave desert, where scavengers escaped with the remnants of the "golden temple", Thuggee cottages, the British institution in Muri, Tantrapur villages, etc. minor technical mistakes can and must be forgiven. The lack of an Oscar for the best music is unforgivable, although the Academy may not have offered it at the time. A single theme was played at various tempos, including the waltz, the march and the sweet mood. Excellent! One of the interesting aspects of production was the need of Kipling's widow. The actor playing Kipling appears shortly before and after the battle scenes. In the first edition, his scenes were reduced in accordance with the requirements of Mrs. Kipling. Later they were included and gave the "connection" of the immortal poem Kipling with the screenplay by Ben Hecht. Interestingly, this very typical and pro-British story was written by a great screenwriter who hated the British himself.
