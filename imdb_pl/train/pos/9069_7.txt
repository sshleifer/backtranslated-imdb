If you like movies about school hustlers, brave kids, happy kids and eating worms, then How to Eat Fried Worms you'll like. <br /> <br /> The film is about a boy named Billy who, after arriving on the first day at a new school, discovers that some of his classmates chose him a joke by putting worms in for lunch. The school tyrant, Joe and his "team" of friends, begin to tease Billy and call him a "worm". <br /> <br /> Billy decides to play together saying that he "eats worms all the time". Joe and his friends do not believe him, but Billy assures them, and he tells Joe that he can eat ten worms in one day, otherwise he'll come to school with worms in his trousers. <br /> <br /> The boys took Billy to his bet, leaving the weak child with a mission to gain the respect of his classmates by eating cooked, fried or live worms. <br /> <br /> The movie may sound disgusting, but there is a lot of news in it. First of all, it presents true friendship and how to accept people for who they are. It also shows why some attackers resort to bullying other children. <br /> <br /> The hero of the film, Billy, is a strong and brave man that anyone can relate to. It's easy to sympathize with him because we silently support him to achieve his goal, even if we do not always agree with what he does or with the choices he makes. <br /> <br /> Children in the film are portrayed exactly how children are in real life, and the movie deserves it. Children's actors are the stars of this series, showing real emotions and feelings than the films of most other children. <br /> <br /> Some adults may not like this movie, but children will, maybe even teenagers. <br /> <br /> At the moment there are almost no other good movies, so if you do not feel like snakes on the plane, try the worms on the plate at How to Eat Fried Worms. This is a good movie for children, not just Fear Factor.
