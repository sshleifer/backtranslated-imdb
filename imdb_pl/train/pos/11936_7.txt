I really liked this movie as a young kid. At this age, I thought that stupid baseball antics were funny and that the movie was "cool" because of sport. Now, a few years later, I can look back and see what a well-designed movie is. This movie opened my eyes as a small child to struggle other children with real problems. This type of exhibition is currently missing in films for children, which I think are not beneficial to our society. Sure baseball antics seem really stupid, but they attracted children. No seven-year-old will ask you to watch a film about foster children, but he will ask you to watch a baseball movie. Disney realized this fact and used it to teach these children an important lesson about the world. <br /> <br /> As a young adult performance of Al and other angels seems to be much less impressive, but I will give him credit for actors playing both children and Danny Glover, who have done a fantastic job.
