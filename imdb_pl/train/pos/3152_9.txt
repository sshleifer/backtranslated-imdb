This performance was absolutely great and I always look forward to seeing it. All characters were fun and amazing in their own way, each episode provided constant laughter and was completely funny and different from many other shows. Everyone was just crazy and incredibly funny that you could not handle this show. There were a few episodes, but in the '70s it was always possible to create a nice atmosphere, to which it really just was one of the best programs ever to be broadcast, and I will watch this program anytime, because I never get old , it never becomes unpleasant and never becomes uninteresting.
