Robert Duvall is a direct descendant of Confederate General Robert E. Lee, according to the IMDb.com movie database. After watching this video, you may think that the Duvall look is the reincarnation at its best. One of my favorite movies. I would like the composer, Peter Rodgers Melnick, to have a CD or soundtrack available. Great landscapes and music and "too faithful to life", especially for those of us who live or have moved south. It's a "real moment in time". Life goes on slowly, but "strangers we do not remain."
