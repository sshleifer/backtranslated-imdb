IF ANYONE IS INTERESTED TO MAKE COPIES OF THIS FILM, PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING DETAILS: The first CBS television program of November 30, 2003, TV Finding John Christmas is the continuation of the previous edition of A Town Without Christmas, with Peter Falk again reborn as a versatile guardian angel Max . Valerie Bertinelli stars as Kathleen McAllister, a divorced nurse from a small town whose depression ... due to the fact that her hospital emergency department may be forced to close due to a debt of $ 100,000, is abolished briefly when she sees a photo newspapers made by photojournalist Noah Greeley (David Cubitt). The painting shows the act of courage performed by the firefighter brother of Noah, Hanka (William Russ), who mysteriously left the city 25 years ago and has not been seen since. Hank would like to calmly retreat into the city without explanation and fanfare, but this proves impossible when the Noah newspaper announces a $ 50,000 prize to identify Hank, known publicly as "John Christmas." And there is something, very, very interesting of this photo: it also shows the Santa Claus suit, which apparently floats in the air without the occupier. This elusive "Santa Claus" is of course the angelic Max, who appears from time to time throughout history in various costumes to solve problems, give advice, link loose plot lines - and even share a musical duet with the talented daughter Kathleen.
