Okay, so Robbie is a little hokey looking at today's standards, and some acting is pretty stilted, and most of the special effects can now be replicated by a bright 12-year-old kid with a decent computer editing program. And do not let me start with the poster. <br /> <br /> This is still a great movie, 40 years after its release. I grew up watching "science fiction" at the local Science Fiction / Adventure Theater on Sunday afternoons, so I saw a lot of SF movies from the 1950s. At a time when most movies were satisfied with hitting someone in a rubber costume and destroying a miniature model of the city, Forbidden Planet has raised the bar and forever showed that you can make a science fiction movie that actually had a storyline. <br /> <br /> I doubt if many SF films created in the 90s will still be considered worth seeing in 2030.
