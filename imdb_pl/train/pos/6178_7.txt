The fifth feature of Mitchell Leisen as a director who shows his versatility, directing the musical after his previous films were heavy dramas. He also plays an episode as a conductor. <br /> <br /> It can be said that it is a movie before the code and nothing similar was created in the USA for some time later (eg Over 30 years). Leisen has made music numbers to be like what viewers will see - without panoramic shots or from the top, Busby Berkeley. What I find funny or interesting is that you never see the audience. <br /> <br /> As others have mentioned, the guys are quite devoid of character, and Jack Oakie and Victor McLaghlan play their normal movie personalities. Gertrude Michael, however, provides a little spark. <br /> <br /> Music numbers are interesting and some good (in particular Rape of the Rhapsody is fun), but the drama is unconvincing and fake - three murders are too numerous and have minimal emotional impact on the characters. Here the movie can be much better.
