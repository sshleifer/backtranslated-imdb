I saw it in an elegant cinema, where the audience is usually white, educated and urban. The show in which I took part was sprinkled by African-Americans, and the difference in audience response between these two groups was a wonderful social commentary on the state of racial relations in this country. Basically, white people were afraid to laugh or laugh nervously at funny pieces - and there are many of them! - because they would be "laughing at the blacks", while the Czarni were silent too, because many could not laugh at themselves against the whites. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, being Asian (and therefore belonging to any group), I had a great time watching this satire of rap culture and its ego / pułapek / values ​​/ pseudo-philosophy. The cast is talented and in great work becomes characters. The songs are too funny to believe. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the best pseudo-documents that will appear, including "A Mighty Wind"
