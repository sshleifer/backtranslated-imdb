It was the first Panahi movie that I saw, I saw it at the Melbourne film festival. I was completely absorbed by the different characters that it creates and how they react differently and behave compared to Australian children, and yet at other levels, like so. I think that if more people could watch such films, they could see people as individuals and avoid racism, which can often be driven by fear of the unknown. There are obviously big political differences between Oz culture and Iranian culture, but I've found that the more subtle differences between the characters who make this movie on the screen are extremely fascinating. The characters that seem special to me are quirks. I found that it makes the characters attractive.
