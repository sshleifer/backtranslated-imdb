Overall, I liked this movie and recommend it to independent movie lovers. <br /> <br /> However, I really want to note the similarities between the parts of this movie and Closer Nichols. One of the scenes in which the figure of Adrian Grenier asks Rosario Dawson about her sex life during his absence, is extremely similar to the scene in Closer, in which the character of Clive Owen interrogates Julia Roberts, although in "Love" behaves less severely and intensively . Also notice that "Anna" is the name of Dawson and Roberts. It can not be a coincidence. Now, Closer is based on the play by Patrick Marber and apparently this movie is loosely based on Arthur Schnitzler's "Reigen", so I'm not sure how the connection was made. <br /> <br /> Everyone has an idea?
