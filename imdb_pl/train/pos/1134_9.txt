The only part that is missing in this film is Shue's role as a daughter who wants to follow her aunt's footsteps as a daily soap star. Otherwise, it would be perfect. 10. <br /> <br /> It looks like every actor liked his parts and took care of his own pleasure as well as the script - I have to wonder if there were some ads. t takes place in parts. It was well manned and there are some classic lines that will stay with you. <br /> <br /> It's a fantastic movie that everyone should see at least once. I would recommend that you do not drink anything that stings to get out of your nose. <br /> <br /> You will definitely want to look carefully at the last scene, "Nurse Nan" has a little secret that she would rather not share with you. <br /> <br /> If you love soaps during the day or you despise them, this movement makes you happy in all the right places.
