I am a huge fan of Stephen King's work, and this film has made me an even bigger fan of King. Pet Sematars is about the Creed family. They have just moved into a new home and look happy. But behind their home there is a cemetery for pets. The new neighbor of The Creed, Jud (played by Fred Gwyne), explains the burial place behind the animal cemetery. This burial place is pure evil. Jud tells Louis Creed that when a man (or other animal) is buried in the cemetery, they will come back to life. The only problem is that when they come back, they are NOT the same person, they are bad. Soon after Jud explains everything about the Seminary for Animals, everything begins to go to hell. I will not explain anymore because I do not want to give out some of the main parts of the movie. The actor who had Pet Sematary was pretty good, but he needed some work. History was one of the main parts of this film, mainly because it was so original and captivating. This film contains many makeup effects that make the movie more amazing and frightening. One of the main reasons why this film sent me shivers was the effect of makeup. There's one character in the movie that's really weird. This character is "Zelda". This particular character appears in the film about three times to be precise. Zelda is sister Rachel Creed, who died years ago, but Rachel still haunts her. For the first time Zelda appears in the film is not terrifying because he does not say anything, but the second time is the worst and, frankly, the second time scares me of the living ****. There is nothing wrong with this film, it's almost perfect. Pet Sematary delivers great horror, pretty good actors, first-class plots and mesmerizing make-up. It's really one of the most-loved horrors of all time. 10 out of 10.
