The Sentinel I hoped would be a good movie and the boy was right. A great story above all from the novel and I thought it was an original story, but I think it was not and it was a very wise story. Michael Douglas in this movie is very good and Keither Sutherland is also, but it is very difficult to ignore it from the role of Jack Bauer in 24, but in the end you do it and it is completely different in The Sentinel than in the 24th another person trying to reject his television role, but failed the exam. Ewa Longeria. She was not very good in the film and did not take place in the whole affair. After watching the movie, I had constant dreams of a Warden and I could not sleep. Overinel Sentinel is a good movie and I recommend it.
