one of the best low-budget movies from Germany! is this the dark side of the new era? if you believe in esotericism, do not watch this movie! it blows out all your positive fantasies. this film shows that beyond the peaceful facade of searching for a spiritual soul lies the world of extreme misdemeanors and terror. I hope that soon there will be a 35 mm copy! Andreas Marschall's first film is just the beginning of a new area in which films are made for a few euros! I'm waiting for the second hit!
