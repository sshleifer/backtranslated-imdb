I love that movie! 10 out of 10 hands! This is damn good! I'm not a movie fan, but I have to tell you that he opened my eyes. Amazing color and fast energy. I was lucky to catch it at the show during Zoinks! The Boston Film Festival, and history has really overwhelmed me from the very beginning. It had many topics and characters for adults, and when it ended, I wanted more. I hope they will do a sequel. That would be cool. My only problem is Melissa Connor's performance as Anyi. UGH! She SUCKS! I saw a lump of wood that has better performance. I do not know what the director thought when he dumped her. But if you ignore it, you can not help but give this movie a big jackpot !!!
