A pop quiz: you are part of modern armed forces during peace during routine maneuvers and found yourself back in time with a chance to change history. What are you doing? If you're a Hollywood studio, you change the Japanese G.I. in G.I. Samurai (aka Timeslip) for the crew of an American aircraft carrier, let them debate the stopping attack on Pearl Harbor for 90 minutes, then return home and hope that no one will remind you that Japan did it first, and more balls in 1979 Sonny Chiba's movie. But in contrast to his Hollywood counterpart The Final Countdown, he sees this premise: thrown 400 years back into Japanese feudal wars, his peaceful soldiers decide that their best hope to regain lies lies in provoking history by trying to change by joining the chief country? cue many of the actions of tanks and helicopters vs samurai, including a very impressive, unrelenting 25-minute battle sequence involving thousands of victims dealing with serious injuries. And yes, there are decapitations. <br /> <br /> Of course, things do not go as planned, and even better firepower does not go as well as thousands of soldiers count. Even before that, the soldiers fall in with those who want to go home, those who want to go to war, and those who want to rape and rob the hell. Impressively directed and surprisingly well thought out, soft rock and country and western songs are sometimes distracting, especially when they contain English lyrics sung by Japanese singers who can not hear words, let alone speak a language, but it is a forgivable defect in surprisingly good science fiction movie. <br /> <br /> British DVD Optimum is a good transfer of an uncut 138-minute version.
