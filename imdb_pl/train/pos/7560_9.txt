Starfucker (who reads Starstruck on my box) was the most amazing movie I've ever seen. I thought it was one of the best movies I've ever seen. So why not 10? Nothing is perfect. Jamie Kennedy proves why he is one of my favorite actors in this very interesting look at the darker side of Hollywood. I forced a few others to watch the movie and everyone agreed it was an outstanding movie.
