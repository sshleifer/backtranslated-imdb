Bette Midler presents her talents and beauty in "Diva Las Vegas". I'm excited that I've recorded it and I can see when I want it. It has what it takes to keep the audience captive. Her voice is as beautiful as ever and will really impress you. The highlight of the show was the song "Stay With Me" from the movie "The Rose" from 1979. You can feel emotions in the song and end up with goose bumps. The show will leave you with the desire to go out and rent a Bette Midler movie or go to the nearest music store and purchase one of Bette Midler's albums.
