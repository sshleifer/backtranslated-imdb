If you want action and adventure in the movie, it would be best to look elsewhere. On the other hand, if it's a lazy day and you want a good movie to suit this mood, check out "The Straight Story." <br /> <br /> Richard Farnsworth puts on a fascinating performance as gentle and gentle Alvin Straight, in this the real story of Alvin's trip on a riding mower in three states to see his distant brother who suffered a stroke. <br /> <br /> Farnsworth is perfect in this role because he travels his long winding road, making friends with strangers and giving away many grandparents' advice on the way. The tale moves as slowly as a riding mower, but somehow it manages to keep the observer waiting for Alvin's next lesson of life. <br /> <br /> Stretch out on the couch, relax and enjoy. This is the only way to watch this very good movie, which in my book has a value of 7/10.
