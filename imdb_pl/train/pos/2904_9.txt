This film is the second immersion of Damian Szifr√≥n in the films after an excellent study of the characters in "El Fondo del Mar". With "Tiempo De Valientes" he creates extremely well-made characters, far from prototypes and unprecedented chemistry. I saw Szifron's talent to present each character in a light manner, but enough to engage us emotionally. His control over them is great, so he brings the film back to a great direction and a perfectly polished script, the characters laugh and cry with real fondness and invite the viewer to join their emotions and evolution on the screen. <Br /> <br /> Spanish takes over the English urban landscape of Buenos Aires at night replacing Hollywood sets, and the premise is as interesting as any other, so we have a bold movie to compete for Hollywood's Machinery. <br /> <br /> But I want you to watch the movie mainly because I've never had to deal with such captivating characters, all of them. It seems that the script fits the actors perfectly and vice versa. I really believe that thanks to such a film Argentina is really ready for the competition.
