For Columbo fans like me, this is an episode of episodes that was the reason why Columbo was so popular and how good he really was. Ruth Gordon has a field day (as always) by playing intelligently intelligent criminal writer Abigail Mitchell. It seems that Abigail calls his nephew to sign the papers that made him her heir. She never survived her niece's death and is convinced that the husband of her late niece (Charles Frank) did this dirty act. Saying more would be unthinkable. Mariette Hartley has a cunning role as Abigail's personal assistant. This episode of Columbo is in itself a class. It's a really well made TV movie. I recommend the most.
