OK Silent movie by Clary Bow from 1927, Spin-off Rain, with Bow playing the half-Hawaiian wild daughter of the local king of pineapple, who falls in love with the staid English engineer Clive Brook. Bow competes with the local widow (Arlette Marchal) for his attention, but both women are surprised when his wife (Patricia Dupont) appears. The predatory wife is ready for a divorce until she finds out she can be on the brink of a fortune. Bow quickly sets up his hash. <br /> <br /> Bow has a personality to lose and has some great scenes: her nude bath naked, hula in a skirt on the grass and a rescue scene for dogs with Bow and Brook doing their own acrobatics. <br /> <br /> Note: the IMDb loan list is incorrect. In the movies (from the DVD I have) I mention Patricia Dupont as Mrs. Haldane --- and not Margaret Truax mentioned on IMDb.
