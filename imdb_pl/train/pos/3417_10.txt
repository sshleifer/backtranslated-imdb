Before I saw it, I was discouraged about the topic, but this is not your average triumph over the history of adversity. Although technically it is about blind Tibetan children climbing Mt. Everest, there is much more. This film shows very strong, often contradictory personalities of two outstanding blind adults leading children, Erika and Sabriye. Erik is an American blind sports climber / athlete, and Sabriye is a blind German scientist who founded a school in Lhasa, Tibet. They are both unique in their own way, but they do not agree on what really builds trust in children. Erik wants them to reach the top, while Sabriye wants them to enjoy Erik as a model and enjoy the moment. The nuances are complicated and not very far away from who was right, whether the whole climb was a mistake or a great idea. The deepest scenes concern the Tibetan children themselves and the difficulties they had to face before they got to school. For me the most moving was the story of Tashi, a weak teenager who grew up in the streets after his parents abandoned him. I could watch the whole movie about his life and was happy to learn that thanks to the school he is now running a successful small business with some of his colleagues. If you like Spellbound or Murderball, you'll love it.
