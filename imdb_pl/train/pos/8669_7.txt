If, unlike some commentators here, you do not organize a class war and you do not mind watching the lives of other people who are quite successful, extroverts, bohemians (panting) and they are not terribly English at the party and entering all sorts of troubles as a result it's a bad movie, closer to Euro cinemas, and not an imitation of ordinary slippery American shit ... I believe that a minimal sound project and a cheap camera is a conscious decision, not a bad film making, I would defend it, as a result the film is not inferior, and sheds light on the cast, some of which are really good (Kate Hardie - think he is called a sarcastic drunk is in place) The only exception is David Baddiel, who should never have the right to act seriously !! It's light and we do not go to this kind of nonsense related to the relationship's relationship in this country, but if you do not have real friends with whom you could go to a party, you can do something worse than sit and watch it.
