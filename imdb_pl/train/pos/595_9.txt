When John Wayne filmed his story at the Alamo, he built a complete Alamo set in Brackettsville, Texas, which is still there and is a tourist attraction. As long as it lasts, we will have a set for future Alamo interpretations on the screen. One such as Dennis Quaid and Billy Bob Thornton was created this century. <br /> <br /> But I would say Alamo: Thirteen days to glory is the best Alamo story that I filmed. John Wayne's movie is good, if it's exaggerated, but it's a John Wayne movie with a story about John Wayne's screen-style. Brian Keith plays Davy Crockett here and gives a great interpretation of the perverse character he was. <br /> <br /> There is a lot closer to the book of Professor Lon Tinkle about The Alamo than Wayne's film and after reading the book years ago I can confirm it. Tinkle's book is mentioned as a source in both films, but Tinkle, who lived when Wayne's film was finished and was not happy with the result. <br /> <br /> Alec Baldwin was of the right age for the young William Barrett Travis, an idealistic freedom fighter who, by the way, was the owner of a slave. In the past, nobody has seen in this ironic contradiction. One of the things that has not been investigated and which has not been studied was Travis' hypersexual sex drive. He was Casanova from the south-west, he even kept a memorable diary of his libidinal conquests. <br /> <br /> But the man who always whitens is Jim Bowie, played by James Arness. He was a hero in the Alamo, but his career before the Alamo was breakneck. He was a smuggler, a slave trader, a buyer selling land, to which he had a dubious title. But his heroic death has surely redeemed him. There are no traces of this in the Arness show or any other that I saw on Bowie's screen. And of course he designed the Bowie knife according to his specifications. This man needed such a weapon. <br /> <br /> However, the main asset of The Alamo: Thirteen Days To Glory, is a full-length portrait of Antonio De Lopez De Santa Anna, president of Mexico who personally comes to suppress the rebellion caused by the North Americans who came to settle in Texas at the invitation of Mexico. Unfortunately, these Americans came with some ideas about freedom that simply did not reach so far south, at least freedom for white people. Raul Julia plays Santa Anna, who remains an even more controversial figure in Mexican history. He was also quite a scoundrel, but he was the best of Mexico produced until a real reformer named Benito Juarez appeared. <br /> <br /> This movie was a farewell performance of Lorne Greene, who appears briefly as General Sam Houston. Greene is not quite my Houston concept, he was really too old for this part, Houston was in his forties in 1836, he was not yet patriarch of Texas. But within the limits imposed on him, Greene does a great job. <br /> <br /> For the romantic story of the Alamo story at any price, see the version of John Wayne, but for the historical content I recommend this movie very much.
