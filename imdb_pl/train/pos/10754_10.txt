I was a little skeptic if I should watch it when it was first shown in CBS. I was one of many people who were in New York that day, I went to school at Hunter College. I did not want to see all the devotion and carnage again, but how many I was curious about what it was all about. Tears flooded my eyes, watching this documentary. All my memories came back and only the intense images were unbelievable. I bought a DVD on the anniversary and watched it several times. How these guys were able to register this material was amazing. If you have not seen this document, do yourself a favor and check it out. It is of course depressing and will bring tears to your eyes, but it's an amazing document of this darkest hour in these countries.
