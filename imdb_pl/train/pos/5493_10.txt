It is rare for you to see a media fraud that has been so widely reported as the official "truth" and caught so many news agencies. This film, in my opinion, deserves every price of journalism - it is objective (yes!), Bold and true "scoop". He can go without comment, false scenes or questioning - everyone, including Chavez, can just as well make fools of himself with his own words. The creators of the film "only" had to follow the events and set up their cameras. <br /> <br /> The Venezuelan elite teaches us "How to take off the president and sell it as a victory for democracy". It's amazing that they have finally lost - so far. As far as I know, the largest involved television station has received only a terrestrial license, it is still broadcast by cable and satellite. I doubt very much whether George W. or Barack Obama would be so tolerant after attempting a coup d'Ã©tat. But they do not have to worry. <br /> <br /> The fact that "Chavez's followers shoot innocent civilians" cheating has been so eagerly repeated all over the world, reveals how biased the so-called "free" media really has become or have always been more. An important lesson for anyone who is interested in what is "really" happening in the world. <br /> <br /> The famous challenge of "objectivity" always arises when journalists dare to oppose the main view or reveal undesirable facts that accuse "us" - this was true of the effects of the atomic bomb, the secret US history of the spread of "democracy" "Around the world or the war in Iraq, which, according to Johns Hopkins, has already killed 1.3 million Iraqis, not to mention 60,000 Afghans (in 2003), which have never been mentioned. To be objective, Saddam Hussein was less harmful to his people than the US. And the United States is ready and want to be more detrimental to the Iranians that it was. <br /> <br /> I am curious about the upcoming trial of some Khmer Rouge leaders before the International Court in The Hague, will there be any mention of "our" involvement in supporting and training Pol Pot's guerrillas in the 1980s, when they stayed in largely defeated by the Vietnamese. Probably not. <br /> <br /> One more reason to turn to an independent medium for balance if not revealing a scam.
