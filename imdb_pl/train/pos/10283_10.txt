House of Games is a great movie on many levels. It's a great secret and a shocking thriller. He is endowed with great performances by Lindsay Crouse and Joe Montegny as well as a strong, strong cast of supporting players and introduces Ricky Jay, an exceptional outstanding actor, prestidigitator and magic historian. His dialogue, written by David Mamet, is spoken in a social game and gives the film (in which reality is often questioned) an additional dimension of unreality. <br /> <br /> At first glance, the House of Games is a convincing look at the unknown world of cheaters and cheats, diametrically different from The Sting, which was played only for glamor and yuks. At this level, he achieves success. <br /> <br /> However, you can not avoid the exam at a deeper level of a woman's odyssey, from unparalleled professional competence to incredible strength and self-realization. The only film about which I know that the subject of the appearance of a woman's personal strength in such a valuable way is underestimated Benjamin private. This unusually pleasant movie sadly distracts his focus, jumping between several themes and using the excellent performance of Goldie Hawn to race after easy laughs. House of Games is sticking to its activities. As Poe once said about a good story, he is relentlessly ending it. <br /> <br /> There is another variation on women's films, embodied by Thelma and Louise, the great budget of a commercial money maker, with the vague topic that women are doomed to death, regardless of whether they are aware of their inner strengths pages. What tripe. <br /> <br /> As usual, you should really see this movie in the cinema. This should be natural for film festivals. Nomine it to one if you have a chance. <br /> <br /> I bought the original version of House of Games and gave it to my 23-year-old daughter. She'd better see it on the TV than she did.
