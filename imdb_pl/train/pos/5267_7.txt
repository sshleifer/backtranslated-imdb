Apparently Ruggero Deodato discovered at first that his story would not work if he approached it too seriously, so he decided to break it. The result is a movie that can be considered a preposterous epic of a sword and sorcery or a very entertaining comedy! And I think I will go the other way. Short moments of gore are well done, Paul Brothers openly mock the material (even barking at each other in one scene!), And also is a charming, thrilling, good-natured game Eva La Rue, as girls who mean together with "boys". Besides, where else can you see the interior of a dragon lit like a disco? (***)
