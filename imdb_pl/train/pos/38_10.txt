One of the best Three Stooges shorts. A terrible house full of bad guys and "The Goon" challenges the best people of the detective agency Alert. Shemp is on top in the famous dark scene. Emil Sitka provides excellent support in his role as Mr. Goodrich, as the goal of the plot of the murder. Before that ends, Shemp's "faithful little shovel" was applied with great effect. This 16-minute jewel moves as fast as any short Stooge and packs twice as much. Highly recommended.
