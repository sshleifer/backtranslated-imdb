I absolutely LOVE this movie and I would like to have it one day. It's just a fascinating legend about an eagle that wears a turquoise necklace, I loved it and would love to see it again! I do not remember much about it, but a Native American boy lives in a nice village with his family and I do not remember what is happening, but he should go to the desert alone. His sister is packing him food and going. While he is there, some Indian boys run away and put feathers on him, and he turns into an eagle. Legend has it that if you ever see an eagle in a turquoise necklace, it's a boy. I have always been fascinated by legends, in particular Native American legends, and I would love to see how it will be released on a DVD one day, I ASK FOR RETURN, anyone who is interested!
