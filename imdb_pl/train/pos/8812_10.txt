I saw this series when it had its world premiere at the Toronto film festival. I liked the idea of ​​the movie where the two men met and told the director from each country to make a movie about 911. These directors never met until the project was completed and saw how it all looked together. NOTE: UFENDING SPOILERS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! All the songs were very powerful and some were controversial. If you're an American, you may not like it because some pieces can be found anti-American. However, I know a few Americans who liked this series. The song that I thought was the best is the one from India. It was about how a Muslim family living in the States had two sons, and one of them was missing. The Americans gave them a cold shoulder and automatically assumed they were involved in a terrorist attack. It suits my mother's despair so well and humiliating these accusations that tears have moved me. Finally, we see her son died, trying to save many victims from the catastrophe of the towers. It was a real story and that's what made it so real. There were many exciting and powerful songs, and the African song was one of the best. It was full of humor, but as powerful as others. It's a must-see for everyone, and let's hope that America will solve this and let them play in their country.
