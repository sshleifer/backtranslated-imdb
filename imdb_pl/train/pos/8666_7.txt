Frankie Dio (Lee VanCleef) is a high-ranking gangster who indulges in police or illegal gambling (for reasons that seem vague to me). Tony (Tony Lo Bianco) is a low-level bandit who visits the billiard room and spends his free time jealousy with Frank. Being in the right place at the right time, Tony is arrested along with Frank and is sent to prison ... where they create a bond that may not be quite a friendship, but for now it will come true. <br /> <br /> This movie came to me under the title "Frank and Tony", which is disappointing, because I see the alternative name "Mean Frank and Crazy Tony", which would help sell the movie more effectively. I suppose it's a tribute to "Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry", but what do I know? I watched him soon after another Italian crime film "Violent Professionals" and I must say that the two complement each other very well. <br /> <br /> Italians have always lagged behind the Americans in their budgets and production values, a real shame in this film. He is considered a film "grindhouse", which unfairly weakens him to film b (or worse). I suspect that thanks to the cleaner sound and the image it could have been a Hollywood hit. I think the story is very interesting, the characters (and actors) are better than the average and in contrast to "Violent Professionals" the plot is quite clear - not too many secondary characters. <br /> <br /> If you like mafia movies or crime videos you should try. A movie about a mob coming from Italy (if more authentic you want?), That's how much you can ask. Sure, this is not Godfather, but it should not be like that. This is not a drama, it's a light comedy, a heavy movie of a buddy ... like "Die Hard With a Vengeance" from the point of view of bad guys. Well, not really. <br /> <br /> If there is nothing else, this movie meant that I wanted to check out other films of the director and the main cast. Movies in addition to "Escape From New York" (where VanCleef plays "Hauk") and ordinary iconic movies. What is more fun than discovering a lost classic?
