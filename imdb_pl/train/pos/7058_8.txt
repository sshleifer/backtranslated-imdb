Immediately after watching the movie, I got the real feeling of the magic of Walt Disney movies and realized that I had seen "real" magic in the movie a long time ago. <br /> <br /> The combination of appropriate music, speeches and magic effects again introduces the feeling of Disney into your body. The very special things that I saw, where ignorance of the effects in the film, began with the transformation of the Disney logo into the castle of Cinderella and ended up as a tale telling old stories with grandparents. <br /> <br /> The magic returned in me. I rate this film 8 out of 10.
