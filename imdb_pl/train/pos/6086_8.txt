I saw this movie about a year ago and it turned out that it was totally funny. A real winner, in my head. He stressed a stupid comedy, but he did have a story too. As in the case of the hit comedy Elf. It had a few serious moments, pressed between cheerfulness. When Stiller shot a black horse, usually sober, you laughed at his dark antics. You can find a common ground there because I'm sure that many people have done something that you do not want your friend to know about your friendship is not over. <br /> <br /> When I found out how many people did not like this movie, I was completely stunned. These absolutely horrible films, such as Napoleon Dynamite, have higher ratings than those that make me wonder about people's health on IMDb. Take my advice and lend it. If at least once you do not laugh, I will compensate you for the rental fee. = D
