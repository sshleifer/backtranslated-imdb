This is an interesting little movie from 1967, with cool jazz music and a story that will make you laugh ... OK, this is not really stupid, but it's a bad game. I have seen many similarities between this and "Creature with the Blue Hand" (AKA The Bloody Dead) and have the same director! The best Scotland Yard is the study of murders of young women in college. It seems that the criminals are released from the local prison to perform the auction of some evil person and then return when their work is over. The bible contains a clever device that shakes Prussian acid, and there is another device that is neither cool nor secret, it looks like a large gushing weapon, and the victim must be completely soaked before it passes. Joachim Fuchsberger plays Inspector and usually chews gum and looks away. He is a "monk" and how anyone identifies this thing with a "monk", he is beyond me, carries a whip and dresses in a red outfit with a red hood, more than a member of the Clan in a different color than a monk. There are many cool devices, such as a fireplace hearth, which rises and falls to receive a monk, and goes straight to the fire, without setting fire to his robe, a clever trick. It is a strange combination of a crime drama with a silly overtone, and although it is sometimes stupid, it is nice to watch. 7 out of 10, not bad ....
