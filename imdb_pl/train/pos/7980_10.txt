Man On Fire tells the story of a former guest of special forces who has a drinking problem and accepts work as a personal bodyguard for a little girl in Mexico during a wave of kidnapping ransom. At the beginning he is not friendly, but then make friends with himself, he decides to stop drinking, etc. Etc. ... one day he is kidnapped ... and killed ... <br /> <br /> And HE, he will not stop at nothing to get revenge. <br /> <br /> It's basically a story of Man On Fire, but expect a few big twists at least a few times, including an ending that's beautiful and will probably make you scream. <br /> <br /> It's also because of the great music of Harry-Gregson Williams with Lisa Gerrard (Gladiator) composed. <br /> <br /> But the most powerful part of the movie ... wait .... The thing is, everything here is perfect. <br /> <br /> First - acting. Denzel Washington is at its best, Mickey Rourke and Christopher Walken as always, great Radtha Mitchell and AMAZING young Dakota Fanning. And that's not the end of the list ... <br /> <br /> Then cinematography, which is dazzling and with an excellent edition, should definitely win an Oscar. <br /> <br /> History is ... not just a movie of revenge. History is intelligent, history makes you think ... and it is pure beauty. Really. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that you have to see in your life, at least once!
