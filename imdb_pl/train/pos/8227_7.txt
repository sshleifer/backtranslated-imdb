An interesting thriller in which Paul Winfield is a detective in the matter of murder. Paul Winfield was an underrated actor who easily played all his roles, it was difficult to say that the man even played. Perhaps best known to younger viewers as the voice / narrator of City Confidential, Winfield ends his film career; but as always Winfield shines. A feast to watch. <br /> <br /> Erika Eliniak is doing well, Erika Eliniak, it's nice to look but she leaves a lot to be desired in the acting department. Although, to be honest, this is one of her better efforts. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: a sensational thriller that should not be missed by any Paul Winfield fan. A decent movie that will help send Paul Winfield to celluloid heaven. What an actor. It will be omitted.
