However, when it comes to the Muppet line, it is not the best or the second best. It has been put on the market for kids, but it has some dark and emotionally annoying moments for adults that parents do not want to reveal to their children. One of them depicts Miss Piggy in "jealousy" in jealous rage, which lasts essentially throughout the duration of this work. <br /> <br /> Besides, the story is progressive and very funny. One scene where Joan Rivers and Miss PIggy are crazy in a department store is simply fun! There are other parts of this work that contain the same level of lightness and fun. <br /> <br /> I really like it and I'm enjoying it today. <br /> <br /> Ocenia siÄ™ 7.6 / 10 z ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
