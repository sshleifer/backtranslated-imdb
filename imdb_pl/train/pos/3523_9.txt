A bizarre and brilliant combination of talents between the director, Robert Siodmak and Ella Raines as a secretary who tries to save his boss from an electric chair, tracking a mysterious "phantom" woman and Franchot Tone as a mad and murderous sculptor. There are also some fascinating smaller parts played by Elisha Cook Jr. as a drugged drummer, as well as other characters that form part of the conspiracy. If you're used to watching Raines in more healthy parts, she can overdo it, especially in scenes with Cook. Franchot Tone also plays someone very different and although it is not a convincing part, it behaves phenomenally. While the conspiracy is too fancy, the movie has a real atmosphere and is very interesting.
