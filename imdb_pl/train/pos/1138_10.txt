When I was 8, I always watched movies and TV shows I did not have and it was one of them. <br /> <br /> It's one of my favorite movies of all time and it has to be the funniest movie I've ever seen in my life, acting is perfect, they do not make comedies like today (movies that are really fun and make it you laugh without resorting to excrements or some kind of body fluid that causes vomiting, as in those delayed films of Judd Apatova, in which dishonest actors like Seth Rogen, barf) appear. This film is a classic with actors who can act and deserve all the awards.
