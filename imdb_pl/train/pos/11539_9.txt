THE ODD COUPLE is a classic film version of Neil Simon's most famous art about TV writer Felix Unger, who is an obsessive neat weirdo who introduces himself to his divorced best friend Oscar Madison, sportsman and complete slob, after his wife Frances throws him out of the apartment. Already divorced, Oscar takes his best friend and regrets it from the moment he does it. The classic comedy by Neil Simon appeared for the first time on Broadway with Art Carney playing Felix and Walter Matthau playing the Oscar. Jack Lemmon takes over Carney in the film version with an unforgettable performance as Felix Unger. Lemmon is not only terribly funny in this role, but so lively that he brings an element of melancholy to the sorry character that is Felix Unger. Matthau, fortunately, let us recreate his role as an Oscar, a unique gem of a comic that provides unchanging laughter. This cooperation between Lemmon and Matthau turned out to be comic gold, which was again visited in nine other films. Because both of these actors are no longer with us, watching this classic becomes more touching, but no less fun. Simona's game was well developed on the screen with a silent prologue describing Felix's depressed attempted suicide, which is the winner. The cast includes Herb Edelman, John Fiedler, Larry Haines and David Sheiner as Oscar poker buddies, Moncia Evans and Carole Shelley as Sister Piedgon, blind dates with Oscar and Felix. Of course, later he became a great TV series with Tony Randall and Jacek Klugman, but it's not like the original. Joy from beginning to end.
