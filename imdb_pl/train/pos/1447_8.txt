I read the negative comments before watching this movie and undaunted, went on and started watching. I must admit that I had to rewind a few times because the film is extremely complex, involved and full of details. This is a good thing, but also unexpected in this culture of car chases, explosions, free sex and general violence, which replace the development of the story and characters. In fact, however, a welcome trip, I am so used that I do not attach much importance to what I watch. <br /> <br /> This movie is full of character and story development; the kind that we analyzed when I was in high school. It requires real mental participation from the viewer. What a nice change. I would compare it to 'All the President's Men' in terms of the general theme. This means that it is the secret of intense misconduct on the part of elected officials and those who have enough influence on officials to basically "own" them. <br /> <br /> Unlike the "All People of the President," this film tries to give a few characters a real personality. In this sense, the film is a character study, like "The Negotiatior" with Samuel Jackson and Kevin Spacey. In this film, their characters are both city workers and the plot is extremely intense. However, the plot depends on the ability of their characters to cooperate, trust everyone and ultimately unite against the corrupt Police Department. There is more fire in this movie, and the plot is different, but in general there are many similarities. <br /> <br /> I will say that the town hall requires much more concentration. In fact, it struck me as it was with the past and current political scandals that I saw in my life returning to Watergate. The thing is, society knows something is wrong, for sure! but following the details is difficult. This film is not even as complicated as real life, but in reality it is realistic in its complexity. I think that this is one of the reasons why the previous posters criticized the film: unrealistic expectations. <br /> <br /> If anyone is looking at it, knowing what he is going to see and is at hand, he is really perfect! I watched it three times in a row! Acting is great and directing flawlessly. The weakest link is the accent of John Cusak.
