I watched "Elephant Walk" for the first time in about 30 years and it struck me how much this story is similar to the excellent "Rebecca". As others have said, you have a sweet, young being thrown off your feet by an alternately charming and deliberate ruler of the court, only to let her marriage be threatened by the inevitable memory of a greater than life but deeply defective relatives. You have a fierce and disapproving servant, a crisis that either binds a pair or breaks them apart, leading to the fiery destruction of a sumptuous farm. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, "Elephant Walk" also owes a part of his terrifying jungle in the mood of "The Letter", the love triangle Bette Davis set on a rubber plantation in Singapore, not on a tea plantation in Sri Lanka. <br /> <br /> Maltin gives "Elephant Walk" only two stars, and IMDb Readers are not very nice, but I liked them despite their predictability. Elizabeth Taylor never looked more beautiful, and Peter Finch performs a credible job as a fundamentally good man who can not get rid of his overbearing father. Dana Andrews - the favorite of "Laura" and "The best year of our life" - is wasted as a frustrated devotee of Elizabeth. The real star is the house, one of the most beautiful interior sets in the history of the film.
