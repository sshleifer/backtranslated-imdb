Robert Wuhl teaches a class of film students at New York University in Manhattan, New York. <br /> <br /> Includes errors of history and truth that are no longer widely known. I would like to see much more of this program. This is very funny. Mr. Wuhl uses examples and "show and say" to get points. He explained that the person who actually rode Paul Revere's northern ride was not Paul Revere! Henry Wadsworth Longfellow used the name Revere because it sounded better. <br /> <br /> I've watched Robert Wuhl for many years, from the time he made the stand-up comedy and the "Arli $$" HBO all the time. He is a good actor and a good comedian, but he is a perfect teacher! I highly recommend watching the episode of this program. This is worth your time.
