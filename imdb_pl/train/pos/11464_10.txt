What's the most disturbing about this movie is not that the school killing of madness, such as the one presented, actually takes place, but the truth is that it is carried out by teenagers like Cal and Andre ... normal children with normal families. Using the Blair Witch manual camera technique, Ben Coccio manages to introduce us to the lives of two friends who have some problems with high school, although we have never been told exactly what is behind these problems. They seem to be typical - many people hate high school, so what? Some of you simply do not believe that they will ever carry out a very well thought out massacre in Zero Day. Because of this, scenes from surveillance cameras at school during shooting are much more powerful. You can not believe that it really happens and that it really happened. The manual camera technique also creates the illusion that it is not a script film, a brilliant idea considering the subject.
