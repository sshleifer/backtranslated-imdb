I watched this movie, expecting what I have: a good science-fiction cowboy. What surprised me was that Kurt Russell did such a great job with an extremely limited role. <br /> <br /> Imagine that you are trying to act within these two limits: you have almost no dialogue, and because you play hardass, a military robot, you can not show emotion with facial expressions! How? Just like asking a diva to make a great aria when gagging and tape. Despite the fact that he is verbally and expressively handcuffed, Russell pulls out an amazing characteristic. His robot becomes a human despite limitations. Well done! <br /> <br /> As usual, Jason Isaacs assures that he will go down in history as a great portrait of a perfect villain - the one you would like to see, take him out and cut up. Connie Nielsen was sweet, soft, motherly and wonderful. I am not sure how much my impression is based on her acting and her physical appearance, but it was difficult to tear her eyes away. Unfortunately, Gary Busey's role was too small and limited. <br /> <br /> A large part of the plot is quite standard, with a lot of weaknesses, but because it has the impression of a sci-fi comic, I do not see what's wrong with some weaknesses. At the end of the story a good guy wins, and the appreciation of the audience receives a lot of emotional satisfaction. Yes! <br /> <br /> This kind of feeling that thinks Russell does not do a good job is the same type that missed the whole point.
