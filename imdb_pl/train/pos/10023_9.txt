After watching a few Villarong movies I had a fairly clear opinion about him - he focuses too much on the personal aspect of the characters, forgetting the rhythm of the film. Therefore, although he has good critics, his films have never attracted attention to the public. In ARo it follows the same line, but it really improved the rhythm, especially at the end of the movie. Honestly, I slept the first part, because although the first part contains the necessary information, it is really slow. However, the second part is absolutely wonderful and makes the whole movie the best movie ever made in Villaronga. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
