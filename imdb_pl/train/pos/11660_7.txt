A beautiful piece of children's cinema buried in the archaic Celtic world. The story of the famous Book of Kels, regarded as monks from the small island of Iona, on the west coast of Scotland. <br /> <br /> Telling a story about a young abbots student who goes to the forest in search of Crom-Cruic, a wild headless rider of pagan mythology. In the hope of recovering the lost artifact. <br /> <br /> The real beauty of the movies lies in his animation. Shaded cells in a bright and inspiring style with deep complexity, which makes them look less simple. The Secret of Kels, drawing heavily on the artistic style of the great Cartoon Network series "Samurai Jack" for the brilliant use of character creation and depth of background, creates a consistently affective Celtic world living in the shadow of the Viking invasion. <br /> <br /> History can be very inaccurate, and ways of life depicted as devoid of realism, but these facts are completely irrelevant, because the film is embedded in the world of fantasy and Celtic-revival mysticism. The girl from the forest is a wonderful addition and in my opinion makes the picture the way it is when it glides from branch to branch. Appearing and disappearing like a mysterious nymph with features reminiscent of the legendary Cheshire cat from Alice and the Wonderland. <br /> <br /> Kels's secret is an absolute feast. For all genders, of all ages, it's a beautiful piece of family cinema. <br /> <br /> Do not expect that you will be delighted, but instead impressed!
