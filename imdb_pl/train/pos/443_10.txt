I saw this movie for the first time in the early 90's when it was released for the first time. The room with a view was also new. Enchanted April had so much more to offer! I considered it more real and earthly, characters more credible for being "normal". At the end of the movie, I felt the same as when I first saw the BBC's production of "Pride and Prejudice," I missed my heroes to find what they were looking for, whether it was isolation, peace, freedom or love. You feel that Italy is so far away from everything they've ever known that they are so decadent that they take risks and leave everything that is madness and limitation. But in the heat of spring in April everyone relaxes (in accordance with Victorian corsets) and slowly recover to satisfy everyone. What a little jewel of the movie! Why is not he more known?
