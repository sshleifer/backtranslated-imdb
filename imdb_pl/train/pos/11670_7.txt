The feather story and questionable characteristics do not matter when watching a movie is as much fun as this one. Live actions and spectacular acrobatics - on their day - give this film a real lock. And there is a real comedy of excruciating chemistry between the two leads. Quinn is also a good black character, although his role is completely obscured. <br /> <br /> But do not be fooled by the hard part of Maureen O'Hara, it's sexist like any Hollywood movie from that era. Perhaps you can forgive this because of the time it was taken, but it is still difficult to get through. Despite all the heroism and horribly adult off-screen situations, it is not much more than adolescent teenagers.
