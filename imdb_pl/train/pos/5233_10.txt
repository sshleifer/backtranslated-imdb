One can be tempted to describe the genre of Gert de Graaff's film as a "thought event" modeled on Merab Mamardashvili. The nominal plot is a tiring search of Bart Klever for this ephemeral substance that is the essence of personality. The script of his new film is shaped both on his computer and in his own imagination. This film monologue was made in response to Fellini's "8Â½" and cost Gert de Graaff 13 years of work. An excited game with real and fictional characters, as well as with the audience, reveals a capricious combination of the real and imaginary, paradoxical coexistence of two different galaxies: Guttenberg and MacLhuen. For some time we have been willing to cooperate with a scriptwriter who believes that the cause of all misfortunes are the damn stereotypes of mass mentality ("man", "Catholic", "window cleaner"). And with him, we fall into a trap when the author-creator faces an unsolvable dilemma: how can you eliminate the future movie. Bart Klever? Just five minutes before the finale, thanks to the common small accusations of the wife of the creator who is deeply immersed in the work, we realize that together with the main character we were again "made up". Really, what is the price of art for which it is acceptable to renounce your name and daily care for your young daughter? <br /> <br /> So who is he, this Bart Klever? Is he a genius prophet or someone possessed like Frenhoffer from Balzac's masterpiece (just like the last writer at the end removes everything he wrote from the computer's memory)? Gert de Graaff suggests that we will answer this question ourselves. <br /> <br />
