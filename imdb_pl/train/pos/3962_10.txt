Wonderful James Stewart, Vera Miles vehicle. What makes this historical film about the FBI so good is part of a family that is involved in Stewart's 35-year career in the film. <br /> <br /> The film shows the story of a large investigative agency. He deals with bomb bots, killing Indians in Oklahoma to get real estate, fighting organized crime, Nazis and communists in that order. The human element is never far behind because Stewart marries Vera Miles. They raise 3 children when Miles's heart goes out every time Stewart goes to class. <br /> <br /> Look for a short but unforgettable performance by Murray Hamilton. Years later he appeared as Mr. Robinson in The Graduate from 1967. <br /> <br /> The film has praise for J. Edgar Hoover. He certainly led the FBI to parish. <br /> <br /> It is true that this can be seen as right-wing propaganda, especially with true Republican views of Stewart, but it is a well-done, historically instructive and family-oriented view so well-represented.
