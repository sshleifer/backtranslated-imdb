When films B go, it was well above average (I am warning the reader that I can reveal some key elements of the plot or other parts of the film, although I try to minimize this tendency). As always, the sequels continue, it was absolutely fantastic (despite the "cutting out cookies" approach to trying to copy some elements from the original movie vocabulary.) Despite the sometimes boring tendency, it seemed to work in this particular movie, as far as the viewer can distract him from comparisons to the original "Scanners"). <br /> <br /> The film was similar to the series "Superman" when it comes to the description of the main character of his early childhood and relationships with his parents (who seemed to be modeled on the same principles as Kents in the stories of "Superman") and the topic of a morally pure hero with extraordinary powers from an early age, etc. Presenting deep feelings of alienation of wonderful or otherwise incompatible children, adolescents and / or adults were a theme that reminded me of films such as "True Genius" and (in a more superficial degree ) "Doctor Mordrid" and hit with a particularly strong chord. <br /> <br /> The film had a positive message, and it was great to watch. I found some fascinating insights and accuracy (in relation to the presentation of certain aspects of paranormal phenomena), and sometimes even deeply touching. Sometimes these moments appeared between all the great shashows based on formulas and free sex (in this case, how sexually elements were tastefully made) and violence that makes B movies (or, in this case, Shakespeare plays!) Yes very nice to watch! <br /> <br /> This is a must for all comics enthusiasts, science-fiction fans, "remote viewing" and horror fans! With proper exposure in the right circles, the film can develop into a cult, just like the original "scanners".
