I collect at least a few people who watched it on September 2 in TCM. If you knew that Hedy had to change his name to avoid associating with this movie when she came to the US. It was a big scandal and I find that the original edition in the US was so fragmented by censorship that it was practically incomprehensible. I watched because I had just watched a documentary about "bad women", actresses from the US censorship council before the film, founded in the early 1930s. It seemed to me that they escaped much more than the most sensational Hedy shots in Ecstasy. In fact, according to today's standards, Hedy looked positively innocent and it was nice to see her early pristine beauty. It was a nice, lyrical movie to relax. I loved what it was: a simple romance. I watched it after recording it during a sleepless early A.M. I would like to see the first version released in the US for comparison.
