Chocolat Claire Denis is a beautiful but frustrating movie. The film presents a very interesting look at the family home of the European colonial family living in Cameroon, giving the viewer an information perspective on the life of many characters and their interactions. However, the development of these characters is often insanely insufficient. For example, the main theme of the story is the inability of young France to create strong relationships with others. Although this portrait is made flawlessly, especially in the way in which Denis sets a story with scenes from the return of France to her childhood, the lack of closeness of the girl with other characters prevents the viewer from investing a lot of interest in its development or lack of it) as a hero. The general stagnation in the development of a film character makes it difficult to engage in a loosely organized story. The film arouses many tensions between the heroes, especially between Aimee and the men in her life, but it never fully touches these social frictions, leaving the viewer unsatisfied. The last few scenes are powerful but depressing. Denis's work is certainly interesting from an intellectual and historical point of view, but if you're looking for a movie with an adventure or drama, Chocolat is definitely not the best choice.
