Here's skinny, it seems to be much older than I thought. But it's still cool. Bike mechs are cool and history works for the most part. I hope that some issues related to character have worked well in part two and my biggest complaint is that it seems to be a MACROSS downfall. Not only the style of animation, but a few form patterns. For example, all the girls in this movie look like LYN MINMAY of MACROSS. Mechs look just like MACROSS, like other characters. It is not really intended for young children, it has graphic violence, nudity and graphical sexual content. To make a short story, I give this cool MACROSS knock-off 7 STARS.
