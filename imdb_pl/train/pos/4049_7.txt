Erich Rohmer's L'Anglaise et le duc is an excellent addition to Peter Watkins' La Commune (Paris 1871). Both films - shown at this year's Toronto International Film Festival - ironically illustrate how history is shaped by narrators of the story. Ironic, considering the tragic events that took place in the United States during the festival. <br /> <br /> In Paris during the French Revolution, the film based on "Memoirs" by Grace Elliott (Lucy Russell) is a firsthand account of how she experienced these difficult but dangerous days. He also describes his relationship with The Duke of Orleans (played by Jean-Claude Dreyfus) who, unlike herself, is a supporter of the revolution. <br /> <br /> True, you do not know on which side of the story Rohmer will come. One of the first French filmmakers of "New Wave", Rohmer was often criticized for being too conservative. Finally, among the rebellious-youth Vietnamese days of the late 60s and 70s, he made romantic little sweets, such as "Claire's Knee". But do not sell this old boy, people, he was always a student of human nature, not an ideologist, and "L'Anglaise et le duc" still confirms this. <br /> <br /> Rohoter characters are never "bad" or "good", they are above all human beings who are able to show a full range of human possibilities - and limitations. That is why his films are always provocative, and this film is no exception. <br /> <br /> Now about technological nuts. <br /> <br /> Rohmer, although he entered the 80's, is still at the forefront of film innovations. L'Anglaise "is like something you've never seen before. You guessed it, the old guy - like several festival directors this year - has become digital. <br /> <br /> All external scenes of the film look like they were in their original Paris interiors from the 1880s. To tell you the truth, you can be so distracted by the admiration of the authenticity of the movie's appearance. They have to go back to the second show to capture psychological subtleties of the film - and yes, let me say this - political insights. <br /> <br /> Toronto is presenting this year's most outstanding young filmmakers in the world, as well as some of the oldest in the world. And the old masters stand on the edge of the cinema next to the young. <br /> <br /> Long live youth. Long live old age. And let Erich Rohmer live. <br /> <br />
