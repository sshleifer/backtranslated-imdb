My favorite movie of all time! I have seen many movies, but this one beats them all! Excellent acting, great story. You will, as a "normal" caring person, begin to love George. Although he is an actor, he is also himself and a very nice person. And most importantly: you will learn to respect and look different than people with Down's syndrome.
