Trick or Treat, Quickie Review This vigorous movie revolves around the culture of Heavy Metal and the horrors of the 80s - two things that I love so much. So, as you can imagine, I liked this movie very much. Additionally, for no apparent reason, Ozzy Osbourne plays the preacher. <br /> <br /> This film is about unpopular youth from high school, who, like all losers, has been drenched in the world of "bad" heavy metal. His favorite Metaldude dies and of course he is resurrected in a wonderful way - playing his latest unpublished album back. This allows the crazy singer to walk around, killing people with demons and helping them. <br /> <br /> Okay, sometimes it's bad, but you know what? It has a surprising number of good features. Decent acting (including Gene Simmons as a radio DJ), pretty good special effects, very short nudity, decent atmosphere ... All in all, it's a decent horror movie. But what really sucks is music. Inert, what? Well, this "sinister" metal guy is one of the most repulsive, high, disappointing Motley Crue on the planet - and "Metal" is not much more than decaying Pop-Hair Metal. It strikes all these stereotypes, from whirling like a gay fairy, to looking nasty, to shouting "Rock and Roll !!!" on a pitch high enough for King Diamond to be able to step back. Besides this horrible musical representation, it's pretty good. 7/10 <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
