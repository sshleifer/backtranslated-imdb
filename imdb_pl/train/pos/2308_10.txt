I checked this as an impulse when browsing the movie store and I could not be more pleasantly surprised! My mom and I watched this movie together and we loved it. This is not a typical "chick-flick" with a juicy love story and tears throughout but definitely touches the nerve at the end. It is the ending in which, although unexpected and tragic, the overall effect of the film is not harmed by him. I think that Reese Witherspoon was a great actress even in this film, her debut, and it's definitely worth watching! I have not met many supporting actors, but everyone plays their important supporting roles well. "The Man in the Moon" is such a believable story about a young teenager who falls in love for the first time. Most women can definitely relate to everything - from the words of Witherspoon, her subtle looks and not so subtle emotions (raging like a typical teenager). While she is a lost character about love, she does not turn out to be stupid and immature, which has been appreciated due to many of today's films.
