The multi-layered novel by Rohinton Mistry seemed impossible to adapt on the screen, but the resulting film is full of passion, emotion, humor and pathos. The story is a bit slow, but there is always something on the screen that attracts the audience. The film ideally catches the specified time and place with the highest accuracy. All actors are Indians - few, if any, well-known "western" audiences - but they are joy, especially the little girl who works very convincingly. Do not be discouraged by the title and summary of the story - it is a movie that you can see on the big screen. We have to learn a lot from it.
