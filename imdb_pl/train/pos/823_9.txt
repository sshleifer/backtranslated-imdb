Until the sixth and final episode of the Star Wars saga, which eventually ended in 2005, I've always looked at this entry in 1983 as my favorite movie from a long series. Various action scenes and really different characters (Jabba The Hut, furry forestry, etc.) made this film particularly attractive. <br /> <br /> No action has ever focused in one place for too long. The last half hour is the best example, because the scene changes every few minutes from the forest into a battle between spaceships for a single laser duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. if the previous two were not a lack of a fight between the two stars. Disappointing arguments between Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford have disappeared. Finally, everyone was on the same page! It was nice to see. <br /> <br /> After all, it was just a great adventure story, more than anything else.
