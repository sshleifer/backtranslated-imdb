Okay, I know I should not like this movie, but I'm doing it. From the sympathetic interpretation of the Japanese stereotype to the irritating shout of Jay Leno Pat Morita, I laughed throughout this movie. As long as you take into account that this is not the best movie in the world, this is a good announcement. <br /> <br /> My favorite part is that Morita is talking to his boss in Tokyo.
