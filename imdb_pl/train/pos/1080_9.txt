Nowadays, movie "comedies" are usually 100 minutes of toilet humor, vulgar language and kicks in the groin. Contemporary comedies refer to the lowest common denominator, undemanding and slow brain. Sure, there will be a good comedy from time to time, but it's getting rarer. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Blandings Buildings his Dream House "shows what Hollywood was capable of in the 1940s and it's just plain funny. Jim and Muriel Blandings (Cary Grant and Myrna Loy) decide to build a house in suburban Connecticut. The film tells about their history, starting from home hunting expeditions, rebellious construction of the house, to the finished house - with the "zuzz-zuzz water softener". <br /> <br /> Grant and Loy are perfect for their roles, of course (Grant is especially entertaining because he watches how home costs get out of control). However, the film was stolen by the wise attorney Blandings, perfected by Melvyn Douglas. As he steals every scene he finds himself in, Douglas is unhappy, while he watches Blandings go from crisis to crisis. Reginald Denny as a crazy architect Blandings and Harry Shannon as a crunchy old drill well are also great. <br /> <br /> I have watched this movie many times and it always makes me laugh. I think it's a good movie to watch when you need a lift, regardless of whether you're building a house or not.
