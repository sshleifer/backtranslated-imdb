But the rest of us who love a good sentimental and emotional story, which is a blockade that allows you to cry ... rejoice! <br /> <br /> Tom Hulce is wonderful as Dominick, a mentally free trashman who loves professional stocks and his brother, Eugene, played by Ray Liotta, who is a doctor and works for a long time. <br /> <br /> Due to the schedule of Eugene's work, Dominick is alone for a long time and has a tendency to question the decision. He just wants to be a good boy, do the right thing and make his brother proud of him. He stops at the church to pray at some point and expresses his emotions so openly and so well that the character is crying before the damn movie even begins. <br /> <br /> I am not going to give anything here, but the movie is extremely addictive and sad and painful. Those who are not afraid of these things will have a great day with this beautiful story, her loving heroes and a great song that I can not quote here, which has nothing to do with the movie at all, but it's strange ... but you hear it's in the bar. <br /> <br /> I thought Tom Hulce would be nominated for this film because he was for Amadeus. I thought it could give him a way to win. There is no happiness. Liotta is equally good, but has less emotional impact, but then does it later. All I can say about Jamie Lee Curtis is that there is not much to say, but it was nice that she gave her name to a small drama in Pittsburgh with two brothers who you will never forget.
