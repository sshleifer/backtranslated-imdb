Castle of Blood is a good example of qualitative work in the horror genre that appeared in Italy in the 1960s. The film contains all the right elements - an old dark house, atmosphere, decent story and Barbara Steele. Steele makes most films worth seeing. <br /> <br /> The story is about a haunted castle. People visited but nobody came back. Our hero bets that he can spend the night in the castle and return to collect his winnings. But the night he visits is a special night. Every year is the night when the dead return to relive their deaths. <br /> <br /> The only drawback I see in the movie is the duration. It almost feels padded. There is a large part of the first act in which nothing literally happens. Our hero stumbles in the darkness, finding nothing interesting. But when he finds something, the movie picks up pace and becomes quite pleasant. <br /> <br /> Castle of Blood is definitely fans of Steele and fans of Italian gothic.
