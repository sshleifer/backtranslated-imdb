I watched the show 10 years ago and I loved it !!! I'm in possession of a DVD now and watched the series, and I was waiting for the scenes I knew were on the show (when Lucas confronted Gail in his house) and realized that he was missing - I suddenly watched the seduction without going up. Then I went to the line to check the entire BIOS of the stars and came across the comments about the broken shows. Thank you!!!!! But there seems to be some conflict. Some comments say: "Strangler number 19, then the Triangle 20, when the other had them in a different direction. And also Potato Boy 5 and Dead to the World 6, have also been reversed. Can anyone explain ?????
