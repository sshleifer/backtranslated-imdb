A few years ago, I saw it several times on the Sundance channel and received a good cinematic shock in the system. A semi-surreal, but strongly sketched approach to contemporary media culture (or lack of it), focusing on some of the seriously crazy Hollywood residents. He had a funny early performance by Marek Ruffalo and unforgettable photos from DP, which he made films of Polish brothers. It was a brutal, discrediting humor and a strange original atmosphere that definitely stood out. In this movie, classic classics have been written and I'm surprised that it is not on DVD yet. <br /> <br /> I hope soon.
