This is one of the best in this series, in the ranking of Resident Evil 3: Nemesis (Or Biohazard: Last Escape) The game has a very good story in which you play as Claire Redfield in search of your brother, Chris Redfield (Who you probably know from the original Resident Evil). It's as frightening as the other Resident Evil and it contains many more cutscenes. <br /> <br /> My Rating: **** from ***** Stars (Score based on comparison with other video games)
