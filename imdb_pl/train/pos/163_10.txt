The first director Tom Kiesche revolves in the winning film in the spirit of cutting, dark comedy. Filmed in a modest budget, but having the taste of Brother Coen's early film Blood Simple ... He must see more than once to appreciate all the elements that take one scene to the next. Expect more good things from this writer-director-actor.
