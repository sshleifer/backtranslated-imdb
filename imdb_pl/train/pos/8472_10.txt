I totally disagree. I thought it was a great movie for children's wells from the island of Gilligans, and the promise shown from the then barely known plato.it was dissident and therefore can not be discounted as meaningless fluff. It was not terrible and it was not meant to be. I will not ruin the ending. But it was amazing how it was done. I mean, the kids were great and I did not know what to expect in the end. the plot also had much more in common with these children than the fact that these children were experts in the field of fishing, which is especially important for the plot. Initially, it also helps them fight the jam. it's too long. I think it's less than 95 minutes
