I fell in love with "Pushing Daisies" immediately. This program can bring a smile to my face thanks to a great story, witty dialogue and great acting. But that's not all: it also manages to keep you to the end. The basic idea of ​​the show - Restoring people to life with one touch, ending the status of the undead with a second - is interesting and can be in later seasons. But full of tension, murder cases, the unique look of the series and a very fit narrator add to this experience. But "Pushing Daisies" is more than just parts. He has a certain charm that I really like and I look forward to entering the world of Ned and Chuck for the second season.
