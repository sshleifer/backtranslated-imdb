In The White Balloon and Crimson Gold, two other films by Jafar Panahi, which I have seen, the director brings out a surprising amount of depth in topics that seem small on the surface. At Offside, a seriocom tribute to Panahi for Iranian women fighting for their rights, I do not think he's that effective. Of course, what he says is not important (and it's a pity that like any other Panahi movie, Iranians do not see it). But after some time the movie seems a bit flat and seems long even after 90 minutes. But not saying that I did not like it. All actors are fantastic, and the celebration at the end of the movie is contagious. But in my opinion this is not an important job.
