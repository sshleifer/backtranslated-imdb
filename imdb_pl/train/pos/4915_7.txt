And rather an unexpected story - in the era: the city of New Orleans is the Scourge - and only Richard Widmark can stop it! Elii Kazan's trademarks: wharfs, working people, crowds, fugitives, people from blue collars, violence in the back room - are presented here. <br /> <br /> Jack Palance is quite effective as an icy gangster big result, Zero Mostel as Dom Delouise a bit bad, but certainly worth seeing as his departure. I enjoyed Barbara Bel Geddes as a steadfast, cool wife - I thought she and Widmark were a reliable couple. <br /> <br /> He always reminds me of Sinatra a little bit - in the face and in an intense, quiet way, and it has to be a compliment, if at all. I have never heard of this film and yes, you must admire Widmark's performance. I also enjoyed Paul Douglas - he seemed to play this role many times, they create an unlikely but effective team. <br /> <br /> The sheer plague is McGuffin - and you must know that it is not exactly as I was in real life - rather not on a small scale? -But I found that it nicely carries the story. <br /> <br /> Check it out. This is good. *** outta ****
