I just want to say that among all the so-called classic hip-hop movies that I've seen like Wild Style, KrushGroove, Breakin ', Style Wars etc ... IMO BEAT STREET is the best among others. Whenever I ask other people what is their favorite, it seems that BEAT STREET appears the most. But it is still the lowest item of all. 4.3 is just a blow "under the belt" (if yes, 5 points is a belt). I love musical performances, breakdance makes me want to spin, RAMO makes me want to throw a piece ... come, its a classic !!!
