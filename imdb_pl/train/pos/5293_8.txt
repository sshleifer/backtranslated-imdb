It is a very light comedy about a great family who has a son named Pecker because he used to peck his food. Pecker loves to take all sorts of photos of people from a small suburb of Baltimore, Maryland, and manages to attract the attention of a group of lovers of photographic art from New York. Pecker has a cute sister who's crazy about SUGAR and is actually ADDICT, taking a teaspoon of sugar from the bag. There are scenes of men showing nuggets in jockeys with grinding movements and girls doing the same. It's hard not to think about the gutter with this movie, but who cares, it's just a movie that gives you a few laughs for a simple picture made in 1998.
