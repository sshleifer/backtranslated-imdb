The film was much better than another reviewer. It's a nice family movie. It has a fantastic fantasy aspect when traveling in time. The story is about a 14-year-old girl who accidentally found a way to go back in time in an old elevator of her apartment building. Of course, nobody believes her when she tries to explain her disappearances. He finds and befriends a girl of her age and is able to help the girl's family in many ways. In the long run, she is also able to help her with her father. It reminds me of a movie about Hallmark, so give it a chance and decide for yourself. It seemed to be aimed more at children aged around 6-12 (maybe a bit older) and this is basically PG or G. I'm an adult who can appreciate a nice "family" movie - probably not another reviewer.
