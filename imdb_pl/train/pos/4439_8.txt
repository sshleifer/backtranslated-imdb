The best-selling horror writer Cheryl (solid and nice representation of the charming Virginia Bryant), her husband Tom (sympathetic Paolo Serra) and their son Bobby (nicely played by Patrizio Vinci) go to a distant castle located in the countryside. Summer holidays. Local legend says that the area is cursed. Cheryl discovers a terrifying, hairy, nasty ogre (hulking David Flosi in a strikingly hideous outfit) living in a basement. Cheryl must overcome the deep-seated childhood fear of the beast so she can overcome the foul. The director / co-writer Lamberto Bava does a professional job, creating and sustaining an amazing and disturbing nightmare mood. What's more, Bava avoids the standard routine of bloody terror in order to create a fascinating and provocative fairytale tale of a dark adult style, how the best way to overcome what frightens us is to face the mentioned source. Sabrina Ferilli as friendly teacher Anna, Stefania Montorsi as hottie babysitter Maria and Alex Serra as batty painter Dario. Gianfranco Transunto's glossy cinematography offers a few liquid tracking shots and plenty of great atmospheric lighting. Fabrizio Sforzy's frustrated make-up f / x, the thrilling, shocking Simon Boswell score and the damp, dark, spider-covered cellar set - all this went into a place full of skin. Worth watching.
