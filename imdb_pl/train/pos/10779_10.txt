A classic cartoon, always pleasant and fun. It has an interesting story with charming characters. Road Rovers is a show worth seeing, it's a short 13 episodes, and if you ever manage to see it, you should. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to find. I think Warner Brothers Studios should release a DVD containing all 13 episodes. I would definitely buy it if it was, and if so, I should buy it too. if you have children who like dogs, they will love rovers! Road Rovers should have paid more attention during broadcasting, it was definitely an original and very special program that should be appreciated much more than it was.
