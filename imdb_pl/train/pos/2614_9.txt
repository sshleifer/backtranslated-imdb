Why was not it released? I thought it must be a bit mushy because it was not like that. How bad a girl can be! This film is fascinating in one word. <br /> <br /> You will be charmed. It keeps your attention from the very beginning and its pace never slows down. <br /> <br /> The last part of the movie, as it was in the "episode" (nothing gave, you saw it in the trailer) unacceptable. You choose your favorite, you will be shocked, you will not be able to go and have a coffee because you have to find out what's going on. Adrenaline is growing and you can not watch it. Cudos for actors, it's very reliable. And it does not end there, they have the last shock for you. <br /> <br /> It also makes you question reality TV and if you want to watch. And how far from this we are, really? Endemol (who creates a big brother) created a TV show in the Netherlands last year, offering a woman dying kidney to patients in need of a transplant. The show was eventually revealed as a scam, allegedly to raise awareness about organ donation, but are we too close to get comfort?
