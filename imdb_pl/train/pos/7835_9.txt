I saw this movie yesterday in a special cinema shown in Nuremberg and it was great. I must admit that the original musical composition of the cellist and drummer / xylophone influenced the mood of the film, but the film itself also had the power to present the tragic saga Nibelungen. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in silent or Nibelungenlied movies, I highly recommend this movie. The costumes were fantastic and creative, the sets were rich and exotic, and the acting was dramatic and breathtaking (as is typical for the "tragedy" of the silent movie). Unfortunately, I have not seen the first part of this film duo that concerns Siegfried. The story of this second film begins after Siegfried's death, when Kremhild (Gudrun in the Scandinavian versions of the story) begins planning his revenge on the brothers. <br /> <br /> I also watched this movie in German; I am a native speaker of English and have basic knowledge of German. It was difficult to read the subtitles (what do you call in silent movies?) Because of the old German script, so I advise you to watch them in German so that you can distinguish your "k". , "F" and "s" in the old script. :)
