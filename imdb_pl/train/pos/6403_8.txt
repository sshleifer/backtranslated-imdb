MEN OF HONOR is Cuba Gooding Jr., probably in his best performance. The game of Carla Brashear, a man of great courage and heroism. He is a poor farmer from the South who wants to become a navy diver - but he has problems because of his race. The head of the diving school, played by Robert DeNiro, is a racist lump that is still growing to respect Brashear. The film tells how Brashear has to agree on almost unbeatable chances, not once but twice. Performances are what makes this film special. Gooding is great, and DeNiro, the best actor in film history, gives a high score - his best dramatic work for years. Charlize Theron gives another solid performance as the much younger wife of DeNiro. The film shows a bit too strong patriotism (although not near the level on which he was in THE PATRIOT), and several characters are only one dimensionally bad (Mr. Pappy Hal Holbrook is so bad), but film is rare today among movies. It's uplifting and non-chronological. A great movie.
