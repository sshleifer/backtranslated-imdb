The only reason I give this film 8/10 stars, not 10, is that 1) Sinatra is terrible, and 2) interest in the love character Kelly leaves much to be desired (IMHO). Do you love that Dean Stockwell, Quantum Leap - Al, is a little boy. The dance sequence with Jerry Mouse is one of the most entertaining and amazing dance sequences I've ever seen. Tom and Jerry are still my favorite and my daughter. I am 28 years old and 4 years old, so even though the character is less cult than Mickey, he is still a favorite of many children and adults. Kelly is always addictive and his eyes are full of fun and excitement. In every movie I've ever seen him, he always steals the program. One of the best dancers of the 20th century. No wonder Paula Abdul "tried" Kelly's moves. I would also mention Gene Kelly as one of the most beautiful people of the 20th century. If you would only watch one part, do not miss the Kelly dance with Jerry Mouse. You will not be disappointed.
