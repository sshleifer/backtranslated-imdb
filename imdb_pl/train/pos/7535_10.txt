700 Club gives a great perspective on world events. Some have described it as insincere or trashy. I think that the program is informative and inspirational. It is natural that many people throw mud on a program that has been so successful. There are very few programs that can point to 40 years of television coverage, and The 700 Club is one of them. Although Robertson may have been wrong in claiming that someone should be murdered, I am surprised that so many people literally stumble over each other to jump on the critics' fashion. I certainly said some stupid things in my life. I certainly would like to forgive Mr Robertson because he made a great concert.
