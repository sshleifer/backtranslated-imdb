Okay, the last Star Trek story was not good. The next generation has disappeared over the past few seasons, the DS9 has boldly remained where no one has been before, and Voyager has started very badly and never fulfilled his promise. So when they announced the new Star Trek series, I did not have high expectations. And the first episode, Broken Bow, had some problems. But overall, it was a solid Trek material and a good romp. <br /> <br /> I will get the nits first. The opening theme is boring and I can not wait to regularly participate in it, but these are the remotes. What was really bad is a completely unselfish scene of rubbing with a balm that nearly drove my wife out of the room. They must cut this nonsense. <br /> <br /> But the plot was strong and well arranged. Characters, though still new, seem to be well rounded and not always what you'd expect. The volcanoes are clearly depicted quite differently than before, with a somewhat sinister motif. I especially liked the linguist, who is the first character of Star Trek, who is unable to stand proud in the face of death, but has to deal with her phobias and fears. It seemed that they remained faithful to Trek's knowledge, which was a significant problem in previous series, although they have a lot of time to bring us things like shield shooting, instant invention of technology that can fix everything, and inevitable excess stories from time travel. Does anyone want to set up a pot for how long before the arrival of Borg? <br /> <br /> In total, the series has huge potential. They see the universe with fresh eyes. We have a chance to find out how things went like in the later series. How did the Klingons go from insulting the war? How did we meet Romulan? How the Federation was created and simply exercised power over the Earth. Why is the first directive so important? If they deal with these things instead of spitting out travel episodes in time, it will be an interesting series. <br /> <br /> My favorite line: Zephram Cochran saying "where no one left" (no "nobody")
