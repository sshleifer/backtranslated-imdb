CitizenX (1995) is the answer of the developing world to the silence of the sheep. Where "Silence" terrorized our peace, "Citizen" exhausts us and grieves us. This dramatization of Chikatilo's case translates rather well, thanks to the Western friendship between two Rostov cops who become equal. <br /> <br /> CitizenX can also argue about (!) Death penalty much better than Kevin Spacey's The Life of David Gayle (2002). <br /> <br /> Humans are Machiavellian mammals, under which lie the limbic brains (logic of the lizard). Why two children who knew better, a stone to die, a toddler whom they kidnapped? Why the bloodthirsty women shout "li-lililililii" during the acts of terrorism OBSCENE? - My own term for it is "limbic domination", the desire of lizard logic to dominate the "enemy". If in the vocabulary you have the words "enemy" / "revenge", you can easily "dominate limbically". <br /> <br /> In the 80s of Rostov destroyed during World War II (located at the mouth of the River Don) near the Black Sea) nothing stopped Andrea Cecililo's appeal for "limbic domination" from overpowering its layers of civilization. The easy victims of Chikatilo (Jeffrey DeMunn) were beggars, usually children who traveled by intercity train for fun because they could not afford anything else. <br /> <br /> CitizenX reminds us that it denies the raging Soviet bureaucracy cost the lives of 52 such "lambs". Serial killer Rostov wandered free for almost 7 years after he arrested the police and allowed him to leave. <br /> <br /> The politicization of the fight against crime is detrimental to the police forces around the world. Although the police are routinely suffering from corruption around the world, in the West politicians can capture the persistent rivalry between agencies, hindering a more coordinated response to crime. However, in the Soviet Union, CitizenX Department of Assassins Viktor Burakov (Stephen Rea) suffered from a repressive bureaucracy. <br /> <br /> Geoffrey DeMunn is not sufficiently psychosexual, Czikatilo, with faultless but insufficient authority - a point of complete oblivion. Also in real life, Czikatilo experienced life's incarnation and avoided capture. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, his persecutor sticks out as a strange bird, devoted to unheard-of, naive explosions. Perhaps by assumption Stephen Rea gives a very strange performance as head of forensic medicine Burakov. Rei's Russian accent is impenetrable; and his Burakov is humorless and gloomy, he argues with everyone. <br /> <br /> So Donald Sutherland is leaving the photo. Colonel Sutherland Fetisov, head of Burakowa, and at first his only supporter, is too restrained, patient Militiaman, whose stately carriage testifies to decades of bureaucratic machinations. His awakening as a logic-controlled and at the same time a passionate policeman becomes the fundamental idealism of the film. <br /> <br /> Joss Ackland makes another turn as a malicious apparatchik, secretary of communist ideology Bondarchuk, overseeing the investigation. Naturally, in 1984, he arrested the arrest of the suspect, a communist, a man carrying a rope and a knife in a bag, allegedly returning home: Andrei Chitlylo. <br /> <br /> Soon Burakov was replaced by another Moscow apparatchik, Detective Gorbunov (John Wood), claiming that the investigation is now focused on "known homosexuals". The funniest scene of this sad, sad movie appears during the institutionalized harassment of Bondarchuk and Gorbunov: one stupid policeman honestly reports, "As I suspected, comrade, this is fornication. I made a few drawings - signaling howl of laughter. <br /> <br /> Five years after the bodies began to accumulate, in 1987 the police finally tried to solicit criminal profiles. The only collaborating Soviet psychiatrist was Dr. Aleksandr Bukhanovsky (Max Von Sydow), who called UNSUB "CitizenX". Later he also noticed that Fetisov and Burakov "together create a great person". We agree. <br /> <br /> The stretched pace, spread over a decade, perfectly reflects Glasnost's institutional inertia - "openness" - it was not. Contrast with perestroika - "construction" - could not be bigger in the case. Although Chikatilo was still circling the railway stations, the police plans were to bear fruit. <br /> <br /> In 1990, Col. Fetisov was quickly promoted to general. His nemesis, Bondarchuk, disappeared from the scene, letting the investigation proceed without any political interference. Staff, communication, advertising - suddenly, all were available. During one night of telephoning, Fetisov got the depressing chief of forensics for the FBI Serial Murder Task Force at Quantico, where, as Fetisov discovered, personnel are regularly rotated on serial murders to stop only such psychological damage to researchers. /> <br /> Fetisov advises his newly promoted head of forensics, now "colonel" Burakov, about all these changes in the avalanche of confession, which becomes a powerful film scene. Fetisov is the most affectionate apology I have ever seen in the film: "Privately, I apologize to you and your wife. I hope that someday you can forgive me for my ignorance, "he almost whispers. <br /> <br /> CitizenX HBO is a top-class movie. Not only is the exterior look genuinely gloomy (filmed only in the most run-down parts of the spectacular Budapest), but the fast soundtrack of Randy Edelman is completely overwhelming - and often our only respite from grim brutality. Those who speak Hungarian will recognize many Hungarian accents and credits. <br /> <br /> Czikatilo's actual murders are portrayed as gloomy, abnormal behavior born of character flaws and ignorance in an equally dismal world. This makes the murders seem not entirely - but of course they were. As President Kennedy reminded us, "we all value the future of our children." <br /> <br /> CitizenX perfectly communicates that killing is far more frightening and indecent than any fancy of revenge can suggest. Serial rapists rape to dominate; serial killers kill to dominate. Just like some soldiers. Such "Limbic dominators" create poor people. <br /> <br /> WARNING-SPOILER: ----------------------------- --------- --------- Real Andrei Chikatilo WAS the most prolific known serial killer. Convicted, he was executed in 1992. In a similar way to all death sentences on the Soviet Union: one shot in the back of the head. Stupidly, such methods destroy any possibility of brain deviation testing after death. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: ------------------------- --------------- -------------------- The best result is always to prevent murders, not to pursue them. Executions simply guarantee the public lack of knowledge about the complex reality of victims' deaths when we even send anecdotal evidence HOW / WHY they died. They also do not kill a murderer. <br /> <br /> Revenge does not kill victims. Connecting to the blood of the killer is no better than counter-domination - when it's too late. <br /> <br /> Revenge in the name of mourning is not justice for the deceased - it is a pardon of the living (10/10)
