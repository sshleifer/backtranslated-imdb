I am and I was a very entertained movie. This was my favorite movie from 1976. Being brought up in the 1970s, I was so in love with Kris Kristofferson's appearance and behavior, of course I'm not a film critic, but in times, I think it was very good. I really like the combination of Streisand and Kristofferson. I thought they worked great together. I've seen this movie many times and I still love them as Esther and John Norman. I am a very big fan of Kris and I see him at a concert when I can. What a talented author of the singer's songs, not to mention the actor. I've seen him in many movies, but I'm still coming back to the Born star.
