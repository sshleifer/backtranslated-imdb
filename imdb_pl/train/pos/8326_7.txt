While Fred Schepisi has "I.Q." there are not really any important features, it's worth seeing them. Walter Matthau plays Albert Einstein, trying to help the mechanic Ed Walters (Tim Robbins) falls in love with the PhD student of Princeton, Catherine Boyd (Meg Ryan). Probably the funniest scene is when Dr. Frizzyhead and friends (Lou Jacobi, Gene Saks and Joseph Maher) try to make Ed look like a scientist: he ends up looking like a French impressionist. <br /> <br /> Not many of them are historically accurate, but that's not the point. It is not meant for anything but a light comedy, quite opposite to the most famous Robbins movie from 1994 (The Shawshank Redemption). The film about Einstein's entire life would have to focus not only on his academic achievements, but also on his political activism, namely how he wrote the letter on behalf of Scottsboro Nine and went out against nuclear weapons (he reached the point where the FBI kept on him) files). <br /> <br /> In any case, this is acceptable. Starring Stephen Fry, Tony Shalhoub, Frank Whaley, Charles Durning and Keene Curtis.
