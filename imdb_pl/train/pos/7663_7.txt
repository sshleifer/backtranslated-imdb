As a rule, the Full Moon logo is a warning sign to avoid film. But because I liked Jeffrey Coms in other movies, I gave him a chance. <br /> <br /> It's not bad. Not great, but it's something else. The film covers the fight with the mystical (evil) "brother" who wants to dominate the worlds and the title hero. Dr. Mordrid also has to deal with people and authorities in the mundane world, which he does successfully. <br /> <br /> Possible spoilers. <br /> <br /> Dr. Mordrid can travel between "dimensions" to find a companion guarding the fortress; however, the guard was blinded. His eyes are ruined pits. So the wizard shifts his hands in front of the other, and hey, presto! His eyes have been restored! This type of healing apparently works only with the eyes. <br /> <br /> Later, Mordred and his "brother" revive several skeletons of animals in the museum to fight. Guess which one wins. <br /> <br /> However, after this picture, the picture is not bad at all, although it resembles a comic book. More "human" adventures of Dr. Mordred are fine, and Combs plays a convincing role. <br /> <br /> I've seen a lot worse.
