I saw this movie and I have to say I'm impressed. There are not many movies that I like, but I like it. You should see this movie yourself and comment on it, because it is one of my favorite movies. I would like to see it again. Action combined with a fantastic story. Very impressive. I like the form of Modesty. In fact, it is very mystical and mysterious (I like it ^^). Bad boy is nice too. Well, actually this whole movie is rare in "movieworld". I was considering voting on this film, I thought it should be a very popular movie. I think it's bad. I was impressed by this film and I hope that I am not the only one who takes the cost. See and vote.
