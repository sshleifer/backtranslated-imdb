It's one of those little Christmas movies for everyone. Our Scrooge is Ben Affleck, who decides that money is not enough, so he rents a family who lives where he thought his family. WELL? It's a great little soap in high school, PG-13, but small sexual references are comedic, so if your child can not deal with them, he can not live in the real world. <br /> <br /> Now, Affleck is handsome, and as usual walks through this game, OMG, remember when we did it ..., create a piece as if it were in the final stage of some neuroinfective disease. But that's okay, because even the old Oracle still hopes that if Ben will be so well proportioned, well, we hope we still have women. Fortunately, the rest of the team - Catharine O'Hara, James Gandolfini, Christina Applegate, Udo Kier and Josh Zuckerman - complement and maintain that the holiday shades of Ozzie and Harriet are alternately fun, comfortable and warm. br /> <br /> This movie is of the sort that you can jump and get popcorn, and when you come back, everyone wants to undo it to show you what you missed. <br /> <br /> This is finally a happy movie that gives you a sense of life, love, family, Christmas and Chanel. Everyone will find something for himself.
