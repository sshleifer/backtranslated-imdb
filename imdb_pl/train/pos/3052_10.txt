A strange but emotionally disturbing chill with a rather masculine middle age (William H. Macy), who ultimately decides to leave the family business (murder for rent) run by his quietly demanding father (Donald Sutherland), seeing a psychiatrist (John Ritter) and flirting with another patient (Neve Campbell). <br /> <br /> Talk about a serious dilemma, but "Panic" is a top-class thriller that looks like "American Beauty" meets "The Professional". Macy and Sutherland are distinguishing marks here. Extraordinary debut of the first scriptwriter / director Henry Bromell. I am surprised that this film has not had a chance to stay in cinemas for more than a few weeks.
