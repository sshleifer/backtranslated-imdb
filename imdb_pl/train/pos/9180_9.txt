I felt obliged to watch the adaptation of "Jane Eyre" Timothy Dalton / Zelah Clarke from 1983, because I just wrote an article about "Jane Eyre" from 2006 for TheScreamOnline. <br /> <br /> I approached the viewing the way I approach my homework. <br /> <br /> At first I was annoyed. Lighting in this version is bad. Everyone / everything is washed out in bright white light, which in some scenes casts shadows on the wall behind the characters. <br /> <br /> And the sound is poorly recorded. I felt like I was listening to high school games. <br /> <br /> And the pancake make-up is too heavy. <br /> <br /> And the sets do not fully reflect the gothic mood of the novel. They're too picky, too Martha Stewart. I just can not see Rochester Bronte sticking to Martha Stewart's house arrangements. Orson Welles' Rochester lived in a cave-like darkness, very adequate to the gothic mood of the novel. <br /> <br /> And yet ... with all the reservations ... not only is this the best "Jane Eyre" I've seen, it could be the best adaptation of any novel I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> This "Jane Eyre", in spite of its technical flaws, brought back the feeling of reading Jane Eyre for the first time. <br /> <br /> The critics of this production say that it is too close to the book. For me, someone who valued the book and did not need it less "verbal" or less "Christian" or sexier, the loyalty of this version of the novel Bronte, which he wrote, is its best asset. > <br /> Bronte wrote a good book. There is a reason why it lasted for 150 years, while other, slender, sexier and easier texts have disappeared. <br /> <br /> As a longtime fan of Jane Eyre, I was forewarned of Timothy Dalton as Rochester. Rochester is not handsome; Jane and Rochester are the famous ugly couple of literature. And Timothy Dalton is not extraordinary handsome. <br /> <br /> But Dalton gives a mesmerizing performance as Rochester. He simply dropped me. I have never seen anything like his total dedication to the role, text, dialogue and love of Rochester to Jane. Dalton brings Rochester pages to shake life on the screen. <br /> <br /> Rochester is going to be a little scary. Dalton is terrifying. Welles also had a terrifying streak, for example when he screams "Enough!". after Fontaine plays a short piano song. But Dalton is terrifying here more than once. You can not really tell if he's going to hurt Jane or himself, in his desperation. <br /> <br /> The power of Rochester, his humor, his rage, his sensitivity: Dalton passes everything, sometimes in an interval of seconds. It's stunning. <br /> <br /> And here's the key thing - the actor who performs Rochester has to convey that he spent over ten years of his life in total despair, loneliness, living with an ugly, life-destroying secret. <br /> <br /> No other actor I've seen trying this part, does not convey this black hole of despair, as Timothy Dalton does. The current favorite fan Toby Stephens does not even try. Dalton hits him from the park. If I saw Timothy Dalton performing Rochester at the singles bar, I would say, "This guy is a problem. Do not even look at him. " It is so radioactive that it kills agony. <br /> <br /> Zelah Clarke is not only the best Jane I've ever seen, she's one of the few Janes that the producers wanted to quit when the book throws Jane. No, people who know "Jane Eyre" only from the 2006 version, Bronte * did not * describe the statuesque, robust Jane with beautifully arched eyebrows and lips. On the contrary, Jane Charlotte Bronte is really poor, simple, unclear and not very pretty. <br /> <br /> Zelah has a small mouth, closed eyes and a little nose. She is really "small." She is not a model. And she is the best Jane, the truest in the book. <br /> <br /> Some have described it as cold or boring. No, she is faithful to the book. Jane Bronte is not a hot mother, she is a sheltered, lifeless teenager whose inner passions appear only at key moments, just as Zelah does. Jane is someone you need to watch slowly, carefully, patiently, carefully, if you really want to explore her depth. You must see Zelah, here to find out who he really is. <br /> <br /> I would like to see more fire in Zelah in one key scene, but this is one scene from five hours in otherwise it is very good. <br /> <br /> Despite its proximity to the text, this version, like any other version that I have seen, does not allow to fully explain the openly Christian themes in "Jane Eyre. Christianity is not an accidental subtext in "Jane Eyre", it is central. <br /> <br /> Helen Burns instructs Jane in Christianity, thus giving her a subversive, countercultural way of reading and living a seemingly doomed life. Christianity and the Christian God convince the poor, simple, unclear Jane of her equal worth, her need to fulfill her ideals and reject the key proposal of marriage. This is not fully explained here. <br /> <br /> In any case, Charlotte Bronte has written a great, complex, rich novel, and this adaptation of all of those I've seen, mine and honors, the best novel of all the adaptations I've seen, and that says a lot. <br /> <br /> Other versions that do not fully honor the book end up in many places. If you do not care about what Charlotte Bronte has to say about using children or the hypocrisy of culture built on gaze and money, your adaptation of a large part of the book will be something that people outnumber to reach the kissing scenes between Jane and Rochester. <br /> <br /> This version, like Bronte's novel, realizes that everything Bronte wrote - about Jane's experience in Lowood and her relationship with Saint. Jan - is part of what makes Jane and Rochester's relationship as explosive and unforgettable as it is.
