This movie is funny! That's what I like in this piece of "Guilty Pleasure". It is easy to condemn this film, not including Pat Priest and Butch Patrick, the original Marilyn and Eddie. But look at the year and do math. Pat Priest and Butch Patrick have long outgrown their parts! Time does this for young stars. Yvonne De Carlo, who again appreciated her role as Lili, pushed Big 6-0 (although she still looked good and was still the perfect "Lili"). <br /> <br /> It is a pity that Yvonne De Carlo did not receive the major part. Still, it was good to see Fred Gwynne and Al Lewis in roles that made them so famous! During two seasons, in which THE MUNSTERS was in the best time, it was Gwynne / Lewis chemistry that was so successful. The rest of the cast supported the cast members, not to say that they were not needed. They were! The television series would not survive as long as without them. Considering the choice between Butchem Patrick or Happy Derman (the original "Eddie"), the choice was too easy. Yvonne De Carlo was also a better choice than Joan Marshall. <br /> <br /> Although this movie does not fit the original TV series, it still performs well and is one of the better "reunuum" television programs, it was plagued by a boob tube in the late 70s and early 1980s. <br / > <br /> "
