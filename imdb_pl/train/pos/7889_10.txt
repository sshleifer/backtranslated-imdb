The movie in which Freddy is dead The last nightmare is as frightening and disturbing as any other Nightmare on Elm Street, yes, it has the essence of comedy, like all other movies, but how could anyone say you will not find Freddy Krueger scary if you came across this man in your dreams, you would not find him even more frightening with the comic essence of him, because his comedy shows that he does not care about killing you, that he thinks it is very funny, and Freddy is comical with them mind games, which in their own way are very disturbing, using its comical ways that make nightmare horrors on Wiązów Street, what they are today, writers are extremely clever, doing comic and Krueger horror in contrast to Jason Vorhees, who does not say anything and there is no proof to really scare your victims, this movie is as good as Freddy proves and I recommend it to everyone with a sense of humor and the way "Do not fall asleep!"
