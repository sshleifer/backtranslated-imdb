My favorite movie "Imperialism" and one of the best adventure movies of all time. Grant, McLaglen and Fairbanks dominate the screen thanks to bold and wise cracks to satisfy everyone, but the most "PC" movie viewers. Plenty of memorable scenes - three sergeants and their 20 sepoys fighting with hundreds of bandits; MacChesney & Cutter gives Bobby Coote a spiked blow ("save a little for the elephant"); Cutter to MacChesney - "I'm an expedition"; Break Cutter out of jail with a fork ("what do you think I'm trying to break out of him?) And that bleeding pudding?! All right, you're all under arrest!" <br /> <br /> I could go on, but just tell me that I'm trying to catch this movie when it's on, better 2 hours.
