It's quite a nice song (look at the cast and borrow it - you know you're already curious), and the first director Bishop gives them a chance, not hurrying, letting the characters interact and chew the scenery, wait - not enthusiastically - for the return of "the great boss "And whatever will take revenge. <br /> <br /> For some of us the most important point is meeting with Christopher Jones after exile from the movies; remains the dominant film character. And yes, with Christopher Jones, Larry Bishop and Richard Pryor, this is the downhill event "Wild in the Streets"!
