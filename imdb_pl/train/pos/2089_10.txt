"The Good Earth" is a great movie that you can not hear much about. There are many great disasters and events, but it is also a story of love without passion. All this happens in just over two hours, which is short for today's standards. Special effects and costumes are very good during this period. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised that Luise Rainer received the Oscar for such a limiting role. In fact, he has only three emotions: submissive, hungry and broken heart. <br /> <br /> The performances of Asian and Asian-American actors are great. <br /> <br />
