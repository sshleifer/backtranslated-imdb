Skip McCoy is a three-fold lost barrier that is unable to return to instinct back onto the street. She chooses a candy bag on the subway train. He does not realize that Candy carries top secret microfilms, microfilms, which are very popular among many organizations. <br /> <br /> The director Samuel Fuller created a unique drama set in the dingy underworld of New York City. Communist spies and suspected government agents are joining Pickup On South Street with a thrilling watch from the first minute to the last. Based on the story of Dwight Taylor entitled Blaze of Glory, Fuller delighted in this adaptation with a heavy political plan, something that many seemed to be at the time, but focusing only on its anti-communist tendencies is a great inconvenience. /> <br /> By digging a little deeper and seeing characters as intriguing as Fuller directed, the protagonist is the hero of the song, cheater and shallow human being, his heroism is not born with love his country, they are born of his stubborn streak. It is quite an achievement that Fuller created one of the best anti-heroes of the 1950s and I am sure he was most grateful for Richard Widmark's performance for McCoy, for all his smile and ice-hearted, his game with great Jean Peters as Candy is perfect and the heart of the movie . However, it is Oskar's Oscar-nominated Thelma Ritter, who takes acting honors, her Moe is strong and dingy as the figures around her, but she is tired of the warmth that Ritter transmits majestically. <br /> <br /> It's a B movie in texture, but the movie in implementation, Pickup On South Street is a real movie with class and entertainment, which is the best of the most intriguing directors. 9/10
