I think it's a beautiful family movie. There are lots of funny scenes and moments that warm up the heart throughout the movie. The actors are great and the effects are well done. Danny Glover plays George Knox, who manages the horrible baseball team "The Angels" and is great throughout the film. The young actors Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Milton Davis Jr. are also fantastic. Christopher Lloyd, who are good as Al 'The Angel', and the effects are great in this highest Disney movie. A moving and warming film that everyone should enjoy.
