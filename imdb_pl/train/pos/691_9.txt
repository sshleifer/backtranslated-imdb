I will come clean. The only reason I learned about this DVD was because Dominic Monaghan is my favorite actor. When I heard the title of the film, I thought it would be ... different, maybe not in a good way. <br /> <br /> But I was wrong. After reading some reviews on this shortcut, I was really excited about this view. I sent my copy as soon as possible and I received it a few weeks later. I do not need to say that I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> The movie follows Jacek, insomnia, which is often harassed by conditions that cause him to doubt what is real and what is in his head. I will not tell you what will happen, but let me tell you that a movie can sometimes scare you in its realism. <br /> <br /> The direction is fantastic, focusing on what is important for the story, not letting it lose any entertainment or moments that make you think. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I am giving this great movie 9 out of 10, for being far beyond what I could achieve with a short movie.
