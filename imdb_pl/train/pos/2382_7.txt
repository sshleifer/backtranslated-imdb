For a long time, "The Menagerie" was my favorite episode of "Star Trek", though in recent years it has been overshadowed by "City on the Edge of Forever". I preferred "Menagerie" rather than the fact that it is a more hardcore Star Trek with this fascinating history back to the Trek's history at the time. I still think that the brilliant way that Gene Roddenberry incorporated the original pilot into the two-part episode. Although the "new" part of the story is largely an excuse for Kirk and a few others (and us) to watch the pilot, Spock's idea of ​​court martial is clever. If you want, you can punch the storyline. For example, given the Talosian mind control capabilities and Pike's state, why is it even necessary to physically restore Pike to their planet? There are other confusing questions about Pike and Commodore Mendez ... it's best not to think too much about the details and just enjoy the only bipartisan ST.
