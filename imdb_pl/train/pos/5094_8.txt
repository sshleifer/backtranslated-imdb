If you're a purist, do not waste time - otherwise, keep your hat and enjoy the adventure. I loved the version of Stewart Granger / Deborah Kerr - I've seen it dozens of times, but this movie is just as good, just different. I will not describe the differences in detail because it would ruin the movie. I'm happy to see Alison Doody again (I'm a big fan of Indiana Jones), Patrick Swayze is good as Quatermain, and the supporting cast is great. I believe that the quality of support is one of Hallmark Production's trademarks and this film was no exception. The photos are great and the score is perfect. If you are looking for entertainment, you will not be disappointed.
