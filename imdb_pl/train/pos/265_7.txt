A series of accidental, seemingly irrelevant thefts in her sister's pension very worries Miss Lemon. Ring, bulbs, backpack, lighter, stethoscope, shoe? it seems that none of them has a rhyme or reason. Miss Lemon asks his employer, the great Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot, to investigate the matter. But what Poirot sees is far more sinister than Miss Lemon could have imagined. And Poirot's fears are confirmed when one of the students living in the guest house was murdered. Poirot belongs to the killer of justice. <br /> <br /> Hickory Dickory Dock is a solid but not spectacular entry in the long Poirot series. I appreciate the loyalty of the script to Agatha Christie's original story. I realize that some freedoms have to be taken, but I still appreciate the effort. The main points of the mystery are there? petty thefts, boarding houses, students, a torn backpack, and, of course, Poirot's ability to see something sinister before it happens. With few exceptions, the student cast is almost as I imagined. Damian Lewis and Jessica Lloyd stand out in the group. As I always enjoy David Suchet's Poirot, I am very excited about the episodes with Inspector Japp Phillip Jackson and Miss Lemon Pauline Moran. This episode is a real treat because Miss Lemon gets more time than usual. In the end, I was enjoying the use of the current mouse as an observer of activities in the hostel. This is a fun game called Hickory Dickory Dock. <br /> <br /> When revisiting Hickory Dickory Dock, I realized how much Agatha Christie's work was heavily influenced by highly stylized Italian mysterious films, Gialli, 1960s and 1970s. Let's take the example of Mrs. Nicoletis's murder. If you were to conquer the graphic nature of the scene, you would have something straight from the early 70th anniversary of Giallo. In fact, the entire story of Hickory Dickory Dock could be used in Giallo. It's just intricate and interesting enough to work.
