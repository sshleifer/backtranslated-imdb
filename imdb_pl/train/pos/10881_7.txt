"Cut" is a full-scale parody of the Slasherian genre that achieves what it intends to do. Most standard slashers are there; old terrifying house, woods, anonymous indestructible serial killer, buckets of blood and of course the couple interrupted by the killer during sex (this is not a spoiler). <br /> <br /> The set is in a simplicity: the film school suckers decided to finish the unfinished "masterpiece", unfinished due to the murders of several casts. It is also nice - good, sloppy - depriving Kylie Minogue of the first drum. They were joined by one of the survivors of the original film, played by Molly Ringwald, who is absolutely stealing the film because he gets all the best lines. The rest of the cast fits well with their roles, especially the lovely Jessica Napier, who plays it straight, while chaos and gore erupt around her. <br /> <br /> There are lots of red herrings and fake moments, and there is very little time to try and figure out who the killer is because the movie is moving so fast. It also has an appropriate low-budget look, including some awkward editing that is probably deliberate. Good soundtrack. If there is a difficulty with this movie, he decides whether it is sending or paying homage to the slasher genre. Probably a bit of both.
