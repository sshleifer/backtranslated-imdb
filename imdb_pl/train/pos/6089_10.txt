OK, I overrated somewhat to offset at least one of these bad reviews. But I liked it. I did not laugh aloud, but it interested me and attracted me, not throwing me at any moment. Built history. Yes, you knew it would be a happy ending - this species always has. In the meantime, it was bizarre with gags that you can miss, so watch out when you look. Stiller and Black were once again delivered professionally. A good team. They should cooperate more with each other. I do not know if it will be a cult classic, but it was definitely great fun. Not as good as WHAT about BOBIE or DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS, but what is it? It is still worth to leave the road to watch and watch this movie.
