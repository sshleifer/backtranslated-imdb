This movie is a riot. I do not remember when I was having a great time in movies lately. In my time, I've seen some good comedies and are usually quite funny. But this is a great line of walls. I think that Best in Show is the last movie in which I was so laughed and so much. The film continued uninterrupted until the end, when they did 5 minutes of sentimental cleaning. In addition, it is a continuous barrage of one liner and unwise situations. I would like to see it again before leaving the theater, because it is like Zucker's films in which he is not kidding for the first time. You must see it two or three times to get it all. <br /> <br /> As for the actual movie, he could use better editing, sometimes he is uncertain, but we have to forgive that. All characters are great. This is not a film by Adam Sandler, in which he tries to be funny, and everyone else suffers around him and it is a joke. I think I will remember all the main characters for many years, because they are all so nice. No victims in this movie. Thank God too, they have a 45-year-old actress who will play his girlfriend. Catherine Keener plays her and she is beloved in this film. You just want women like her to really exist. She is not "10" like other top ladies, but somehow her smile is warmer than Julia Roberts is exaggerated. <br /> <br /> If you see the trailer of this movie, you may not think about it too much. I assure you that the trailer is not fair. They do not give away all the good jokes. Only some of the mediocre. <br /> <br /> Oh and one more thing. I hope the critics have put it on the top ten list. Many of them complain that comedies do not get the recognition they deserve and by the end of the year they do not put them on their list. It means that Ebert !!!
