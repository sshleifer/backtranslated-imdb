Despite the narrow narrative, Johnnie To's Election sometimes feels like it used to be a longer picture, with many characters and storylines abandoned or ultimately unsolved. Some of them are discussed in a really great and definitely better continuation, Election 2: Harmony is a Virtue, but it is still a fascinating thriller about the contested Triad election, which bypasses ordinary shooting and explosions (though not violence) in favor of constantly changing alliances, which can change the time it takes to make a call. It is also a movie in which the most ruthless character is not always the most dangerous, because the chill ends too clearly: one can imagine the whole life of psychological counseling, which is necessary for the entire trauma that is inflicted on an unhappy observer. br /> <br /> Simon Yam, often a very changeable actor, but always under his guidance, probably never was better at the forefront, not only because the much more extroverted performance of Tony Leung makes his silence stronger.
