OK, this movie starts like a cheesy Lifetime movie and it does not get better until the movie is clearly visible. The script is full of "cheese" and "fluff", and the cast is not well-targeted in the majority. In the first half of the movie, a little girl gnashed my nerves. I do not think it's one of her best acting works. The only reason I bought this movie was because it was on sale and it had Ellen Burstyn in it. She's great, but she's not one of her best acting performances. The story is based on real events and it helps the film. Actually, I did not even like the film at first and I became disgusted when I saw the balloon trip pictures. But everything is forgiven before it reaches its destination and the story is over. If it does not bring you tears, nothing will be! It's cheesy and predictable, but it also makes you feel good again in the world.
