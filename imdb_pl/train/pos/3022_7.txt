I never realized that Charles Boyer (Luis Denard) appeared with Lauren Bacall (Rose Cullen) in one film and had a great time together. Even Peter Lorre (Contreras) played a role in this film and had a bad misfortune in his bathroom, which made him faint. This story is about the Republican courier, Luis Denard, who visits England during the Spanish Civil War and tries to disrupt the coal mining contract that will do great harm to other nations. Lauren Bacall (Rose Cullen) comes to help Luis Denard, lifting him and falling in love with him, and then helping him escape the angry crowd of English mine workers who threaten his life. The real bad guy in this movie is Victor Francen, (Licata) "Beast with Five Fingers", which gives exceptional performance. A great classic movie from 1945 without Humphrey Bogart.
