WELL. Who brought the cheese. I love it. During the race he became a phenomenon. Anorexia fables have become popular. Bob Saget started to make a payment (instead of REALLY a funny stand-up). And people knew who Dave Coulier was. Then life was good and simple. This is one of the great American classics. It was fun and always brought a good lesson. And here I am different from the norm: I liked the last seasons. As with Home Improvement, when children get older, you can do more with the script. That's why I dare say ... It could have gone much later than it did. But in any case. I gave him 8/10 because of his healthy, funny stories and thanks to Bob Saget!
