Intelligent, flashy and thrilling "Invisible Man" stood out in 2000. Among the ordinary composition of Sci-Fi, balancing the fantastic direction of art "Farscape" and sometimes melodramatic scenario with harsh, cynical threads and modern dialogue noir. The show was sitting between "Law and Order" and "Doctor Who" on the credibility meter, but it could not be denied that the characters of "I-Man" went beyond the caricature. Even characters that bordered on predictability, such as the Guardian, the Official, and Eberts, received prizes from the formula. Paul Ben-Victor and Vincent Ventresca had a chemistry that evolved and changed elegantly, which was further emphasized by a team of writers and directors with revolving doors. The effects can never overwhelm the plot, and science sometimes bordered on the totally unbelievable. The low points of the series are still fun and I have never seen such a tight pilot episode. It should be praised by Matt Greenberg and Sci-Fi, and fans have the right to request extensive DVD editing. Every time I encounter the "Hercules: The Legendary Journeys" marathon in Sci-Fi, I roll my eyes and sigh, mourning the excitement and possibilities of science fiction TV that "Invisible Man" and his similar representation.
