In the early nineties, I read a small advertisement in a magazine of horrors about the Liebe des Totes (love of the dead) or something similar. This of course aroused my curiosity, so I ordered Nekromantik 1 and 2 and Der Todesking (King of death). Nekromantik's films are Ok, even interesting and unique in the approach to the topic of Necrophilia (even if of course they are entries to horror movies, and not to cause fear in the viewer's mind, they are quite funny). > <br /> TODESKING, on the other hand, is in my opinion one of the best films ever. It consists of a series of scenes depicting many aspects of death. Death as an enemy; Death as a relief, Death as a very physical distribution of the body. Film is a metaphor of life. It shows how fragile life is and how short our lives are. He reduces his viewers to the children we really are. The fact that we can not really understand the nature of death, and thus the process of dying, is not the main message of the film. This is the most realistic movie. Buttgereit never tries to hide death behind white roses. Regardless of established moral standards, death is inevitable and sooner or later it will not be a fiction, but YOUR reality. This applies to YOU, Dear Reader, as it affects viewers of the film. Some juvenile reviewers do not seem to understand this, which is fully justified, because of course they will live forever ... <br /> <br /> This is not a film about exploitation. Why? Because death does not use people. It collects us. We grow up for seven days, and then we return to Schopenhauer's pre-birth state, or death. Buttgereit gives us his version of the oldest story. Whether you decide to consider it "optimistic" or "pessimistic" depends on you. At first glance, it may seem very dark. Consider, however, that for something to live, something else must die. "Who wants to live eternally?" <br /> <br /> I believe that when Buttgereit shows the body that is eaten by worms, it shows not only the distribution, but the GENERATION of a new life. Is not it better to die and give life to the worms and then to the birds and eventually become the soil than to stay alive dead zombies, which is one of the favorite animals of this species? <br /> <br /> When you understand this, you see that Der Todesking is the right context. <br /> <br /> Sieben Tage hat die Woche, siebenmal letzte Stunden. Seven days of the week (weak, deadly!), Seven times in the last hour. <br /> <br /> Do not be afraid of the Reaper, says Buttgereit, because the Reaper takes only what is ripe. And apples that are not torn out to eat will rot! <br /> <br /> Have a nice life, colleagues with IMDBers! The seventh seal "in depth and universality"
