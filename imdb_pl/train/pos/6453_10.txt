The arrival of the world-famous conductor of sets of unexpected events and feelings in a small village. Some people are threatened with the way they deal with the church choir and how people change in it. This movie is impulsive and makes you leave the cinema with a smile on your face and tears in your eyes. It's about getting the best people out, and Kay Pollak has written an excellent scenario based on the ideas from which he became so famous. The actors are outstanding, Michael Nyqvist, whom we know earlier, but Frida Hallgren was a new and charming friend to me. He has a most vivid face that leaves no one intact. Per Moberg performs his role as husband Gabriella almost too good, he is also terrible. He only regrets that one day he will be thrown to play a nice guy so we can see if he too will take over this character. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that will not leave you intact. If you have not seen it yet, do it today!
