Without a doubt, 12 MONKEYS is one of the best science-fiction movies, and director Terry Gilliam is no stranger when it comes to the production of such cinematic originality. Apocalyptic movie in which you are completely charmed, 12 MONKEYS never gives up and you're guessing all the time. The excellent use of Philadelphia premises and netherworld sets creates a gothic sense of tragedy and two people caught in the right place at the right time. <br /> <br /> Bruce Willis defies his macho image and presents a real madman who is right, everything will happen. In fact, it is reasonable, but people of the future (or present, if you like) distort this guy's head during the journey, no wonder he is getting divorced. He was sent to World War I shortly after Beng sent him into the wrong year to learn how the Army of the Twelve Monkeys pulled away the annihilation of civilization as we know it. In the end, they do it well, and in what is really an unusual scenario that suits the performance, we can see Willis, Madeleine Stowe and the malevolent Brad Pitt, who have been appealed within 6 years. <br /> <br /> Stowe is sensual and robust, like a risky psychiatrist who is slowly beginning to realize that Willis may not be as depressed as it seems. The captivating element of the relationship between her and Willis is their "seeing" earlier, at another place or time. 12 MONKEYS is above all a time and madness in which futuristic people and present tense are immersed, when assassins and psychotic genius can change the world. <br /> <br /> The reflecting city of Philadelphia is a dark and gothic backdrop to the difficult situation of Willis to fulfill his mission, which, contrary to the usual Hollywood stereotype, is NOT meant to save the world. Collects information. The film also plays tricks on the viewer, putting Willis in a new setting in one fell swoop. It must have been an extremely difficult picture, but Gilliam seems to be a master of hard-filming. In a sense, he drops humor reminiscent of other great works, such as TIME BANDITS and BRAZIL. The screen is the canvas of this man and he knows how to paint a terrifying image of the world and its possible future in the mainstream atmosphere of large budget films. If you want a real madness and ironic tragedy, see 12 MONKEYS. <br /> <br /> ASSESSMENT: 9 out of 10
