Make a pinch of GOODFELLAS, mix it with THE GODFATHER, add some Roman mythology and a lot of low-toned comedies, and you have THE SOPRANOS, a mafia clan in the north of New Jersey. It's almost as much fun as pro wrestling. I am not the biggest fan of this program, but I admire the very complicated Tony Soprano by James Gandolfini, a psychopath with an occasional flash of conscience. I also came to admire the contribution of people like the gravelly Dom Chianese as a bewildered but murderous Uncle Junior, a gray-haired Tony Sirico as perpetually embarrassed Paulie and very beautiful Edie Falco as a two-faced hard-naive Carmela Sopran. Violence is sudden and graphic, the number of bodies is constantly increasing in each season, but often these are small moments that are most important here. Watch Pauli and nephew of Tony Christopher (Michael Imperioli, late with RIGHT and ORDER) when they get lost in Pine Barrens and sit down a bitter night in an abandoned Trutuck, both convinced that they had it.
