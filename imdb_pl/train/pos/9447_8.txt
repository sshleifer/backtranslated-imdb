An addictive drama of four men on the canoe down a distant river. They are pacifist Ed (Jon Voight), adventurous, brutal Lewis (Burt Reynolds), disgusting Bobby (Ned Beatty) and nice guy Drew (Ronny Cox). The first 40 minutes are great - there is an amazing sequence of banjos duels, an interesting game between the heroes and simply stunning panoramic photos of Vilmos Zsigmond. Then two hillbillies attack Ed and Bobby. One of them rapes Bobby ... and the journey becomes a nightmare. <br /> <br /> Simply unbelievable. The scenery is amazingly beautiful, but this terrifying violence takes place. To tell the truth, Beatty's rape never bothered me - I am very aware that she is fake despite a good game. This movie also shows how characters change - Ed has his pacifism test, Lewis gets weak, Bobby is violated by one of the people he used to mock at earlier, and Drew tries to keep his judgment. Directed by John Boorman is also very confident, and the sounds of the forest and the river help a lot in the mood. <br /> <br /> Acting is mainly good. Voight is fine at the helm - it was better. Beatty is fine too - but this is his debut film and he has the courage to take on such a risky role. Cox is very good, especially when things start to fall apart. And Reynolds is simply great - one of his best acting works EVER! As it was not nominated for an Oscar, it escapes me. Also Bill McKinney and Herbert Coward are too credible as hillbillies. <br /> <br /> A powerful movie - NOT for children. Try to see the uncommon version - the TV version is massacred. Also watching the letters is necessary to capture breathtaking images.
