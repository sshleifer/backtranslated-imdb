During the second viewing of this movie I like it even more than the first time. It is full of nuances and perceptions of life as quite ordinary and often timid, but what raises this film to a rare height, is focusing on small events in our lives, which we usually only deal with for a short time. Here, the film revolves around the celebration of these events, the meeting of the driver and tow customer of the truck, a runner hearing the crying child from the bushes. Dialogue, acting, casting and direction are great. No two fours, no great revelations. What I observed was how real the characters were for their basic nature and how their lives were strengthened when they were celebrated. Kudos for everyone involved in this, we need more "Big Canyons" in our lives. 9 out of 10.
