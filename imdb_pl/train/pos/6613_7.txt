Very unique animated film Sci-Fi and honestly love the uniqueness no matter which way it is better or worse. This French film is quite interesting to watch, some of the technique is innovative, like "Waking Life", which I have recently watched. <br /> <br /> It took me a lot of time to get used to the black and white style, but in the end I love it, the sketch-like images are really sophisticated! The contracted future world is a symbol of the ultimate goal of the human race that I love very much. <br /> <br /> The whole story is fine for Sci-Fi, not so intriguing, but it's OK, like some Hollywood products, a huge conspiracy about the eternity of a man, a somewhat banal and twisted end is not so convincing, some kind of development it's just too light and bland and the whole movie is too long. <br /> <br /> So I think I'm just in love with the style that shows this movie, others are not so good. <br /> <br /> About eternity of life I think that most people came to unanimity, that we do not want eternity, because it destroys the meaning of life, we value our lives because they are limited and meaningful if everyone can live forever, that's why the world will become disaster and chaos. Leaving someone you love is difficult and painful, but it is also a way to show that our life is real and all emotions fill life and make the world colorful and lively.
