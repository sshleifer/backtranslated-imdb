James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan play collaborators in a souvenir shop in Budapest, who really do not like it, not knowing that they are really nice buddies who have not met yet. <br /> <br /> A very charming romantic comedy, very addictive for two nice stars and very willing to help cast. The story is well written, and the film has this romantic innocence (I do not know how to explain it) that movies simply do not have. This can of course be compared to the recent "You Got Got Mail" and original prizes in every respect. <br /> <br /> It's a must see every Christmas, I can not think of a better way to start the Christmas season than this little gem.
