I like this Christmas specialty for me too. In 1989, I caught 2 records I found from a soundtrack, giving one to my sister and leaving the other to myself. It is now part of the holiday tradition of my family and I would love to be able to see the program again and not just remember it when I listen. <br /> <br /> Elsewhere it was noticed that John Denver made the show number at the Muppet Show and they made more than one special together. The good relationship between Denver and his indistinct companions is clearly seen here in a charming and fun show that's good for all ages.
