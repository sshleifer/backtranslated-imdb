It is said that Deanna Durbin invented teenagers. This first movie was one of the best. The humorous story depicts a charming 14-year-old Deanna, a beautiful girl with a wonderful voice, as "Miss Fixit" in a family divorced by divorce. For a summary of the story, see other IMDb entries, but soon Deanna and her two older sisters plan to leave Switzerland for America to prevent a re-marriage with their father. Thanks to the excellent cast, especially Barbara Read and Nan Gray as sisters, good directors and editing, the film manages to capture even one in subsequent scenes. Of the three songs of Deanna, only "Il Bacio" comes from the classical repertoire, but when she sings on stage at the police station, the place of the film in history is assured. At least for this viewer, who at the age of 15 was delighted with life with both Deanna and classical music. One of the many nice touches that appear in THREE SMART GIRLS is the short look of a drunk stretched neck in order to finally look at Deanna when the cops push him! One of the unfortunate results of the success of this film was that subsequent writers for Durbin's vehicles closed in the "Miss Fixit" theme, which quickly became obsolete. Deanna herself never did. Her attitude as an actress is more questionable than her charisma, which she certainly had. It seems to me that, like many other film personalities, it has replaced "naturalness" with the histrionic abilities it lacked. The trick worked well in 21 feature films.
