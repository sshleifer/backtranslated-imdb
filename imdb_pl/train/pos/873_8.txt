I watched this movie without expecting much and not knowing about it. I love it. A very good, tight plot, an intriguing hook in the form of an ugly, fat, deaf girl and a former opponent, and a pace that made everything flow unhurriedly. <br /> <br /> A much, much better movie than the same director de battre mon coeur s'est arreté, which was boring and unbelievable. <br /> <br /> The only thing that did not work was that the supposedly ugly, fat girl was neither ugly nor fat: certainly solid and far from conventional beauty, but with such a large figure on her face that she took over screen whenever it was on it. Magnificent. I want her to be in more movies and better than usual. I saw Gilles' wife and some mustache, and both looked like garbage, and I saw everything from De battre mon coeur s'est arreté, and that is certainly nonsense. It seems that a few are approaching, so I keep my fingers crossed.
