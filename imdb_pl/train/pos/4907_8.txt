This well-organized and imaginative production, refreshingly free of stereotypes, this somewhat quirky account of a close friendship that develops between a man and a boy in less than ideal conditions: a man who escaped a convict who kidnapped youth for his value as a hostage. Experimented by Alan Gibson with a great sense of a balanced narrative movement, the film provides freshness in almost every scene, like criminal Martin Steckert (Richard Harris), believing that his rejection of parole was particularly undeserved, he invented a complicated but ultimately successful escape plan, what his spontaneous nature comes to the fore, when he escapes to the residence on the lake of his childhood. Capricious Steckert, often falling in love with songs or dancing a few steps, gradually gains the trust and attachment of his prisoner, and when the police approach an inevitable confrontation, the imprisoned couple are seen as very similar in their reactions to the forms of rejection, as noted by the psychiatrist (Lindsay Wagner) assigned to assist the zealous police lieutenant (James Coburn), who is responsible for the hunt for Steckert and his "prisoner". This is a captivating story worth telling, a fast-growing and innovative adventure that benefits from Harris' excellent performance, great turns from Wagner, Coburn and Karen Black and Justin Henry as a kidnapped boy with the rightly capricious result of Wilfred Josephs and top-notch photos of Frank Watts, with all the material shot in the beautiful autumn province of Ontario.
