I rarely emerged from watching a movie with such a warm, happy feeling. I felt like I was with really good friends and had a great time! I really liked this movie. The acting was excellent, although I would have to mention Bill Nye in particular, because it gives absolutely flawless performance. Bill is a great actor and would like to see him in more films. Timothy Spall and Jimmy Nail are also favorites and they always love to watch them because they give such solid performance. And Billy Connolly, as usual, is wonderful. It was a great performance for all those interested. Such a refreshing experience to see a well-written, well-played and good-looking movie.
