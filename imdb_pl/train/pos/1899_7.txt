Arthur Bach needs to grow up, but unfortunately this is not the only thing he has to do. According to his unusually rich father, Arthur must marry some affluent Susan Johnson or cut off his family money (worth $ 750 million). The problem is that Arthur does not love Susan (though I hear he's making a good chicken) and she just got head over heels for the waitress and Linda Marolla, who works part-time. Artur is an interesting man. He is a really great kid, born in wealth, in which at least one person looks after him every second of every day. The work simply rubs Arthur in the wrong way - he likes to play, femininity and of course drink. Drinking gives Artur a kind of Jekyll-i-Hyde complex; and although it makes a lot of trouble, watching the screen is totally fun. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore is great in this movie as Arthur, earning an Oscar nomination and a Golden Globe Award for his performance. Moore is fantastic with comedy aspects of the movie, turning fun lines into unforgettable comedy gold, but he's also great at bringing Arthur to a relative level and makes the hero feel likeable. Moore has some help in the star department. Liza Minnelli is great as Lina, a thrilling man whom Arthur can not get enough of, and John Gielgud is great as Arthur's butler Hobson. Gielgud won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his role in this film and there is no question as to why. Hobson has a strong, dry stone and keeps his posture, but he always cares about Arthur - and Gielgud is perfect in this role. Steve Gordon's 1981 film "Arthur" is short and simple, but provides lots of laughter.
