It has fun jokes from all Cheech and Chong movies. This is the first one I've seen in these guys. It turned out that it is really good. My father actually told me to get it. WHAT A GREAT ROLE MODEL, and my GRANDMA actually bought for me, knowing how it is. What family I have. Well, this movie is pretty good and great to borrow when you want to see a good classic. But I must warn you that it is not funny. He has his moments, but not as much fun as "There's something about Maria." Check it anyway. I'm sure you'll laugh. Unless you're an anti-drug activist or something like that.
