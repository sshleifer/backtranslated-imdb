It was a good movie with a powerful message of love and redemption. I loved the change of my brother and the repercussions of this terrible disease for the family. Well-functioning and well-targeted. If there were any faults, I would have to say that the story showed a typical suburban family and their difficulties. What about all people from all cultural backgrounds? I would like to see a movie in which all these cultures are shown - as in real life. Nevertheless, the film has grown in value and understanding of how a disease can bring someone closer to its creator. I loved the movie and brought tears to my eyes
