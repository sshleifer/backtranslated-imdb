This was the first "Walking Tall" movie that I saw, I think in the movie theater for $ 2 along Hollywood Blvd. so I had no reference to the first part made by Joe Don Baker. I remember that I was shocked by the broken system of McNairy County and the brutality of the "redneck gangs." I was also amazed that one man decided he would not allow him to slip and leave to do something about it. Brave? I thought so - to the point that he sent shivers up my spine. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is a great story of American courage to get up and do something with a system that only serves its interests. I was very shocked by this and I think it is still one of the best movies of the hero / antihero genre that could be laugh, but it contains the latest movies, such as "The Punisher", but the more that it's true story. The last remake with "Rock" simply does not capture the real fire in the history of Buford Pusser. <br /> <br /> "Classic" that will definitely come back in the future.
