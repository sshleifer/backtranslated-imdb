OK, there are a lot of reviews here, what can I add? <br /> <br /> And so I will try. <br /> <br /> The reason why this is my favorite Scrooge is everything. Sets, outdoor costumes, costumes are so beautiful and authentic. The music is sweet. The auxiliary staff is very well made. One of my favorites is the narrator and nephew, played by Roger Rees. His restrained honesty is moving, and his voice is the sound of Christmas for me. David Warner is also a completely credible Bob Cratchit. His life is difficult, but remains positive and dignified. <br /> <br /> The best part is of course George C. Scott as Ebenezer Scrooge. Some said his portrait was too rough. I could not disagree any more. His exchange at the beginning, though cold or rough, was not beyond character. He is a terribly disappointed man whose heart has been hardened by changeable life and his own lust for wealth. <br /> <br /> In retrospection it is obvious that he is not surly. Here we see that there is hope for him. If he was not there, his partner Marley would never come because of him. In the end, we are not from us in hope. I think it's a HUGE part of what Dickens tried to say. When Scrooge looks at his dance with his employer from Belle, you see him smiling with regret, when he tells Belle in retrospection that he will go through life "with a smile on his face". Clive Donner was as smart as the director to let those moments in the movie. Sometimes they leave them on the editor's floor. <br /> <br /> And finally, his conversion is so full of joy that makes me cry with tears of joy EVERYONE sees it. His apology for Fred's nephew, so sincere and touching, is not only the spirit of Christmas, but also of humanity itself. The joy that Fred brings to his wife is so obvious. And the line that gets me every time, "God, forgive me for the time I wasted." <br /> <br /> Bravi tutti!
