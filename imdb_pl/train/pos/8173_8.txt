The splendor of this movie is that even a competent dentist is quite terrifying. This is one of the primary human fears. This film is a nightmare image that every child has to go through in the waiting room. Corbin Bernsen gives a surprisingly low score as a crazy dentist who probably tries to kill people, but only works on teeth, so it really does not work. On a particularly bloody scene, we find so much that the actor Earl Boen has completely damaged teeth with drills and so on, which is probably the worst way you can do when you're a deadly dentist. This is a typical situation of Brian Yuzna, not well written, but it is gore. The plot is tacky and sometimes it seems to be made up on the spot, but hey, it's a movie about deadly dentists, we all thought about it, but they did it first.
