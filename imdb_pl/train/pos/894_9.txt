This "Prodigal Son" and "Eastern Condors" are my favorite Sammo Hung movies. The Fat Dragon is thicker on this tour than in the "Condors", but is as sure as the director or actor. In fact, he is at the top of his form and delivers a destructive, brutal actor who offers half a dozen amazing sequences and can tell a compassionate, sweet love story. Love and romance are not the director's priorities here, but they serve as interesting additions to the action and guarantee that viewers will not hit the fast scroll button between physical encounters. <br /> <br /> The opening scene, which has a fun light saber duel, gives a solid but deceptive tone. The sequence in which the Sammy pedicab is hunted by the car is beautifully exposed and sweetened with a sharp, comical tone. The fast and furious battle between Sammo and Lau Kar Leung is a model of dazzling choreography and a sharp, perfect direction, and is easily one of its kind. Violence in the film grows slowly until finally, when the climactic game comes, we give in to the most brutal arguments we have ever seen in Sammo's production. Attack of the director / actor on Billy Chow and the house full of angry, dangerous opponents is a bone-splitting, physically punishable pleasure. <br /> <br /> Great at every level and one of the best martial arts films. <br /> <br /> A great result.
