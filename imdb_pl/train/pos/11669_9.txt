Being the prototype of the classic adventure film Errol Flynna and having a good story, and two more great stars in Maureen O'Hara (what a great beauty!) And Anthony Quinn, I can recommend this film to all who have even the slightest liking for romance and adventure. <br /> <br /> Hollywood at its best!
