Goebbels's motivation for withdrawal has not been investigated. In the aftermath of Stalingrad, the Reich decided on a "total war". This is mentioned in the film. Part of this was the use of women in the war effort that Germany had not done to a large extent before. The SS women's massacre would meet Goebbels with a huge proportion of public relations disaster. His preference was to make the problem disappear as quietly as possible, based on the fact that Jewish men can always be rounded up later. I understand that the majority survived the war. <br /> <br /> Another problem was the fact that the "Red" Berlin was never too enthusiastic about the Nazi case and had to be treated with caution. Again, the massacre of women could cost the Nazis for their average level of support in their capital. <br /> <br /> It is interesting that most SS uniforms showed patches that indicated that men were not German nationals, but came from Germany in other countries, such as Lithuania or Latvia
