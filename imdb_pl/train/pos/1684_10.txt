Tell me what you want about Andy Milligan - but if his family was even 10% as demented as the one in this movie, it could be worse. Unfortunately, the video printout of this movie contains sex scene inserts originally shot by the distributor in order to increase cash register attractiveness. Several times during the movie, the ugly music of Milligan and the silent film music suddenly end, and suddenly they care about the nice looking deputies for Milligan's actors and start doing it on the psychedelic 60 guitar. Scrolling forward is very easy if you try to pay attention to the original Milligan movie, which, unfortunately, is missing some of the action that has been cut to make room for the added sex scenes. What remains is still fascinating. I do not think I've ever seen a more hated mother in any movie.
