I saw this movie when the Mystery Science Theater ran it in 1993. This is the worst thing I have ever seen. It's so bad that thanks to the idiosyncrasies, this film has to get ten marks because you have to believe it. <br /> <br /> Whoever wrote this script with children in mind should be beaten. I mean, really, the Devil versus Santa? Visions of hell? A frightening laughing reindeer? Forced work of children with racial stereotypes? This is not Sesame Street, that's for sure. As Crow screams during MST3K, showing: "This is good, old" nightmare nightmare fuel! "<br /> <br /> There are lots of strange innuendos and twisted theology. Merlin (probably Arthurian Merlin) hangs with Santa Claus in his crazy castle in the clouds (ie Heaven). Saint Nicholas speaks of a child Jesus and sends letters to "Mr. Stork" for children who ask for siblings. Around the castle there are symbols that look like pentagrams or RAF stars. <br /> <br /> My best friend and I have been watching her every year since 1993 and we're giving up anyone who can keep him for 2 hours to see him.
