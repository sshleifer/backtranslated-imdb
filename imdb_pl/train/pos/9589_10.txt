Growing up in New York on the club scene at the turn of the 80s and 90s, I can personally say that this is one of the most important documentary films shot at this time in this period. No Madonna had the idea of ​​Voguing, but where did it come from! Instead of bothering each other with violence or ugly fights with cats, voguing allowed people to "fight" within anything that does not touch them (which would justify automatic disqualification). Seeing such extremely talented / well organized "throws" in clubs, it was very spectacular and all the big names from that time are here ... Pepper La Beija, Paris Duprée, Xtragavaganza, etc ... all commemorated by such songs as songs by Malcom McLaren "Deep in Vogue" ... did not matter who you are or where you come from, when you went through this door to the "magic kingdom" in a sense you became part of something bigger than you alone / you were important / and most importantly creating your own moves and imagination ... and anyone from anywhere could be King (or Queen) how it could be. Words and jokes were as sharp as movements on the floor. All the tension, excitement and magic of this very urban NYC energy are captured in this film. EXCELLENT!!! PLEASE ON DVD for the world to see! Thank you!
