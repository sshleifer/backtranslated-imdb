It is difficult to say what comes out, the charm and energy of James Cagney, or the excesses that open the mouth of Busby Berkeley's three big showbies. I give him a tie, with Footlight Parade, one of the funniest and fastest musicals from the early thirties. Although the film clearly belongs to Cagney, Joan Blondell adds enormously to this good-natured story. <br /> <br /> And what is the plot? It's about Chester Kent (Cagney) who produces musicals, and which just finishes its activity when the gadgets take over. He begins to do Prologues, live music entertainment on stage before the beginning of the film. He comes up with an idea to do bigger and more, moving them around the country. It is a sphere of fire and ideas and it needs all the ideas that it can get to constantly produce these things. But the rival is spying on him and stealing his ideas; Nan Prescott (Blondell), his wise secretary, loves him, but he is too busy; a girl in an office in round black-rimmed glasses (Ruby Keeler) wants to dance; his wife appears saying that despite everything, he will not divorce him; the blond goldsmith kicks him in the hooks; his partners betray him ... my God, what's next? All this can sound like much to digest, but everything happens quickly, with Cagney bouncing, rolling, rolling, cracking fingers, barking orders, and sometimes - until the great last number, when he goes on the whole singing and dancing - taking a step or two to show how it's done. <br /> <br /> Instead of "Let's make a show, gang" we have "We need to build three concerts in three days, so close the door and start trying." These three superprologies will contain 40 chorins, spectacular effects and will mean a rich contract, with forty Kent departments in luxury movie houses ... the entire perimeter of Apollo cinema! Exhaustion threatens, painful feet, but all those stained choirs in scant costumes (including Ann Sothern and Dorothy Lamour, you can quickly see Sothern, but Lamour is more general) stay on course, dancing their hearts, giggling, barking and looking extremely distasteful. <br /> <br /> And then the curtains are raised when each Prologue is presented in separate cinemas, one after the other of the same evening, with the owner of the Apollo circuit, who decides whether he will save Chester's Skin or not tonight. <br /> <br /> The first is "Honeymoon Hotel" with Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler in a 9-minute production number that includes many healthy lasciviousities, with brides and grooms (some may even be married), bedrooms and beds and door with "Do Not Disturb" signs. <br /> <br /> Then to the next theater and 11 minutes "By a Waterfall", which probably caused the Warner Brothers accountants to worry about bankruptcy. This number is too big - dozens of floating girls, trees, fountains, a huge cave with slides, a giant puddle - you would never have thought that Depression was. Berkeley pulls out all his tricks - synchronization, human patterns, legs and arms, doing all kinds of precise things - and he does it in the water, with lots of underwater photography. Girls are some games. They come smiling with water in their eyes and they are still in their tracks. The whole thing must have been incredibly difficult and exhausting. Ruby Keeler, who has several quick shots in the water, is the only person who looks a little cautious. <br /> <br /> And finally the final ... 11 minutes of Cagney dancing and singing with Keeler to "Shanghai Lil", with different girls from the bar and their clients, unusual that the races are mixed up. At the bar, Cagney and Keeler dance, dance on the table, fight Cagney. There are what looks like fifty or sixty marching marines, hupping back and forth, rifles thrown and caught. Then ... it's true ... a human image of Franklin Roosevelt and the NRA eagle. This may be the only Hollywood music production ever performed by Roosevelt, a large federal agency and a group of sexy Chinese prostitutes. <br /> <br /> It's entertainment, people. Great! <br /> <br /> Of course, Chester's Prologues receive a big deal, and Nan gets Chester. The film is full of juicy stereotypes that make us smile. Ruby Keeler is so captivating that she frankly throws out her arms that you want to help her with. Joan Blondell makes us forget about many Hollywood women who could have been more beautiful, but they had much less talent and personality. The film, however, belongs to Cagney, who grabs him and shakes him, and to Berkeley, a man for whom there was never too much.
