Bug's life is a very good animated feature. This movie is intended for younger children, but it's also a great movie for people of my age. The story concerns an ant named Flik. He brought havoc to his colony when he destroyed food that was meant for better grasshoppers. He is banished and needs to find more mistakes to fix the mess. This movie is a classic because it's a good movie and it's a Pixar movie. Animation is brilliant especially in the late 90's. The story is good, but just some more details. The voice is good, as in most animated films. The music is nice to listen to. Nothing special, but he was nominated for one of the music categories. In general, this movie struck me with admiration. It's a good movie for all families. I rate this film 10/10.
