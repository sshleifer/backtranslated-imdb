This movie scared me when I was a kid. This is not "Citizen Kane", but he has his moments. The scene of ripping the arm is good. The plot is good, even if the characters are not - it may have something to do with acting. Put some of the best people in the roles and then see what you get. It was one of those photos, editing (not enough) and distribution in several months of movies. It is a classic low-budget science fiction and deserves it. I rated it on 9 other films of this genre and age.
