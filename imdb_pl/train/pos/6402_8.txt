I thought that this move was very good. There were a few things that were less than perfect, but overall I was quite surprised. The courtroom scene finally seemed a bit unreal, but it was real enough to be entertaining. I discovered that the movie conveyed difficulties related to military training and related victims. Being a military pilot I could refer to many of these parts.
