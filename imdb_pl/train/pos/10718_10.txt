Spacecamp is my favorite movie. It's a great story and inspires others. <br /> <br /> The actress was excellent, and my wife and I went to Lea Thompson in Cabaret many years later because of her performance in the film. It is a pity that the Challenger accident delayed and injured the film. <br /> <br /> The 20th anniversary of the Challenger accident is approaching. I knew one of Challenger's astronauts from childhood on the Carnegie Mellon campus, where my father went to school; I also know a close friend of a dead pilot. <br /> <br /> I was a National BSA technical review for Boy Scout Astronomy Merit last year and I still consider Spacecamp a great movie that I recommend to Teachers' scouts a badge for space-related services. <br /> <br /> Again I came across a dead astronaut as an adult and followed the technical training schedule that we created when the Challenger broke out. I ended up with Willard Rockwell and his engineers, "invisible," going by accident after the Astrotech shareholders' meeting, so I'm closer to the accident and all the similarities to the film. I made sure I was a good student and graduated four years later, surprisingly, according to the recommendation of Rockwell's engineer, who told them not to fly the Challenger in 1986, and later to build Endeavor.
