(spoilery ??) <br /> <br /> I was not sure what to think about the movie. Not too much movie for children. You must definitely watch with a parent because it includes death and death. But I was surprised that it amused me a bit. <br /> <br /> I was a little disappointed with the 81 minutes we had. (even less without credits) And the trailer makes you think that the rodent is the main creature. But unfortunately, they torture him. Until the end of the movie. These two obstacles docked the movie with 2 stars. But I recommend a movie. Even for the sequel. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 9/10 Entertainment: 7/10 Reproducibility: 7/10
