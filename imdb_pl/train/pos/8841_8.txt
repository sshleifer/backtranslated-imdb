"Before the devil knows you're dead" is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time <br /> <br />. Aktorstwo z <br /> <br /> excellent team cast is amazing. Philip Seymour Hoffman focuses on outstanding performance and is electrically excited every time he is on the screen. Ethan Hawke responds to him with the stage, and Albert Finney simply bites the screen. Marisa Tomei is, however, underestimated, but she looks amazing for 42 years. The script is perfect, a nonlinear plot, but quite easy to follow. Sidney Lumet, though not known for his hits, turned out to be a gem in it!
