I consider this film to be tight from the very beginning. When Miss Stanwyck begins her narrative, it's only a few minutes until you realize that trouble is coming. Abandoned area, a lock on the abandoned door of the gas station, everything sets you up to wait ... it comes here. At first you think it will be about a little boy, but you start breathing too early, watching the tide. I think that this movie is really stressful, even though I watched it before and was prepared to solve it. Now a movie that can keep you in suspense even when you've seen it, deserves some special evaluation, or maybe a white cube award?
