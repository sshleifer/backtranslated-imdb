Everyone should see this movie because each of us is somehow broken and can help us become aware of it 1) My life is not as bad as I thought it was and 2) How important it is to welcome a child in need. There are so many of them. Thinking that the film is based on a real person has caused us to think deeply about life and how the world is and will always be. Damaged, but corruption does not have to reach your home. We all have a choice! I definitely recommend this ... and when you are on it, I would like to throw "The Color Purple" and "Woman, Thou Art Loosed" by TD Jakes. <br /> <br /> These are all movies based on life and giving us a look at life.
