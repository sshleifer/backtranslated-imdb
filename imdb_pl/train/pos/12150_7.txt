This film is one of many Kung Fu action films produced in Asia in the late 1970s - early 1980s, full of cheap sound effects, dubbed dialogue and instant martial arts. But unlike most movies of this genre, it also has a decent story and many great comedies. When the workers of the dyeing factory are forced to leave their jobs by Manchu stalkers, they employ a conformist (Gordon Liu) who tries to scare them away. When his attempt fails miserably, he delves into the Shaolin Temple to learn to fight really. Instead of making him a Kung-Fu student, the Master instead orders him to build a scaffolding to cover the roofs of all 36 chambers. It turns out that while performing these nefarious tasks (laying and tying bamboo poles), you learn the skills of being a Kung-Fu expert! It's a bit like a Karate Kid, when Mr. Miagi teaches Daniel the basics of karate, telling him to do routine homework - "Wax on, wax up" and so on. From the beginning to the end there are lots of great comedies, and finally a lot of action, when Gordon Liu once again face up with his persecutors from Manchu. "This time it's not just tricks - it's the real thing!" Liu declares, proudly banging his chest. If you like classic Kung Fu movies, you do not want to miss it!
