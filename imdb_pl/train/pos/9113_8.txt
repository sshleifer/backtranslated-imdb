Probably the first Portuguese movie that I saw in my life, and I liked it. The conspiracy is related to how young army officers took power in Portugal in 1974. To finally defeat the fascist government of Caetano and end the wars in the colonies, i.e. Mozambique, Angola and Guinea (Bissau) - Cape Vert. Most of the events shown in the film reflect the behavior of officers and soldiers to carry out a coup d'Ã©tat of oppressed people who were very pleased with this new development and freedom, the resistance of the Caetano people, and in a subtle way by most conservative officials, including Spinoli, who took up the new position President. The Portuguese Revolution can be remembered for the actions of several young officers, but for me the most interesting part of the film was that the young captain expressed the opinion that Portugal should develop democratically, and it was the country that reached several years after this coup. or revolution. The film also shows that officers and soldiers never wanted to kill anyone; even the most serious enemies were respected at the end.
