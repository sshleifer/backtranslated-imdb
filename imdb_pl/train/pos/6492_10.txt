I'm not a very good writer, so I will say it briefly. World at War is the best documentary from World War II that I've seen. I saw various documentaries from the Second World War (not only English / North American) and this documentary seems to be the most complete document from the Second World War I have seen. I think he can talk a bit more about the Great Depression and why Hitler came to power, but he is doing a very good job in covering the war. It seems to be complete and objective / just for everyone. It does not exaggerate or undermine the roles of various nations. It has many original recordings, including colorful film material and many eyewitnesses (created in the 1970s, when much more lived). He has great music and a narrator. All-in-All I gave this 10/10 because it's so good. (I have not seen special offers in the DVD version, so I can not comment on them)
