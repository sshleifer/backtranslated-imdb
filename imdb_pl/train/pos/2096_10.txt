With the advent of IMDb, this overlooked movie can now find an interested audience. Why? Because the users who carry out the quest for the double Oscar winner, Glenda Jackson, can find "Return of the Soldier". Likewise, Julie Christie, the Oscar winner, can do the same. Ann-Margret fans can give the title a click, just like those who are looking for the career of the great Alan Bates. Not to mention the extra bonus for a heavyweight movie with Ian Holm and Frank Finlay. Each movie with such a large number of notables is rewarded by IMDb, taking into account all the links that are taking place here. So why is not this movie on DVD? Do the producers not realize that the Internet Movie Database is a marketing gift for such a movie? And "Return of a soldier" is definitely a jewel waiting to be discovered. Move, people.
