Well, the movie is not exactly "funny". <br /> <br /> Okay, I admit, there are a few HUMOROUS lines, but definitely nothing that is not fun. For example: Just before the exciting sex scene between Eleniak and one of her men's costumes, sh is handcuffed to the post of the bed and can not take off her shirt. Before he left the room to retrieve the key, he tells her: "Okay, do not go anywhere." <br /> <br /> See, funny, but not funny. <br /> <br /> The plot and acting is quite good. <br /> <br /> But Erika Eleniak definitely steals the show. She is hot and sexy, and there is a really steamy scene with her that can not be stopped from rewinding and re-watching. <br /> <br /> There are other very sexy scenes with her and she has very provocative lines. <br /> <br /> Generally 5 stars. I would give only three, if not Erika Eleniak.
