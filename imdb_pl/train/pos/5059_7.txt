We watched the cassette and found it fascinating. Without knowing anything about this true story, I thought, "Oh, no, P.Brosnan as an Indian (" red "Indian in the film), what a bad choice" until I discovered the truth about Gray Owl. The film is doing a good job of demonstrating the dignity of these indigenous peoples and undermining racist myths about them. And Annie Galipeau, WOW, what a beauty and a very persuasive Indian woman (I believe she is French-Canadian, she certainly returns to such well-known speech of such people). Despite the detached, grunting style of Brosnan, he finally convinces himself that he is a passionate, devoted man. The conspiracy is a bit weak because it shows how it changes from animal to trapper. Good movie, highly recommended.
