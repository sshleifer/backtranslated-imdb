This film about "maturing" tells the experiences of two young girls, Dani and Maureen, who learn about the life and love of one fatal summer. <br /> <br /> Directed by Robert Mulligan, famous for his excellent work in "To Kill a Mockingbird", the film will never go into a false note. All acting is great. As Dani Reese Witherspoon makes a stunning film debut. Watching this beautifully photographed and superbly directed and edited movie, I felt that I was looking through the window at reality and not watching a movie. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie at least 5 times and I can honestly say it is one of the best films ever made about being young, in love and experiencing feelings, challenges and changes in a young adult age. Families with children between the ages of 10 and 15 years should watch them together and use them as a discussion material, because it raises a number of issues regarding competing with siblings, coping with falling in love, parenting duties, etc.
