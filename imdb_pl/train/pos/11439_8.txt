OK - up to 2 versions of this movie. There were 2 people involved in the creation - John Korty and Bill Couterie (George was only the producer - he did not really have any such voice in the film - he just helped with the money) - Bill Couterie's "adult" version was possible. John Korty did not like or approve this version (as it was done behind his back). Thanks to the Ladd movies that were not available, they did not advertise the movie and threw all their cash for the ad for "The Right Stuff", hoping it would pass them; ... and it was not like that. Yes, this movie never had a chance. When "Twice" reached the cable (HBO) - they showed the drums with the Bill version, and John threatened that the lawsuit if it will be shown (did you notice that the "adult" version was not used for a long time?). Showtime got the "clean" version. The version on the video tape and laser disc is a version approved by John (who has more power than Bill). It is a pity, because the "adult" version is actually better and makes more sense. But it's VERY doubtful whether it will ever be released in this version on DVD (or any other format without a bootleg). We apologize for the disappointment of everyone. I know all this information because I was the president of the Twice Upon A Time Fan Club (I still have a lot of movie items - it was used in the "adult" version in the mailbox, but it was stolen - only now have a partial copy of HBO). 8 stars for the "adult" version - 5 for the "clean" version. Any other questions, just ask.
