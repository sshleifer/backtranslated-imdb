Lost contains something interesting for everyone. You can say a lot about this series and you've been told a lot, so I will not be the one who spells it all out for you again. Just read the people who loved it and you'll know why you want to watch it. A nice feature of this series is that it is completely new. There are not many movies - and even fewer - series based only on the subject, but Lost lives proudly. It is unexplained, and if you combine it with an exotic location, nice twists, excellent cast and good format (present and past combined in single episodes), you will get a series in which each episode is a story about it, but part of a larger story. You want to have an insight into all the characters, you want to see the overall picture and you want to know where the writers will lead you. The result of this is that it is a series that does not let you go. In a more skeptical tone, the series fell slightly in season 2, probably because of their own success. It is well known that Lost was written for only one season and when there was overwhelming success, the writers were also overwhelmed. In my opinion, they made a mistake by adding more secrets and higher pace in season 2, and then solved these (or at least partially) those from season 1. At the end of the second season you ended with a great deal of secrets, twists and unexplained phenomena, but the viewer only has so much. However, the difference between season 2 and 3 was enormous. Season 3 gave away many insights to partially replace them with new questions. And that's exactly what they should write; you want to tilt from one twist of the story to the next, do not crash through the entire tsunami secrets, and then select a few to explain to the viewers. They got it in season 3 and bring the promising future of the series in season 4. It's good to see that such a different format of the series can be so popular.
