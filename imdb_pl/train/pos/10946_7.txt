Do not listen to primitive critics who are probably bitter players still painful because of Silverman's roasting infamously on the Spike TV Video Game Awards a few months ago, "The Sarah Silverman" is wonderfully bizarre, surreal, immature, funny and better suited to the Adult Swim product line . If Silverman suppresses the youthful "doody", jokes and highlights the darker, more vile overtones that have been heard so far, we can have one of the greatest cult comedies since the cancellation of "Strangers With Candy". But just watching the pilot, his solid, not outstanding, unconventional dark comedy / musical, but with great potential. <br /> <br /> Silverman created a funny female heroine - a prettier, younger, Jewish Princess in the version of the late great Jerri Blanka, and the exhibition features one of the most unconventional, non-stereotypical homosexual performances I have ever seen on television. Early reviews suggest that the next few episodes will exceed the pilot level, so I can not wait to see how this program is developing.
