From the author of "What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?" And "Hush .. Hush, Sweet Charlotte", this end of the horror of the sixties has an amazing and fun fun. Micheál Macliammóir makes a bit of Victor Buono, but too often the movie is wobbling dangerously close to the evil musical ... halfway there is a particularly horrible recital for children. Debbie knocks, tangos and tricks up Harlow, while Winters' religious fanatic has a lesbian advantage for her. Agnes Moorehead works as an evangelist. The weaver has nothing to do - and even has to pay a gigolo to dance with Debbie.
