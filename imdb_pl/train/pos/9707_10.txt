About a year ago, I finally gave up on American television. I thought about giving up television altogether until a friend who lived in England showed me programs that included The Office, Extras, Blackadder and The League of Gentlemen. Then I decided to go to British television. Of all the performances presented above, The League of Gentlemen is certainly the darkest and twisted of all, providing guilty laughter and material not found in any other comedy I've seen. Among the characters are the most unhappy marriage, a butcher who puts ingredients in meat that are not spoken (probably for the best), a mad couple who looks at the local store, which is intended only for the local population and the worst vet. This program is one of the best I've seen.
