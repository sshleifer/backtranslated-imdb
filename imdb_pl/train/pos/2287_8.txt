This film pleasantly surprised me. He has a moving, slightly off-center approach that never loses any attention. This is a movie I've never heard of, but if you want a "sleeper", that's it. Great writing, production and acting. I highly recommend it to recipients who want something thought out. Nick Nolte, Sheryl Lee and Alan Arkin are wonderful. Why was not this movie made again?
