It was one of the best concerts in the history of television. Full of secrets and intrigue, twists and turns. Compulsive watching. I was lucky to see it in Britain. They could have an erroneous order of the episode, I do not remember, but at least it worked at the regular time each week. My girlfriend and I have come across a trailer and none of us is a big fan of American series. <br /> <br /> After the pilot we knew that it was something special. We missed some episodes, and for a week you were sad and crazy, losing those lol. <br /> <br /> Great casting, great game. Gary Cole was absolutely brilliant, even better than his role as Custer. Lucas Black turned out to be an amazing performance for a kid, and Paige Turco was also the best for her since Party of Five. And, of course, Nick Searcy, as a longtime assistant to the Sheriff. <br /> <br /> Yes, there were some confusing and embarrassing fragments that I suppose would be explained later, and would undoubtedly be in the later series. This made the ending poor and it could be said that they killed him. They made us go CO? Why did they do it with one of the best concerts ever? Shoot exec.
