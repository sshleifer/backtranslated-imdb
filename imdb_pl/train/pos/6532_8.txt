I think a part of this movie has been created ... and is aimed at us players who play all Nancy Drew computer games. There have been many videos based on video games recently and I think about it in one of them. <br /> <br /> So this movie does not follow any book. But he follows the parts of the games. I buy and play every Nancy Drew game whenever it appears. And the games come from HerInteractive and are designed for "girls who are not afraid of mice!" And some of these games have indeed won gold awards for parents. They are not only fun, but you can even learn something while playing. <br /> <br /> I took my two children with me to see it and they loved it! 10 years. The old lady started playing her first game Nancy Drew the day before, when I took her to the movie, and she had a great time playing this game. And I was right ... not only did she love the movie, but she could not wait to come home to finish her first game and start another one. <br /> <br /> My other daughter is only 7 years old and she loved the movie, but she is still too young to play games, but she likes to watch her sister playing sometimes to see what's going on. <br /> <br /> The games are based on children aged 10 and over. All games usually have nice reviews to go down and are classified as adventure games. For more information on games, just check out HerInterative Nancy Drew games. So, personally, I thought the movie was pretty good and I'll buy it when it comes out on DVD.
