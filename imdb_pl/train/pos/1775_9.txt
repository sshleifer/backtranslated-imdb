I often wonder why this series has been slammed shut. I thought he was brilliant and very cleverly written and made. I think that in time he will come to see in the light he deserves, that is, if he ever delivers it. Many young comedic actors have appeared here and everybody has come for bigger things. Perhaps this fact will make people aware of its value and will have to be released. Sally Phillips, Simon Pegg, Peter Serafinowicz and not only Julian Rhind-Tutt from the extremely successful Green Wing. Writers Graham Linehan and Arthur Matthews are the two best writers of the contemporary comedy. Anyone who can produce comedies like Father Ted would not be able to write something that is not worth publishing. If it is ever released, I will definitely buy it.
