I think this movie was probably a lot more powerful when it debuted for the first time in 1943. Though it now seems a bit polite and static to raise it to size. The film takes place in 1940 - just before the US entered the war. Paul Lukas plays a very serious and dignified head of his family. He is a German who spent seven years fighting the Nazis and avoiding capture. Bette Davis is his very forgiving and long-suffering wife who, from time to time, can raise and raise children. When the film begins, they cross the border from Mexico to the USA and for the first time in years they will relax and stop running. <br /> <br /> The problem for me was that the family was also perfect and too decent - making them seem like obvious positive propaganda instead of a real family suffering from real problems. Although it had a very noble purpose at the time, it seems false today. In particular, the incredibly strange and extremely scriptural dialogue used by children simply did not work. It sounded more like anti-fascism speeches than the voices of real children. As a result, they were very annoying - especially the youngest, who sometimes came out as a brat. The only ones who really sounded were Bette Davis and her extended American family, as well as a Romanian scumbag living with them (though he did not have a noticeable accent). <br /> <br /> It's really hard to believe that the ultra-famous Dashiel Hammett wrote this dialog because it simply does not sound faithful. The story was based on the art of his lover, Lillian Hellman. And the basic idea of ​​the plot and plot is good ... but sometimes the dialog box is just bad. Overall, an interesting curio and movie with great moments ... but that's really everything.
