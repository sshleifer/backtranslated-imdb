Of course, because of the great pictures and amazing sound, this is a great "show" home theater disc, but it is also a moving drama, as well as an information document. Parallel stories that intertwine throughout the movie will interest all viewers. Both young, old, boys and girls will find it deep down, we are all fans of motorization, especially high-performance indium machines, which are the result of generations of blood, sweat, tears, ingenuity and perseverance. The soundtrack by Mark Knopfler and Ry Cooder is perfectly matched to graphics and content. I do not want to reveal the ending, but the last sequence leading to Quincy Jones's "Days Like These" can simply bring a tear to the eye. Be happy!
