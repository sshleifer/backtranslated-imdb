A tremendously underrated black comedy, the best of a series of great guignol movies that you can watch for "Baby Jane." Reynolds and Winters are the mothers of young convicted murderers (a nod to "coercion") who flee to hide in Hollywood. They run a school for would-be clips, a group of cheerful, talented children who are visited by terrible mums. Debbie, in her blond wig ("I'm Harlow, you're more Marion Davies" tells Winters) leads the kids to their concert and wins wealthy father, Weaver. She also makes a wonderfully fun tango, and above all gives exceptional performance, unlike anything she has done before. The atmosphere is a great combination of comics and amazingness. It looks great with beautiful details from the 30's. Lots of cute flicks in Hollywood and a terrifying movie tot. Micheal MacLiammoir has the ball as the head coach of the drama: "Hamilton Starr", he murmurs "two r, but nonetheless prophetic." See it and love it.
