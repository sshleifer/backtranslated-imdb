This series was exactly what you would expect from Mr. Spielberg. It's really one of those frightening, funny, children's shows you will not forget. Like Outer Limits (another great program), this little series does what little can do. It was great and it deserved longer running. It was a great performance that even children could watch, although some of them were a little scary when they wanted to be, but all had morality at the end (like Twilight Zone) that made you realize the situation you did not want to end up in those you did. I remember watching some of them in Sci-Fi when I was 10, and even now I'm still enjoying watching them whenever I can. A really fun, clever show. I loved it and I'm still doing it.
