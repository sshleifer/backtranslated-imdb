Sometimes I get bored reading reviews of some of the lesser-known Hitchcock movies, because almost everyone starts with someone saying that this movie is grossly overlooked or is a hidden Hitchcock jewel or a real Hitchcock big or different genre, if only - people would prefer - they watched - it - they - would - they saw - that - it - is - great - Hitchcock - the movie - just - how - a lot - how - Vertigo - North - by - Northwest - Psycho - Rear - window - etc.) Having said that I would just like to say that if - only - people - will be - watched - then - they - will - see - that - it - great - Hitchcock - movie - just - how - much - how - Vertigo - North - by - North -school - Psycho - Rear - Window - etc. <br /> <br /> Now it can be a little exaggerated, the Ring is not even covered by the imagination in the same league as each of the films listed above twice, but in comparison with other movies that H itchcock recorded at the turn of the 20th and 30th, I really think that â€¢ The Ring is one of the best photographed and made films in most of them. As an almost completely new director, the dream sequences and great editing segments are amazing, showing why Hitchcock generated so much attention at the beginning of his career. <br /> <br /> It is admitted that the film begins with things, a very disturbing spectacle of a stupid black circus performer (and I use the idiot in a definitive way, like Stephen King so often) having eggs and fruit thrown at him by the crowd the most classic-looking white people. I suppose it just illustrates how incredibly different circuses and people were, but I think it's one of the most hideous sequences in every Hitchcock movie I've seen. <br /> <br /> The main attraction in the circus is a fighter who claims he is able to knock every man into one round, but when he meets his game, he is against a man who challenges his authority not only in the boxing ring, but also in the ring around his wife's finger. So it starts with a funny, if not very tense, challenge for the love of one woman who seems to sway from one man to another effortlessly and without thought. <br /> <br /> (spoilers) There is, for example, a scene in which her husband looks down on her when she is being released late at night, and just before entering the building, she is persuaded into the car for a kiss. This kiss is never explained, and the fact that even at the end, when it turns out to be faithful to his husband or at least ultimately chooses him, they look into each other's eyes, but in reality they do not kiss each other. <br /> <br /> The movie is certainly beautifully photographed, even more than a few films that Hitch released in the following years. There is also a performance by Gordon Harker as a coach of Jacek's one round, who in his stone expressionism very often reminds me of the brilliant Buster Keaton. Hitch leaves it a bit ambiguous, but it's a great sample of his early work.
