Care Bears Movie 2: The new generation is not a bad movie at all. In fact, I really like it. Yes, I admit that dialogue is trivial, and history is sometimes poorly told. But Darkheart, though very dark, is a convincing, shape-changing villain, and Hadley Kay did a great job of expressing him. Speaking of the game, it was great, nothing wrong with that. The animation is colorful, and some of the visual elements, especially at the beginning, were breathtaking. The songs and scores are adorable, especially Growing Up and Forever Young, the latter has always been my favorite of them. Taking care of the bears I like is cute and the children are well done. And the ending is a real tear squeezer. All in all, harmless fun for kids. 8/10 Bethany Cox
