That's what I chose on the DVD and watched it again. I love bright colors and dark paintings. He is not a big fan of Beatty, but it is an excellent popcorn movie. Pacino is amazing, as always, and this movie marked the time when Madonna was absolutely the sexiest of her. I would like her to get stuck in the gaze of "Breathless" for some time. The first really big role of Charlie Korsmo, other than "What about the bob?". The make-up effects were then innovative and in most cases still persist. Beautiful landscapes and moods take you directly to the comic. Cars, dressing rooms, buildings and even streetlights and a great tone, not to mention the perfect lighting, although scenes with lots of red can be a bit annoying because they tend to blur a bit. I just want Beatty to have a chance to make a sequel. All in all, a few hours of fun.
