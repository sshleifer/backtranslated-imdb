I lost count of how many reviews I wrote on Slaughter High. I read a lot of bad guys and I will say now that this is a fantastic movie. Simon Scuddamore gained fame in a short time thanks to his well-known suicide, and although it was his only film, he made the movie so great. At first, I did not know anything about Simon until I read the review of his suicide. Then I found out because of the current website www.IMDb.com was born in 1957 in Dayton, Ohio. Simon could play the most pathetic character known to man, but his real life certainly had its strengths and weaknesses. He did a good acting job, who can not agree? I always wondered how he felt when showing himself naked in the movie. It must have been embarrassing at least. I saw this movie for the first time when I was 12 in the sixth grade. I agree with some tips, as if the girl did not take a bath after someone was murdered and the secondary schools do NOT have bath tubs! I think Caroline Munro, who was 36 at the time, was the only other star who had a dignified acting talent, and unfortunately, for Simon's death, he did not make any future films. The reason (s) for his suicide are a secret and I hope that they will be discovered in the near future. While doing math on his website, he tells you that he was 29 when he made Slaughter High. He looked like a teenager. I give this film two thumbs up, the best horror movie. Probably because of their terrible activity, others have not been famous in the film industry. -Jacob Young
