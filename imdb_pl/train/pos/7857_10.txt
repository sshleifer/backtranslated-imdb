This film does not cease to engage and move, even in 2008, On the audience familiar only with modern overproduced sounds and techniques improved by computer. <br /> <br /> The experience of the film viewer from 1922, Who could only see it in the cinema with others on the big screen had to be a really deep and completely rewarding experience. <br /> <br /> You have to ask if the filmmaker can make a two-hour silent movie today and make it interesting and achieve the same tempo and structure balance as the movie. The quiet filming of the film was pure art, it had to focus attention on its structure, direction and operation - there was no complement to words or computer disturbances. A silent or uninteresting silent film is unobtainable. <br /> <br /> This film should be placed in a context for those who may be concerned about the Christian themes. This is not a "Christiana" movie, it does not sell anything. These themes, in reference to current moral norms, often appear in this era - also the church on Sunday was a national past time, Christianity was given in most households, so the film presents only a normal life as it was then. The themes would then be real and deep. <br /> <br /> This is very strange, given the strong support for good Christian thinking about this particular film (and it is not the teaching of religion to anyone, only emphasizing the difference between hypocrites and honest people) that in 1922 the pastor in an open debate with a film industry representative with a large crowd, he condemned Pickford as an example of immorality, along with several others he mentioned. NY Times 1922. <br /> <br /> Maybe they should have watched this movie, which also appeared in 1922 and learned a few lessons. <br /> <br /> Pastor complained that the film industry began the church's turnout dropped by 500,000. However, the film's representative made the following comments; this attendance in salons has also dropped, that much more pastors in prisons than actors (fact) and that the selection of several examples among many was not representative of the whole. <br /> <br /> So there was a battle between the church and the film industry in the first days of the film. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie about being honest and faithful family friends and willingness to make sacrifices. Mary Pickford, naive, honest, feisty, full of happiness and joy, loyal, humorous and quiet victim - although poor and uneducated, she represented a perfect character. This, however, is not pushed to the throat, but is gradually revealed in the film. <br /> <br /> This is similar to some contemporary Chinese films in which the characters slowly, lazily reveal themselves during the movie and this is the pace that creates a stronger connection with the character. <br /> <br /> It has a smooth, even tempo for the first half, which creates all the elements of the last section. The last 30 minutes are great film production and this should be appreciated without the benefits of sound and dialogue - it was achieved thanks to skillful acting and great direction. It is sometimes surprising to realize that you have not heard a word at the end of the movie, but it seems that you have heard everything. <br /> <br /> Supporting cast played great performances, especially Gloria Hope, Jean Hersholt and Lloyd Hughes. <br /> <br /> The last few minutes are typical of Pickford when he goes outside under the pretext of sweeping the snow, almost perfect balance and ending. This is a special type of touching humor that should not be underestimated. Chaplin often used this device and copied some of the Pickford company. <br /> <br /> Another special remark about the silent movies, especially Pickford films, is that the star often has to hold the camera for most of the film without the audience becoming bored or bored, and the actors are excessively exposed. The fact that Pickford is usually the center of attention for most of her films, but people still can not get enough of it, is a testament to her excellent acting ability.
