DANIEL DAY-LEWIS performs an amazing job by playing Christy Brown, an artist who grew up with cerebral palsy, but managed to live productively, cope with the handicap and become a respected artist and writer. <br /> <br /> The film is very difficult to review - and even to watch. Fortunately, I had a signature function to capture every spoken word that would be impossible if I saw a movie in the theater. Although I respect it as a bold song dealing with difficult subject matter, I can not say that it is a kind of film that I would like to see more than once. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, my attention was drawn through a story-telling device, a retrospective framed by the present, in which we see that Christy is honored for her achievements before we see the retrospection of his youth and his struggles for communication with people around him who certainly gave him loving care. DANIEL DAY-LEWIS is certainly extraordinary as a restless man who falls in love with a therapist (FIONA SHAW), to the fear of his mother that when love is not reciprocated, his heart will be broken. In the restaurant there is a painfully long scene in which he confesses his love to others, and then falls into a crazy rage after drinking too much. <br /> <br /> BRENDA FRICKER does a great job when the mother takes care of him, his father and offspring of the siblings, fighting to keep the roof over his head until Day-Lewis begins to succeed in his work. He supplements the performance of Day-Lewis as a cordial mother and shares with him many moving moments. <br /> <br /> A richly detailed family story that remained together in the most unusual circumstances, with attention to detail of the period in each frame of the film. Both Fricker and Day-Lewis won the Oscars, but HUGH O'CONOR and RAY McANALLY are also great. O'Conor is Christy as a boy, and McAnally is a father who spends too much time in a local pub, but he loves a boyfriend. <br /> <br /> In conclusion: Elmer Bernstein's music is an additional factor. It's worth it, but definitely not a movie for everyone.
