Earlier, I thought that this movie was the worst movie Muppet. I would like to withdraw this statement now. In my opinion, the hottest movie MUppet was the TV movie "YOU ARE VERY MERRY MUPPET" Saint, was this WONDERFUL LIFE detached, which was really terrible. MUPPETS ACCEPT MANHATTAN is nothing special, but pleasantly more enjoyable than MERRY MUPPET Christmas. <br /> <br /> The best song is the song "You Can not Take No For An Answer", which is singing Muppet Babies and songs for the finale. Because I loved the Muppet Babies TV show, I loved the Muppet Babies sequence (I was told that this was what inspired the Muppet Babies show) <br /> <br /> The MANHATTAN MELODIES show itself was a real showstopper Muppety from Sesame Street even appearing at the wedding . As Kermit puts it in his last poem, "What could be better?" But I would like to make what was between the beginning and the end a bit more fun. There are charming episodes from Brooke Shields and Gregory Hines as well as a great dance sequence with Rizzo and the Rats (choreography of the late, great Jim Henson), and the movie certainly amuses. I must say, however, that MUPPET MOVIE, GREAT MUPPET CAPER and MUPPET Christmas CAROL are the three definitive MUppet movies.
