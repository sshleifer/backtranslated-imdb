Reading the comments left for this concert, I could not help but notice that a significant part of the reviewers either did not watch any episodes of the show either by or of their own will. The thing in Kerching! it is a program for children, CHILDREN so obvious, if your older one will seem tacky, forced and probably stupid. I even found one person saying that the sets were stupid, but I remember how, when I was an eight-year-old, I wondered why the Taj had ikea ice cubes on his wall, and wondered if my parents would let me keep some of mine (they did not). Yes, it can be annoying, acting can be better, and some characters do really weird things with hair, but as kids show, I rate them as 10/10. Compared to the materials that are in place today, let's say I would like it to be re-broadcast. Someone has released a DVD?
