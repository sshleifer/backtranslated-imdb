This film resembles the German movie THE NEVERENDING STORY, because the child is magically transferred to a strange land to become a hero. However, due to the much better modern technology, puppets and CGI are used to create an extremely realistic looking world - one that will blow your socks because of its realism and range. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie, but the boy was a duty at the beginning! Unfortunately, for most people in the West, this movie can be dispensed with quickly or discarded, because everything in the film seems so strange. However, give him a chance. Do not think or try to understand everything you see - just let the story unfold and you will most likely like the movie. <br /> <br /> In many respects, this is exactly the advice I would like to give adults who are watching the SPIRITED Miyazaki, because it is very similar and has a lot of Yokai (Japanese mythical ghosts). The big differences between them is that YOYI'S GREAT WAR is action-oriented, and SPIRITED AWAY is more child-friendly. Although I believe that THE GREAT YOKAI WAR was mainly intended as a children's film, in the US, most parents would not show it to younger children because it is so brutal, frightening and contains some adult behavior. Who is the audience in the West? Well, older children and adults who appreciate foreign films about non-Western motifs and compositions. It's a really narrow audience! <br /> <br /> When searching, search for all the strange things. In fact, you can watch the movie several times and see different things every time. Some funny references that I liked were a comment on Gamery, a scene with the commentary "KIDS: Do not Try This At Home", and the use of Kirin beer so that the person could see Yokai (hmm ... maybe this scene should include this warning! <br /> <br /> By the way, director Takashi Miike is difficult to stylistically describe, except that none of his stories that I saw appeared to be "normal." Some of his films are rather disgusting and disturbing and I hate them (especially AUDITION and ICHI THE KILLER), while some of them are magical and belong to the best films I've ever seen (HAPPY CATHOLE). One thing is for sure, it's hard to watch one of his films and not have a strong one reaction in one way or another.
