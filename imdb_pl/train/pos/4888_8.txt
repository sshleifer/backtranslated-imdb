This was broadcast on the BBC and I'm absolutely delighted to see it. As the loans were spinning, the cast itself was certain that I would give her a chance. After just five minutes I was completely immersed in this beautiful film. <br /> <br /> Yes, it was formal and predictable, but it somehow gave him charm. Retrospections up to the forties were beautifully placed and captured a feeling equal in several productions. <br /> <br /> A real, good movie, interrupted by exceptional music. When it's released, I'll buy it!
