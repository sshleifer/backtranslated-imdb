More like a psychological analysis of movies, but Psycho sounds better as a headline. The man in charge of the film (the narrator, if you like) presents the films in his own way. Most of them are classics, but all of them are listed here in IMDb and I strongly advise you to see them (especially Hitchcock, Solyaris, Conversation & and Lynch), because Slavoj Zizek will cancel them! <br /> <br /> In other words, it can spoil it for you. I do not remember if it broke down more than the ones I mentioned (I think about Chaplin's films too), but as I wrote, it would be best if you had seen them all before! The IMDb list lacks a video that I have submitted to them, so it may be there soon. It's Meg Ryan's movie, but it's just a short passage, which is not very interesting. <br /> <br /> Zizekowe views and opinions are crazy and pleasant to listen to, if you are open to watching things. another perspective (even if it will destroy your favorite movie a little bit for you ... it does not mean it will, but maybe)!
