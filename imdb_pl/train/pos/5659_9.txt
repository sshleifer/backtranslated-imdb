AG was an excellent presentation of drama, tension and thriller, so rarely seen on American television. Sheriff Lucas gave many viewers a willow. We fell for Caleb when he tried to resist the sherries of Lucas. We became plunged into fear and fear after learning the unimaginable connection between these two characters. The manipulations that caused Lucas to worry every week were really surprising. This performance lived up to the "gothic" idea in the way American entertainment so rarely tried, and the more it mastered. The overalls definitely made a big mistake, not supporting this program. This show shames the current excess of reality programs that are as unattractive as watching. This show is high-quality viewing for a demanding market hungry for high-quality viewing. The audience, who is tired of the over-saturation of the paralyzing reality of reality, will welcome this jewel of true story. Bring a set of DVD boxes !!
