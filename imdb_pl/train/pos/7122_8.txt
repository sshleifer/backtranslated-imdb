Immediately after the Second World War, wise minds in Hollywood tried to distance themselves from mindless waving the flag, which is a natural component of the war effort. "Best Years of Our Lives" and even "Gentleman's Agreement" examined the way Americans looked at each other after the war, but Delmer Daves' Pride of the Marines defeated them. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of Philadelphia's smart alley John Garfield, who goes to war as a sea soldier and after a nightmare in the trench, with Japanese soldiers shouting at him and his buddies "Mariiines, die tonight!" blinded by a hand grenade and throws his girlfriend back home instead of relying on her after returning home. <br /> <br /> Delmer Daves is uncompromising in his image of those men who are brave, as it was, almost by accident. They are in the trench, and when they are shot, they react so much to heroism, but they do their job. And then there is self-pity, a dark, grim sense of humor. Garfield is in a bad denial of his blindness, and the film does not justify "There is no free candy for anyone in this world," says his colleague. Adam, Jew, played by Dane Clark, reminds him: "In the war, someone gets it, and you are him. Everyone has problems! When I come back, some guys do not hire me because my name is Diamond. <br /> <br /> Great movies are made with courage and if the first half hour of "Pride of the Marines" does not revive completely, from that moment it transforms into a real work of art, you cry, you wonder, you hurt and you hope for Hope, simply: art. <br /> <br />
