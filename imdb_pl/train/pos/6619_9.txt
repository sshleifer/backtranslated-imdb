Blade Runner (Deckard is a replicator!), <br /> <br /> City of missing children (increased senses or anything used and abused, and above all, just gives us much less than what we could dream about) and <br /> <br /> Dark City: <br /> <br /> These really should be added. <br /> <br /> For some time now I've been waiting for an animated film that can influence me as much as Miyazaki's. This one is first. <br /> <br /> Hmm, scratch the "animated" part of it. <br /> <br /> I have an intense love relationship with the hatred of noir and, hey, if you do not go, it must be love, right? But there are so many science fiction and noir themes completely immersed in this movie that it's just a miracle to watch. <br /> <br /> These people have done an amazing job!
