There are some great comments and observations about this movie. I was happy to note the comparisons to "M" by Fritz Lang (forget about the intermittent remake of the 1950s with the lightweight David Wayne). The real villain is not a tortured murderer (an extremely good performance by Jeffery DeMunna), eliminating his sexually frustrated anger at his victims - mainly children. He is the goal. The real villain is strangling the bureaucratic Soviet system, drowning in its own corrupt incompetence. Frustration of an uncompromisingly devoted man (Rea in his best role since "The Crying Game"), an easy pragmatist who is ready to use the system in his favor (Sutherland always succeed in this role), hesitant, scared, but determined psychiatrist (incomparable Max Sydow), an inept, stupid bureaucrat prosecutor (brilliant British actor John Wood) and a quiet, supporting wife of the researcher (delighted supporter, Imelda Staunton). This is one damn movie. Its darkness and grim character are supported by the presentation of a corrupt, incompetent system that works against success. There is no need to immerse yourself in the sensational sense of gore-laden slice 'n, which has characterized so many recent films. Gore is present - this is a horrible story - but it is added to the presentation of the pathologically twisted human being. The success of this story is exactly this: it was a deed committed by a person, a man like you or me. If you and I decide to unload our frustration with reasonable measures, Chikatilo took his anger at the most innocent and helpless of us, our children. The excellent premise of this story is manifested by the equally excellent cast of excellent actors. - I notice that our Australian friend did not like speech and would no doubt prefer to hear it, as they say in the Australian dialect. Well, that's not good. This great movie certainly worked for me and everyone else with whom I spoke, who saw it.
