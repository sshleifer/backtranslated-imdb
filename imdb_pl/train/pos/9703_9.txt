One of the best comedy series ever to come out of the UK. Mark Gatiss, Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton are wonderful actors and performers who seem to be at home with drama, just like comedies. Backed by their writer Jeremy Dyson, they created a series of the most memorable figures of recent years. Little Britain faint to a small extent as a fake imitation of her ideas. Consistent original and groundbreaking I'm sure that so many people hate these series, how he loves them, but I'm just as sure that no one can have an opinion about LOG. I have not seen the full-length movie yet, but I've heard good things and bad things, so I'll book the grade. The original radio series from which LOG came from was as innovative as the television series. I do not know if the TV show reached the US, but I would be fascinated to see how the American public found a strange English humor
