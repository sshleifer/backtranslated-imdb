This movie is very funny and it is never boring, even after almost 3 hours. Al Pacino, Michelle Phieffer and the rest of the cast are great in the film and are very credible. Violence was a bit extreme in the film, but then showed how wicked drug trafficking was during the movie. The ending is amazing and is probably one of the coolest scenes in history. Great movie and you'll probably like it.
