This movie is great. As we often hear, this is indeed very realistic, and sometimes brutal, but unlike some other people, I clearly do not think that Austria is depressing, negative or disassembling as a proto-fascist society. Quite the opposite: while in HUNDSTAGE there are really really hard scenes and some characters are to be called very bad people, at the same time you watch the love, beauty and humor of Ulrich Seidls. And that's what distinguishes HUNDSTAGE from other films that try to show the lives of "ordinary people" in an intense, realistic way; their turmoil, their wishes, their dark sides: Seidl apparently never tries to prove that the lives of working-class people are garbage! In my opinion, the viewers who came to this conclusion are very much afraid to admit that almost nobody is as "clean" and "normal" as we would like other people to believe. And that every life has its dark and often depressing sides. The most beautiful scene: an old Viennese man watching his old girl dancing "in an oriental way" as he calls it. I think that everyone who considers this scene is ugly, has no sense of beauty and should ask themselves what it is, it is a proto-fascist: characters in HUNDSTAGE or viewers who are turned off by the body of a 70-year-old woman dancing all her charms for her lover.
