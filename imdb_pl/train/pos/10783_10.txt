I liked the movie. I have not seen Andy Griffith for centuries and felt that he fits this role perfectly. I associated him with comedy, but I'm glad he is versatile. <br /> <br /> I did not care that Dotty's "anxiety disorder" was not literally from a psychiatric textbook. There are zillions of phobias and neuroses that can take a variety of quantitative and qualitative forms. It is clearly sensitive to extrasensory powers, as the Indians understood, but not Anglos. No wonder that this character is sensitive and nominally eccentric. <br /> <br /> Although it is considered a light "family movie", it is more sophisticated than it seems. Also the end of Hiram was a pleasant surprise for me and bound all previous activities to the beam. It is nice to consider the possibility of such spiritual guidance.
