In addition to the usual stereotypes of the thirties, Eugene Pallette as a surly police detective, Jack La Rue as "swarthy" of Italy and of course James Lee as "The Chinese Cook", this film is a great mystery of murder in a locked room. In the case of the film from the early thirties, this step by step "peeling the secret veneer" is similar to the COLUMBO series, with the exception of this film, you do not have the advantage of knowing who the killer was.
