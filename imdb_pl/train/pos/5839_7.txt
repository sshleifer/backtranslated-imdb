The last (I think) of The Boys movies made with Hal Roach is also the last really funny movie they made before he went to the fox of the twentieth century, which so famously damaged their talents. Although there are weak moments - for example, a business with a "lung tester" is a bit, ah ... exaggerated (but it is worth having only to see "Dr" by Jimmy Finlayson) - but this move is a good summary of it, what the boys brought to the screen. Richard Cramer (uncredited) has appeared in other L & H movies and is delighted here as convicted Nick Granger. A scene in which The Boys must eat their own synthetic meal ("It looks good, smells good and probably tastes good.) Eat it.") It is one of my favorite moments in creativity. Stan and Ollie will always be nice companions in the lives of millions of devoted fans.
