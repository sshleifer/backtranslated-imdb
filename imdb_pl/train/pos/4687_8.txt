Love Crimes Lizzie Borden is an important film dealing with the dark side of female sexuality (including a full nude feminine nudity that certainly beats men's). He flirts with sadomasochism and a prisoner who falls in love with the captor theory. <br /> <br /> Such treatment of female libido is sometimes shallow and violent, but Borden traveled far beyond the feminist dogma of women gaining power through their insatiable lust. <br /> <br /> One striking scene reveals a feminine fetish for horses when an antagonist, a fake fashion photographer, seduces an elderly woman in breeches, asking her to show her how to ride a horse. He slides the crop between her legs, pressing him to the crotch, which greatly increases her excitement. <br /> <br /> He suddenly leaves her and she swears to the closed door. <br /> <br /> Patrick Bergin plays the artist, and although he falls away from the handsome, he chooses an ordinary Janes and has enough presence on the screen to believe that women can swallow his line. According to all reports, Sean Young turns out to be a strange person, and she is little beautiful. However, in this film as a district prosecutor her intense face and long, slender body, accented hips and periodic chaotic movement alchemy into erotic fascination. Her performance is strong and complex. <br /> <br /> Borden has an intriguing worldview and the fact that he stands in contradiction with the modern mindless spirit that I really appreciate.
