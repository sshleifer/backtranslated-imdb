One of the best documentary films released in recent years. A few points ... <br /> <br /> 1. Hugo Chavez was elected president of Venezuela in 1998, and his support came mainly from the poorer regions of Venezuela. <br /> <br /> 2. In 2002, the coup briefly overthrew Chavez. During this time, Irish filmmakers Kim Bartley and Donnach O'Briain were in Caracas, making a documentary about Chavez for British television. Their film deconstructs the coup d'état and its aftermath, and electrically records the story unfolding on the site, outside and inside the presidential palace. <br /> <br /> 3. Chavez intended to free Venezuela from the free market policy imposed on her by the United States. Although oil in Venezuela was already owned by the state, it was run for private gain by management, which Chavez wanted to replace. <br /> <br /> 4. Although it is the fourth largest oil supplier in the world, Venezuela remains flooded with poverty, and its resources are literally sucked out by foreign international corporations. <br /> <br /> 5. The document begins with the presentation of Chavez's first years as president before the coup d'état. It focuses on its popularity among the poor and its various policies, which have proved popular with local workers (educational plans, distribution of oil revenues, democracy at the base, etc.). <br /> <br /> 6. Chavez was a great advocate of education and printed thousands of copies of the Venezuelan constitution, encouraging children and adults to study and understand it. <br /> <br /> 7. When Chavez came to power, he immediately pledged to redistribute oil profits. Understandably, the oil companies began to get nervous. <br /> <br /> 8. The media war broke out. Six private television stations immediately began to oppose the state television station. They questioned Chavez's motives, mental health and sexual orientation. <br /> <br /> 9. Without media support, the attack would not be successful. The film clearly shows that the dissemination of information by attacks is based largely on the media, and the message can easily fabricate. <br /> <br /> 10. Under the guise of "restoring democracy", the opposition silenced the state television station, disbanded the National Electoral Council, the Supreme Court, the National Assembly and took control of the army. <br /> <br /> 11. Monetary interests, supported by the military elite (encouraged by the US and the CIA), organized a civil march for the presidential palace to perform a coup. Snipers were shooting at the supporters of Chávez, but private media stations edited the footage, so it seemed that the return fire was aimed at the opposition march, which in reality was safely diverted. <br /> <br /> 12. Police started a shootout against Chavez supporters, bleeding on the streets. <br /> <br /> 13. Chavez, held captive, refused to resign. Of course, the media / government lied, saying that he resigned, but the Chavez cabinet members conveyed the truth to the international community, which ultimately passed the message to Venezuela via cable television. <br /> <br /> 14. People arose, pressing for the return of the president they elected, which only a referendum could constitutionally replace. <br /> <br /> 8.9 / 10 - At just over an hour, this document is much too short. Nevertheless, it is a thrilling piece of journalism and deals with the form of a "media war" that is rarely touched upon. A great addition to the "Battle of Algiers". <br /> <br /> It's worth watching.
