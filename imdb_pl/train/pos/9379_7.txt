The more I watch Nicholas Cage, the more I appreciate him as an actor. Watching this movie now (in 2005), I see that it does not really match the genre of films that appeared in the early 90's. I really do not think it can be considered a noir movie, but sometimes it's quite dark, mainly because of the lighting and strange personality of the character. <br /> <br /> Typical performances from each of the three main actors who did their part well. I thought, however, that the characters of Hopper and Boyle remained undeveloped, because sometimes it was difficult to understand what they were doing and why they were doing it. Hopper is love for him or hates him. The plot is really good and although some parts are very unrealistic, there were parts in which I had to give them to the director (i.e., When I saw the sheriff for the first time). In conclusion, this movie is definitely worth a look. *** 1/2
