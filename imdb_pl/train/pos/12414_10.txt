The first American film by Renny Harlin was one of the best horror movies imprisoned (such as "Death House" or "The Chair") in the late 1980s. Twenty years earlier, Lane Smith guard unlawfully lost the convict. Now he is the head of a newly opened prison, and the spirit of this man returns to bloody revenge. This moody and very romantic movie contains a lot of macabre gore and violence. Viggo Mortensen, Tiny Lister, Tom Everett and Kane Hodder are ready for a funny slaughter.
