I loved this movie. I'm not even sure what's particularly about it, but I think it was wonderful and should be available on DVD. The women were unfamiliar, and yet they made good arrangements to spend time in a villa in Italy. Actors, in my opinion, did a great job. All characters were so different, but the wise story that made it work. In good time, there are problems with humor, drama and relationships. It requires 10 lines, but I can not think of anything else, so I will just rattle until I get 10 lines. Sorry about that. What else can I say that it has been a long time since I last saw it. I am looking forward to re-viewing, but it is not available.
