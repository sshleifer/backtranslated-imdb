When my 14-year-old daughter and her friends meet for a movie night, there is one movie that insists on watching it many times: guessed, K-911, the third part of a very successful K-9 series with everyone's favorite TV dad, Jim Belushi . <br /> <br /> People, I knew that you can set up a VHS tape, but a DVD ?! It has been recreated so often that it starts to jump; no jokes! But of course you will have it when you have a movie so charming, so brilliant. <br /> <br /> Of course, we have to thank one and only Tom Hanks for presenting us the favorite Cop-Dog with Turner and Hooch; however, even this movie can not match the perfection presented in all three K-9 films. <br /> <br /> Some non-speakers say that Belushi ran out of steam with this third movie in the series. Poppycock, I say. Although you may suspect that the third part - direct-to-video at the moment - may not seem like something to look at, it turns out that you are wrong after watching this high-quality movie. <br /> <br /> I will not reveal the story, but I will say that Belushi and his breathless partner give the best results - one that will make you laugh with laughter! It is a pity that John Belushi is dead to see what great progress his brother has made in the world of acting. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend that your teenage daughter present this film to your BFF at the next event. Do not forget about puppy!
