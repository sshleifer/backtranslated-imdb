I was impressed by this small, independently made photo. The story of a couple of social outcasts who meet, become friends and provide each other with a support system, seemed to be missing as children, is sometimes funny, sometimes sad, but always provocative. Music, mainly through underground bands, has been used with great effect, as have experiments with camera angles, filters and slow or fast motion techniques. Performances (lead writers and film directors play) are among the best I've seen in the last few years. If you've ever felt like a square peg forced into a round slot, I really believe you'll appreciate "By Hook or By Crook".
