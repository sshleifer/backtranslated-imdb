It could have been a better movie. It stretches in points, and the central story changes from Boyer, who ends his mission at Boyer, avenging Wanda Hendrix's death, but Graham Greene is an author who is really difficult to spoil. His stories are stories about morality, because of his own reflections on Catholicism, guilt and innocence (very relative terms in his worldview) and the human condition. <br /> <br /> Boyer is Luis Denard, a well-known concert pianist who stood with the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War. He was sent to England to make a desperate purchase contract. Unfortunately for Denard he is literally alone - each of his contacts turns out to be a willing conqueror for Falagists in Spain. In particular, Katina Paxinou (mistress Melendez), a grim babysitter and Peter Lorre (Mr. Contreras), an international Esperanto language teacher. Wanda Hendrix is ​​a weary girl (Else) who works for Mrs. Melendez. The local diplomat, Licata (Victor Francken) is already a willing collaborator of the Falangists. <br /> <br /> The British (Holmes Herbert, Miles Mander, and preferably - if not the worst - party, George Coulouris) don do not give much hope to Boyer (which the British will soon be able to catch). Herbert and Mander simply retreat behind the official policy of neutrality administered by the governments of Ramsay MacDonald and Stanley Baldwin during the civil war. Coulouris is a typical type of colonel. Blimp - always impeccable in native English diction, is keen in showing unwillingness to foreigners in general. <br /> <br /> The only ray of hope is Lauren Bacall (Rose Cullen), here he is trying to play his role as well as he can - but he can not really. She is an aristocrat - the daughter of the ruler of the press. It was Bacalla's second film and (sadly) almost drowned her long career. She is doing well, but the spark she showed in her first film was due to the double effect of playing with Humphrey Bogart and director Howard Hawks. Boyer is a great actor, but he is not God, and Herman Shumlin is not a Hawks. Her next film returned to Bogie and Hawks again, and her star resumed her advantage. <br /> <br /> It's a grim movie (just like a novel). Boyer's mission never fails, because it has too many hidden enemies in every place. But villains are also losers - often with their lives. <br /> <br /> With Dan Seymour, as a suspect foreign tenant of Katina Paxinou (and a man who destroys her). It's worth taking a look at how many Warner actors do their best, given the weakness of the direction.
