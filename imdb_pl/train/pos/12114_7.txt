This film is of course low-budget and filmed in British Columbia, Canada. Obstacles that had to be defeated to make this movie convincing (set in California and late 60's-80's) were well thought out. I believe that this is the best and most accurate version of the Zodiac killings that have plagued the city of Vallejo and the Gulf area from 1968-19? (he was never caught). Edward James Olmos (Det. Dave Toschi) and George Dzundza (Zodiak - at that time considered to be Arthur Leigh Allen, since he was cleaned up by DNA and fingerprints) plays the game of visiting cats and mice together, each trying to free the other in emotional revelation. Olmos dying because of some terminal illness and knowing that Dzie≈Ñdza did it, still completely obsessingly losing his family and becoming a full alcoholic along the way. completely unconscious and absorbed himself (like all serial killers) for the slaughter left in his footsteps. The only disappointment was that the ending "above the mountain" was quite accurate. If you get bored with a typical Hollywood swell or are interested in the Zodiak case, check it out.
