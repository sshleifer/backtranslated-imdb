This film was highly recommended to me by Matt Groening. Well, I actually watched both The Simpsons and Futurama, and I got a mention in both, so I thought "what the hell". The film brings a few "what if" home, which makes us realize how happy we are today in which we accept simple things such as soap and water. Interestingly, in 2022, men are still shaving with a single-blade razor! It's nice that responsible people do not burden the film with unnecessary special effects, radial branches, etc. Some nice looking "furniture" after determining what it means. Remember that "Tuesday is Soylent Green Day"
