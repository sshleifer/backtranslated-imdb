There is something wonderful about the fact that the film made in 1934 can be head-to-head over every Tarzan movie that followed it, including a bloated and boring Greystoke piece from the 80s. When the viewer covers the first three scenes that are boring, Tarzan and his Mateusz shoot like a shot, offering a continuous action, humor and romance. Maureen O'Sullivan is adorable and beautiful like Jane and walks away with the movie. Weismuller is also solid. Highly recommended.
