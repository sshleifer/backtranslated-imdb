Gandhi, the Great: <br /> <br /> Greatness in the world is associated with people like Alexanader the great, Ashoka the Great lied about their size in being glorified more than people. Gandhi is called great for being in fact not Great, but he is more human, because I always believe that the extraction of humanity in us is where there is the greatness of human lies. in the battle for humanity, but not its enemies. Let's now go to the film review. <br/> <br /> About Gandhi My father: <br /> <br /> Gandhi My father is not a film about Gandhi, but about his son Harilalu Gandhi. about the son, whose father was one of the greatest people who walked on this earth, the director manages to depict the story. Film manages to tell the story of a deceitful father's son who led the nation to greatness. criticism of Gandhi's failure as a father for my son, I would rather say that it is a sacrifice that Gandhi made as the father of a son to make justice the father of the nation. <br/> <br /> I would like the essence of this film to prevail not only in India, in the land of Gandhi, but in the hearts of all people in this world. <br/> <br /> Gandhi is a real man. Jaihind.
