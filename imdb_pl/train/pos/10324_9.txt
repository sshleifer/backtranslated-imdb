The frightfully funny song from the 1930s is a classic series about cliffs, as well as "Raiders of the Lost Ark", made only in a low budget and much more intimate by director Michael Anderson. The opening scenes lace the liberal amount of gothic nuveau art, surpassing Batman by two decades. Ron Ely (Tarzan) appeared as a well-manned hero and a great Pamela Hensley as a local latina Mona, who joined our hero in hunting in the non-existent Latin American country of Hidalgo. The best line, our hero to Mona, holding a fist to the chin, just as you expect him to be tender with her and hug her: "Mona, you're a brick!" <br /> <br /> Paul Wexler's hat with ham and cheese, Captain Seas is an absolute delight. Expect a bit of "Raiders ..", a bit of "Batman", a bit of "The Lost World", some "Lost Horizons" and plenty of abundance, and everything will be fine. Watch out for the iconic favorite of Michael Berryman in a small part as a farmer and enjoy the camp use of the patriotic music of John Philip Sousa. It is the main candidate for the DVD, but it is certainly late. A unique feast for the whole family. 9/10
