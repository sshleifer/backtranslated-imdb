First of all, in defense of JOAN FONTAINE, it must be said that Ginger Rogers would be terribly ill treated as Alyce, a young British woman who has the title role. Fontaine makes a great photo here as a heroine, but her lack of experience shows wrong, and her dance is better not mentioned. Fortunately, she went for better things. <br /> <br /> But here is FRED ASTAIRE, GEORGE BURNS and GRACIE ALLEN, who get the best bills - and they're great. Burns and Allen fans will be surprised how easily they fit into the Astaire dance routines. Especially interesting is the big routine fun that won the choreographer Hermes Pans Oscar. They join Astaire in what is supposed to be the most ingenious event in the film. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, little can be said about the slow pace of the plot - nor some outdated situations that require a lot of patience from the viewer. It must be said that some of the humor falls and the usual romantic misunderstandings that appear in every film by Fred Astaire from this period are treated conventionally. Only musical interludes give the story of the elevator he needs. <br /> <br /> Some pleasant Gershwin's melodies appear once in a while, but not all of them receive the treatment they deserve. The pleasant supporting cast includes Reginald Gardiner, in the best edition of the comic performance as a conniving servant, Constance Collier and Montagu Love (as Joanna's father mistakenly regarded by Astaire as a gardener). <br /> <br /> It's light fun every time Burns and Allen are around to remind us how funny they were on their radio and television. Both are surprisingly adept at following Astaire's work. <br /> <br /> Director George Stevens makes sure that the dance number on the hill of Joana Fontaine with Fred is filmed at a discreet distance, but clever work with the camera can not hide the fact, is out of his element as the dance partner Astaire, something which seems painfully conscious to her.
