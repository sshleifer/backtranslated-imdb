Although Cher and Cage are the center points of this story, Gardenia and Dukakis are good counterparts for them - Loretta and Ronny will be in this place for 50 years - still in love. The whole cast does a good job from Aiello to John Mahoney - it shows a real piece of life. Although I saw it a long time ago - I'm glad that Cage finally got to the place where he was recognized in Hollywood for his talent. From music to opera scenes to kitchen table arguments - it's a very funny movie.
