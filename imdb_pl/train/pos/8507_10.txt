Well, you take O.J. Simpson as an American soldier turned all American bus drivers who decide to save their passengers on their own, but there is no one else, and Arte Johnson plays an absolutely simple role as a guide who does not know what to do, but does not want to admit that they are in trouble and connect them to Lorenzo Lamas as one of the three bad boys face to face who intend to kidnap the heiress and leave the bus for death for dessert, and you must have action, twists and drama. Everyone was good, but seeing the Lamas as the worst of bad boys really enraged my mind. He was too credible as an overbearing bad guy who not only wanted to kidnap an heiress, but to rape women and humiliate a guy who tried to stop him. It was apparently long before he grew his good image of a guy. And believe me, 20-year-old Lorenzo in tight jeans that you really do not want to miss!
