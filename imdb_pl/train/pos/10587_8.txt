This film is not a schlock, despite the production of a lo fi and its link to the production of Troma. A dark fairy tale for adults. Exploitation is the theme of Sugar Cookies and you may wonder if the cast has fallen victim to this topic. A strange movie with tempting visuals: shadows and contrast are visible. It's definitely worth a look, especially from Warhol fans and stylish decadence. Through all cruelty and wickedness, you can degrade morality, though twisted.
