In my opinion, this is an absolutely romantic Disney masterpiece. If you ask me, stepmother (voice of Lucille La Verne) was really diabolical. You must see the movie if you want to know why. On the other hand, although she did a lot of cleaning, Cinderella (voice of Ilene Stanley) was a very beautiful woman. For me, the scenery was beautiful, the cast was well chosen and the writing was strong. Before I discuss this, I would like to say that everyone involved in this film did very well. In conclusion, I strongly recommend this absolutely romantic Disney masterpiece to anyone who has not seen it. You're having a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick it with a friend and watch.
