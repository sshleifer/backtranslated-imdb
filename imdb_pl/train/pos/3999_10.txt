I am ashamed to say that I missed "Mother" when she was in cinemas. I saw it on DVD tonight. I gave him 10 votes, one of the few I gave here. This independent English film is filmed with such great care and quality. I was constantly attracted to it. The story of a low key and a purely human character is brutally honest and totally absorbing thanks to the acting of Anne Reid, Daniel Craig and Cathryn Bradshaw. The photos are stunning. The score is closely related to the story. The plot is epic, well dressed by the writer Hanif Kureishi in a prosaic life. This story raises great problems with the subtlety of Impressionist painting. And some of these big issues are very controversial, which probably explains the lack of prizes won, despite many nominations. It's just one of my favorite movies.
