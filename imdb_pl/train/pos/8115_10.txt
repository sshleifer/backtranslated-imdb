The first two parts try to limit to the absurd the growth of wasteful wars and the rule of nationalist barbarians. The third part speculates that progress and exploration towards the moon and beyond is the key to ensuring the significant use of human talents and resources. He has speeches that some viewers reject as naïve or bombastic, but they make others irritate with excitement. It depicts a space gun / launcher and helicopter, along with innovative mass communication devices, elevators, flat panels and wireless intercoms. This is probably incorrect for windows without windows in the future. But it presents a childish vision of a boundless scientific / technological investigation. <br /> <br /> For me, it seems to be a film about a group of thinking rational thinkers led by Spinosan morality in their quest to perpetuate themselves and live ethically through scientific progress and a united world government. Progressive characters (such as two Kabbalah) believe that humanity could "live forever", preserving our experiments and progress for future generations, always standing on our humanity, as if on the shoulders of giants. <br /> <br /> Arthur C. Clarke (author 2001: A Space Odyssey) suggested this film to Stanley Kubrick as an example of a great SF movie. Kubrick hated it and said he would never see another film based on Clarke's suggestions (source: Clarke's special millennial introduction to his 2001 novel). Though the late Clarke suggested this at the top of his list when someone asked him about the best SF movies. It has a beautiful design in the style of Menzies, but mediocre special effects (especially in tanks with toys). <br /> <br /> Personally I liked it and I think it perfectly reflects the spirit of modernity. A little naive is the belief in the possibility of creating a society without crime for a long time. It also seems unlikely that progress is inevitable. It seems to me that we might as well return to the dark ages, or at least become so hardened in science that we kill ourselves by overpopulation or by our inability to escape another serious natural disaster. But it nicely presents the importance of taking risks to society and nourishing indignation about the potential risks of cosmic accidents and deaths. It challenges us to choose the side of progress over small desires for safety or comfort or happiness: <br /> <br /> KABAL: "Too much and too early, and we call it death. and there is no end. He must go further - conquer beyond conquest. This little planet, its winds and roads, and all the laws of mind and matter that stop it, and then the planets around it and finally the vastness to the stars And when it conquers all the depths of the cosmos and all the secrets of time - it will still begin. <br /> <br /> KABAL: "If we are nothing more than animals - we must seize our little scraps of happiness and live, suffer and pass, counting no more - than all other animals - or ending." {Points to the stars .} "This is it - or this? Whole universe - or nothingness ..." (quotes from the script). <br /> <br /> If it sounds like rationalization for devoting the whole society to development, members of the council (world government ) But in reality these "technocrats" allow their citizens to become artisans or freely pursue other passions and be suppressed by government bans, laws against science and experimentation, and other mandates and restrictive use of power that would turn their critics into tyranów. <br /> <br /> In fact, a huge group of rebel in the conspiracy feels neglected by the development of council science and technology, so they try to to keep progress and end the freedom of the council to experiment, a progressive council will not, however, suppress the freedom of rebelliousness, preparing only a "peace gas" in crisis situations and only desiring freedom and space to continue its progress. <br /> <br /> So it's also a story of freedom to learn, just like the miracles of progress. Many people in our society would agree with some of these basic premises, except in cases of social bias (many want to ban cloning, for example) or naturalism (some do not want us to act freely and prefer to simply become extinct at the right time when they were enslaved to the earth) or fear / reason (some think that we are not ready for advanced science / technology, because we can destroy ourselves). But Cabal (the chairman of the council) has the answer to the problem of danger: "Our {scientific} revolution has not endured death or danger. It simply made death and danger worth it "(script).
