Superman and Mole Men are probably the most intense adventures of Superman in history. <br /> <br /> Lois Lane and Clark Kent are sent to Silsby, the homeland of the world's deepest oil well. While there, some radioactive people are fucking through oil and exploring the city. Jeff Corey and many other residents of the town are trying to get rid of invasive moles. Can Superman change people's ways in time to save the mole? Can Superman warn people about the radioactive danger brought by the mole? <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Superman and The Mole Men are a very intelligent, well-written and well-played movie. Even if we see Superman only once, it is still Superman's great adventure. Necessarily for everyone. <br /> <br /> 10/10 Stars
