Looking at some of the negative posts, you really have to wonder what some people do for fun ... <br /> <br /> I was lucky to see this movie during his too short theatrical run. The audience laughed. I watch the tape from it when I write, and it's still funny! <br /> <br /> It also has a sweet side, with unexpected turns of real pathos. The late great Royal Dano is especially effective as a lonely Wrenchmuller farmer. Ariana Richards and J.J. Anderson is great as a leading kid. And the actors in Martian suits, although limited to the mime, do a great job <br /> <br /> Another thing to watch out for is the background details. The film is full of tributes, pastichees and references to other SF and fantasy films. Look at Martian costumes next time. One of them is wearing the costume of Marta McFly, another is the Ghostbuster, the third is in the uniform of House Atreides, and the fourth is wearing the Last Fighter suit.
