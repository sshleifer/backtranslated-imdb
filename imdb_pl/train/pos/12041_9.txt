It's an old ghostly story about ghosts. I showed it to my friends in my movie club, and they were charmed until the end! Without blood and blood - just old-fashioned tension. It starts from the beginning, builds and builds. The ending is a real turn of action that surprised me. <br /> <br /> Well-directed and well-played. It is also a "piece from the age" - embedded in the twenties of the twentieth century, which he added to the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> I was so impressed that I got Susan Hill's book from Amazon. The film follows the book closely. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that it is not easily available on DVD. My copy is VHS. This along with "Haunted" are probably the two best ghost stories I've ever created. Which just shows that a bit of creativity exceeds "on your face" every day!
