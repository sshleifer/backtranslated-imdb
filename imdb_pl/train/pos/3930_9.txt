It's extraordinary that for "young Mr. Lincoln 'supporting Ford players manned less-known, non-star actors. This not only emphasizes his concentration on the main role of Lincoln, but also gives viewers a refreshing insight into Lincoln as a man in his place and time, a man entangled, like us all inexorably, into the problems and feelings of his time and striving to solve them. It's not so much the word and action of Fonda Lincoln, what the faces, reactions of supporting players that Ford tells the story of young Lincoln's worldview, sense of place in society and politics and how people reacted to Mr. Lincoln's words and deeds and trusted this man they considered it to be deserved and respected. <br /> <br /> Give it a try: instead of focusing on Henry Fonda, the next time you see "The Young Lord Lincoln" he turned his attention to the supporting heroes - you expect to be lavishly rewarded by the deeper appreciation of both Lincoln and Ford. I like to suspect that the story of Ford through the reactions of heroes supporting Lincoln Fonda could appeal to David Lean, when he directed Omar Sharif in "Doctor Zhivago," in which the reactions of the supporting heroes to Zhivago talk about Zhivago.
