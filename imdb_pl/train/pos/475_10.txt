Once again proving his incredible versatility, John Turturro plays an introspective Russian chess genius preparing for the return tournament and establishing an unbelievable relationship with a resident gadabout (Emily Watson) in an Italian hotel from 1920. They fall in love with the horror of their social-alpine mother (Geraldine James). A great love story, whose chess glow can make him look like a brain. But despite its beginnings in the history of Nabakov, it certainly is not. Romantic elements and the sense of time and place have overcome psychological analysis. John Turturro appeared in "Barton Fink", "O brother, where are you?". "The Big Lebowski" proves that he is not dependent on Coen Bros' films to confirm his position.
