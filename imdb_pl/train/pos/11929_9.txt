One of the curiosities that is often forgotten in this family movie is business. <br /> <br /> At this time, in 1994, this movie was the record of the biggest movie premiere in the history of the film (and can be continued to stick). It took place in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania - undoubtedly in honor of the original films of "Angels" who "haunted" Pittsburgh Pirates. In this remake "haunt" California Angels. <br /> <br /> Either way, the premiere took place in the long-gone Three Rivers Stadium, which was home to the Pittsburgh Pirates and Pittsburgh Steelers at the time (The Pirates are now placed at PNC Park and Steelers at Heinz Field). The premiere took place on a film screen, which was five stories high in the stadium and was maintained (and maybe even maintained) the record of the biggest film premiere in history, shown to 60,000 fans. Danny Glover, Tony Danza and Christopher Lloyd participated in the admiration of thousands of sports fans.
