As a reminder, I am not involved in production in any way. <br /> <br /> Hidden Frontier is probably a movie for Star Trek fans with the largest number of episodes produced so far. During seven seasons (this is the last) they produced about 50 episodes. <br /> <br /> It's no mean feat in almost any budget and all volunteers devote their time and energy. <br /> <br /> Sami admit that earlier seasons do not have such a good production features, as later, but as the progress of the green screen's work progresses and activities improve. <br /> <br /> It was difficult for me to "immerse" in "so it started from the beginning and watched all the way. HF benefits from feature arcs, just like all the best sci fi and combines nicely with the world of Star Trek in which it is set. Characters and "relatives" from the original series have been introduced to the story and add a lot to the story, sometimes improving the characters above the original. <br /> <br /> The whole experience includes an excellent website network, blooper reels, a high membership forum that is visited by many actors and production staff, as well as a weekly chat. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for high quality budget production, it's probably not possible for you. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for constant adventures in the Star Trek universe with stories that make Star Trek credit and that makes you think, this is the one.
