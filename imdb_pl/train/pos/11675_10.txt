I always follow Dakar, so when my husband bought the DVD "Charlie's Race to Dakar", I could not wait to see him! Of course, we saw the transmission from the race when it was a race, but it never gives background and specific teams. <br /> <br /> If you watched Long Way Round, you would not be surprised by the language that I honestly think is more entertaining than offensive. <br /> <br /> I think the only thing that annoyed me on DVD was Charlie's hair, but he was styled in front of Dakar, so my feminine need for grooming was eased; tho 'I could have lived without' flames'. Undies lol As with LWR, preparation was as interesting as the race itself. I almost cried when Charlie broke his arm and grimaced at every bruise he suffered during training ... and of course Andy Caldicott's death ... it was a terrifying tragedy, but something happens every year. <br /> <br /> Russ drives me crazy, although his attitude has improved a thousand times compared to the arguing cynic he was in LWR. It's great to see how well he gets along with Charlie. <br /> <br /> I learned this odyssey: 1. Never let Scorpion prepare your vehicle for EVERYTHING! - They had months to prepare the X5 and the day before the team went to Lisbon, Scorpion did only half the things that had to be done and the vehicle was pain throughout the race; 2. The Dakar organizers must put a lot more work into the driver / driver recovery plan - leaving Matt (and probably a large number of other players / drivers who will dry up as they did, it was nothing but culpable neglect; 3. Charlie has an endearing enthusiasm for "rough and difficult" adventures, but it must get tougher to really do what it wants to, and finally, 4. Charlie and Ewan plan another of these epics, called Long Way Down in 2007, and I can not wait to see I will look at it: D If you love bikes and / or really nice guys, you have to watch it, I guarantee that you love it. It's very funny. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, for Simon Pavey - you are the hero I was so impressed with the way it "quietly achieves" and the fact that you actually finished ... just unbelievable, considering how monumentally difficult the race is. And for Charlie, Matt and the rest of the team - full marks for detachment have reached so much is really admirable. You are wonderful.
