I think this series is vociferously funny! Not for every taste and I'm not going to pick up or denigrate people who do not understand it. I am sure that they are wonderful bright people who operate on a different wavelength. But if you like it, you REALLY like it. Sarah is a lost loser named Sarah Silverman, who is often in Homer's difficult situation (this is "Homerian" as in "Homerian Simpsonian"). <br /> <br /> I remember Sarah Silverman from her short appearance Saturday Night Live in the early 90's. I liked her immediately and I'm leaving to check everything she did. <br /> <br /> This performance is fun. That's why I always fast before watching and wear diapers for adults. Check it out!
