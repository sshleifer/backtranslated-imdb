Many people rate it as a movie with fans because there are many stars in the film (Gackt, Hyde and Wang Lee Hom are a very famous singer in Japan). But do not judge it before watching what I say. Gackt and his staff are very serious when they made the film, and they worked so hard. It's a good movie with a touchy story inside. A few scenes can be so funny and some are so sad. They made it so good until I could stop watching it. <br /> <br /> The story wrote quite well, but I admit that their actions are not very disappointing. This is particularly true of Hyde, because his acting skills are weaker than others and it is strange to hear the way of speaking in a different language, with the exception of his mother tongue (Japan). But this is understandable because it appears in the film for the first time. <br /> <br /> I think Gackt is trying to show us how someone can be so weak when he loses the most important person in his life. When Toshi was killed when Sho asked Kei to let Yi-Che turn into a vampire like him because he would not let her die. I even said that Hyde's skills are still weird, but I give him two strokes on this stage !! <br /> <br /> There is a time when the plot goes too fast, as if they did not say why the son can join the local mafia and be an enemy of Sho, because in the past they are a good friend, and the Son is Sho brother-in-law. <br /> <br /> Whatever, I love this movie ~ (very ^^). <br /> <br /> This is an action movie with a moving beautiful story.
