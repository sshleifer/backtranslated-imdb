I saw this happy, small movie aged 10/11 in 1979, when it was broadcast in CBS. I did not know he was in the theater at all. To judge it from the point of view of children, I would give him 4 out of 5 stars, because being a young boy at the time seemed a little "girlish". <br /> <br /> The climactic scene in which Gazooks tickles all of us was a little disturbing, but you grow out of it. <br /> <br /> When I rediscovered it as Blockbuster Video in 1995, I had to visit it again! I still liked it, even though it looked a bit "old". I do not know where another reviewer came up with the idea that he is not on VHS. <br /> <br /> It's there. It may even be on DVD, at least I hope so. I want to share this with my children someday! 10 stars here is still a great movie for children. (koniec) <br /> <br /> 09/08/2009: I've finally found a copy of VHS !! Woo-hoo!
