While 9 may seem an extremely high result for such a small movie, however, compared to hundreds and hundreds of series of detective movies from the 30's and 40's this is one of the best and also very advantageously compares it with the later "thin movies" Man. Now, this does not mean that the movie is similar to Thin Man movies, because THE KENNEL MURDER CASE is not a comedy, but a more traditional mysterious-detective movie. Now you would think that the lack of fun for Nora Charles or Asty or the traditional comic book helper (something that can be found in all series of detective films) would be harmful, but I did not miss them because it was an exceptionally well-written movie - having a really interesting case, as well as uniformly excellent performances of all. <br /> <br /> The film begins at the exhibition and is called The KENNEL Murder Case, although this film by Philo Vance actually spends little time on dog and dog shows is not a very important part of the movie. Instead, the completely hated man is killed and left in a completely closed room - an idea repeated in several other detective movies (such as the CASE OF A HUMAN AGAINST A CONCENTRATE). However, as all this is explained, it seems quite reliable and fits very well - keeping my interest. I would definitely like other detective films on that day to have intelligently written threads and unique acting. This one is definitely a guardian.
