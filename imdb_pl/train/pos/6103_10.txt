I recently watched the film during the Boston festival. The film was very funny and it is something that I believe in the world and black America is ready to see. He has a comedy, a drama, and the soundtrack is great. It's a good movie. The characters were well developed, and the film had many prominent actors, such as Wood Harris (Remember the Titains, Paid in Full), Brian J. White (Trois 3, Mr 3000) and the wonderful Zoe Saldana, Pirates of the Caribbean). The film touches on many important topics in today's society in a short time, and does it with style and grace. This is not only a story about life in a hospital, but a story about people and their personal path to discover who they are and who they will be.
