The "last wave" is much more than the sum of its parts. It is not only a movie about a catastrophe, not only exploration of Australian Aboriginal spirituality, and certainly more than just a court drama. Screenwriter / director Peter Weir manages to bring these elements to a higher level to create a truly effective and thought-provoking movie with the same amazing atmosphere that he gave the "Picnic on the Hanging Rock" two years earlier that you will remember later. <br /> <br /> When lawyer David Burton (Chamberlain) is called to defend Chris Lee (Gulpilil) in connection with the death of the Aborigines, for which he can or can not be directly responsible, he thinks that he is not only trying to get truth from Lee, but understanding what he hears when he comes. As with the Aboriginal belief that there are two worlds - everyday and Dreamtime, the truth exists on two completely different levels, with consequences more catastrophic than Burton could have imagined. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly the reason why "Picnic under a hanging rock" is better remembered because of its permanent mystery. We are guided the same way but forced to find the answer for ourselves. In "The Last Wave" we can put everything together at the end of the movie. However, even with all this information, we have to choose what part of it we want to believe because the film moves us beyond the limits of our normal reality. <br /> <br /> On the production side Weir uses his budget with great effect, gradually building a sense of destruction in everything, from gentle lighting, through intense rain, to good use of sound. Accidental music is discreet, it never tries to be great. Richard Chamberlain manages to convey the amazement that the audience will undoubtedly feel, trying to unravel the mystery. David Gulpilil perfectly depicts a man trapped between two worlds who wants to do the right things, but is afraid because he already knows the ending. <br /> <br /> Collect all these things and you have a perfect example of why David Weir is a known name in the cinema thirty years later. Definitely recommended.
