It is not known whether it can be called an anti-war film, it shows war on the elite level. They are elite units who know what they are doing and are proud of it. Even if they are pacifists, they still enjoy a level of skill and defeat enemies, even if it is contrary to being a pacifist. Movies are slow and rather undisturbed and in many ways are rather tame, like war movies more than today's standards, no parts of the body depart like in contemporary movies. This is brutal in other respects, as you see killing on a personal level. It's more the movie of a thinking man. When you start watching, you do not want to miss anything. Men's thoughts in the film and their interactions are what a movie is - not just a fight or a huge, exciting plot. This may be called a war triller. <br /> <br /> If you are in a state of war, if you like to read or watch programs about SAS and so on, YOU WANT TO WAIT THIS FILM !!!!! <br /> <br /> Comparable movies are The Hill (1965) with Sean Connery, 49th parallel (1941) star cast, The Naked and the Dead (1958) with Cliff Robertson. They are all unusual in their own way and show war on a personal level. Enjoy!
