The industry has dropped the ball on this topic. The trailer does not do film justice and when it opened it was on a hand full of screens. If people had the opportunity to see it, working with the mouth would be very successful. Two leading actresses give you great emotional performances that really draw you into history, especially in character. I checked this on the recommendation of rave Richard Roeper or (Ebert and Roeper) in his book. An example of a great movie that has never been fully released, except for a few screens. Which did not give a chance to be seen. Some movies are quickly recorded because they are not very good. This is a worthy Oscar and tragedy on many levels, most of which will never be heard. Perhaps via voicemail it will get it on a DVD or cable. If you have not seen this movie, you should. Great performances by two main actresses make up this movie. It could just be a different formal teen movie after school, but instead stands out from other movies worth attention. The girl interrupts. If you like it, you'll like it. <br /> <br /> Both girls are on one incredible emotional scene after the other, not melodramatic. Although Alicia is furious, and Deanna cries through most of the movie, it is such a real way that they are not stereotypical or melodramatic. The movie will take you to many scenes, and if you're an aspiring actor, use these real performances as your school. Erica is better at it than in Traffic. I hope that both of these actors will gain more roles that will use their talents and allow them to shine. See this video, and if you like, I recommend to your friends not to get lost among all the hits that appear each year. This movie was buried, and Spiderman 2 records. In what word do we live? AGHhh. Let the world be right again, see it and recommend it.
