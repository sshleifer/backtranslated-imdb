It is easy to forget that later series have developed the plot of aliens' conspiracy more that formerly "X-Files" wrote episodes such as "GenderBender" and "Fearful Symmetry", in which strangers were not all small gray men or mind control, but maybe you surprise. <br /> <br /> "Fearful Symmetry" begins with an "invisible elephant" - actually an elephant moving in time and space, less than a mile from "The Walk" - and ends with the abduction of a gorilla during pregnancy. And this is a very episode of wonderful moments. This thread is annoyingly worthy - yes, we understand that zoos are bad, unless they are not - but the ideas that are in them are fascinating, visually powerful and very memorable, and include the angle of abduction, which is usually overlooked why * people * would be the only things that aliens are interested in? <br /> <br /> After all, it was not a classic classic, but it was enjoyable to watch when it lasted, again, very memorable, and mainly it is something that can not be imagined in many other programs.
