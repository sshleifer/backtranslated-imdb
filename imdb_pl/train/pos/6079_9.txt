Shakespeare's plays have a way to go over time. The language somehow breaks the time barrier. but maybe it's the actors who really do it. <br /> <br /> after disappointment Romeo and Juliet (version with Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio), hesitated on another contemporary version of Shakespeare. To my surprise, Othello was great! <br /> <br /> The character of Iago was so well played by Kenneth's guy! even if Iago is really bad and vile, the character was played so well that he does what Shakespeare intended to make it a trait, to hate the audience. I must say that Fishburne's performance was really good here. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to scholars and lazy students (who do not want to read a book).
