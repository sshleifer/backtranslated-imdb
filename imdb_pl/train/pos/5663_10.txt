14 years since the series was created and it is still the best performance in history. Writing was first class and production is second to none. This concert will never be performed, which is a pity. I hope that if you think about finding this program, you will look at it. <br /> <br /> AG appeared in the year in which I left the high school at a time when my favorite TV program was x files, which gives me an idea of ​​why I first got into this program. AG was a much better program with better writing, but had only one reason? I know that this is not the only program that has only one season. Another example that comes to my mind is a lonely shooter (spinning x files) that has a good writing and is fun but has only one season. This does not seem right! <br /> <br /> We must also remember that this concert was before concerts, such as twilight, which made the dark show "cool", so I think it could also allow performances on the hill. <br /> <br /> Watch this program and enjoy it! 10 out of 10 for me.
