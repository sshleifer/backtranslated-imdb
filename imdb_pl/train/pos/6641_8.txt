On December 28, 1895, in the Grand Café in Paris, the story of the film began to be written, while Louis Lumière showed his short films, all individual shots, paid to the public. "La Sortie des Usines Lumière" was the first movie to play and I would like to be there, not only to see the film, but also the audience's reactions. <br /> <br /> We start from the closed door of the Lumière factory. Apparently, because the picture seems to be photography, people thought they would just see a slide show, not something they hoped for. But then the door opens and people pour out into the house. First a lot of women, then a few men and one man on a bike with a big dog. When all the doors close. <br /> <br /> Whether it's the first movie or not (some say "L'Arrivée d'un Train à la Ciotat" was the first film recorded by Lumière), this is an impressive piece of early cinema. Being bored is almost impossible for many reasons. One simple reason: it only lasts fifty seconds. But also for people who usually like films with special effects, there must be something interesting here; you do not see such historical things every day.
