This documentary has been nominated for an Oscar and it is easy to understand why. Even 45 years later, it is quite an impressive job. Why is not it in print, it's a secret that only Disney can explain. Good use of live material and animation in tandem. Every once in a while it worked as part of "Vault Disney" every few months, but I have not seen it for a long time. * sigh * Most recommended.
