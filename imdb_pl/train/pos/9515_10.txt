One of my favorite movies, with a very nostalgic ending. The film is about the Sullivan family, of course Michael Sullivan (father) is one of the main members of the mafia, a killer who speaks in this way and an expert. One of the children wants to get to know his father's job (a terrible mistake), so he hides in his father's car and well, he sees Tom Hanks in action to say it this way. <br /> <br /> The mafia does not rule, in the Mafia no one wins when he wants you, they pull you out. Of course, you can see anyone who works in the mafia with a huge house, the best car in the world, whatever you want, but do the wrong job or do something that your "boss" does not want, and you are fired and killed. <br /> <br /> You can see what I mean in the movie, Sullivan Jr. he sees something he did not have to see, and almost all his family is killed for this "bad thing" his son did. The movie is really funny, you see how Sullivan lives after the mafia is chasing him or something like that. <br /> <br /> This movie is a bit sad, it shows us revenge, the dirty work that people do, almost everything you like. I hope the guy reading this comment does not work for the mafia, and if you work in the mafia, do yourself a favor and get out of the country before you are killed by your boss and their employees. <br /> <br /> This movie gets: 10/10
