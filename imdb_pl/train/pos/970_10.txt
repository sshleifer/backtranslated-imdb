Now I have seen many films, but each of them has some very good ones that were really good for me. And I'm a 19-year-old man who is impressed by this movie directed to a younger audience. It is a very underestimated jewel for those who watch foreign films. Almost all the acting is reliable, the graphics are decent (for which you will not even care about watching the movie. Trust me, complaining about the graphics would be a stupid task), the story is well written is a movie that everyone can enjoy not only children. <br /> <br /> Here's what this movie actually did. That one, it made me laugh ... a lot, two, it made me feel like characters like you and three, it's a very uplifting story. At the end of this movie you will feel good. Sure, what anime did not contain a young boy turning into a great warrior and anything to defeat some great evil. This is a formula that is often used. But in this case it is excusable, because even if they use puppets for some characters and some average graphics that can be seen 5 years ago, their appearance can not be judged. It's very touching, the tip is original and keeps you in the movie, how it should be. However, if you try to compare it with other movies, such as "The Never-ending Story" or anything, it will be different in your opinion. Watch it as it is and you'll like it. <br /> <br /> It's been a long time since I was impressed. The only other movie I felt this feeling was when I saw TMNT when it came out. In this movie there is something about TMNT that really made me love it. So do not take this film too seriously, just enjoy it.
