Finally, a thriller that bypasses car chases, explosions and other eye-catching effects. The film combines a simple story (an attempt on the French president) with a perfect background. He deals with the behavior of people with authorities and explains why we will observe almost every order (even murder) that will be given to us. <br /> <br /> In addition, it shows us how secret services can manipulate history and how difficult it is to control them. The best thing about this movie is that there is no classic "end of Hollywood" that can be easily predicted.
