This movie has everything. This is a classic description of the events that surrounded the migration of thousands of Cuban refugees. Antonio Montana (played by Al Pacino) is one of the thousands who have a chance to choose their destiny in America. This cinematic but extremely accurate picture of Miamis' drug empire is amazing. Brian DePalma performs an amazing job, guided by this image, so much so that the viewer engages in both the story and each character in the cast. Because the presence of Tony's character is so credible and strong, Brian DePalma plays the raw talent revealed by Steven Bauer (Manny, Tony's best friend), Mary Elizabeth Mastantonio (Gina, Tony's Sister), Robert Loggia (Frank, Tony's Boss) and Michelle Pfeiffer (Elvira, wife of Frank). I enjoyed every minute of watching this movie and watched it every week. This year, on the twentieth anniversary of this classic crime movie, I am a true believer that for the next 20 years, people will continue to appeal to the film in an amazing number. Because other crime movies are so dramatic that I can see, this movie is a shock to the system.
