In your video store you can find this gem. <br /> <br /> Human condition in modern LA. Without exaggerated drama, only the collapse of events that can happen to any group of people over time. <br /> <br /> It helps to understand the joy and desperation of urban life. <br /> <br /> The direction and cut is top class. Cinematography and music are very much in tune with the mood and the situation. AND CAST !!! <br /> <br /> Outstanding cast and excellent acting. Nobody outside of the place or outside of character. <br /> <br /> And it is not as much a downer as one would expect. I gave him 7 out of 10. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen it, DO!
