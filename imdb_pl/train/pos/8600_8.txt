There was some hesitation about what this movie has to offer. At first, casting did not seem right. Kiefer Sutherland did very well at 24, and the preview did not seem to offer anything difficult for him or the public. Eva Longoria appeared out of place, and the rest did not seem very interesting. <br /> <br /> When the movie finally ended, I was not completely dissatisfied because I saw a decent thriller that could have been a lot better. Did the responsible parties make a bit more effort to observe the narrative gaps and devote some more attention to the development of the character . We have already seen these types of threats, which made the main conflict much harder for writers. As an audience, we do not want to relive the same old story again. We want to see something different, be delighted and entertaining. <br /> <br /> There is nothing wrong with the casting. From the delicious first lady Kim Basinger. It carries so much grace and sex appeal that a part will be remembered. Michael Douglas was and he did it before. Unfortunately, the president is a non-subject who even cares for his fate. Sutherland remakes his "24" approach with a hard guy with enough power to make him big enough for a big screen, and Eva does a satisfactory job as a novice. <br /> <br /> Do not expect so many twists and turns of fireworks as some of the renowned classics ("North by Northwest" and "The Fugitive" come to mind). Leave your expectations outside and enjoy the ride for whatever it may be. Fine.
