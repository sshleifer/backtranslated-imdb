My wife and I watched this series at least three times. I can not imagine how it could be better. This is not a "complete" history of World War II, no library could have such a story, but it is the best summary of this story. Lots of detail, many personal stories and still retains the overall picture. <br /> <br /> Olivier's narration is perfectly written and, of course, greatly served. Interviews are from all sides, except Russian, because the producers could not talk to many Russians. It's really worth having this complete DVD program. We value our copy. <br /> <br /> The producer is great at delivering photos and actions where there was almost no archive: there are almost no movies from convoys and underwater battles, but still, the episode on this subject is very well done .
