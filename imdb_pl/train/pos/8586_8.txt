Welcome back Kiefer Sutherland. It's been a long time since you've appeared in the movie, and what a movie it was, whether it was 24, but very intriguing, especially with a professional such as Michael Douglas at the helm, as an entangled Secret Service agent. Kiefer's character is the one that chases Michael Douglas, and the film "Partner Kiefer" is Eva Longoria, "Desperate houswife". wow, it can actually work outside of flirting all day long and look good, but I would like Kim Bassinger to have a bigger role, but other than that, I really think the whole movie was explosive from start to finish. This film is what I consider to be a political thriller, everyone played their part in the hand. nothing has been revealed in the film so that you can always guess. and I really think that Kiefer did one piece of good work here in this movie, but in my opinion, Michael Douglas had a "thumbs up" day performance.
