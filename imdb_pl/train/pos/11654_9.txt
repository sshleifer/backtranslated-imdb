I agree with the above commentary, I love realism in this, and in many films (not just films about eating disorders) producers seem to forget about it. They take on a daily problem and create an extremely dramatic scene, and then films end in which everything is perfect, which I do not like, because it is not reality. It does not mean that things can not be better, and it does not mean that there is no stuff in this movie, but it does not spend most of the movie creating all these problems, and come to the end of the movie everything is perfect again. When people have eating disorders, people not only admit it and want to improve themselves, and then life becomes peach, takes time, and I like how we develop with characters in this movie, we go through difficulties with them. better and worse, because it's a very important part of the movie. He gets into the minds of people with eating disorders and shows complications and pain in a very realistic way, and I loved it. I also love how it shows. The secret and betrayal that people experience when they suffer from eating disorders is terrifying to see how people react when they learn about it, especially if they agree. I thought this movie was very moving, beautiful and well-told, and definitely one of my favorites.
