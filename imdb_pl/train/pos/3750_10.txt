This is a great shortcut. I think each voice is performed by Jason Steele. (you can only barely say if you've heard his normal voice, so do not worry they sound the same, they do not do it.) It's about 15 minutes. the spatula fights the war with spoons and meets strange people. in fact, everyone he knows seems crazy. <br /> <br /> "edward!" "general peterson, we have to take you to the medical unit!" "No, I will not do it edward." "Do not say yes, I'm sure everything will be fine." "I'm goner edward, and you know that. Before I leave ... "" yes? "" Can I just ... one kiss? "" Umm no. " "Come on, just one, small, mouth in mouth?" "I'm leaving now." <br /> <br /> There will be a movie soon. the date of this is in September, but will probably be pushed aside.
