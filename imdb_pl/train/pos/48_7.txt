I'm from Belgium and that's why my English writing is rather bad, I'm sorry for that ... <br /> <br /> It's one of those little-known films that only play once on TV and seem to disappear in the air. I browsed through my old VHS Video collection and came across this title, I checked it and had an IMDb score over 7/10, it's pretty decent. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that this is a very good combination of film and that's why I'm surprised. This is the director's only film ...? Why did not he make many films after this quite good ...? Someone with such a big potential should be forced to make another film, ha ha ;-) <br /> <br /> Anyway, I really want to see that he pulls out his act and makes another good movie, like this, .....?
