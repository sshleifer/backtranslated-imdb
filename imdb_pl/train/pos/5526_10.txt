I love cinema, so what I'm going to say confounds me deeply. I gave my thumbs to "Che, Parts 1 and 2" without watching the movie. I know terrible. But I fell into a trap committed by ... who? I really do not know, but there's a negative word in my mouth that's spread like wildfire, and no matter how smart I think I am, I've fallen into it. But fortunately I came across the Argentine film director Martin Donovan, a man I love and admire. When I told him I would not see him because I knew the movie was a failure, he looked at me as if he was ready to hit me in the face and Donovan was a pacifist! He set me aside and told me how much he loved this movie and why. I went to see both parts right away, and "Che, part 1 and 2" is the best movie I've seen in 2008. It is, with such purity, that it will remind you of the work of some great masters of the past. Respect for his audience is something that we are not used to. I do not know if we've ever been. Riveting, moving, without concessions and Benicio del Toro is simply extraordinary. We see his soul, we can actually see it. Man's humanity is overwhelming. So, thank you, Martin Donovan, for educating me so sincerely. Bravo Del Toro, Bravo Soderbergh and everyone involved in this groundbreaking movie. Do not make the mistake I was about to commit. Go see it now on the big screen
