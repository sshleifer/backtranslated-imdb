With modern sensitivity sometimes it is difficult to watch older films. It's annoying to see a stereotypical wallflower librarian who has to take off his glasses and become pretty and stupid to win a man. Especially such a shallow and unstable person. He is obviously a player (I would not trust him to stay true to her) who does not want to settle, who only looks at stupid attractive women and always calls them "darling" (ick!). Even after she completely changed her appearance and life for him, she only goes to her after she (apparently) has been rejected by another woman and finds out that Connie has spent all her money on refurbishing the boat for him. I wanted her to defy him, not to pursue him miserably! His sudden conversion in a few minutes was completely unrealistic and did not work for me. <br /> <br /> Besides this topic, I liked the movie. How can you dislike sailors dancing with each other ?! (You could say that they came from San Francisco .... D) The "trial" dance was great, watching how Ginger Rogers deliberately falls into "right steps" was great. The last dance scene "Face the Music" with beautiful costumes and art deco set was beautiful. And I really liked "We Saw the Sea" (although they used it a few times, as if they realized it was their best song). <br /> <br /> In any case, the plot was a bit weak, like most musicals (IMO) - and the songs were OK, but the dance was worth watching. I would like them to be able to show some pictures from San Francisco because the movie was supposedly set. <br /> <br /> It is also strange to watch such a light sea movie with the knowledge of what Hitler has already done. I must try to suspend all knowledge in order to immerse myself in the imaginary land of fantasy.
