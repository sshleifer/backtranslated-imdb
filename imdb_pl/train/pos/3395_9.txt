This is a brilliant sci-fi movie that is very strange in how men and women watch the same movie. I talked to many people about the movie and almost every guy loved it and said he was brilliant - while most women thought it was just disgusting and stupid! This is the only film I know has such polarized views based on gender. Perhaps many women simply have less tolerance for disgusting or depressing threads - but whatever the reason, I always find this difference fascinating. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a murder and another investigation led by Charlton Heston. This is set in the near future, and the head of the huge international corporation Soylent was murdered. As the film unfolds, you quickly realize that this is a terrible and highly unjust future American society. The rich live in beautiful apartments with security and all the pleasures that can buy money (including "furniture" - a euphemism for paid lovers who come with the apartment). At the same time, the masses are poor, unemployed, and in many cases live in abandoned cars or corridors. Overpopulation and smog have had a serious harvest, and the future really looks terrible! <br /> <br /> Why the rich man died and a terrible truth that he could not live with, really should not argue - he can ruin a movie for you. However, the movie has a great story and works and is super exciting. Additionally, in his last screening, Edward G. Robinson appears on the screen as Heston's crappy midfielder. Though not for easy to despondency or squeamish, this is a great sci-fi movie that is allegorical and profound.
