It was a bit difficult to imitate to the extent that it seemed to be immersed in the middle while I was trying to make the head or tail of who fought who and why. One of the problems is cultural / linguistic. We have a Chinese / Taiwanese / Japanese problem here, which we do not know much about, and because we just read English subtitles, we inevitably lose some of the subtlety. Another problem is that there are only too many, only partially explained, twists and coincidences. Nevertheless, it seems unlikely that Miika's completely evil film would exist and it certainly is not. Plenty of stylish and crunchy violence, a window on less than orthodox sexual activities and the family aspect. All in all a decent ride, but maybe checking the plot can be helpful before watching this one.
