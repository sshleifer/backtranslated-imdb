I saw this film premiere on Friday (1/19) a night at Park City at Sundance and I was tremendously moved. Sitting in the theater and listening at first hand, the tormented soldiers passed almost more than I could bear. Others in the audience were equally moved, and although we wanted to turn away, at least we could give testimony, because these men and women shared their experience with us. Robert Acosta, Paul Rieckhoff, Sean Huze and Herold Noel, all veterans of the Iraq War and taking part in the film were present. Although they may be at home now, you can say that this war is still in them and it will probably always be. Regardless of whether you support the war or not, it is our duty to support the soldiers with something other than a bumper sticker. Watch this movie!
