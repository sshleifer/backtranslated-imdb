Recently, I watched this movie on a lazy Sunday afternoon with my friend and have fun! This film is a masterpiece of trash. Try to watch it for this purpose! Of course, it was not expected, but the performance of the actors (and Alberto Tomba is absolutely the best), a poor script and cheap budget created an amazing mix of stupid things. Tomba just retired in alpine skiing, where in the late 80s and 90s he was the dominant technical skier. Tomba has won three Olympic gold medals, two world championships and nine World Cup season titles. Seriously about the director: no one knows why Damiano Damiani signed the film. All of Damianie's other tips are considerable.
