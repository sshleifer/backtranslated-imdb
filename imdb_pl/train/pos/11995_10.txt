"Zakręć!" <br /> <br /> The 90s were opened thanks to the clever Disney favorite "TaleSpin", a TV series with characters from the "Jungle Book". Join Baloo and the Cloudkicker Kit when you fly the Sea Duck like never before: from Cape Suzette, to Louie, to the mountains, through the jungle, to the water, to the volcanoes, looking for adventure, looking for treasure, looking for a fun, action-packed cartoon adventure! !!!! <br /> <br /> It was my favorite, just like my family. It lasted in The Disney Afternoon throughout the first half of the '90s, until the original cartoons moved to the Old Disney Channel in 1995, which I saw on vacation once in 1996, before I got the cable in March 1997. <br /> <br /> And good news: today DVDs are here !!!!! Experience the fun and excitement of "Dun, dun, dun, TaleSpin !!!!!" <br /> <br /> 10/10
