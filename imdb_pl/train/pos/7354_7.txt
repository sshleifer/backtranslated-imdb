I saw this movie for the first time over 25 years ago on British television and only last week I caught up with it on a DVD copy purchased on eBay. I remembered the music sequences, the color and the wonderful plate poses and clothes, but the story is weaker than the previous Anna Neagle / Michael Wilding Spring movie in Park Lane, and Maytime can not stand it that well until the end of the year. But Michael Wilding is a joy in the movie, charming, funny, he seems to have a great time and great shape. It's worth to watch it. Anna Neagle appears next to him, a bit too old for the role he plays, but at the end of the forties their film partnership was well-established and the cinema began to appear. Spring in Park Lane was the best hit in 1947 and a big money producer. In his autobiography, Wilding wrote for a long time about his great appreciation for Herbert Wilcox, director and initiator of this London series of films.
