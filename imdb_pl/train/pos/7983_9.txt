It is difficult to make this film in several ways. Everything works very well here; casting, acting, script and photos are paramount. For a film-maker it is a moving, violent story of love and human redemption. There are a lot of sharp technical techniques and advantages for the film critic. There are some tactical errors, and as discussed on the boards, at the end there is a lack of realism if someone is rigorously formal with the CIA agent's training angle. However, I took this ending as more moving, because instead of implementing the pragmatic approach of the CIA agent, Creasy basically recommends his Ultimate soul, without taking into account the consequences. Like Jesus himself, Creasy becomes superhuman thanks to his sacrifice, regardless of whether it has a pragmatic meaning or not. In any case, I appreciate the fact that Creasy is without conventional bourgeois morality and simply covers bad people one by one in his methodical search for justice, which in fact leads to redemption for both him and the innocent. <br /> <br /> In any case, this movie is very worth seeing, if you are interested in this genre at all. Excellent soundtrack, great writing, flawless castings and solid performances on the whole surface make it a movie with 100 best (or better).
