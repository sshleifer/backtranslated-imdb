I've seen a lot of HK actors, and this one is at the very top of the genre. Action scenes are as exciting and kinetic as anything you've ever seen in any action movie. Kung fu is spectacular, pyrotechnics are striking, stunting heart work. The editing is perfectly controlled, increasing the voltage and completing the operation of the liquid camera. The film's director is the old pro Corey Yuen, whose biography is filled with the best works of this genre, including the Jet Li The Legend of Fong Sai-Yuk. If one film is missing in this film, the presence of the three-dimensional hero, though Martin, the male leader, is the closest to him. This movie is full of archetypes, not characters - a sexy killer, stupid thief and his strange girl, croaking villains. Having said that, Shannon Lee has a great presence on the screen; he's great at fighting, stunts and weapons. When it's on the screen, it's hard to take your eyes off her. She is so good. Why is this woman not a star?
