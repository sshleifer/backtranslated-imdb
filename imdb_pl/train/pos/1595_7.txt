Although I would say I like this program, I was expecting something completely different than when I first saw "What I like about you" I expected to find something like "All this" (I'm not sure if this is happening) but I have to say that I like this show and although I do not classify it as a breakthrough show, it is very charming and I like chemistry between characters (including supporting cast) <br /> <br /> I would definitely say it's great to see Wesley Jonathan back on the screen because I really loved him in City Guy. I also saw a woman who plays a popular friend Valerie in Popular, and although I think it was a good performance, I do not like her character in this series because she's just not my cup of tea, but she's pretty good at it
