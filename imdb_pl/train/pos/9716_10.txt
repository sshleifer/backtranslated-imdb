To like this movie, you must be a) strongly in love (without marriage) b) recognize English humor, which consists in admiring the brave and humorous life situations, and not just on gags c) be quite intelligent, because the authors gave the opportunity to laugh and cry over every minute of this movie and only if you meet the requirements of "b" and "c", you can recognize and enjoy the author's contribution. d) to fully enjoy the movie, you must love women like Kirsted Dunst, who is so natural, sweet and irresistible. e) you have to admire creative, a bit melancholy people with wonderful and amazing personalities <br /> <br /> if you meet all these requirements, you will probably rate this movie for 10 points. <br /> <br /> I never laughed at half (!) Just like watching this masterpiece. And even I managed to cry laughing at some moments (I always feel sensitive when Kirsten Dunst is going well)
