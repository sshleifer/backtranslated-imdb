Anarchy and unrighteousness prevail in the village of Elk Hills. The elders from the cities are replacing the hard, respectable Vietnam veteran Aaron (the wonderfully solid and engaging performance of Kris Kristofferson) and several of his vet friends to clean up this place. The plan becomes sour when Aaron and his cruel colleagues decide to take over the Moose Hills after they get rid of all the bad elements. Aaron's good brother, Ben (playing with pleasure in the performance of Jan-Vincent Vincent), should stop him before things get out of hand. Screenwriter / director George ("Miami Blues", "Gross Pointe Blank") Armitage raises a delightfully amorous, cynical and perverse subversive contemporary "drive-in" winner: he skillfully creates a rough, senseless tone, keeps the tempo crisp and uninterrupted all the time and the scenery of abundant action scenes with considerable muscularity (the captivating explosive climax is particularly strong and thrilling). The first-rate cast of B-feature's famous faces is the main asset: Victoria Principal as sweet friend Ben, Linda, wonderful Bernadette Peters, singer with Little Dee salon, Brad Dexter as cheeky mayor, David Doyle as slimy bank president Andrew Stevens as a polite gas station employee, John Carpenter's film, regular Charles Cyphers as one of the veterans of Nam, Anthony Carbone as a casino manager, John Steadman as the old restaurant owner, Paul Gleason as the strong arm of Shakedown Bully and Dick Miller as a talented pianist. Moral: Do not hire other people to do your dirty work. The beautiful pictures of William Cronjager, the vivid, harmonious, bluegrass result of Gerald Fried and the abundant brutal violence additionally contribute to the general kitsch play of this unjustly neglected little doozy.
