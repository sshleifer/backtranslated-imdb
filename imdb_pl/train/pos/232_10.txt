What a great movie. The figures were not only alive, but alive, reflecting everyday life and conflicts in the family. Each character brought to the story a unique personality, which the audience could easily associate with someone they know in their family or a group of close friends. <br /> <br /> The story has a real movement that the viewer can learn and become a part of drama, laughter and tears as the film's story unfolds. The script does a good job, capturing typical emotions, actions and reactions of heroes to conflict, opinion and determination. <br /> <br /> It's not epic, but it's a very nice movie to watch with your loved ones. Plenty of knowledge of the head and moments of "ahhh" for sharing and joy.
