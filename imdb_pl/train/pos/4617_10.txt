I've been a fan of Jennifer Connelly since the Phenomena, and when I heard about seven minutes in the sky, I saw it as fast as I could. Film is not only a comedy, if you think that many of the things that most of us have survived as children, and which now are experiencing not only a great movie run by the phenomenal jennifer connelly, but also captivated my attention that this movie was written in great way and I acted that it was a good deal. I loved it and watched it many times and for those of you who like to laugh or love jennifer, you can not postpone watching this movie !!!!
