the only season came here in Australia and I thought it was absolutely brilliant! I love it! all stories are so good! and there is a much more realistic view of the lives of teenagers and families today. and yet he continued to maintain strong family values ​​of keeping together and being for each other. their problems were real and they really attracted you to the show. the spectacle is basically about this family called "Days" and their lives. the family consisted of Abby Day (mom), Jack Day (dad), Natalie Day (sports daughter), Cooper Day (son from outside) and Nathan Day (boy with a brilliant son). every episode is the day of their lives, and the coopers see everything in it. I loved the coop, its view throughout the whole concert was just great. he was definitely my favorite character. it ended with so many things that could be continued, I'm really sad that the next season was not done. it was a great performance that I miss.
