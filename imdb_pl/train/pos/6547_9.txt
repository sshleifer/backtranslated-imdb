I took my 10-year-old daughter to see Nancy Drew over the weekend and found myself totally entertaining. First of all, it was clean and I mean my standards. Most of today's children's movies are full of raw humor and jokes to make cheap teenagers laugh. Nancy Drew, however, is smarter and the humor is subtle and clever. <br /> <br /> The title role is played by the refreshing spontaneity of Emma Roberts, which is dashing and polite, never annoying. Unlike Brady Bunch, in which anachronistic characters are mocked and ridiculed, Nancy's style is treated with respect and dignity. This is a great moment when girls from LA "consciously style" with their Paris Hilton outfits are rejected by the owner of the boutique, while Nancy in her moccasins and the homemade dress with the pattern of Buttericka is covered. This film avoids the hit we need to enlighten a healthy girl with so many Hollywood movies. Nancy remains faithful to herself and her values ​​all the time. <br /> <br /> The secret is taut enough to be addictive. There were a few moments when my daughter nervously grabbed my arm, but there were no unreasonable shock scenes. It's all based on tension and mood and is great fun. The auxiliary staff is good, especially Marshall Bell as a terrible caretaker. There are some great scenes from Eddie Jemison, Chris Kattan and Bruce Willis, and many moments that will make adults smile. <br /> <br /> This movie deserves better grades than some of them. I was not only happy that I was not drawn into another computer animated film in which talking animals will pay and let gas all over the place, but I was also very entertaining. If I was there without a child, I would still enjoy the movie. This is one DVD with the name of my daughter under the Christmas tree.
