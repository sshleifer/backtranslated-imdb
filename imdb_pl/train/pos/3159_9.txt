... and the series lets you forget about all this. I am three years older than the children shown in the series. I was born in 1958, I learned to ride during the first gas shortage and I got my first job after graduation during the second gas shortage in 1979. The seventies were a really terrible time of being young - inflation, struggle for a minimum after school - gravity with postponed thirty-something, terrifying music, worse clothes. <br /> <br /> It's funny that this series does not ignore anything and still manages to make the 70s look good, even for those of us old enough to know better. He manages to look directly into the face of the 1970s - along with authentic clothing on time - and yet fill the performance with the hope of youth and what makes high school and years of study the best and the worst. Then there are parents. Two young lovers in the show - Eric Forman and Donna Pinciotti - really have terrible parents with the best intentions. Eric's parents, Red and Kitty, are not exactly June and Ward, although they are traditional for a decade. They represent what happened when the 1960s finally reached the suburbs in the 1970s. Donna's parents are two people who have been waiting for the 1960s to show their whole lives to give them a bizarre legitimacy. Eric's friends, Fez, Kelso and Jackie, complement the group representing nervousness, incompetence and good snobbery, respectively. Hyde is an unusual teenager for a suburban show, but to a large extent he represents someone who has to play cards he has received, even if these cards are given away by absent and careless parents. I highly recommend all eight seasons, although the eighth season is slightly delayed due to Eric's absence.
