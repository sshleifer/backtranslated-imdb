I just discovered that it is more disgusting and shocking than "Little Britain" and I like it! "The League of Gentlemen" is a sick British comedy about the most terrible, crazy and disgusting town in the whole of Great Britain. This place makes Dibley and Craggy Island (from "The Vicar of Dibley" and "Father Ted") seem quite normal !! The show's format resembles LITTLE Britain, except that they all focus on the burghers of this infernal city. Both performances still repeat the same sketches in each episode, and some of them inspired Little Britain (especially cheating in search of work). But the program is different, because although it's primitive like "Little Britain" (so it's not a children's program), the show has a sad and sadistic character that sets it apart from all of these concerts. In particular, cruelty to animals and serial killing are repeated themes throughout the entire show. <br /> <br /> If you have not guessed it, then it is NOT a program for children, easily offended or normal people and probably because I liked it. However, you really need a very thick skin and love for the terrible, to enjoy it to the max. Funny and unbelievable, unbelievable - you have to see it to believe it.
