British comedies usually fall into one of two main types: quiet, introspective, usually romantic science and farcical social satire. Settings, characters and concepts are different, but some features mean that the vast majority of shows are in one of two categories. Butterflies are probably the first type epitome. <br /> <br /> The scenarios are very verbal, including the long internal monologues of the main character Rii, a happy but dissatisfied housewife who is curious about what she could miss when she started a completely conventional life. When he meets a successful but clumsy and emotionally active businessman (who makes his interest quite clear), he plays with the idea of ​​finding out what the second path could offer. <br /> <br /> Acting and screenplays are always on money, which makes the reaction to the show almost entirely personal: I was not surprised or turned off. On the other hand, my mother loved this program. I think that the degree to which he identifies with Ria's dilemma is the most important factor determining the response to butterflies.
