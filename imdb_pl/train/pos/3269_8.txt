CHANCES ARE is a charming romantic fantasy about a woman (Cybill Shepherd) whose husband (Christopher McDonald) dies soon after learning that she is pregnant. We see a husband in heaven, letting the powers know that he was taken too early and that his wife needs him. It is said that he can return to earth, but not alone. 19 years old, when we see the daughter of Shepherd (Mary Stuart Masterson) preparing for graduation and meeting a young man (Robert Downey Jr.), who turns out to be the reincarnation of her father. The film is somewhat predictable ... history goes to all the places you expect it to, but it's so delightfully played by the energetic cast (especially Shepherd and Downey) that you can not help but get fun. Shepherd was rarely seen on the screen as being better, and she and Downey are backed by a talented group of actors in the background. A charming and charming fantasy that will consume and enchant you.
