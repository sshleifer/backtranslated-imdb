The director's venture of Govind Nihalani's novel by Vijay Tendulkar is brilliant. Om Puri is playing inspector Velankar, who is forced to protect the underground world, there is no Rama Shetty, he played the sraphiv amrapurkar. This is the most talked about movie by Govind Nihlan. It's a very good and classic movie. Smita Patil plays the main female role at the side of Om Puri. Naseeruddin Shah is brilliant in an episodic role. Although Sadashiv Amrapurkar has only 4 scenes in the film, he dominates the film. It was the acting debut of Sadashiv Amrapurkars. Am Puri won the national award for this film for the best actor. Winner of the Filmfare Award for the best film, history, supporting actor (Sadashiv Amrapurkar).
