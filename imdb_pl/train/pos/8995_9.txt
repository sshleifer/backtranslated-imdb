I could not find anyone to watch DiG! with me because no one I knew was a fan of any of the bands. Of course, everyone assumed that you can enjoy this movie only if you like The Dandy Warhols or Brian Jonestown Massacre, but it's so far from the truth. The only requirement is interest in music and / or pop culture in general. The way in which the careers of both groups are parallel is a perfect reflection of the paths that the band can take, and watching Dandy Warhols eats and spews the audience is fascinating. I agree with other reviews that mention that it would be nice to get the last word from Anton himself, because he is clearly portrayed as his worst enemy and bastion to the band's ability to stay. <br /> <br /> The most interesting for me is Dandy's respect for BJM (despite their lack or reciprocity) and for Anton (despite his unpredictable behavior). The Dandy Warhols respect the art created by the group, even if the group hates everything they now represent Dandy Warhols (though it is debatable). The best line is the situation in which the drummer from Danda's band says: "I will not bore them anywhere" and the guitarist unknowingly says "I will continue to buy their albums". For me it shows how powerful music can be. <br /> <br /> Definitely see this movie, even if you know nothing about any of the bands. It's more about the subject of rock music and their development, which makes this film so interesting. It's rare to follow a group for so long.
