Both Robert Duvall and Glenn Close played their roles with such credibility, I just cried. Glenn Close's role as Ruth showed that she wants to deal with the situation, but she was under the rule of her husband. "Think about what he did," Robert Duvalla said firmly, Joe. History depicts a rural family engaged in the accidental death of a son by his brother, called the "Stone Boy", which means that he was so distraught and overwhelmed by what he did, he became emotionally paralyzed. Then, at the end, when Jason Presson's character, Arnold, let it out to the stranger, I was so broken for him that I thought of some of the terrible things I had done in my life. I personalized and identified his character. The roles of Frederick Forrest and Gail Youngs did not add much to the film. I was thinking about Frederick Forrest, who played the antagonistic, female brother Ruth, Andy, as a moron who did nothing to help in this situation. His wife, Lou, played by Gail Youngs, acted like a crazy lady, striking Arnold of frustration for his own problems without mercy and blaming him for his troubles. I could not really regret these two. Although Lou tried to keep the marriage together, she was not successful. Both of them have NOT successfully solved their problems. They really did not do anything for the movie and they were completely ridiculous. The small role of Wilfred Brimley as a grandfather, considering he was the only person who paid attention to him. I felt that his role should be developed. The players simply did what they thought was sufficient and sufficient. However, I really liked the ending, I actually smiled and cried tears of joy. I felt good. Hillermanie was a family again. Actually, I wanted to be part of this family. They were so realistic.
