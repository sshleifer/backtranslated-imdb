After the cold sex scene between Andy and Gina in South America, we know that Andy is a wage manager who is in a difficult economic situation, where he needs extra money? We also found out that he was stealing from work and used money for his drug habits? He also tries to keep up with his wife, who can have an affair? <br /> <br /> To solve all their problems, he convinces his brother that he can join him in order to steal a small store for parents? Their parents are happily married and owned a jewelry store in New York's Westchester County? Sixty thousand dollars is all they need to get out of desperation? <br /> <br /> The three main characters are important in this movie ?? <br /> <br /> First, two brothers? Each of them is a complex person, threatened by many motivations and deep in doubts and disappointments? They are both desperate figures, financially and emotionally. <br /> <br /> Andy is selfish? He feels he never had love for his father? He is a tainting influence, turning his brother into a striker, and his beautiful woman into an adulteress? <br /> <br /> Hank is too weak to resist his brother's wishes? His ex-wife is one of the reasons why he needs money because he owes hundreds of child allowances. He wants to regain the trust he once had with his father? <br /> <br /> The third character is tired and sad father Charles Hanson (Albert Finney), especially in the haunting climax scenes? <br /> <br /> Saying you more about the details can reduce the impact of the movie, and thus the entertainment ... <br /> <br /> Tomei's performance transmits great depth and emotion, even with its appearance, touch, its special traffic ??? strong, fresh and brutal.
