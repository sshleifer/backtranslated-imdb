The frustrated middle-aged deputy district attorney George Maxwell (excellent performance of George E. Carey, who also produced this painting) can no longer stand up for his provocative, ice-cold wife Edith (the perfectly weird Anne Bellamy). Worse, poor George is additionally burdened with a newborn sun and a lusty lesbian teenage daughter (dishy brunette Sheri Jackson). George has adultery with a charming, tempting and casual hippie swing Candy Wilson (beautifully played by a sexy girl by a delicious blonde, Patricia Wymer). Complications arise when George is blackmailed by bitter Julia Freeman (nicely queuing Kathy Williams) who wants George to jump out of his boyfriend-rider Laurence Mackey (terrifying Robert Tessier, who has a head full of hair here) from prison . Director Tom Laughlin (yep, the same guy who portrayed Billy Jack!) And screenwriter James McLarty cram wonderful, seamy, winning and very funny surplus of delicious feminine nudity, sizzling with soft sex and raw violence. What's more, they precisely define the entire wild and unrestrained sensitivity of the youth culture of the 1960s and link the plot in a tight 75-minute time, ensuring that this film is not overly pleased. One clear attraction occurs when Candy invites his groovy friends at Maxwells home to an improvised bash basement with sweat burning, rock music and, of course, hot naked dancing chicks. The functional result of Robert O. Ragland hits a sharp point. Black and white photos of Stanton Fox add an additional rough edge to the depressingly depleted scenes. Most importantly, these fast movements are a great showcase of completely charming and fresh-looking pixie Patricia Wymer, who positively illuminates the screen with her sweet, sparkling personality and captivating beauty. Totally cheesy feast.
