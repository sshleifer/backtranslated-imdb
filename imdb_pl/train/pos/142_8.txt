The second part (actually episode 4-8) of the hit Danish TV series is slightly worse than the first, but it also has lots of laughter and terror. This time, Udo Kier plays two parts, as a monster and his demonic father. Other prominent parts are this time Dr. Krogshoj Søren Pilmar, who has to face the terrible revenge of Dr. Helmer and once again patient Drusse is trying to solve the secrets, the style of Miss Marple. Ends on the cliffhanger and after the death of the main actors Ernst Hugo Järegårda (Dr. Helmer) and Kirsten Rolffes (Mrs. Drusse), you are wondering how they will ever be able to create Part III, but I hope that Von Trier will give it a shot. Unfortunately, Morten Rotne Leffers, Dishwasher Down's Syndrome # 2, died shortly thereafter. Look for Stellan Skarsgard in the episode. ***
