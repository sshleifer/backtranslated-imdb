After the release of the DVD, I came to the market and bought it. And I think that my money was in good condition, as I expected before buying. A great movie, what else can I say about Willie Smith, was an amazing actor, as always in action or serious movies. It always gives record braking performance. I think it is a movie after Rush Augustus, which makes a person cry while watching. The way the director described the story was really amazing. His previous life and new life in the film have been properly developed for the public. Even I could not find any fault in this story or in the way in which it is made. I think this DVD should be home, because it will be a really cool thing for your collection. This is not a movie that needs pop-corns for pleasure, it is a movie that allows the audience to learn lessons. now, which is a lesson you can see while watching. And I advise those people who are film critics to watch it if you could find some criticism about the movie, and then please talk to me.
