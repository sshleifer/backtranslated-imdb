When I first saw The Shining, I was expecting a decent movie of what I had heard about him, and I liked the many other works of Stanley Kubrick, but when I started watching him, it was much better than I thought it would be. Sometimes I really felt ridiculously uncomfortable and could not take my eyes off the screen, but there is something very disturbing about this film. Now some people do not like The Shining Kubrick's version because it does not follow Stephen King's book, but in my opinion both the Kubrick version, the mini-series and the book are great. Jack Nicholson gives you amazing performance. I'm looking for a good original movie that will allow you to think even after movies, and then watch The Shining.
