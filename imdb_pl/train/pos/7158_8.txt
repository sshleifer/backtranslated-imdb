Holes (2003, Dir Andrew Davis) <br /> <br /> When Stanley Yelnats IV is unlawfully convicted of theft, he is sent to "Camp Green Lake". In this camp, the Guard and her two supporters, Sir Sir and Dr. Pendanski, order the campers to dig holes through the hole behind the hole. But for what reason? Stanley plans to find out. <br /> <br /> I never really wanted to watch "Holes", and I must admit I really watched this movie because I'm a Shia LaBeouf fan, but even if you're not a fan, it does not matter. "Holes" is one of those Disney movies that the whole family can use. The story is beautiful and contains a great idea of ​​incorporating flashbacks into the past. They are not distracting and really give a great story. All casts are great. Young stars are doing well, and the addition of Jon Voight and Sigourney Weaver is a joy. Shia LaBeouf shows that even at the age of 17 can work without any defects. This is one of the Disney movies, you would definitely like the family. <br /> <br /> "I'm learning from failure." - Stanley Yelnats III (Henry Winkler)
