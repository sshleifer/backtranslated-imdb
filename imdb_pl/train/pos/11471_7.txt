I am a big fan of verite cinema and I saw this movie because I heard how interesting. I can honestly say that it was really interesting. The two top actors are amazing, the movie is not boring, and the concept behind it (though of course inspired by Columbine killings and homicide killer movies) is really interesting. There are a few weaknesses, such as the last 20 minutes that really reduce the realism visible in the first hour, and the ending really does not make sense. The shaky camera can sometimes be distracting, but in the real cinema that is given. But I still think that the film is very well done, and the director Ben Coccio deserves recognition.
