While a rather pleasant musical, what stuck in this film was an unexpected comedy chemistry between Basil Rathbone, as a composer, and Oscar Levant as his assistant. Rathbone played a very intricate, distracted type of art (far from his more well-known roles as dangerous villains or cool logical Sherlock Holmes), but he could not find a way out of bed without help. And this help is Starbuck, played with his typical humor by Oscar Levant. After employing Crosby as his spiritual song writer, Rathbone introduces him to Starbuck, saying, "He's doing all my thinking for me," to which Levant says, "Ah, it's just part-time work." Of course, this happens just after (or over) Rathbone, who is too busy to worry about where his next song comes from. As another reviewer said, who knew that Rathbone could be so funny! It is a pity that he did not have more opportunities to show his comedy talent.
