It is quite well known, so I will not go deeper into it. The basic story is about two teenagers who learn about a slime-like foreign spot of a smear that comes to Earth through a meteor. Human contact with this slimy sphere burns through the body like acid. It also absorbs human bodies, thanks to which it grows. Nobody believes teenagers (Steeve McQueen and his girlfriend), and when they finally do, it seems that you can not stop a drop. It's really well done for this age and unlike many other 50s movies, the pace is quite fast. This story is unique, which makes it necessary for every fan of old science-fiction movies and monsters. If you can dig a horror movie from the 80's, check out the remake from '88.
