Much richer in texture and character than even classics from the 30's and 50's. George C. Scott was born as Scrooge, just like he was born as Patton. Mr. Scott will be known as one of the greatest actors of the twentieth century. Scott's Scrooge figure seemed to jump off the screen. Scott as Scrooge brought to the screen a richer, more solid but deeply moving Scrooge than any of his predecessors as the ugliest man in eighteenth-century London. Mr. Scott seemed to introduce Scrooge into a more personal, understandable but highly conflicting level; his role worked thanks to the great authority that Scott always showed on the screen: but his usual warlike voice was whispered sometimes, almost like a monologue, because he criticized Christmas with one voice and at the same time revealed his own human weakness in his next line. He could portray sour and crunchy Scrooge and incomprehensible, sympathetic Scrooge in the same scene. <br /> <br /> A really amazing performance of the giant of his generation.
