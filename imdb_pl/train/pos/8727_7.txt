The life of mistakes is a good movie. But for me it has nothing to do with films like Toy story and stuff like that. Do not get me wrong, I liked the movie, but it was not as good as the Toy story. The film has visuals, laughter and other things that the Toy story had. But the movie did not seem so ... I do not know, but I thought it was still a good movie. <br /> <br /> Life of a worm ... I do not want to say it, it's a movie I do not remember. I saw it years ago. Of course, I have not seen Toy's history for years, but I still remember it. I should not have been reviewing this movie, but I am. I'm raising my fingers, though it's not the best job that Pixar did. <br /> <br /> The life of the worm: *** / ****
