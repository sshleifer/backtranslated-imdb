I went to see this movie with my brother and his girlfriend. The place was quite packed and we all laughed so hard it was easy to miss the lines. I knew it would look good, but it was much more fun than I thought. I liked Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci, they seemed really weird, like normal people, if that makes sense. I'm fed up with movies that show teenagers that they're similar to people like "jock," "geek," or "cheerleader" ... etc. Both characters were unique, but still human and normal enough to relate. I will recommend this movie to all my friends and I look forward to seeing it on DVD, go see this movie with friends who can laugh at the funniest parts of life! I plan to see it again in the theater and often do not watch things more than once.
