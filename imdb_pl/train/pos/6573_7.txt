From the very beginning, the movie has the impression of playing - it seems to me that it would be a better game than a movie, because the set design and dramatization make the film version a bit too artificial. But it's still pretty good, and history and dialogue in particular are interesting. They made the dialogue exactly the same as the real game. Perhaps this is a good introduction to Shaw's plays. <br /> <br /> Rain's main character has his head in the clouds and a talent for drama, and Helena Bonham Carter's acting is good here. Her fianc√©e, Serges, is a bit too caricature when she really has to be an incredibly handsome figure. Her parents are fun enough.
