It is very rewarding when we see how one great work of art is transformed into another without distortions and tricks. I had no idea how to reproduce such extraordinary literature as a film worth seeing. If you loved Bulgakov's book, you would have been understandably afraid that you would see some misinterpretation made more due to the design of the artistic film than the actual introduction of the deeper meaning of the story to the screen. There are several examples of this with the Master and Margarita. As complicated and stretched as this story, the film leaves nothing behind. It's as if the director read Bulgakov's work in the same way that the orchestra conductor reads the score - without any notes. Why can not we find such talent in the United States? Now my favorite book and movie have the same title.
