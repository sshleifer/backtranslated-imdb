I rate it 10 out of 10. Why? <br /> <br /> * Offers insight into something that I barely understand - surfing surfers, because that's all they want to do; Nothing else matters to them like surfing; This is not a temporary thing - it's a lifetime for these people * Buried in the movie is a great surfing story; I have never surfed, but I love to surf movies and see a lot. No one taught me what the movie did. * The film was very well edited. It floated well. Interviews were great * It's interesting from the beginning to the end <br /> <br /> In summary, it's as good as a document, as I saw, so I have to evaluate it. So 10/10
