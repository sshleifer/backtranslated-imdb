Wow, I really liked this movie, William H. Macy is great as a quiet striker Alex. <br /> <br /> All performances here are really good, the story is interesting and fun. /> Alex, a married murderer (like his father) with a small son, goes through a middle age crisis and wants to quit a family business, so he goes to a psychiatrist for help and here he meets young Will the spirit of Sarah, who falls in love with him, fall in love with him. One day Alex does not know what to do when he gets a job to kill the person he knows. <br /> <br /> I recommend you watch if you like mature, interesting movies. <br /> <br /> 8 stars = very good
