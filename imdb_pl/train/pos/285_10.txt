I would just like to say that no matter how low the film's budget is, it should be shown all over the world in these films. We do not read much anymore, people want to watch movies instead. The release of this series on DVD made me want to read the whole series and I want more. PLEASE DO EVERY 8 FILMS. Do not change any of the characters, it destroys the effect. Because I loved the actors who played in the form. PLEASE DO EVERY 8 FILMS. I want to see a message and see a message that these books and videos are here to present them. We do not have enough. AMAZING WORK!!!
