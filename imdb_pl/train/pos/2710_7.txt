This is not my favorite WIP ("Women in Prison"), but it is one of the most famous films in this genre. It was produced by Roger Corman, who at this point has already produced several WIP. It is obvious that the film tries to play in accordance with the established formula. The film takes place in an American prison, not in a "banana republic," like most WIP movies. I'm not sure if it was a wise move, but it's an acceptable change of pace. Screenwriter-director Demme really does his work, always looking for new ways to present a known scenario. In fact, he is a bit too ambitious for his own good. The creator creates several surrealistic dream sequences that are pretentious, but it's nice to see how hard it is to place this movie above the average chick movement in chains. But do not worry, Demme still works within the parameters of the subspecies. There is plenty of nudity and violence, something that will satisfy hardcore fans. The movie is a bit slow but it is very funny. The cast is good. Roberta Collins is a WIP veteran, so she does not need to be admitted, and Barbara Steel is stunned as a crazy warden associated with wheelchairs. Pam Grier, however, is very misguided.
