Clara Lago is wonderful as the title character of the film, basically a film about a Spanish / American girl who moves to Spain with her mother during the Spanish Civil War. It turns out that the mother goes home to die and she stays with her grandfather. He befriends and experiences a lot in a short time. Tomiche (Juan Jose Ballestra) is initially annoying to her when they approach. The film is beautifully shot, bathed mainly in soft colors. Carol misses his father, who is a pilot of war, and you can feel the love that sher has for him. While the war itself takes up a little space in this film, it embraces the heroine's life. I think you like it. See it especially for Clary Lago, who does a great job as Carol. She is definitely for watching.
