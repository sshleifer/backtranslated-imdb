The early movie Kazana noir won the Oscar. Some of these reviews relate to the extraordinary detail and length of the film and its symbolism and evaluate it very highly. I can almost see where they come from. But I prefer a more subdued approach to a long-forgotten movie that seems to be shot virtually without a budget and quasi-documentary. Plague plague is loose on the streets of New Orleans and to the chief physician (Widmark) and city detective (Douglas) you must stop the main carrier (Palance). The film is moody, filmed in raw black and white and uses locations very well. Widmark is wonderful as usual. Forget about symbolism (crime is a disease and illness is a crime) and just enjoy the pursuit. Watching such a movie is not always easy, because we are in this new century, because it has a special style that was very short-lived (after World War II until the early 1950s) and unlikely to be interesting for an ordinary film observer. For those who will be watching this for the first time, sit comfortably on the big chase at the end. This is something different and to be honest I do not know how they filmed some of them. I can say that filming the finals probably lasted as long as the first 90 percent of the movie.
