This film is a spectacular, exciting, exciting action image with a lot of dark humor. It was one of the biggest hits of 1993. This is one of Harlin's best films. Lithgow is a wonderful funny black character. Stallone has certainly made a brief return to this harsh thriller. This is probably Harlin's best work as a filmmaker. <br /> <br /> The DVD has a sharp anamorphic transfer (2.35: 1) and great Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound. The DVD contains the current commentary of the director with Stallone comments. The DVD also has a technical commentary. The DVD has a stage behind it, two deleted scenes with the introduction by the director and many more. Do not miss this amazing action movie.
