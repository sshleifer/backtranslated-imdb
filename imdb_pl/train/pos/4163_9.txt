I saw it as a child in the late eighties and I have to say that Galaxy Express is one of those films that stay in the imagination for a long time. If you have never understood the attractiveness of anime, the discovery of this movie may be your golden ticket to the city of Otaku. <br /> <br /> The story is as delicate and poetic as Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. Mobile animation, although somewhat traditional, has a vivid style that violently portrays Leiji Matsumoto's great talent for character design and visual storytelling. <br /> <br /> This is one of those special children's films, such as Star Wars, Dark Crystal The Wizard of Oz, which completely exceeds the status of "family entertainment" and is a classic cinema on its own terms. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie.
