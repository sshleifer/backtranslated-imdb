Stephane Rideau was already the star of his tour in "Wild Reeds" and is one of the biggest indie stars in France. In this film he plays Cedric, a local boy who meets the holiday Mathieu (Jamie Elkaim's newcomer, in a stunning, refined, ethereal performance). Mathieu has complex relationships with her sick mother, requiring aunt and sister (with whom she has a competitive relationship). Soon, they both fall in love. <br /> <br /> The broken narrative of the film - which consists of long flashbacks, fragments of the present and real-time forward movement - is a bit daunting. Director Sebastien Lifshitz does not signal the time we are in, and the plot may be difficult to track. But hold on to it: the last 45 minutes of the movie are so engaging that you will not be able to take your eyes off the screen. At the turn of the heart and uplifting, this film ranks in the category of "Beautiful Thing" as a compulsory cinema.
