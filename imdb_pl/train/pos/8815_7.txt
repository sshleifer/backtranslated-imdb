This collection of eleven stories in one film is a great idea and presents some great segments, but also disappointing surprises. Based on the tragic event of September 11, 2001. In the United States of America, eleven directors were invited to present their approach to the American tragedy. The result of most of them is not only individual compassion for the American nation, but above all, intolerance in the world with different cultures and people. <br /> <br /> Ken Loach (United Kingdom) presents the best segment on September 11, 1973 in Chile, when the Democratic government of Salvador Alliende was destroyed by the dictator Augusto Pinochet with the support of the United States. <br /> <br /> Other excellent segments are one of Youssef Chahine (Egypt), showing intolerance in the world and the number of victims made by US governments in various countries along modern history; and the one from Mira Nair (India), showing the true story of injustice and prejudice against a Pakistani family whose son was wrongly accused of terrorism in the US when he was indeed a hero. <br /> <br /> Some segments are beautiful: Samira Makhmalbaf (Iran) shows innocent Afghan refugee children preparing a harmless bomb shelter while their teacher tries to explain to them what has happened on the other side of the world; romantic Claude Lelouch (France) shows the life of a couple in New York near the WTC; Danis Tanovic (Bosnia and Herzegovina) shows the effects of his war in a small place and the lonely protest of widows; Sean Penn is very poetic, showing that life goes on; the story of Shohei Imamura is probably the most impressive, showing that there is no Holy War, but sadness and disgrace. <br /> <br /> Segment Idrissa Quedraogo (Birkina Faso) is very naive, but it illustrates the terrible bad conditions of this African nation. <br /> <br /> Segment Amos Gital (Israel) is very boring and manipulative, it shows more violence and terrorism. <br /> <br /> Segment Alejandro González Iñárritu is very disappointing, horrible, without inspiration and certainly the worst. <br /> <br /> My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): '11 de Setembro' ('11 September ')
