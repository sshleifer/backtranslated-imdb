The Sea Is Watching was made from the original Akira Kurosawa script and is indeed a lush and warm movie. Watching it will be a pleasure! <br /> <br /> Kei Kumai as a director is certainly not equal to the old but eternal master (especially the massive scenes at the beginning of the movie have terrible acting), but the overall mood and scenery is very pleasant. Another thing that is missing here: Kurosawa has always allowed heroes to be more than what they actually show and do. <br /> <br /> Probably it was his magic on the set during the shooting; and maybe this script was not yet fully ready. <br /> <br /> Maybe we just miss the master's eye. <br /> <br /> This is one beautiful and sweet movie, but this is not Kurosawa. Expect that it can be very stupid ...
