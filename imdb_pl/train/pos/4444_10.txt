Most Italian horror fans seem to hate this movie because it has nothing to do with the first two films of demons. And with the title "Demons III" one could assume that it will be so. The problem is that this movie was never meant to be part of the Demons series. Distributors only have "Demons III" above the original title "Ogre" to earn the popularity of other movies. A new American DVD with this picture has the title "Demons III: The Ogre" on the box, but the movie only says "The Ogre". I do not know if the previous releases had the title "Demons III" on the film itself, but this new release seems to be a little white lie. If you can go through the title "Demons III", you can enjoy "Ogrem". It starts with the intrigue of creeping and remains quite crawling. Slowly there are no movies and movies, but I still dug it up. Just do not expect it to be similar to other Demon movies. I give "The Ogre" 7 out of 10. Italian fans should try it out.
