It's a great movie. In the same genre as "Memphis Belle". I saw it about 10 years ago. And I would like to see it again. There is a connection with the story of hellish angels !! Like a pilot crew, he fights with the Germans in WO2. And most of the changes create pilots for Harley rs. In a way, the film really happened. To see a film! I reed the story of infernal angels in hells in hells angels.com Regards Frederik. <br /> <br /> Cast and crew: John Stamos, John Stockwell, Teri Polo, Kris Kamm, dir. The story of noisy forest rebels rebels with a cyclist who joins the army to avoid a stiff prison sentence after a little contact with the law. Although it is tormented by the discipline of the army, it soon turns out to be under fire as a brave and charismatic leader of people in scout troops in Spain during the Second World War. more Â»MPAA Rating: PG Runtime: 88 minutes
