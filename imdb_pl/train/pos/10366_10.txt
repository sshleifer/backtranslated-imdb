Unqualified "10." The level of writing and acting in this Australian film is reminiscent of the best "old" Hollywood. Sam Neill and Meryl Streep are very good. Neill adjusts the line of Streep to the line and takes it to his hand - this is one of the best showcases of his great acting talent and is the best in his sexiness and magnificence, despite the intensity of his role. This captivating movie is a treat for any movie fan who loves the thrilling drama of the courtroom, depicted in the most human but inexpressible categories. The film - which has won several best awards in Australia - can boast not only a great cast and director, but also great and authentic Australian venues. It proves that people are the same all over the world. And after all these years, people still like to repeat the famous Streep line, accent and everything: "Dingo ate moy baby!". Including the impel "Elaine Benis" in "Seinfeld".
