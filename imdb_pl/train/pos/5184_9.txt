A deeply humorous but honest comedy about an adult group (Bill Paxton, Julie Warner, Kevin Pollak, Elizabeth Perkins, Vincent Spano, Matt Craven and Diane Lane) who were invited back to Tomawka, a camp in Ontario, Canada by their former consul (Alana Arkina). Screenwriter / director Mike Binder used his experience in the same camp as the main source for creating a delicate and understandable yarn that makes sense. In addition, the movie has many funny moments, some of which are quite strange, like my favorite, this one concerns the use of masking tape. Newton Thomas Sigel ("The Usual Suspects", "Three Kings") provides the film with impressive shots of the Canadian wilderness. Among the cast, Sam Raimi, the director of the films "THE EVIL DEAD" and "The Gift", appears here as the inept right hand of Arkina. One more thing, this movie assured me that the camp does not have to be a place of bloody murders.
