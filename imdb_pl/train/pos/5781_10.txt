"Most of us live at least two worlds, the real world in which we are at the mercy of circumstances and the world inside, the unconscious, safe place where we can escape ..." With these words, Mr.Gone introduces the world of "The Maxx" to a fascinating world in which fantasy and reality are combined. Inspired by Sam Kieth's comics, "The Maxx" is very faithful to the material in which he was inspired, not only in history, but also in a graphic style that looks like the pages of the comic, giving this show a surreal and unique look. But also the story is interesting and fun. At times it may be too weird, but when you get in it, it's hard to get out of it. History and characters are wonderfully developed. The music fits the style of the show perfectly and gives it the right atmosphere. Unfortunately, like many good animated programs, this one was short. "The Maxx" is a must. This is one of my favorite games.
