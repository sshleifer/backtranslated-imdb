The film really challenges the imaginations of identity and the society in which we live. It is well made and very strong. The people in the film are honest and reveal a world that exists beyond the normative ideological perspective. I believe that it gives a great insight into a subculture that shakes the ideas that the viewer has in society. It is sometimes shocking and more powerful because of it. Some parts were difficult to watch, like most realities, but it was not finished. Well, when you watch it for the first time, but it gets even better the second or third time; because you had the opportunity to discuss topics that they discuss and question.
