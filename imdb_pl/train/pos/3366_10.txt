Ettore Scola, one of the most sophisticated and grand directors we have for the world's citizens, is not yet available on DVD ... (now it's summer 2001). <br /> <br /> This great classic has returned to theaters in my hometown thanks to Sophia Loren - a summer retrospection and I saw him again on the big screen after so many years watching it on video tape ... it's a real gift. <br /> <br /> To avoid criticism, try to prove the point anyway: I took my reluctant little brother with me to see this movie. He had never seen a movie before and "he does not like those Italian Oldies ..." Like everyone else in the theater, he was intrigued by this miracle. Even during the final titles, the theater remained completely silent. <br /> <br /> This SPECIAL DAY is really special. A miracle of perfection. And a big loss, if you have not seen it yet ...
