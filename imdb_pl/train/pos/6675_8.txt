The director of this film was fantastic for comedy. Many of the scenes seem to be from the comic and much darker (visually - not tell stories) than I expected. It's true that this can not be the funniest movie ever made, especially if you're in very crude sexist jokes, because it has very little (compared to others like Something about Maria or American Pie). As you observe, a few jokes stand out and become more fun. If you've ever read a comic book or watched a movie in the style of a comic book (Batman, X-Men, etc.) and you liked it, you'll probably enjoy the subtle humor that lasts throughout the movie. If you do not like them, you can like the respectful mockery that this movie has for those. If you liked this movie, dvd has cool add-ons. (8.10)
