I saw this movie before joining the British Army. I went through basic training, initially difficult, and then when I made progress much easier. I spent my time on the heights of NI and the Cold War. There were times when I asked myself about what I got into, not for long, because training always took control and you always reacted instinctively. The voice used to display what the soldiers think is in place, although I would add a breath and pulse, because it seems that in some situations it sticks into your drums. A few years later I was in Canada to meet my family. My aunt, who lives in the USA and is a lecturer at Columbus Uni Ohio, wrote an article about the effects of the British Army in NI. She spent some time there. Although she was stalor, she was very anti-British. She made a bee line for me and condemned me for being a British soldier. My only answer was: "A long day dies". The nearest civilian will understand why a soldier does what he does. The answer is at the end.
