In the eighties, long before the creation of NAFTA and corporations that began losing their national identity, the United States and Japan were each other in the world of productive races. Remember words like "Union Yes!", "Japanese take over this country" and "Americans are lazy?" <br /> <br /> When the Reagan era ended and corporations approached the global market, director Ron Howard held one of several trips to the comedy genre with his hit "Gung Ho" from 1986, which brought over $ 36 million in American box office. Although in many respects the outdated history of colliding cultures in the workplace is still a hard truth for modern industrial life. <br /> <br /> "Gung Ho" focuses on Hunt Stevenson (Michael Keaton), Automotive Union Rep from Hadleyville, a small, depressive city at the foot of Pennsylvania. Stevenson was asked to visit the Assan Motor Company in Tokyo (similar to the real Toyota), which is considering an American operation in an empty factory in the city. Because hundreds of residents are out of work and the city is approaching collapse, Assan decides to move in and Stevenson is hired as a liaison between company representatives and employees on the assembly line. <br /> <br /> 112 minutes Gung Ho 'is a humorous look at these two sides, with their strengths and weaknesses equally well contemplated: on the one hand, an American workforce that values ​​its traditions, but often falls into the frenzy of pride and trade unions; on the other hand, Japanese employees who are very devoted to their work, but have no personal satisfaction and self-esteem. In Stevenson, we find an American working class figure of average intelligence with the ability to talk to people through misunderstandings. Thanks to the survival of his workers and the majority of Hadleyville on the line, Stevenson proves that he is a nice guy who does not want anything more than a fair chance, though his cunning will put him in a lot of trouble. In addition to the Assan chiefs' answers, we are witnessing a delicate balance between Stevenson and his union members, many of whom grew up. This includes Buster (George Wendt), Willie (John Turturro) and Paul (Clint Howard, brother of Ron). <br /> <br /> The Japanese cast is directed by Gedde Watanabe, also known from "Sixteen candles" and "Volunteers. Watanabe plays Kazihiro, the manager of the plant, who is unlucky and begins to feel compassion for American life. He is constantly followed by Saito (Sab Shimono), nephew of General Assan, who desperately wants to take his place in the pecking order. Despite the light touch, these characters are very good at communicating ideas for Japanese work culture. <br /> <br /> With Hunt Stevenson dominating in the script, Michael Keaton must ensure solid performance of this film. "Gung Ho" is indeed Keaton's success, who also collaborated with Ron Howard in 1994 in The Paper. He made the film during a series of lighter roles that included "Mr. Mama, "Beetle Juice" and "The Dream Team" before they set off in "Batman", "One Good Cop" and "My Life". It is also hard not to like Gedde Watanabe as a freak who first wears Japanese shame before joining forces with Stevenson to make the auto-bet a coherent unit. <br /> <br /> The supporting staff is at the highest level of notch, including Wendt, Turturro, Shimono and Soh Yamamura as Assan CEO Sakamoto. Mimi Rogers provides the romantic interest of Audrey, Hunt's girlfriend. Edwin Blum, Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel joined forces to write a solid Gung Ho magazine. The random music that won the BMI Film Music Award was composed by Thomas Newman. The Gung Ho soundtracks are the '80s, including' Do not Get Me Wrong ',' Tuff Enuff 'and' Working Class Man '. <br /> <br /> The success of "Gung Ho" actually led to a short-lived TV series on ABC. Though more impressive as a social comment twenty years ago, Ron Howard's film still has a comic value. It is available on DVD as part of the Paramount Widescreen Collection and is a bit changed. Audio options are available in English 5.1 surround, English Dolby surround and French "dubbing", but the subtitles are in English only. There are no extras, not even theatrical trailers. On the plus side, the Paramount digital transfer is quite good, with a small amount of grain after the initials and high sound quality. While a few additions would be helpful - especially since "Gung Ho" was a box office success - not much is complaining about the presentation of the film itself. <br /> <br /> *** for 4
