At the beginning it is a very funny movie with a few crazy characters that run around to laugh (see two Russian mistakes). <br /> <br /> Bug's Life has a classic Disney story, but that's one good thing about the movie. Family values ​​are valued, and the main characters in the film undergo evolution to finally face the grasshoppers. He also has some great readers Dave Foley, Julia-Louise Dreyfus, Kevin Spacey (of course), ... But in reality the most amazing thing about this movie is animation. It's just wonderful. All the details, great colors, every ant looks different, beautiful backgrounds ... And the guys and girls from Pixar made everything look so realistic. All in all, a very nice job. This is the best Disney animation since Aladdin.
