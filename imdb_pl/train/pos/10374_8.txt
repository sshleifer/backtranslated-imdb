I just sat in a very nice, fast 45 minute ROLL game. <br /> <br /> The roll is about a boy from the country, Mat (Toby Malone), who dreams of becoming a sports star. Mat travels to the city and is to be picked up by his cousin George (Damien Robertson). In any case, that was the plan. George is associated with a gangster, Tiny (John Batchelor), and makes a delivery for him. Needless to say, Mat is drawn into the world of George. <br /> <br /> I thought it was great how Mat teaches George morality and respect, while George teaches Mat how to relax and enjoy life. Toby and Damien were well staffed and did a great job. <br /> <br /> Every character in the movie compliments very well, the two cops were wonderful. David Ngoombujarra brought a great comical relief to the film. Tiny played a friendly gangster who reminded me of one of my favorite characters, "Pando" from Two Hands. <br /> <br /> One of the other things I liked about Roll was to show the cities where I grew up and lived for 20 years, Perth and Fremantle. It was good to see the monuments and landmarks with which I grew up, especially the old ferris wheel. <br /> <br /> To Rocks 'n' Rolls
