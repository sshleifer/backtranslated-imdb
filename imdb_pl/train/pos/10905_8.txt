In September 2003, 36-year-old Jonny Kennedy died. He had a terrible genetic disease called Bullosa (EB) Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) - which meant that his skin literally fell off with the slightest touch, leaving his body covered with painful wounds and leading to the ultimate fight against skin cancer. In recent months, Jonny decided to work with director Patrick Collerton to document his life and death. The result was a film that first appeared in March, was a uplifting, misleading and provocatively entertaining story of an individual. Not to avoid the grim reality of EB, the film was also a celebration of life to the end. Produced and directed by Patrick Collerton and first shown in March 2004, The Boy Whose Skin Fell Off has become the most popular documentary film of the year. It attracted nearly five million viewers, and after the screening, the audience donated over half a million pounds to Jonny's charity, DEBRA. The Jonny Kennedy Memorial Fund was set up to raise another half a million to ensure that Jonny Kennedy will leave a million pound inheritance.
