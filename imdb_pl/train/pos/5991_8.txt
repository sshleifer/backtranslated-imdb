The continuation of "Angels with dirty faces" just by name, "Angels wash their faces" suffers slightly from the usual giggles of Dead End children. In fact, thanks to the presence of Dead End Kids and Ann Sheridan, this should be treated as a real continuation of Angels with dirty faces, at least for the sake of continuity. <br /> <br /> Speaking of Ann Sheridan, she is the only real glowing light of this film. Paraphrasing the stereotype, Ann Sheridan could read from the phone book for two hours and I would buy a DVD! <br /> <br /> Another advantage of this movie is the chemistry between Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan. Unfortunately, this aspect of the film is too far in the background. For a better example of the Sheridan-Reagan duet, I recommend Juke Girl or Kings Row.
