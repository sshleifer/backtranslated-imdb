The film was very sweet and cordial! I'm crying almost every time I watch a movie. I recommend this movie for everyone. The film was so inspiring for me. The actors did a great job, and the film was played very well and done. The movie was about a little girl who had a parrot she named Paulie. Paulie was separated from her by her parents because they thought it would be best for her. <br /> <br /> After Paulie experienced so many people, he was in the cage himself in the basement. In the end, this Russian man who got a job at the watchman's place. He found Paulie in the basement and Paulie talked to him, telling him the story of his life. In the end, the man helped Paulie to unite with Marie (the little girl who raised Paulie). Love has overcome all obstacles.
