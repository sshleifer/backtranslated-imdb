My favorite film by Jackie Chan will always be "Drunken Master" (1978), and then this 1985 movie "Police Story". Chan plays in this super-police officer from Hong Kong, who beats the notorious ruler of the crime and his gang, and then is assigned to protect the male girl (Brigitte Lin) so she can return evidence of state. When the story goes on, the gangster sends his thugs to send Lin, but Chan takes matters into his fists and feet, while keeping the girl Maggie Cheung at bay. Like "Drunken Master", "Police Story" has many characteristic stunts and top-class choreography of martial arts / action, which Chan is famous for, culminating in the royal battle in a crowded shopping center. As a director, Chan exceeds perfection, giving a charismatic and fun performance that highlights the action. In the light of the slapstick drunkenness of "Drunken Master", in the bottom of his heart "Police Story" is just a policeman, a lively cop thriller, which would be copied in the years to come. <br /> <br /> 10/10
