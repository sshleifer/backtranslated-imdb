Yes, Keaton looks like he really liked making this movie. Apart from stepping into tailored striped suits, he'll remind you of Jimmy Cagney! Johnny (Keaton) is a young hood who does it just to pay for his mother's expensive medical bills and send his younger brother (Griffin Dunne) to law school. Nobody even knows Johnny Kelly, Johnny Dangerously, until later in the film. Joe Piscopo is Vermin and he does not like Johnny (and I do not like Vermin). Marilu Henner has a nice singing / dancing routine, while Johnny enjoys it. I love this part when they are in a constantly changing car! The policeman who "calls all cars" is Skipper from Gilligan's! See this gangster laugh from 1930! Gags in this movie are fun, but you have to catch them because you will miss them! Look at the background of each scene.
