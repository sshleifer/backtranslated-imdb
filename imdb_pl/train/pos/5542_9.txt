Probably the best photo ever produced by the producer, this little horror draws attention from the first to the last. Director Frank Wisbar of course knows a good story when he writes one, and more importantly, he knows how to realize his full shock potential on the screen. Not only the plot is fascinating and the characters are fascinating, but the setting is absolutely out of this world! Almost the whole action takes place at night or in the middle of an adjacent, ubiquitous fog. This chilling atmosphere is enhanced by the ingenious direction of Wisbara and the absolutely convincing performances that he has drawn from all his players. The charming Rosemary La Planche makes an ideal heroine, beautiful, full of vigor, but sensitive. Robert Barrat presents his usual, nonsensical, simple portrait of the local bigwig, although it is hard to believe that the handsome, handsome guy who plays his son is no one else, like the later director / director dullsville Blake Edwards.
