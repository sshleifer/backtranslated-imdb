Absolutely one of my favorite movies of all time. I've seen it at least a hundred times and I can not go through it without crying. I oppose anyone who sees Celie and Nettie, Shug and my father, and I do not feel your eyes hazy. Whoopie Goldberg should receive an award for an amazing portrait. And for a person who said that you can not love a movie, if you loved this book, wrong! I am this testimony.
