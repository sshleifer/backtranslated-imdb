Heh, if I tell you to compare The Dark Knight with some 18-year-old film adapted for comics rated at 5.9, will you call me crazy? It's just to attract your attention. Every day I meet people complaining that there are no good movies that seem to know only the latest hits. Finding and exploring old films, especially those with good artistic qualities, is not a bad thing. Dick Tracy is one of those that can not be easily outdated when it comes to technology. <br /> <br /> Negative reviews mainly complained about the "mixed up" DT story. But it seems to me that the plot is quite clear and I did not have a problem with it. I have not seen comics, but I am not a big fan of comics in the USA, but I appreciate top-class film productions and performances. Perhaps the expectations of most people were too high when it came to the story he would tell. But if you see a movie in which Madonna and Warren Beatty are together, what would you expect. I had a few scratches on my head and I can not stop wondering if we really saw the same movie? The title role, although not as competent as it seems, was still able to attract him and charm the audience. Madonna was more expressive than "breathless" in her seductive role, but she added a lot of fun to this story. Al Pacino was fun and wonderful to himself. Apparently he is brave enough to be sarcastic in his earlier successful roles. We see a hybrid of Scarface, Michael Corleone, Adolf Hitler and Robert De Niro who hit our slits to make us laugh. And many thanks to makeup. <br /> <br /> It is not bad for me. The surreal feeling really caught me.
