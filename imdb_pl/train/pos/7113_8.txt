The film, coming from the suburbs of Philadelphia and very interested in local history, provides a perfect view of Philadelphia in the 1940s. There are scenes in the city center, a railway station that no longer exists, a 30th Street station - which still exists, as well as scenes from the north-eastern part of the city. Good shots of old terraced houses, as they appeared at the time. The film sometimes becomes a bit "talkative" - ​​causing the viewer to lose interest briefly ... but the overall plot is solid and very moving. Anyone who has liked this movie should also try the movie "Bright Victory", also with a local movie from Valley Forge Army in Phoenixville, PA - and scenes from downtown Phoenixville. Since then, the Military Hospital has become a university campus. None of these movies is in any format and I can not imagine why. I have them both on VHS from home recording, as shown on TCM in recent years. I highly recommend them to other history enthusiasts in my area!
