Let me start by referring to my first meeting with Prince's music. It was at the bar on my 39th birthday and the girl danced naked to "1999" playing on the speakers. I asked people who this singer is? I was told it was a prince. It was so good that it pulled me away from the beautiful, topless dancer. Later, I started to hear other Prince's songs and really "kick" them. When Purple Rain appeared, I still knew very little about the Minnesotan. The movie threw me out. I immediately became a fan of the 1st generation prince "War Baby". Later I found out that one of my cousins ​​was his secretary and she and my nephew fell in V.I.P. Prince concert, where we sat next to his mother ... how cool it is! Coming back to the subject, I agree with Siskel and Ebert, who named Purple Rain an instant classic. I've seen it over 17 times and I really like it. I thought Prince was good, Apollonia struggled a bit, but all in all the game was fine. John Gielgud was not available to play "The Kid", so Prince took over the role. The film is visually stunning, brilliantly thought out (never releases) and is well directed. I belong to the best music films of all time. Last time I watched him after a 7-year break and he was still delivered. I am very proud of my friend from Minnesota Rogers Nelson and I would like to tell him personally. During the mentioned concert, he came to me and said: "Hi" to my nephew, but not me. He talked to his mother. I was a bit crushed, but he's still the number one with me.
