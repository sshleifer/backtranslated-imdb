I saw this movie for the first time 15 years ago. I thought it was perfect and I was still. I am a former English teacher (high school and college) and a lover of English Romantic poetry, so Coleridge highly values ​​me. Anything that could diminish the beauty of the poem or the power of the story would not bring me perfection. In this case, everything works well to involve the viewer, especially high school students. The story is well illustrated for the generation that grew up on television. In addition, Michael Redgrave's voice gives him authenticity and authority. Ok, so there was not a big budget for the project. So it was not Star Wars and there's no CGI in it. But who can reject the illustrations of Gustave Doré as part of the presentation? The above comment, which in only four lines rejects the video as a piece of rubbish, is grossly unfair and insensitive. I am a friend of the producer, but this is not my reason for this comment. On the contrary, I am defending a work of art that, in my opinion, has value at all levels. It is well suited to bring the Coleridge poem to the students in a way that awakens their appreciation and awakens their compassion for the lesson that the ancient sailor gives.
