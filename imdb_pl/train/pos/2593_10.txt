It comes out of the left field and REALLY is not what you expect. But I love it. The most unforgettable movie experience comes from surprise if you ask me about it. If you have not been informed about the mysterious "thing" that makes these brothers so strange ... you feel like a feast. <br /> <br /> The cast is fantastic, but it is not very tangible. Special effects appear out of nowhere (seriously, it's like a weirdly dark romantic comedy until they do - then WOW) and they're great. Overall cinematography is easy for the eyes, editing and sound are of very good quality, and the twisted story develops without cliches. Although none of these aspects make him a hit, "what the hell?" The factor alone makes him a movie treasure. <br /> <br /> People who play this movie do not make sense. This is one of those often overlooked movies from the 90s that you have never heard of, or love so much that you jump on the memory of his title. <br /> <br /> I am in the second group.
