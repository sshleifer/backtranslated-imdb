This is a series of cartoons in which most of the action takes place in a human body, where the actors are vitamins, viruses, blood cells, etc. I will not try to explain it in more detail, you just have to see it myself: I will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> I remember watching it as a child in the 1980s (with Swedish voices). I spoke to several people who were also children in the 1980s and they liked it too! I must admit that the educational part of the episodes did not reach me on the conscious level, but the whole idea of ​​educating children during play is great. Recently I saw several episodes; there is humor and heart in it that are hard to find in other children's programs. <br /> <br /> 5/5
