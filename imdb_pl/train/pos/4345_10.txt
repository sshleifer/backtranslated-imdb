Not surprisingly, this movie won 4 prices, it's a movie that stays on every soul, so it's not surprising why Paul Reiser needed 20 years to finally give in and talk to Peter Falk about his idea. I can understand every part of it, it's a movie that will make you cry only with tears or thousands. <br /> <br /> History: 10/10 When Sam kleinman gets a letter from his wife about her leaving, find something else that his son and he will set out on a journey to find her, and when they do, they will find something lost, Friendship , family and feeling to yourself. At the beginning you know what will happen, but no story is easy to guess from the beginning to the end, it is a ride between the father and his son, and husband and his wife. No wonder Paul Reiser needed 20 years to write this beautiful romance / comedy. <br /> <br /> Actors: 10/10 Well, you can not say anything more, what I would say, it's with Peter Falk in him is a legend, everything he does in movies is magic when you use Peter Falk in romance comedy, what do you think you have? Excellent result, no wonder that this movie is so perfect and won so many prices. Because son Paul Reiser does a great job, although he's not a great actor, which does not mean it did not work, Peter Falk and Paul Reiser play the perfect Father and Son, the rest of the cast is good enough, but you do not see them so much, so tell me that they do what they want to shine even more. <br /> <br /> Music: 10/10 It does not always work when you use music, sometimes it just does not fit, but it's not in this movie, music is perfectly matched, it creates an even more convincing movie. This part of the movie will shine as well as other parts, great soundtrack for romance / comedy for sure. <br /> <br /> Total: 10/10 There are so many movies about the romance / comedy cassettes, DVDs, Blu-ray discs and not, but this movie is one of those exceptional. it does not happen every day that you can create such a story, thinking about it takes years, and the fact is that what you need to create it is a great piece to buy and keep in the human soul, see it when you get old and You will see with an elderly father, I think that this film will spark like no other.
