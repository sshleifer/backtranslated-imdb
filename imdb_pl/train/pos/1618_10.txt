This film is brilliant in all respects. He touches the complexity of love relationships in a significant way, but never lectures. The script never goes into any character, not even for the unfortunate Johnny. It's also the benefits of direction, design, casting and performances. The fact that Cher is so perfect in the movie and more like "Cher" than ever before is a miracle for me. I watch Moonstruck at least once a year and just watched it again on Christmas Eve with my 16-year-old twin daughter. He has something for everyone with his heart and finally leaves happiness.
