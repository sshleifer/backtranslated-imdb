I love this program! Mr. Blick, Gordon and Waffle are cats so different from each other, but they are collectively called "brothers". I often try to imitate the tired, sighing accent of their butler, Hovis, and even the Scottish district of Gordon. There should be more episodes about human Kimberly. The episode of cats dressing up as teenage girls to get to the Kimberly dream party to get thirsty paws on your favorite drink, Rootbeer, is a funny classic. We can not drink the rooter in our house now, without making Catscratch or Hanson Brothers from the "Slap Shot" movie. Future classics. Where can I get the first two seasons on DVD?
