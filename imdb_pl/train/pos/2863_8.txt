Although this show has not been broadcast since 1973, after watching the DVD set borrowed in our library, I felt compelled to say a bit about it. <br /> <br /> I remember when it was the only show of colors on TV in the 1960s, and sometimes it would be a small "Sunday Night Party" with friends to watch it on NBC on one of the few color TVs. <br /> <br /> I really like history not so much names and dates, but how it affects us today and how much it can be so deep based on the most irrelevant activities of those times. Example: Virginia City, Nevada, which has become one of the richest cities in the world due to its silver, took its name from a character named "Old Virgin" who, during the first days of the city, stumbled from the saloon, collapsed and broke a bottle of whiskey. <br /> <br /> The old virgin did not want to waste the opportunity, because the precious liquid penetrated the land, he decided to baptize the city of "Virginia Town". The area became known as Comstock Lode because another figure, Henry Comstock, had a reputation trying to leap over everyone's claim, and the area became known as Comstock Lode. <br /> <br /> I just watched the early episode he was giving away with these 2 items. Other episodes concerned the literary uprising of Marek Twain, and the reporter of the Territorial Enterprise ... <br /> <br /> It was a healthy (and often educational) entertainment for the whole family. As someone else has pointed out, each episode will be considered a movie in itself - rich scripts and characters. <br /> <br /> The only thing that turned the truth was the proximity of Virginia City and Ponderosa. To tell the truth, to drive from Ponderosa (whole North Lake Tahoe), you would have to ride a horse about 3,000 feet (1,000 meters) down the Spooner Summit to the high desert (3000-4000 ft) of the Carson Valley, then another 30-40 miles to Virginia . <br /> <br /> Needless to say Cartwrights would have some sore back ends to do it regularly. But every writer should have some freedom about the truth. <br /> <br /> How I miss this performance, even today.
