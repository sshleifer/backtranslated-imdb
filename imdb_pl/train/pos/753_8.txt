A story about four teenage girls growing up in California. Jeanie (Jodie Foster) is the most balanced group, but wants to move out of her home, where she lives with her divorced mother (Sally Kellerman). Annie (Cherie Currie) is addicted to drugs, alcohol and bad boys and is beaten up by her father. Madge (Marilyn Kagan) has overprotective parents. Deirde (Kandice Stroh) thinks she is more mature than the rest. <br /> <br /> This is nothing new from what we've seen many times - but this one has a big difference - it's accurate. I graduated from high school in 1980 (when I saw the movie for the first time) and was surprised how realistic it is. Dialogue, clothes and attitudes completely broke down. Even the main song from the movie ("On the Radio" by Donna Summer) was a big hit before it came out. This movie hit me harder than any other teen movie of those times, because I could understand the characters and refer to them. I knew the high school girls who were just like that! The film is (of course) outdated, but gives a time that we will never see again. <br /> <br /> Acting is good in all aspects, and Foster gives you the best performance. The relationship between her and Kellerman (who was perfect) was realistic and well done. Even Scott Baio (who has a small role as a girl's friend) more or less realistically played a teenage boy. <br /> <br /> A very good movie - an essential review if you reached age in the 1980s. the film has a well-deserved R score (lots of drugs and curses), but it should be watched by all teens. I give it to 8.
