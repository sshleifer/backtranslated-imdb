In "The Odd Couple" there is nothing to complain about and it is no wonder that Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau form a highly winning comedy group. But there is something so deprived in the adaptation of Neil Simon to his hit stage play, to make it look more like a sketch on a comedy sketch than in a full movie theater. I have not seen this game, but I must assume that the screen version is quite faithful, because Simon wrote it, so defects can not be blamed for the adaptation of the set design. There are some interesting ideas in this story - two recently divorced men who immediately become traditional married roles when they become roommates, because no one knows otherwise - Simon never fully develops. Still, there are many worse ways to kill a few hours.
