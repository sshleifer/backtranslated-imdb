What would you say about the man who was about to marry and set up a bachelor party with some of his closest friends in a Hawaiian bar for men? Sail smoothly until you remove the "bachelor hat". What would you say about talking to one of the suggestive dancers, and then sleeping with her? What would you say if this exact girl was a cousin of his finances? New low truth? Well, Paul Coleman, played comically by Jason Lee, runs this sickening blur experience and a new low level. I must say that this is one of his good leading roles. However, I believe that his role in Vanilla Sky was better preserved. <br /> <br /> His finances, named Karen, play the actress Selma Blair, while the character Karen, Becky, plays a charming and talented Julia Stiles. Returning to the place where we finished, Paul now has to deal with one emerging problem to another. He gets sick, he has to deal with certain people and he has to play his stealthy lies or every member of every family can get P.O'ed, including one of his relatives, who did not have "flushing" for 14 days. * Vomit * All this leads to a long-awaited wedding with one funny scene, before recapitulating the hell through which Paul and his brother had to go. <br /> <br /> In general, A Guy Thing is quite funny and it's fine. Sometimes this story may seem nowhere and you'll get bored with scenes here and there, but it's a mixed movie. And if you're a Canadian and a fan of CTV series Brett Butt, Corner Gas, you would recognize the small role of Fred Ewanuicka, the same man who plays funny Hank in the show. This movie is fine. This is another feather in Lee's hat (so far a pretty empty hat). <br /> <br /> My rating: 7/10 <br /> <br /> Eliason A.
