Amazing effects to the movie of this time. The basis of the uselessness of war and how war becomes the guardian of herself. <br /> <br /> The great thing about this movie is that it is now a public domain and is available at archive.org. No fees, no registration required. Watch it in one sitting and you will be driven. <br /> <br /> I intend to share this movement with as many people as possible, because I have never heard about it before and I am a hard core fan of sci fi. <br /> <br /> I would like to see how others react to this film. <br /> <br /> Watch. <br /> <br /> Rate. <br /> <br /> Tell us what you think.
