For anyone who judged others at the first meeting, here is an excellent tutorial on depth of character. A grumpy old woman has a soft, thoughtful heart - and needs new friends. Flighty, uncertain, "ditsy" dame, who makes inappropriate, uncomfortable comments - sees deep in your soul and has pure love for everyone. Cold, primitive, neglected wife has a passion that cooks at any time - with the right setting. Excellent beauty - rich, sweet, partying, pursued by crowds - wants peace, silence and love without possessiveness. <br /> <br /> Taking the time to look beyond the surface, you'll find treasures in everyday life, from the least expected sources. All you need is patience and a spell.
