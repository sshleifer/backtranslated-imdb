Gregory Peck gives an excellent performance in this film. The last 15 minutes (or more) are great, and Peck is an absolute joy to watch. The same can not be said about the rest of the film. This is not terrible and I'm sure it was done with good intentions, but the only real reason (if I was to be honest) to see this Peck. For the rest, it's better to just read the Old Testament.
