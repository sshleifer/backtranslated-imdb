Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis) is wrongly accused of killing his unfaithful wife. On the night she was murdered, he was with a mysterious woman who refused to give her name. After being accused of murder, the police visit all the places where he was with her, but people remember that he was alone. He was sentenced to death, and his secretary (Ella Raines) decides to find the murderer herself because she loves him. <br /> <br /> The film was made as a universal film by Universal (look at the cast - all the characters' actors) and one star - Franchot Tone - in the fall). The budget was small, and the cast was mostly unknown, but what came out is one of the best film noirs of the 1940s. It is beautifully directed by Curt Siodmak and has a fantastic script from the excellent book of William Irish (the name of the pen for Cornell Woolrich). It moves quickly and looks fantastic. And there is the infamous jam session with Raines and Elisha Cook Jr., who just comes out of the screen with incredible sexual energy (I'm surprised that censors have not cut it). <br /> <br /> There are only a few drawbacks that prevent perfection. The tone gives terrible results. It looks horrible and is just awful. Curtis is also stiff and insipid as Henderson. You really wonder why Raines loves him - he's so dispassionate. But Raines is good at the lead. She is beautiful and full of life. Also the last scene in which the killer is after her never sounds real. It is not a physical threat, and its reactions seem simply exaggerated. <br /> <br /> I still give it to 9. A really great movie - defects aside.
