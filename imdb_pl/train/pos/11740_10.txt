I have no doubt that the critics watched the film, especially artists who need a laxative. It's a great movie about vehicles in the tradition of Abbot and Costello, and recently Don Knotts. It will not shake the world or change movies forever. What he will do is entertain. When everything is said and done, it is the most important thing anyway. Watch this movie and forget about the troubles. It even has a simple and nice moral message at no extra charge. I always loved Elvira's TV show when I lived in LA. She really did not steal her Vampire outfit, like Vampir from the original, Theda Bar. This kind of mythical character belongs to the one who does it best; & Cassandra Peterson does it best. Long live Elvira; we need more of these kinds of movies. It is never enough. The villain, William Morgan Sheppard, was also perfect. He exudes wonderful sophisticated malice. I could not find any technical mistakes. The performance is as close to error as a form of art. My deep compliments to the director, James Signorella and his entire crew.
