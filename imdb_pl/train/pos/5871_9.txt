I value every frame of this beautiful film. It's about ordinary people, people we all know who suffer a bit in life and have luggage to wear. Like all of us. Robert DeNiro, Ed Harris and Kathy Baker breathe life into their performances and are great, but Harris is particularly painful and therefore very real. You would swear that he really is a trucker who drinks, so he will not have to feel anything. Baker as a sister also has a delicate moment - when DeNiro gives her flowers in one scene, it seems that she has never been given flowers before and probably she was not. It's very worth it.
