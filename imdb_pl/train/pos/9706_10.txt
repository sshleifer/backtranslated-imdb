League of Gentlemen is one of the funniest, weirdest, darkest and most unforgettable comedies of our time. So much so that it paved the way for more similar comedies, many of which copied the style, but never succeeded. <br /> <br /> Unlike all other sketches around, the heroes of The League of Gentlemen are all loosely connected. First of all, everyone lives in the fictional city of Royston Vasey, in the depths outside of North England. <br /> <br /> The first heroes who welcome newcomers are Tubbs and Edwrad, owners of a similar pig, apparently a local store that is so far away that most residents probably do not know it exists. Other peculiarities are: the Denton family with an obsession of hygiene, cleanliness and toad; Hillary Briss, who sells a special but fortunately unknown brand of meat; Pauline, the restarting officer with sharp language and even more sharp feathers; Mr. Chinnery, a kind vet and a threat to all four-legged ones; Geoff Tipps, a plastic seller with a fierce sense of humor, often with pistols, electric lamps and. . . . . . PLUM !!!!! <br /> <br /> Despite being a comedy in the heart, The League of Gentlemen often goes beyond genres, never giving the impression of impersonating others. There are several references to horror movies, such as the disappearance of a tourist, a pair of dumb twins, an obsessive circus owner and a sudden outburst of nosebleeds. Even more striking are the moments in which the series takes on a more sober tone, and the mentioned characters, such as Pauline and Geoff, are shown in a more sympathetic, sensitive light. Film adaptation is the best proof of it, but some fans may decide that they belong to local. <br /> <br /> An equally underestimated third series also has a different route, instead of sketches each episode focuses on an individual character with each story leading to one conclusion with a plastic bag and a runaway theater van. Although many fans may not enjoy the structure of the film or the third series as much as the first two, they are certainly signs of how inventive the Gentlemen's League can be and how he is not afraid of discovering new areas. <br /> <br /> In short, The League of Gentlemen is definitely worth seeing, just as welcome signs say: YOU WILL NEVER LOSE!
