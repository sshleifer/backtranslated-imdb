Soapdish can be one of the most underrated films ever made. <br /> <br /> A stellar, disinterested cast who understood exactly where the movie was heading and what roles played in it. While everyone was getting ready for it, there was not a single talent. Kline showed a joke and great physical comedy, Goldberg and Downey knew how to have a funny conversation, when someone else talked, I could just continue. <br /> <br /> Do not upload this video!
