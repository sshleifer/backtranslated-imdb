How can you say that Peaches, with its complex narrative, dealing with many problems, is a "little TV idea" is beyond me. Besides, I can think about many movies that have a "little TV idea" on their story lines. Your obvious aversion to the television industry ("Sue Smith did not cross the television level") is misleading. especially because you have so much fun while working on television. If we were all so talented as Mrs. Smith (no, I'm not a friend or a relative) - awarded AFI Brides of Christ, Road from Coorain, etc. Everything made for television. Think about it, and what about other "small TV ideas" such as "Against the wind", "Bodyline", "Release", "Scale of justice", "Blue murder", "Water under the bridge", etc. I think Peaches is a good entertainment film that interested me and most of my friends from beginning to end. This is far from faultless, but I think it is one of the best Australian films I've seen in the last few years. Who knows, with a few more scenes (there is so much to think about), can just be there with classics such as "The Year My Voice Broke", "The Devil's Playground". I really liked this movie more than "Somersault" and "Three Dollars". I think that these films had their moments - surrealistic, atmospheric, realistic and dealing with important contemporary problems, but when it comes to pure entertainment for you and the average movie viewer and me, it was very ordinary, if not boring. When I go to a movie, I am always aware of the audience's response to the film (through cinema reactions and overheard conversations in the foyer and loo). Some of them sounded like peaches, heads, others with negative criticism, but many seemed to enjoy this experience.
