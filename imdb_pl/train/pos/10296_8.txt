Pretty funny vehicle Jim Carrey, who has it as a news reporter who temporarily gets the power of God and destroys havoc. Carrey is coming back to familiar territory and it looks like he is having fun, and Jennifer Aniston, as his friend, is also charming and has an influence on her. The story is predictable until the end, but the cast (including Morgan Freeman as "God") is great and makes the film worth the attraction. GRADE: B
