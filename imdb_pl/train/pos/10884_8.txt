for a shorter film, this movie is actually better than a lot in this genre. it is a predictable place of work with notes that kill, people die, yada yada yada.However, in this movie there are some good positives. I really liked the mask that I owe to the nut. It is definitely terrifying, at least the least exceptional (although I have not seen every slasher movie), the genesis of bad things is something that I have not seen before, and he finally meets with its end, is an innovative concept, as far as I know. I also really liked the weapon you selected for the majority of murders. The murders themselves are not as graphical as most of the genre, but this little problem. the film is not taken seriously, which is something most slashers suffer. enough, while watching the movie, I remembered the early "Friday of the thirteenth film, which itself is serious. There are several concerns about this film. Several scenes, the killer suddenly wears as a resemblance to one of our horror icons. I mean his movements and reactions after shooting, as well as the way he went with greater worries, but this is a scene very close to the end, where the madman wears more than a striking similarity (in fact a complete rupture) of another famous titanic horror. In the last scenes, we have our scumbag again, looking just like the first horror icon that I mentioned. The fact that the last scene is almost complete extortion from another icon in the slass genre. these scenes were weak and unoriginal (of course). In this way, the film is set in Australia, so if you're a sucker for a chick with an Australian accent (like me), you'll be in heaven. it can be grateful to you. Another great thing about this movie: beauty Kylie Minogoue (just do not get attached to her) is one non-Australian accent, courtesy of Molly Ringwald.overall, there are more reasons to watch than you do. I liked it and I had some fun. So I must admit "Cut" 8/10, which may seem too high for some people.
