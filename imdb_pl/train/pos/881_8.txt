"Read My Lips" is about a strange symbiosis that develops between a simple, socially maladapted office worker (Devos) and her apprentice, a primitive exon (Casel). As the film develops this unlikely duo, up to the identifiers, they become entangled in a chilling combination of minds, each of which uses the other for selfish reasons with extraordinary results. Good things for everyone in movies based on characters with strong psychodramatic trends. In French with easy to read subtitles and good translation. (B +)
