In "Brave New Girl", Holly comes from a small town in Texas, sings "The Yellow Rose of Texas" during a local competition and is admitted to the prestigious art academy in Philadelphia. From now on, the film turns into a colorful story of friendship and loyalty. I loved this movie. He was full of great singing and acting and characters who kept him at a very good pace. Acting was, of course, great. Virginia Madsen and Lindsey Haun were excellent, as was Nick Roth. The camera work was really good and I was very happy with the end (it seems that the continuation can be continued). Recognition for the director and all others who participated in this production. Quite a jewel in film archives.
