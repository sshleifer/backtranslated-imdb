And I gave him high 7 ..... <br /> <br /> Why? Because it's damned well swayed. At a time when there were so many other concerts that were related to toys / games, this show was unique because it had overlapping stories. As others have said, it was ahead of its time. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for this reason the concert was doomed. So far they have released 4 DVDs with 16 episodes of the series. I hope more will come out. <br /> <br /> How it compares with watching now 20 years after it first came to light ... I do not know if I still like it despite the sometimes clumsy animation and that IMHO is just a flaw. Writing was almost at the highest level and ahead of the competition ........ <br /> <br /> I hope for more DVDs or even a set of all episodes in the right order ... DVDs are good, but I do not think that the stories were in the right order, but still the show shook.
