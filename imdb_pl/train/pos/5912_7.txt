Dane Youssef <br /> <br /> "Coonskin" is a film, according to one and only Ralph Bakshi, allegedly a satirical act of accusation of blaxploitation movies and negative black stereotypes, as well as a look at black life in modern America (modern for this day, I mean - 1975). Paramount dropped it like a hot potato that just burst into flame. <br /> <br /> But this is a Bakshi movie, controversial, thrilling and must necessarily see from the very definition. Not just another random "shock" of the movie that tries to shake because of the shock. This is Ralph Bakshi. Anyone who knows this name knows that if he made a movie, he has something to say ... <br /> <br /> Although his roots are based on cheaper blaxploitation, "Coonskin" is not just another campus off the mainstream white film or any one-time throw. "Coonskin" wants to be more. It is aimed at the fact that the target is higher and fry much larger fish. <br /> <br /> The film not only ridicules this genre. Not only do they not accuse Black people, but they seem to show love, beauty and heart in the strangest places. <br /> <br /> "Coonskin" tells the story of some prisoners awaiting imprisonment. The fact that it is even possible to break out of prison in the world of "Coonskin" makes it old-fashioned. <br /> <br /> One of the prisoners tells the story of three brothers from Harlem named Brother Bear, Brother Rabbit, Preacher Fox, who want respect and a piece of action and are ready to get him with all necessary means. Itallian mafia operates the whole real action. <br /> <br /> A star of great black musicians: Barry White and Scatman Crothers, as well as Charles Gordone, the first black playwright who took the Pulitzer home. Something big is happening here, of course. <br /> <br /> The movie takes place like a descent into this world, this side of racial division. From a furious, fashionable, deep, spiritual black man with hatred in his heart and a gun in his hand. <br /> <br /> Bakshi movies never know the meaning of the word 'sublets'. This one looks like he never even heard about this word. But maybe such a topic requires extremism. A real satire with a blacksmith's hammer. Some items can not be dealt with gently. <br /> <br /> Bakshi is merciless. Here, no member or minority from the Harlem scene seems unscathed. <br /> <br /> Characters here are "animated" to "real", depending on your mood and situation. Animated characters and people have the same reality and are to be treated literally. <br /> <br /> Bakshi never shows ugly caricatures just for the value of shock. He always has something to say. There is also a black face. Here, in contrast to Spike Lee's Bamboozled, it seems that he is trying to really tell him. <br /> <br /> Like 99.9% of all Bakshi movies, this includes animation and live action. Usually at the same time. Bakshki is not just artificial here. All this technique is intertwined, intertwining with each other, saying something. <br /> <br /> Somehow I feel inevitable. Many of these types of films (including Bakshi) are very timely, very sharp moments. They reflect a certain trend on this day, but looking back on these years, an infallible feeling of nostalgia (and also a timeless truth) appears. <br /> <br /> Even if music, clothes, slang and the city looks like photos that belong to the time capsule, the attitude, spirit and heart remain the same no matter what it is. Anyone who really saw movies, the state of affairs and was in the company of people knows what I'm talking about. <br /> <br /> Even some of the black characters are rabbits (junglebunny), big bear and fox. One of the most sour and distasteful racist characters is a dirty Harlem policeman who is hot on the trail of those "dirty n-days" after the cop's death. But it's not just business for him. This does not apply to other brothers who wear a shield. It's just pure sadistic racist pleasure to hurt blacks. <br /> <br /> The sequence with Godfather and his lady is one of the most moving songs in the whole movie, which are many. It performs like an opera or ballet. <br /> <br /> Promotional line: WARNING: "This movie offends everyone!" It's not just a hype. Proceed with extreme caution. <br /> <br /> You have been warned ... <br /> <br /> by Dane Youssef
