I would highly recommend !! <br /> <br /> A well-written, funny movie that will appeal to everyone with a sense of humor !!! Give yourself a break, it's good to see an independent British film more than to stick to your own against a big, well-known study !! It's definitely worth adding to each film collection. In this movie there are scenes with which I am sure that many people will be able to relate. You will laugh out loud with antics and enjoy a great soundtrack. I particularly liked the version of Jimmy Cliff from Vietnam Orb's and The Tower of London on Freebird. <br /> <br /> Go, give it a rest ............ you will not be disappointed.
