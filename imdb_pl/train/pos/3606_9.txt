I really liked Girl Fight. It's something that I could see many times. Acting was Fantastic and I thought Michelle Rodriguez did a good job in the movie. I can say very convincing. The film shows how women should defend what they want to do in life. She had so much compassion and so much hatred. Dealing with an unconscious father did not help her much. Although he loved her, he was really hateful. Her mother died when she was younger, and it also brought some sadness in this role. The love story was also a part that I really liked in the film. I felt the passion that you had for yourself. Then the drama starts again, and then that he chooses between his boyfriend and a long dream. I thought it was over. It was a kind of ending where you have to decide what will happen to them in the future.
