"The No Show" is good. Probably not on the same level as "Aqua Teen Hunger" or "Space Ghost Coast to Coast", but it certainly has many great moments. and go to school, living in the 50's style neighborhood. The humor and animation of this series is very similar to "Aqua Teen Hunger" (in one episode you could see Meatwada) with bizarre situations and strange characters. But it's good, it has fun parts. Some songs are great, others are not, but I like this program. The funniest character is the father of Brak. (this is a man, no one knows why)
