Every day we can watch many films, soaps ... on TV. Sometimes a miracle happens. A great movie, with real feelings, with great actors, with a great director-director. For me there are two movies that everyone has to see: the first is Pacula? "Sophie's Choice" from Meryl Streep. The second is "Journey of Hope". As human beings, we must learn humility, love of others, acceptance of another civilization, another way of life. We must also fight against racism and fascism. We must avoid judging or criticizing; we just have to love our companion of the earth. This wonderful film helps us reach John (Lennon) his dream: Imagine that all people live in peace. These two films are difficult to see: watch them, but make sure you get hurt, but better. A great movie, great actors, a terrible story, a guarantee of pain and crying, but also a better understanding of others. Enjoy it.
