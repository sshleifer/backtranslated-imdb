I found that The FBI Story is very funny and optimistic about watching the holidays in the New Year. His drama and action-packed episodes were exciting. Hardesty's figure was well drawn and admirable. In general, photography, script and direction were perfectly reliable. Instead of treating the movie as a repulsive propaganda, as some may have, I liked it as a well-grounded picture of the need for ingenious minds and brave bodies in the fight against crime. Again, the image of the family holding together, even under the influence of my husband's involvement in his (probably) important work, I did not consider as a twee representation, but perfect and exemplary.
