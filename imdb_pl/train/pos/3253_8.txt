Not a film that should be taken seriously, but nevertheless a great little movie. <br /> <br /> Certainly it is NOT just a piece of fluff. Acting, IMO, is great. <br /> <br /> One of those movies you do not want to see, but it brings a smile every time it appears on the cable. Like an old friend. <br /> <br /> It's definitely worth seeing if you have a chance. <br /> <br /> - - - - - - - -
