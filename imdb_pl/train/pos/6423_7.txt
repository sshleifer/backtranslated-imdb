This movie is an amazing, incessant laugh, containing all the usual ingredients of Dawid Dhawan's comedy - clumsy heroes, puffy supporting heroes, invented dolls for heroines, nasty villains, wisecracks, rock soundtrack + choreography and low dose of action. <br /> <br /> Amitabh Bachchan and Govinda are in the dual role of policemen and konmen. The heroine of the Amitabha policeman is Ramya Krishnan, and Raveena is a Govinda policeman. Heroins are mere props, as usual. The guards do not have heroines. Paresh Rawal carries his sinister game at DAUD (he played similar Don also in KHOOBSURAT). Asrani shines with a short role. Do a replay of his famous "Angrezon ke zamailane Jailer" in SHOLAY. <br /> <br /> Govinda is immaculate as usual - as a wise, kind Pyaare Mohan policeman and as master of ceremonies Chhote Miyaan. He imitates Hindi style speaking in Bihari with fun results. Amitabh Bachchan, believe it or not, pales in comparison with him. But AB is still alright. Madhuri Dixit makes an episode as her in the song "Makhna." He dances like the wind. <br /> <br /> Viju Shah's music is amazing. Check out "Kisi Disco Mein Jaayen", "Makhna" and the title track. <br /> <br /> Do not look for logic, because it is a comedy, and the script is convenient. Just enjoy yourself.
