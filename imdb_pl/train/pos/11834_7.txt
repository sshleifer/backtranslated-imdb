I love horses and admire animated hand drawings, so I did not expect anything but Dreamworks amazement with the new animated image of Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron. I think you could say that I was a little disappointed. You have a great animation and at the beginning it seems to be an ideal story. A story of absolutely nothing but the nature of a horse. Animals do not sing sweet songs, they do not even talk - that's a big plus. Unfortunately, the film has the obscene narration of Matt Damon; the juicy soundtrack of Bryan Adams; and enough action scenes to compare it with the production of Jerry Bruckheimer. If the creators of the film were simply with simplicity, we would have a masterpiece here. This is not a great movie, but it is a good entertainment for young children. I recommend this film to families because it has its heart in the right place and is the only thing that is now unapproachable for young children. Not bad, but it could have been much better. Very nice visualizations.
