Youth, sexuality and the French countryside - one of the more unique films you will ever see. If you can see this, it's no mean feat, considering how difficult it is to find copies of it (a combination of rarity and censorship). Sometimes it is erotic, sometimes disgusting and sometimes funny. A bit boring in the middle, but all in all you can not call yourself a fan of a bizarre movie until you see it at least once.
