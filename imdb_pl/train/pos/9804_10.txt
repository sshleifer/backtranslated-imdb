"Batman: The Mystery of the Batwoman" is as much fun as the animated movies with Batman. <br /> <br /> Although he is still faithful to the feelings of comics, the animation is performed with a lighter spirit than the animated series. Bruce Wayne looks the same as before, but now he seems a bit less impressive. Dick Grayson Robin was replaced by the less-than-sharp, more youthful Tim Drake Robin. <br /> <br /> Kevin Conroy, as usual, summons Batman's voice better than most actors live. <br /> <br /> Kelly Ripa did a much more decent job than I expected. <br /> <br /> Like the Batman live action movies, the movie lives or dies based on the quality of villains. My favorite of all time, Penguin, is here. His design is more elegant than before, noting the portrait of Burgess Meredith from the 1960s than on Danny DeVito's "Return of Batman". David Ogden Stiers is the perfect choice for Penguin's voice. The penguin is finally portrayed as deviously sophisticated, as he usually appears in comics. The voice of Hector Elizondo creates Bane, which is much more memorable than the "Batman & Robin" version. And finally, Batman has the secret to going to the solution, putting "Detective" back in "Detective Comics" (in the end it means "DC" means). A revolution in the mystery is a charmingly insidious turn. > <br /> The score adds a mysterious atmosphere to the film. It sounds like a mix of the score from "Poirot" and the score from "Mission: Impossible". In summary, it's more entertaining than the average cartoon.
