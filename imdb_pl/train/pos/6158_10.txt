What can I say about such a story? This magical story has followed me since my early childhood, evoking warm memories in my heart. The characters take you to so many bizarre places that you want more of each scene. For example, there were so many different flavors of knowledge on the market. I loved exotic dancers who accompanied steel drums. <br /> <br /> The plot was great. I wanted Landsbury to stop premature babies, and she also stayed with Mr. Brown. find the other half of the spell so that people with less armor can win the war. <br /> <br /> I'm still a kid inside, and this movie speaks to my inner child like no other. This movie is my favorite movie of all time. I hope all children will be able to watch this classic and be swept away and moved to another time.
