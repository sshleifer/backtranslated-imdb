It was the second of the three films Irving Berlin wrote for the Astaire-Rogers series and is by far the largest and is somewhat unusual because two numbers are performed by Harriet Hilliard, and the rest are shared and / or shared between clients. As usual, the story does not have to stop us, although the recording was based on the play Shore Leave, which also served as the basis of Broadway Musical, Hit The Deck. Anyone who saw Shore Leave in the theater could be temporarily confused, because the roles played by Fred and Ginger were created for the purpose of the film, but as always counts the music, song lyrics and hooves, and this is all wrong. This departure from other titles in the series 1) we see how Astaire plays the piano - in real life he was a great pianist and composed a few songs, one of which, "I build to terrible Let-Down, wrote the text of Johnny Mercer and spent a few weeks on the charts - and this is the only one in the series in which he played a soldier, though a former hoofer who enlisted in the navy after being abandoned by the dancing partner Ginger before the beginning of the story. He performs in a little-known, but excellent Berlin issue, Rather Lead A Band, and in the duet "I'm Putting All My Eggs In One Basket", but the final number is prophetic - in 1936 the rumbling of World War II already felt - let's look for music and dance, one of the strongest ballads in the band's history. So what if Randolph Scott is a bit wooden and there is no water in the water without a horse or six guns at hand, and Harriet Hilliard does not set the screen on fire; we came to see Fred and Ginger and the only question is if they deliver. Answer: In spades.
