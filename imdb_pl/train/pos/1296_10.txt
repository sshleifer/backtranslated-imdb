It is an extremely difficult movie to watch, especially since it is directed to the deepest core of our lives. But ultimately it is a very beautiful and deeply moving film. Anyone who thinks this is cynical must say that they must have missed the point of the entire movie. For those who are actually watching the movie, they will see that the way problems are solved is absolutely necessary and the result is ultimately uplifting. Sure, it's very difficult to look at, a difficult subject, and even brutal. However, it is extremely important for society and everyone. It shows the peak of what the world cinema is doing right now (I will not limit this time only to France) and everyone should see it. I will say that it is best to go with a clean head, without being influenced by conflicting views, and simply let the film work for you.
