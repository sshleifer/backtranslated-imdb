This movie is described as a comedy, but it was not a comedy at all. Like every Panahi movie, it was a very realistic drama depicting the common thread of social inequality and hypocrisy. But it was very funny; much lighter than the dark and serious director of The Circle (my favorite Iranian film). The resourcefulness of the girls and the banter between them and the soldiers were completely reliable (as if it were a document) and totally funny. <br /> <br /> Filming of the actual match and consequences was amazing. He added realism, like Australian Kenny, of course a completely different movie. <br /> <br /> The performances of all non-professional actors? soldiers and girls? they were very reliable. It was very moving to see the passion, disappointment and emotions of these girls. Anyone in this country who thinks that Muslim girls in chador are different from their daughters should see this movie? it will be a real opening eye. <br /> <br /> For me, soldiers represented the current paradigm. They started with standard official political responses to all girls' requests. As the film progressed, it became increasingly difficult to maintain this attitude. When everything seems to be part of Tehran, it turns into a crazy feast, everyone is caught up in it, and the absurdity of current politics is obvious to everyone. <br /> <br /> It was a very moving and unexpected ending and gave the film a really nice blend of emotion, frivolity, drama and social comments. Although it is an adult cinema, I think that children with a mature mind for about seven years will be really grateful for this film (if they can read the subtitles). <br /> <br /> It is remarkable that a repressive country, such as Iran, is able to produce films of such quality as Panahi and Kiarostami. Perhaps the restrictions there force the directors to be extremely resourceful. Australian (and other) filmmakers could take a leaf from their book.
