Actually, I did not start watching the show until it appeared on FX. I was bored and I had nothing to watch and saw that the series was premiered, so I decided to watch it. I was so upset that I did not watch the show when it was first broadcast on t.v. I really enjoyed this show! Finally a show for everyone. I remember Full House and Family Matters and Step by Step and they were all right, but they just were not funny enough. They made stupid jokes and laughed at things that were just stupid, but not the show of the '70s. This 70's performance was fun, intelligent and so real. I think it was the best performance in history and I'm very sorry that it ended. Although I love this program, I think it should end in the seventh season when Eric and Kelso leave. The last season was just not right, the main character was Eric, and the concert should end when his character goes away. I still love this program and I hope that TV will start to do more such programs.
