I was pleasantly surprised when I learned that "How to Lose Friends and Alienated People" was not as "disgusting" as the comedy that the trailer awaited me. I quickly absorbed the development of the narrative and remained absorbed all the time. The pace of more visual humorous content was, I thought, in place. (I mean, I got the impression that I was witnessing Pegg's attempts to restore lost control "in real time"). At other times, it was possible to share the reflection of the main characters (ie Pegg and Dunst) on how the events affected them and what led them to the place where they found themselves. All characters were well manned, to some extent interesting in themselves and generally quite nice. (Every visible ruthless ambition was usually mitigated by an appropriate, natural resistance.) A playful, intelligently written, superbly directed and well-played movie that I highly recommend.
