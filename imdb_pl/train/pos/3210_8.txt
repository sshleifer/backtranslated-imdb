SOLDIER is not as bad as many were. I found this movie, which has a bit of a sacred, cynical humor like that in Starship Troopers by Paul Verhoven. Lack of dialogue and more than the top action is deliberate and adds atmosphere to the comic. <br /> <br /> One particular detail stands out for me - Todd has the names of several tattoos from the space war 'd on his chest, and one of those battles is the TANNHAUSER GATEWAY. For those who are unaware, Tannhauser Gate is listed in the elegiac last lines of Roy Batty in Blade Runner. Imagining that Todd could fight alongside the likes of the likes of Roy, is at least surprising. Maybe the writer David Peoples was nostalgic? <br /> <br /> Dam is 3 out of 5.
