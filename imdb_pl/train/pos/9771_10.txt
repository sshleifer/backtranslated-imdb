Attractive and innovative! At the beginning of this understated fleet of Whoopi Goldberg, the writers draw a parallel between Theodore Rex and the classic Citizen Kane by Orson Welles in 1941. Writers are right to draw such a seemingly diverging parallel, but the viewer is too stunned to see an exaggeratedly-known Hollywood schlock that appreciates the subtle similarities between the two films. In "Citizen Kane", Charles Foster Kane fears and admires his colleagues and subordinates, as does Whoopi Goldberg in this film. This film is about finding love in everyone's differences. It is an epic study of the fear of abandonment and the need for love and acceptance in a society dominated by greed and self-absorption. Whoever was parried by Whoopi Goldberg and Theodore Rex, he formulated dyads for ages, and the only legitimate comparisons were Bogey and Bacall, Hepburn and Tracy, and Hall and Oates. If you would like to see the uplifting, celluloid philosophical study of some of the deepest drives of humanity; Bergman-esqe, but not so depressing, Theodore Rex should be watched immediately!
