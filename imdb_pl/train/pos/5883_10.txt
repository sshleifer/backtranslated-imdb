I watched, I was entranced and hypnotized by the vocal and physical game. The roles played by each character were performed with perfection. Words, words, every gesture, sunrise, he said it all. I was enlightened by a different perception of a person who believes in humanity. Who believes in peace and gentle behavior. I was also in disbelief thanks to the victims and human dignity. Power without grace is mad and deprived of feelings. The desire for power at the expense of humanity is so unbelievable. This movie made me scared of people who are no longer in this world. And with sadness I think about them. I like this film for conversations and facial expressions for all this. Let this movie be blessed.
