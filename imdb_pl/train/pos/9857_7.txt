Although I loved the movie, the trailers that circulated on the internet the year before its appearance caused my expectations to be slightly higher. <br /> <br /> I am the owner of a DVD, so do not get me wrong, do not say do not watch it or even buy it! I just still think that the first scene was the best and nothing in the whole movie ever crossed it.
