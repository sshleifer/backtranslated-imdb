Japan has serious problems. Demons attacked Edo, taking over earthly forms and bending them to their godless will. In addition, the rebirth of Ashura, the Queen of demons, is approaching. The only thing facing this serious threat is Demon Wardens, a terrifying group of warriors who can be just as bad as the demons themselves. <br /> <br /> Izumo is a retired Demon Guardian who, five years ago, took up theater instead of Demon Slaying after accidentally killing an innocent child (in a battle that strangely resembles a bar scene from dusk to dawn). One night, by chance, he meets a beautiful and mysterious woman named Tsubaki. Their fates intertwine (literally), and their destiny is to be lovers and enemies. <br /> <br /> If you think it sounds like your typical epic Japanese fantasy / sword game, you would be wrong. In fact, there is nothing typical in Ashura. It is a collection of many different genres. Mentioned just now, as well as comedy, drama and romance. Director Yojiro Takita (Onmyoji) juggles the genre quite seriously (although in some scenes, the comedy seems forced), and the end result is a funny, but really funny movie with popcorn. <br /> <br /> To be sure, there are defects in the movie. Some of the humor seems to be invented and out of place. And acting is not the greatest. But seriously, do you watch Fantasy / Sword / Comedy movies for great acting performances? No, we watch them in action and crazy CG graphics that Ashura has in spades. Not to be mislead, the movie is not the whole action, but it is large enough, with lots of fencing and buckets of green blood to keep the average viewer happy. <br /> <br /> Conclusion; movies have their drawbacks and are not an epic martial art, but they do not try to be and have interesting visuals and a good fight action. The reason the movie worked for me is that it never takes itself too seriously and if the viewer does the same, he will certainly be delighted with this funny and stupid fantasy action with a sword. <br /> <br /> My rating 7 out of 10. Fun movie with popcorn.
