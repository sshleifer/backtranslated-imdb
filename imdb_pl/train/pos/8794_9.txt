"Shaolin Temple" Chang Cheh may well be the hallmark of the Shaw Brothers martial arts film series. This thrilling epic of kung fu can be proud of an amazing cast - a real person who is stable in Shaw. Although the plot is quite standard, and the choreography of the fight is, as usual, excellent, but what Cheh does, makes this film extraordinary and enjoyable. A sense of respect for the history and tradition of the Shaolin Temple is tangible in every frame. Unlike William Keighley's pean on the legendary Fighting 69. In the same movie with the same title, whether I greet John Ford for West Point in "The Long Gray Line", "Shaolin Temple" Cheha is a beautifully made ode in the same style. <br /> The cultural correlation that tempts me is to compare the Shaolin Temple to the Alamo. Watching this movie will give you the same delightful and nostalgic feelings that you experienced many years ago in the history of elementary school, when you learned about the courage and sacrifice of these doomed Alamo heroes. At the end of the film, you can also be tempted to shout: Remember the Shaolin Temple!
