It was the first regular filmed episode of Columbo, but it was still the second, after Steven Spielberg's "Columbo: Murder by Book." It is also one of the better! <br /> <br /> Bernard L. Kowalski was a great creative director! No wonder they later asked him to shoot three more Columbo movies. The film contains several really creative and innovative sequences of shots, and the film as a whole is also clearly made with style, passion and attention to detail. Each shot combines and this is the reason why this movie is better and looks better than any other average for a TV movie. This is definitely one of the better-targeted Columbo movies. <br /> <br /> For several reasons this is the original Columbo entry. Murder is more or less an accident and it was an impulsive act. So, this time the killer has no time to plan the "perfect murder" in advance and to clean up all traces, after which he must get rid of the body. The killer in this film is not only treated as a man who committed a crime, but more as a man who helps Lieutenant Columbo to solve the murder. This makes the character more interesting and layered, and helps in resolving Columbo, because the whole crime seems more interesting because of this. Of course, Columbo begins to suspect him quite early and, as usual, comes to a solution, making himself vulnerable and looks more stupid than he really is, and winning the killer's trust. This is obviously not a spoiler, because in this way each Columbo movie is configured. I liked the story of the film and its progress. <br /> <br /> It also helps the film to have such a great cast. During this film, Peter Falk really made the character Columbo his own character, and his character was already fully developed. Robert Culp is really great as a Brimmer with a short temper. The funny thing is that later he would play again in three different Columbo movies and one episode of "Mrs. Columbo", only in completely different roles. He even played the murderer in several of these films. By the way, he was not the only actor who did it in other later Columbo films. Also, the great Ray Milland appears in this film as the husband of the victim. <br /> <br /> All in all, a great early Columbo movie and one of the better from a long series of movies. <br /> <br /> 9/10
