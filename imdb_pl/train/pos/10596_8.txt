Every time this movie is on the BBC, someone in the Radio Times talks about the satire against the post-war world of rationing and the welfare state. I do not think that's the meaning of the film at all. The film was a parody of spywa (small criminals who ran a blackmarket) and leagues of housewives who campaigned against government restrictions, but were really the front organization of the Torah. <br /> <br /> Yes, of course, the film sends a political / social situation, but in the end people realize that they need all controls to ensure a just society, want to be British, but rather to stir, not strangers. <br /> <br /> But I do not think they will come back to being exactly what they were before.
