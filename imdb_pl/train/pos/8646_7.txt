In 1990, Brad Pitt and Juiliette Lewis played on Too Young To Die TV, where they both played almost the same kind of parts as in California. I have no doubt that this has led to their cast in this big film. <br /> <br /> California finds the aspiring writer David Duchovny and his friend, artistic photographer Michelle Forbes, on rocky relationships because of Duchovny's obsession with writing a book and entering the minds and souls of serial killers. In fact, he has planned the most unusual odyssey, he wants to cross the country and visit the places of several famous serial killers. But he and Forbes are broke. <br /> <br /> Fate intervenes in many ways, more than financially, with the arrival of Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis pairs of strange southern types who agree to divide the cost of gas into this country. trip. It turns out that Pitt himself is a serial killer and decides to do a little research himself, delving into the mind of someone who is fascinated by amorality. <br /> <br /> California is not the type of movie you usually go, but in reality Brad Pitt's acting skills and charisma make it work to a large extent. Pitt is the walking definition of an inbred gothic refugee from Liberation. But better than he is Juliette Lewis, who once again plays these types of low self-esteem, which seems good. Watch her scene with Forbes when she makes her hair, and Lewis describes her sad and pathetic life. Lewis 'dialogue and Forbes' reactions should be shown in acting classes throughout the country. <br /> <br /> For those who like cinema, they are not better than California.
