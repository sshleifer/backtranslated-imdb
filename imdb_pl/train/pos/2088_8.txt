From the top shelf of great classic books comes this masterful story written by Pearl Buck. A book like the movie is called "The Good Earth". He tells the story of Wang Lung (Paul Muni), a simple Chinese farmer who begins his day with a trip to the "Great House", where he took a slave named O-lan (Luise Rainer) and made her his wife. Almost from the beginning, he begins to adapt to his kindness, saving small peach seeds and planting them near his new home. In the following years O-Lan proves its value, constantly sharing the hardships, troubles and changing fate of her husband. Over the past years, they have been bringing up a family and watching their usual home weather both holiday and hunger. Indeed, at the lowest point of their lives, everyone discovers the value of company, loyalty and love. With the changing times, their growing family is helped and threatened by friends and relatives, like their uncle (Walter Connolly), who is a scoundrel and charlatan, but is tolerant tolerant. Wang has his "Old Father" (Charley Grapewin) who will advise and remind him of the delicate and unstable nature of life. Two notable actors who make impressive performances in this movie are Keye Luke, who plays Elder Wang and Phillip Ahn, who plays a nationalist soldier. The film is black and white and beautifully adapted from the novel. I highly recommend it to all recipients. ****
