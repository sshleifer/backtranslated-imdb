This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I feel very moved by the subject the film is going to convey. One sentence that still comes to mind is: "history repeats itself". Life is what is shown in the film: when people are young, they do not seem to understand their parents, their own spouses; people have all the excuses not to share their dearest time with their children until it is too late; people must always work hard to support the whole family, but they can simply neglect the subtle feelings of their partners; people always change their perspectives at different stages of life; people can always be forgiven if their heart is full of love for their beloved; nothing is more important than the blood relationship that people share in this world, and it is never too late to talk to people about what they feel in their hearts to achieve a better understanding among themselves, so that when life would end up one day, people should not regret or regret because they have kept their words and there is always hope - a new life. Actors and actresses are fantastic. They perfectly understood the director's intention. The charm of the film lies in me as the effect of bringing a clever and wonderful fusion of exclamations and tears to the audience.
