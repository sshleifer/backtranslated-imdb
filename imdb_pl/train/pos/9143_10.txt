It seemed that 1984 was more than an Orwellian nightmare to be with George Orwell's science fiction novel !! 1984 turned out to be one of the happiest times in American history !! The growth of the economy and the reappearance of basic American values ​​have cultivated the idealistic aura of the resumption of innocence that Americans perceived with a very favorable disposition !! There have been many versions of classic films in the past, but the originals are almost always considered better! "Purple Rain" is a movie in this category !! Made in 1984, "Purple Rain" provided the eighties poodle, good quality music, which they included to create this great movie !! Some artifacts pointing to the 1980s are actually classics !! Screwball comedies, neon accented clothes and of course music !! The music of the eighties is considered by experts as the best decade of music in American history !! Located in Minneapolis, "Purple Rain" has adapted to the use of naive entertainment in the changing times of the city. When I was a small child, I lived in Minneapolis for about eight months, then the non-white population was below 3% !! In 1984, African-Americans did some on the roads to Minneapolis, and thus created their own, strongly embedded culture !! The film "Purple Rain" recalls clothes in the style of the eighties and a band that easily captivated the film audience !! I loved the music for "Purple Rain" and the innovative approach that this film takes to confront success, is really brilliant !! See this movie if you have not seen it yet !! Prince became an icon of the eighties with this masterpiece !! He met Kim Bassinger for a short time, he must do something right !! "Purple Rain" placed the prince on the map !! This movie has my definite verdict THUMBS UP !!!!
