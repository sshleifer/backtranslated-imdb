I really do not like Shrek's films. (Since both "PG" and have words in them, I would never say anything, so I did not like them.) <br /> <br /> But when it comes to "Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron", which is barely seen for the first time the first month last month I became a fan of animated films other than Pixar. *** Forward Spoilers *** In "Spirit: Stallion of Cimarron" a horse foal is born, which ultimately becomes the leader of his listener. One night he sees a strange light in the distance and moves towards it. This action ultimately leads to his capture and a few other things. Throughout the film, we hear the narrative. It is through the mind of the Spirit, though the horses never speak. This is what makes the movie goo. They (filmmakers) recited real horses to make sounds that horses made; none of these sounds was created by people. <br /> <br /> The ghost meets Rain, a beautiful mare and Little Creek, a native American who owns Rain. Little Creek later releases Spirit and Rain, running home. <br /> <br /> I've never been a big fan of Brian Adams, but I'm going to buy a soundtrack for this movie in the near future. <br /> <br /> Watch this video and you will not regret it. My result: 10/10
