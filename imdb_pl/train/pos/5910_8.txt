OK, OK, do not bend the round. I joked. <br /> <br /> "Bustin 'Out" is actually a better and more real title. <br /> <br /> Racist and criminal dramas gain a satirical feast from our X-rated friend animator, Boy Ralphie. And he's doing one of his better jobs here. <br /> <br /> On the front of the crime shows the truth. They build it, defend it, and then boredom and stronger rivals make it (maybe) lose it. Find out what's going on. <br /> <br /> Rasista? I do not know. Because Scatman (RIP) and walrus love (also RIP) are black and the main point of view, I saw it as an attack on racism. The fact that Richard Pryor liked it, says the same. And the younger (formerly "Miami Vice") Phil Mike Thomas was a nice surprise there. <br /> <br /> This is an animated movie "Blacksploitation". It's a good thing. Well done and well done. This will cause some people to start twisting (like a lynching scene), but unfortunately this is based on facts. <br /> <br /> But Ralphie REALLY should rethink this title.
