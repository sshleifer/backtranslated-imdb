This is the best mafia movie ever made. He deserved more than what he got at the Oscars. Nominated for such things as scoring, direction, supporting role (Newman), this movie could easily be nominated for the best movie, director (Mendes), actor (Hanks), supporting actor (Newman and Law) and won !! Hanks gives one of his best performances, and the kid who played Michel Jr. he was so good that I'm surprised that I can not see him today in other movies. The critics themselves did not give the film enough points. But in addition to amazing performances, another real star of this movie is incredible music. This was by far the best result of the year. He was nominated, but he did not win. It's a great movie that everyone should see. My degree-A +
