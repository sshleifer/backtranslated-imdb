INCLUDES THE SPOILER With the exception of John Wayne, no other actor was taller in the saddle in the western than James Stewart, and this movie confirms it. This magnificent revenge story around the Winchester rifle has only one weak spot I can come up with: throwing Geiger as the very out of focus Wyatt Earp. The cast of villains was good: Stephen McNally, surly Dutch Henry, Dan Duryea as Waco Johnny Dean, and John McIntire (versatile in playing both good and bad guys) as a shapely runner. The showdown between Stewart and McNally on the cliffs is great! I would put this western against all the west that I did today. They would not have a chance!
