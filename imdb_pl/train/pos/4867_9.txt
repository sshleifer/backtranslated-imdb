Ignore the plot and enjoy Fred Astaire doing A Foggy Day and some other dances, one duet with the unfortunate Joan Fontaine. Here we see that Astaire does what is essentially a "stage dance" in a purer form than in his films with Ginger Rogers, and before he learned how to fully use the potential of the film. Best of all: the fact that we see Burns and Allen before the comedy career of a husband and a radio and television wife, doing a dance they had to do in vaudeville and did not have a chance to do in their college movies from the 1930s. (George was once a tap dance instructor). Their two numbers with Fred are the most important points of the film and worth waiting for. The first soft trio for shoes is a warm-up for the thrilling carnival number "Chin up", in which all three sing and dance through rides and other attractions. It seems almost spontaneous. Fans of Fred Astaire, Burns and Allen deem it worth taking part in the "storyline". I've seen it 4 or 5 times and think that the fast scroll button is helpful.
