If you've ever seen the trailer of the movie "Recruit" with Colin Farrell and Al Pacino, you'll never have to watch this movie. Unfortunately, the Renaissance has similarly amazing teaser writers. <br /> <br /> The history of the Renaissance concerns a detective investigating the kidnapping of a young woman and a medical researcher. The place is futuristic Paris, and the elements of science fiction throughout the text. A special feature of Renaissance, however, is its visual style, not its history. Renaissance is a 3D computer animation, like Final Fantasy, but highly stylized black and white with ultra-sharp contrasts. The result looks stunning (although the problems with 3D animation of human beings are still noticeable from time to time: slightly robotic movements, slightly wooden facial acting, etc.) As a stylized, beautiful film noir, the Renaissance manages to dazzle the audience, especially visually. However, history and writing are not at the same level of quality as visualizations. This is not a bad story (and presumably, if you have not seen the trailer, it's much more exciting than for me). But this is a story that is not very original and borders on banality. A few lines of dialogue were painfully banal, which made the writing sound like the first beginner's efforts. <br /> <br /> I will definitely recommend Renaissance to my friends. It does not resemble anything I've seen before, visually and I think that its originality makes it a valuable experience. It's also a story to look at, even if it's not perfect.
