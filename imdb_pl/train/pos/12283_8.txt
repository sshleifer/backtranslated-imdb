The photograph of this production with a low price is surprisingly bad. The colors are muddy and brownish, and the photography has a very 80-year-old appearance. Directing and editing are often quite boring, just like a TV movie. * I * At the beginning the film seems to want to torture its viewers with images of sex and violence. The score of Hans Zimmer is also a typical and bland work of this overrated, not talented composer. <br /> <br /> But if you want to watch the movie on, you'll get a very moving family story version of Edna Ferber Giant's family epic. While at first you wonder why Clara married this idiotic man, even his character gains deeper and deeper origins. Clara presents the spiritual lesson of the film, a wonderful and moving statement against the terrible events in her country. Her daughter, whose lover is young Antonio Banderas at the beginning of her international career, understands this lesson and ultimately tries to live it. The way the plot was constructed with the final reflection of the beginning was great. All actors do a great job. I was wondering, "Who is Blanca actress?" All the time, but of course he was really young Winona Ryder! <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie really made me want to read a book.
