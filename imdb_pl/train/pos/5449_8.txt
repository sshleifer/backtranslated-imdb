Did you know that Anthony Kiedis (singer of Red Hot Chili Peppers) is in this movie. Blackie Dammit, he's Anthony's father. I noticed this after reading Anthony's autobiography "Scar Tissue" and saw a picture of his father. I thought, "Well, this guy looks like this guy from this movie I saw in the eighties. Then I read more and said that his father was an actor who had several small roles. After checking this site and comparing it to searching on the net, I realized that it really was his father in the movie. It's funny, because nowhere in the book is it mentioned in this film. I think his father, Blackie, did a great job on the show.
