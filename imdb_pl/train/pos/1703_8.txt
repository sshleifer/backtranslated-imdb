Being alone from a small town in Illinois, I can immediately refer to this movie. Considering the era in which it originated, the townspeople look unpleasantly like many people with whom I grew up. Yes, the plot is so-so. And yes, the Actor will not receive an Oscar nomination in the near future. But that is not the point. It's about suspending reality and just FUN. And this movie has a lot of fun. From a greedy, uncontrollable banker to a well-thinking but dark deputy, this movie was created to make fun of the SciFi genre and the small city living in its best style. Who can not smile at the sight of Drone of Enforcer or Vern Droid? and I liked FarmZoid. I would like to have one when I was growing up. In general, given the technology they had at the time, it is a fun childhood experience when you could sit on a Saturday afternoon, take Popcorn and laugh at the weakness of living in a small town. This is a movie that I have watched again and again, if not for any other reason than just joking about myself and my small towns.
