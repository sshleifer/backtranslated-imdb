It is really the largest Swedish film of all time. It is not only revolutionary in its narrative, but also as one of the first films to feature the next generation of Swedish humor and Swedish comedians. Felix Herngren and Fredrik Lindström are the two most intelligent and witty filmmakers in Sweden, and this film really does show it at the exhibition. <br /> <br /> "Vuxna människor" (Adult People) is a warm and fun story about adulthood and the question of whether it would not be better without him.
