<br /> <br /> This movie is definitely one of my favorites. I saw it in college at the beginning of the 90s and although I could not identify with thirty performances in the film, I felt that history, characters and the film in general were at the highest level. For people who talk negatively about Indian Summer, feel free to stick to your exaggerated Armageddon movies and leave movies with a great, healthy story to those who can appreciate them.
