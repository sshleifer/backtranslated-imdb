It seems that the reviews of British newspapers have focused on the fact that the reviewers know Toby Young, a journalist whose real life is based on this film. The key word is "based" here. How To Lose Friends is a fictional romcom. <br /> <br /> Sidney Young joins the prestigious gossip magazine in New York, where he continues to create gaffe after gaffe, before finally Getting It Right and Making It. It is connected with its sale, and the film has some serious points about journalistic honesty. However, they are not exaggerated: the main substance remains the comedy that focuses on Sidney's erroneous adventures. The script has its own cake and eats that Sidney is a stupid, well-meaning buffoon, yet a wise, moderately intolerable qualified writer. This contradiction is never a big problem, because Simon Pegg (as Sidney) designs sympathy too well. <br /> <br /> Jeff Bridges snaps the editor of Sidney a little too effectively, and Kirsten Dunst is rather anonymous, because the conflict eventual object of Sidney's feelings And when it comes to Megan Fox (who plays a star bimbo star), I can only say: just say a word, Miss Fox, and I will leave my wife, sell all my stuff, and buy myself a plane ticket to take my place as my spouse. Of course, given that I'm a fat 56-year-old English accountant, my offer may not be too tempting, but it's still on the table. Considering how short her career has been so far, one would think that Megan Fox is too early to take on a role that mercilessly pissies, like an actress she could have imagined: however, she does it sweetly, with some skills and extremely sexy . This girl will go far. <br /> <br /> There is a strong support from many experienced performers - Miriam Margolyes and Bill Paterson from Great Britain, Gillian Anderson and Danny Huston from the USA. <br /> <br /> There are several moments of laughter and loudness, and I smiled most of the way. As always, the word F makes an impression when it really does not have to, although at least some of them are very funny.
