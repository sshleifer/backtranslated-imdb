My wife is a teacher and she knows the story very well after reading it in a few of her classes. However, it never sounded so interesting to me and I bought a DVD, thinking it would be a movie that would not really be in my aisle. <br /> <br /> The first half of the movie has a lot of things and I thought I was right. It starts a bit slow and I have to admit that I was a little bored - but curious enough that I could stay with him. Boy, I'm glad I did it because it ended with a very satisfying and satisfying movie. I would definitely look at it again! <br /> <br /> the casting was very good. Since I have not read the book, I can not vouch for accuracy, but I must say that Jon Voight was really delightful. You liked the characters you liked to like, hated those you were supposed to hate, and laughed at those that were supposed to be funny. <br /> <br /> I can see how some people may not like this movie. Sometimes it is boring, especially at the beginning. All memories can be distracting (although they are necessary in history). But when the story begins to end, I think you will get a refund for your patience. When everything was said and done, I think it's a very good movie - 8/10. <br /> <br />
