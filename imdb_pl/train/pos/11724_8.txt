Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) is the host of a cheap horror movie. After she learns that her dead aunt has left her some things, elvira goes to England to pick her up, hoping it will be some money. But to her horror, Elvira learns that her aunt has only her home, dog and cookbook. Elvira decides to settle at home, but with her striking dark looks and stunning features, she will not be able to live in peace. All the neighbors are turning the whole city against him now, and Elvira's scandalous attitude and appearance make everyone watch out because Elvira is on fire! I really liked this movie, it's really nice to watch Elvira in all these adventures, it's just great. The whole movie introduces you to the Halloween mood, it is certainly stupid, and the jokes are cheap, but it is nice to watch them. I would give Elvirie, Mistress Of The Dark 8/10
