The Kells Secret is an independent animated feature that gives us one of the legendary stories surrounding the Book of Kells, an illuminated medieval manuscript containing four New Testament Gospels. I did not know that this book really exists, but knowing it now, my interpretation and analysis are much easier. There are several stories and ideas that tell about how the book was made, who wrote it and how it survived over 1000 years. This is one of them. <br /> <br /> We introduce ourselves to Brendan, an orphan who lives in Abbey of Kells in Ireland with his uncle, Abbot Cellach (spoken by Brendan Gleeson). Abbot Cellach builds a massive wall around the abbey to protect the residents and monks. Brendan does not like the wall, like other monks. They are more focused on reading and writing, which Abbot Cellach no longer has. He fears the "North", those who loot and leave the cities and villages empty and burned to the ground. <br /> <br /> One day a traveler comes from the island of Iona near Scotland. This is Brother Aidan, a very wise man who carries a special book with him that is not finished yet. Abbot Cellach grants him permission to stay, and Brendan is with him. Aidan has special plans for Brendan. First, it needs ink for the book, but it requires specific berries. The only way to get them is to go beyond the walls and into the forest, an area outside of Brendan. Seeing that he is the only chance for Aidan to continue working, he decides to sneak out and come back with the berries before his uncle notices his absence. <br /> <br /> In the woods, Brendan meets Ashley, the forest keeper. He lets Brendan go to the berries and becomes similar to his company on the way. He warns him of the impending danger in the dark and does not frustrate him. There are things worse than the Vikings. From there, Brendan meets with further challenges related to the book and the upcoming invasion. <br /> <br /> Now I like this story much more. Knowing now what the Book of Kells is and what it contains, animation makes sense. I am sure that you have seen photos or copies of old texts from hundreds of years ago, with pleated edges, colorful pictures and extravagant patterns, creatures and letters embellishing the pages. Like the opening Disney frames The Sword in the Stone. The animation contains many similar patterns and patterns. It creates a unique visual experience in which history and animation almost surpass each other. <br /> <br /> I could not take my eyes off amazing details. These are some of the best 2D animations I've seen for years. It is alive, stimulating and full of life. Characters are constantly surrounded by patterns, doodles and patterns on trees, on the walls and in the air just floating around. Strengthens the movie. <br /> <br /> The story is satisfactory, although I think the ending could have been slightly more spread out. In just 75 minutes, I think that the last act could have been something special. It does not give much information or refers to the meaning of the book. We are reminded of how important this is, but we never fully understand. We are told that it gives hope, but never why and how. It was really the only missing piece of the movie. Otherwise, I thought that this story is interesting, though completely exceeded by animation. <br /> <br /> I guess it's okay to some extent. Animation can carry a movie so far before it goes down. This story lacks several parts, but it is an interesting look at the fascinating story. I would recommend briefly reviewing the Book of Kells to find out what I am talking about. I think it will make watching much easier. This is a very impressive and beautifully illustrated movie, which definitely can not be missed.
