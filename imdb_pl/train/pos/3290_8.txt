Anna (Charlotte Burke), who is just before puberty, begins to have strange dreams that start to feel her in real life - especially with the boy named Mark (Elliott Spiers), whom he meets in his dreams. <br /> <br /> A very unusual fantasy with really terrifying moments. Despite the fact that this applies to teenagers and has the rating PG-13, this is NOT for children. Also, if you hate fantasy, stay away. But if you play for something else, it matches the bill. <br /> <br /> Well directed by Bernard Rose with a beautiful musical recipe and some pretty, terrifying shakes. The only thing that prevents it from being a great movie is Burke - she is not a very good actress (no wonder it was her only movie) and the film hurts. However, everyone else is just great. <br /> <br /> Needles are very good as Mark; Glenne Headley (very good British pretend) is also very good, because Anna's mother and Ben Cross are terrifying and nice like Anna's father. <br /> <br /> A dormant dream, when it was released in 1988, has disappeared since then. It is a pity - it is really very good.
