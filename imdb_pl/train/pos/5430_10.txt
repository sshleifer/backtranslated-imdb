Of all British imperialist films, such as Four Feathers, Charge of the Light Brigade, this film stands out as a crop cream. It reflects the time when "the sun never happened in the British Empire." Stop. I will not wonder why so many others have expressed many reasons why this film is great. I visited the Alabama Hills and photographed the pass through which the British marched, and it remains as it was, unchanged by time and entering the human and vandals. And although I know it's coming, seeing Din lying dead on a stretcher and reading these lines <br /> <br /> "Yes, Din! Din! Din! <br /> <br /> You Lazarushian-leather Gung Din! <br /> <br /> Although I rushed and accused you, <br /> <br /> By the living Gawda who made you <br /> <br /> a better man than me, Gunga Din "<br /> <br /> Still, at the age of 54, I look at it vaguely and anyone who says no, is a liar. The range of emotions in it is a sign of a great movie. Like the ending of another great movie Of Mice and Men.
