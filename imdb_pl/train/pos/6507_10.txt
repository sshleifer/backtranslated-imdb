This series, probably produced at the most favorable time after the events of the Second World War, has a scale of values ​​that far exceeds any presumption of criticism by the individual. <br /> <br /> The production time of World at war in 1974, counting about three decades after the events of war, allows you to accurately link events in a colorless way through residual propaganda and inclination. The passing of thirty years allows speech to be supported by an impressive and fascinating group of people involved, from the highest military and political figures to field soldiers, civilians and survivors of death camps. we have remained witnesses of unimaginable inhumanities to which civilized people are capable. Most of the respondents are approaching or approaching their last years, so they have enough time to reflect on their experiences and in most cases have had enough time for any propaganda and fervor that could have influenced them in the past to leave, leaving only memories about what they saw and what they did. <br /> <br /> The information that these survivors give, strikingly enhanced by the attitudes and expressions they display, telling their role, all the more they influence their stories. Names like Ira Eaker, Adolph Galland, Louis Mountbatten, Albert Speer, Gertrude Junge (personal secretary of Hitler) ... the list is too long to be answered. <br /> <br /> Today, during the lives of the survivors of this huge lesson about the hideous price of political ambitions, young people who are chanting the same kind of militaristic and nationalist promotion of war, which led to World War II. The DVD series that we are discussing here should be the core of the compulsory history in schools, so that lessons bought at such terrible costs in those days should not have been wasted, but should be taken to heart by those who have not seen the terrible price first hand. <br /> <br /> I almost finished watching a set of 11 discs, seeing most of the series when the local TV channel airped it over 10 years ago. It did not lose anything of its adversity, it actually became an even more wonderful chronicle of some of the darkest days of human times. <br /> <br /> The highest possible rating seems unworthy of applying to this presentation. I think the value of this series is innumerable.
