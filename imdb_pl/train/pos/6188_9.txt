The investigation of the murder takes place in the back room, while The Vanities, on the opening day, plays on the unconscious audience. A strange combination of musical and murderous mystery is worth looking at her cast, production numbers and the pure novelty of the film. <br /> <br /> Gertrude Michael has the striking role of a bizarre actress who wants to stop the marriage between the show's stars, Kitty Carlisle and Carl Brisson, and the infamous "Sweet Marijuana" (which was also on Bette Midler's album from the 1970s .). While the girls are shuffling behind the scenes, an inept detective Victor McLaglen embraces the girls as he tries to resolve the behind-the-scenes murder of an unknown woman. <br /> <br /> We quickly learn that the maid (Dorothy Stickney) loves Brisson from a distance, that the lady from the wardrobe (Jessie Ralph) is the mother of Brisson, and the stage manager (Jack Oakie) is breaking in on everything. Many threads revolve around music numbers. The most well-known song is "Cocktails for Two". Kitty Carlisle also sings the haunting "Where To They Come From?" And there is a strange rhapsody that erupts in Harlem, a special issue involving Duke Ellington! Pretty cast. <br /> <br /> Some great performances here, especially Gertrude Michael and Dorothy Stickney. Kitty Carlisle is pretty good too. Brisson is a total of zero. <br /> <br /> Charles Middleton plays Homer, Toby Wing plays Nancy, Donald Meek plays the doctor, and also sees if you can meet Ann Sheridan and Lucille Ball among the girls on the show.
