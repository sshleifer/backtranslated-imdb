Karen goes to the Japanese home as a substitute nurse for Emma, ​​a strange woman who sleeps during the day and wakes up at night. Karen goes up after hearing the sounds when he encounters a terrifying ghost. He will learn the secrets of the house. <br /> <br /> It's very scary! The scenes are shocking and frightening! Characters are good. Settings are frightening. I love the entire story! The ending was shocking! I stopped on the stage where the little boy crushed the man so loud that he found his sister upstairs and was shocked. It's the scariest movie I've ever watched. I did not see the Japanese version. I recommend it to horror fans. 10/10 and 5 stars!
