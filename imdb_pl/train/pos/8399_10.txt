Love Trap is not short, it is of course a full-length feature film with a duration of 105 minutes. <br /> <br /> While writing this article I might as well talk about Love Trap. I often ask what makes Love Trap different ... so I answer this question: 1) Introduces characters - especially one - that have never been seen before in the film, period. <br /> <br /> 2) Reveals more truth about love and goes deeper into the very concept of love than any other American film ever, in my humble opinion. <br /> <br /> 3) Structurally, as the story goes on the road, it's not like any love story you've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 4) Offers extremely current insights on various cultural issues, both in the Black community and beyond. <br /> <br /> In time people will come to see Love Trap as much as the original work, as it is possible in this era, delightfully refreshing, authentic and honest. This is a rare game of morality full of food for thought. <br /> <br /> Visit www.lovetrapmovie.com for full and accurate information about this video.
