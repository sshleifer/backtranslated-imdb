For those who like to deal with murder mysteries, it is certainly the one who is full of interesting and suspicious characters, most of whom are rich types of social Long Island. As a stellar detective, William Powell is alternately starchy and inspired, acting as if he and his suit went to the cleaners and were pinched. Mary Astor is very lovely here. <br /> <br /> Powell made his career playing the main character, Philo Vance, in a series of films made in several studios for several years. Between these films, he developed into a somewhat unconventional romantic role, sometimes even in the essayist roles of gangster gentlemen. Already in middle-age he got stuck in a somewhat routine career before it happened. As with many early talkie stars, it seemed that his time had come and passed, that he felt good in the early films of the Prohibition period with depression, but in the changing times he was perhaps too mature and dandied to bear. br /> The case of breeding killing, directed by the neglected by the criminal Michael Curtiz, is one of the last "old Powells", while the next year heralds the first of the new, Thin Man, whose success catapults the leading players in the Hollywood stratosphere. In breeding, we can watch movies in a bit rigid, ritualised pattern, because the camera does not move much, with the acting, like a presentation, heading towards the theater. However, there is nothing wrong with this approach, which has its charms. It gives the film a Baroque quality.
