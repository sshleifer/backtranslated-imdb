I really like this movie. I can watch him regularly and do not bother with it. I suppose it's one of my criteria for a great movie. <br /> <br /> This story is very interesting. He introduces us to 6 characters; everyone has a unique kung fu style that is very secret and very deadly. Each of these characters is trained by the same master, but their identities are kept secret from each other. The dying master sends the sixth venom, his last student, to remedy the wrongs that some of his disciples suspect he has committed. <br /> <br /> How will the last student find other venues? How will he know which one is angry? The way the answers to these questions are part of what makes the movie great. <br /> <br /> We also notice that jady fight each other in every combination. It's nice to see how their styles match. <br /> <br /> If you want to see if you like kung fu movies, it's a good movie to start with. There is nothing better than this.
