I would not dare say that this movie is better than the original, but it is very good in itself. The comedy in this movie is just as good as the original, there are so many scenes that make me laugh only thinking about them. <br /> <br /> The story in this movie is even more bizarre than the original, but it makes it so great. Peter Hewitt does a great job of directing this movie with a great cast. The core from the original movie returns to the character in this movie and everyone performs a fantastic job with their roles. I do not care what someone says, I think Keanu Reeves is a great actor! I really liked his portrait of Ted in both of these films, as in the case of Bill Alex Winter. I was very happy to see that George Carlin is back in the role of Rufus, very good! Hal London Jr., who plays the role of Ted Logan's father, does a really good job. The scene in which Ted has his father's body, and Hal London Jr. begins to play like Ted, is a great scene, and he does it impressively well. I can not forget about William Sadler as Death, he made a movie for me completely. The rest of the cast is also quite good. <br /> <br /> If you liked the first part of the series Bill and Ted, I hope you like this movie too. But do not expect it to be as good as the original. I really hope you enjoy the movie, thanks for reading, <br /> <br /> -Chris
