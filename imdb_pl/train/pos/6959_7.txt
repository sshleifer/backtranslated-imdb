Well, this is Ivan Reitman's movie. with a rare exception, Ivan likes to play. His films are generally not "deep", but they are often fun enough. My Super Ex-Girlfriend surprised me that I was laughing more than I thought. Uma Thurman is simply great and I love her performances. I also like Luke Wilson, and Rainn Wilson was a simple bang. A movie that never takes itself seriously, is on the top, but it is not very special, there is also no place where nobody has ever arrived ... but it is a nice rent and probably a movie with a good date, especially if you have a headache and I do not want to overload the brain. It's escapist and it's okay. When you get rid of the "super-girl", you will have a story about relationships and spoiled relationships. It's the boy who meets the girl, the boy leaves the girl. In the end, the characters look for love. Not everyone thinks of being "abandoned" as well as they could ... a piece of life with a surprise.
