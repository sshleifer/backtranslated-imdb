A great movie directed by some of the best directors in the industry. The film also casts some great actors of our time, not only from France, but from around the world. <br /> <br /> My favorite segments: <br /> <br /> 14. District: Carol (Margo Martindale), from Denver, comes to Paris to learn French, and to feel the meaning of his life. <br /> <br /> Montmartre: there probably was not a better way to start this movie than in this segment of romantic Paris. br /> <br /> Loin du 16ème: a picture of Paris, which we know better about since the unrest in Cités. Ana (Catalina Sandino Moreno) spends more time looking after someone's child (she is a nanny) than on her own. <br /> <br /> Quartet Latin: Gérard Depardieu is so much fun as "tenancier de bar" with Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara discussing their divorce. <br /> <br /> Tour Eiffel: do not tell me you did not like those mimes! <br /> <br /> Tuileries: such a feast for Steve Buscemi as a tourist who makes contact with a girl from Metro. (<br /> <br /> Parc Monceau: Nick Nolte is great. Ludivine Sagnier also. <br /> <br /> I spent 3 days in Paris in 2004 and this movie makes me want to come back! <br /> <br /> I saw in Barcelona (another great city), in Verdi, 18 March 2007. <br /> <br /> 84/100 (***)
