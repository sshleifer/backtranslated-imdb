The "second beginning," as the title explains, shows us the beginning of the end of the human race. This short anime written by the Wachowskis long before the matrix existed, shows us a world that could be ahead of us in the near future, set at the turn of the 21st century, the second renaissance delves into problems common to human behavior; greed, power, control, vanity, etc. <br /> <br /> The use of robots or artificial intelligence as slaves or servants is common among science fiction / fantasy stories. The second renaissance is no exception to this concept, but instead of a simple human-machine layout, this story explains the struggle with which machines struggle, the struggle for acceptance in a world ruled by people. Where matrix films show us a human perspective, these short animations tell stories to both sides. <br /> <br /> The second part of the renaissance 1 + 2, answers many of the questions raised by the original Matrix movie, such as how the war broke out, how the sky got tainted, which led to the use of people as a battery, and also introduces us to the city machines called 01, which may be important for the upcoming Matrix Revolutions movie. <br /> <br /> I will not reveal too much history, because I do not want to spoil the experience of perspective viewers, but I will recommend it to any interested world of the matrix or just anyone interested in Japanese animation (anime). <br /> <br /> 9/10.
