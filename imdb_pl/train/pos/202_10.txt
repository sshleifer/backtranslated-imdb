And give this movie 10/10, because it deserves to be 10/10. Two of the best actors of their time - Walter Matthau and George Burns collaborate with Neil Simon and all other actors who are in the film + director Herbercie Rossie. The Sunshine Boys is one of the best films of the 70s. I love this kind of humor in this movie, it just makes me laugh so much. <br /> <br /> I got this video on VHS 3 days ago (yes, VHS because it was cheaper - only $ 3). I watched him as soon as I got home, but I had to see him again because the first time I missed a few parts. The second time I watched it much better and I was laughing much harder. I definitely intend to repeat it on DVD, because I have to see special functions. <br /> <br /> It's very funny how it happens. Two people work together as artists / actors / performers. They do well on the stage, but they really argue with the stage, they can not survive the next minute with each other, and then some 15 years later, you want to combine them for a special TV program. You can find it in this movie. Matthau & Burns were great in this movie. It is a pity that they died. George Burns deserved this Oscar. He gave a strong comic performance. He was also 78 years old when this movie was filmed. So far, he is the oldest actor who received the Academy Award at an older age. Jessica Tandy breaks the record as the oldest actress. Richard Benjamin was fantastic too. He won the Golden Globe for the best supporting actor. He deserved this Golden Globe. Although many people may disagree with what I intend to say, everyone in this film has shown good results. This comedy is a classic classic. I would highly recommend. One more thing: whoever hates this movie is "Putz"
