There is something special in Austrian films not only of Seidel, but also of Spielmann and other directors. It is a penetrating sense of reality that never leaves the viewer in the whole film. Hundstage is no exception. This effect is achieved not only by the presented stories, but also by actors playing. At Hundstage, I've never had the impression that it's actors, but real people. That is how the viewer's inner feeling is real ... Almost as a grouchy pensioner or a single lady in a movie lives under you in your block. <br /> <br /> Anyone living in Vienna can undoubtedly painfully recognize people in the movie with his patron / sudern (complaining), their hidden sex drives and prolo macho guys. This is further strengthened by the Viennese dialect, which according to many is especially made to complain as a way of life. The special parochialism and arrogance typical of Vienna is very well shown. <br /> <br /> The Vienna suburbs have a lively presence in the film with their dullness and drowsiness, where nothing happens. What's more, they were turned into a feast of materialism with shopping centers and large department stores. Among them are the homes of people who devote themselves to what they consider to be pleasures, trying to stay in touch with their human selves, but in vain. An example is the sexual game of an old woman with men who were bordering on rape, a prolo guy losing his nerves and hitting his girlfriend and a young woman who hitchhocks and hides her drivers. <br /> <br /> The movie has no soundtrack because it focuses only on the normal / abnormal images. Another typical feature of Seidl (and other Austrian directors) is showing disturbing sexual images. They include undressing an old woman for her husband, sexual scenes in a bathtub, a sexual game of a lady with two men in her apartment, etc. <br /> <br /> In Hundstage Seild presented the lives of people who can finally be as Viennese as they can be citizens of Paris, New York or Madrid. Viewers should not despise or sympathize with the Viennese film, because they themselves can be victims of the same human alienation and alienation, albeit in different circumstances. In the end, I think that Seidel's film is a warning to us about the terrible state of interpersonal relations so brutally revealed in Hundstage. And if the viewer does not succumb to the causes of this bad transformation, Seidl has achieved his goal.
