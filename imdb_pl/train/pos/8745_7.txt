After high school, Alice and Darlene's best friends decide to go to Thailand. When they are there, they meet a charming Australian named Nick. After spending some time with Nick, he asks them if they want to take a weekend trip to Hong Kong with them. They agree. However, at the airport, they were arrested for drug trafficking and then sentenced to 33 years in a Thai prison for something they did not think they were doing. Not knowing what to do, they end up contacting Yankee Hank, an American lawyer who lives with his wife in Thailand. The word says that if you have money, it can help you. Things start well, but they still can not leave. <br /> <br /> The movie is really good because it does not allow what's going to happen and it's interesting all the time. However, I could not believe in the ending. It was one of those endings where you do not know 100% of the truth, but you still know what really happened with Nick and drug smuggling because of "possession" etc. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale here pretty good performances. However, Beckinsales' performance was a bit weak. Both Danish and Beckinsales friendship is good, but it may seem stronger. Paul Walker even has a small role here. ;) <br /> <br /> In any case, I thought that Brokedown Palace is a good movie and I give it 7/10.
