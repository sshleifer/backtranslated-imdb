Most of the complaints I've heard about this movie boil down to one thing: it's not Versus. Yes, the cast and crew are basically the same. Yes, Kitamura does a few shots in the fight scenes that appear in the second half of the movie, but it's the end of similarities. The Versus takes place basically outside, showing Kitamura's ability to create an interesting B movie in natural places. For Alive, almost everything happens inside. In small, tight spaces. Here the visual design is stuck in your face, and what is an artistic project? We are treated in a few very complex and interesting spaces, and our characters are mostly limited to these spaces. The key difference is also that we do not take too many actions until the end of the movie. Versus relied on action and coolness, here much more attention is paid to the characters and the situation and the mess in the head. For this reason, Alive is a much more interesting movie than Versus. You may not jump in or go to a random scene to watch five or ten minutes of a zombie's bloodshed, but you'll be stuck to the screen for almost two hours, watching the interaction of some really interesting characters. br /> I am now in ecstasy that I ordered the DVD despite indecision. You should too! Remember, however, that this is another animal from Versus - it is often slow and requires a bit of thought to take full advantage of it. I hope that Media Blasters will decide to release a DVD with R1 subtitles!
