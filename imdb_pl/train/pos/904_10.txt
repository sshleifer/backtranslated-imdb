Suraj Barjatya is the best in films about marriage. And here he is; return to its basics on Vivaah. In this story, it is a story from commitment to marriage. A movie that you can watch with the whole family around you. A movie you hate to watch for yourself. The story is simple, but the music is good, the photos are excellent, the direction is the best, everything in the film has its own class. There are many scenes that will make you cry and I'm sure that watching a movie with your sweetheart, you're both holding each other until the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Shahid & Amrita jodi gave us hit movies earlier like Ishq Vishq and Shikhar. Although Shikhar was a good movie, he was not well received by the audience. Really a Shahid and Amrita movie.
