Naudet's French brothers did something that no one else did, they had a video camera on the day of the tragedy. They were in building number 2, when you could see papers drifting down, people hitting the ground because of a jump from such a height. <br /> <br /> It means that when the two buildings collapsed, they ran, their camera was still working, when the white dust covered them, they found the door to the shop and they went inside, but all this stuff is real and I think that they did a fantastic job, grabbing it for us. <br /> <br /> Ten stars go to the Naudet brothers who filmed this amazing film, which I watch every September 11, so I will never forget what the country has gone through. I believe that if I remember correctly, it shows the first death of a firefighter priest while he was carried to the church and his honorary funeral.
