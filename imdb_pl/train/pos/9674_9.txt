I did not give this film the perfect result to be honest compared to great classics such as Citizen Kane and Seven Samaurai. However, this film is so versatile that it is a real shame that it is so weak to the general voter of the IMDB. However, IMDb voting bends over science, and "Paulie" does not qualify for this. <br /> <br /> The only criticism I can suggest is that Hallie Kate Eisenberg did not represent the ideal stuttering of the child. I'm sorry, but asking a 6-year-old child to go with Dustin Hoffman as Rainman, he asks for the impossible to film. <br /> <br /> Passing this small complaint, the film has the best of many films: buddy of travel, con-games, hero as a friendly animal-party (bird-party?), Disney humor for young and old, etc. What do you dislike? Tony Shaloub has his role as comfortable jeans. It seems to be normal. ("I'm a Russian ... I like long stories.) I do not like mango, but he almost makes me want to go out and buy one. Watch the movie and it will make sense. <br /> <br /> Buddy Hackett and Cheech Marin look very well in the Role movie that matches what we all know about them, I've always thought that Jay Mohr is a little slimy, and his role on the screen is also for that it fits. The only surprise for me was the statement that Jay was also Pauli's voice, in the end it even works well, putting Parrot and anti-Parrot together in a team and creates their own magic. <br /> <br /> If you are trying to find a movie for yourself and children who is neither offensive nor boring, "Paulie" is the perfect candidate, but I must admit that a cheerful moment colors my review "Paulie". he was on a road trip during a great heat wave, the car's air-conditioning died, half of the restaurants had dead cooling (just like our hotel), and I said, "let's watch a movie that works air itioning. "We did it. So for 100 minutes we were cooled down, amused and experienced a warming experience. When I saw him recently on a VCR in less emotional circumstances, I realized how well this movie was made. <br /> <br /> It's a movie about a sleeping person that you will not regret.
