Oliver! the musical is my favorite. Music, characters, history. Everything seems perfect. In this installment of a timeless, classic novel twisted onto the stage, director Carol Reed enlivens the Broadway hit on the screen of the movie. <br /> <br /> Switching from musical musical to film is not easy. You must have the right voices, the right set, the right scenario and the right game. All signs indicate yes to this game. It looks like it was written on the screen! <br /> <br /> Our story takes place in a merry old England, where a boy named Oliver manages to leave the orphanage. He travels the country to London, where he meets a group of juvenile offenders, led by Dodger, an intelligent, handy pocket to choose from. The leader of this gang is Fagin, an older colleague who sells all stolen goods. <br /> <br /> But not everything in London is good when Bill Sykes played by Oliver Reed and his loving girlfriend Nancy get entangled with Oliver, Fagin and his young soldiers and the law. What is connected with it is a wonderful story about love, feeling and large numbers of music. <br /> <br /> Regardless of whether you like musicals or not, you listen to these melodies and humming them throughout the day. Oliver! it is a triumph on and off stage and is a timeless work of art.
