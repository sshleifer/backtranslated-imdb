As someone who has lived with a brain palsey for over forty years, I find the film inspiring. If someone with such a serious CP case as Christie Brown can do so much, there is no reason why I can not achieve my own dreams. Daniel Day-Lewis and Brenda Fricker give amazing performances. <br /> <br />
