Ko≈Çczak is pure entertainment. Great stories and a great cast and nothing else to weigh it. Darren McGavin gives an energetic performance that attracts the audience with him. Simon Oakland, Jack Grinnage and Ruth McDevitt give McGavin solid support, which most leading actors can only dream about. Some great stars add colors and spirits to each episode - Erik Estrada in Legacy of Terror, Phil Silvers in Horror in the Heights, Antonio Fargas in The Zombie. It is easy to see how the boys spent watching Kolchak led Chris Carter to create X files. Darren - RIP. Simon - RIP. Ruth - RIP.
