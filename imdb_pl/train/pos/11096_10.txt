Based on Elmore, Leonard is a brutal and intelligent action movie. History: a business man is blackmailed by about 3 criminals. Roy Schieder does a great job as the main character, and a special loan must go to John Glover, who plays a naughty psychopath. I must mention that the characters of villains are very complex and interesting - something very rare in the action movie. it also contains some beautiful and sexy women - Kelly Preston is the most notable young bate for Schieder. Vanity gives a very good performance and appearance, like a prostitute associated with three blackmailers. I'm glad Ann-Margaret still has not lost it - this lady is a real child. Do not look at the pace of this movie. I really do not know what the public and some critics have against this movie, but my suggestion is to ignore them and watch this really engaging and underestimated movie. You will enjoy it, it's a promise. Recommended A +.
