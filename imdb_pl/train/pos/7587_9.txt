I must say that I was impressed that the pictures were amazing, the frames close to perfection, and the way he built the tension around the theme, which sounds more like a frightening bore, is over. two narrators, one seen, one invisible. Both are trying to explain a significant series of images that have long been scandalous. The film is about theories and explanations of views, but the conclusion is quite shocking, I must say. Definitely a movie that deserves more than 171 votes. <br /> <br /> After just 66 minutes of playing the story, the movie still seemed like a complete job. Fantastic direction! I have to say a lot better than the Poet's Blood, which for some strange reason reminds me a little. <br /> <br /> I suppose you can call it the slang word "artsy". It's a lot of professional conversation about different theories and stunning visual effects, but the crew and Ruiz did it. At least for me. Incredible movie.
