This movie intrigued me for a while, partly due to the unusually high IMDb score - the average 9.0 with over 300 votes gives the highest rating for any silent film available! How did I not hear about this movie before this site? You can not always trust ratings. It is really a very good movie that has been quite good, if a well-hired VHS transfer is any indication - great performance of directors, especially William Haines as Brown, and good location in Cambridge with beautiful film materials in the climax Harvard / Yale football game - but history must have seemed a dizzying chestnut even in 1926. A disgusting, self-centered and charismatic guy goes to school and is put in his place, thus becoming a caring, sacrificial friend; I doubt that people in 1926 will discover a lot of really exciting things in the last few reels, the predictability factor is high. Nevertheless, it starts very well and definitely deserves to be remembered if it is not praised heavens. Perhaps the previous 350 voters are mainly men from Harvard ... <br /> <br /> EDIT Now over 600 voters and the result actually increased to 9.2! Seriously, people, there are voting choices here - I am opposed to anyone to explain why this is a better movie than "Metropolis" or "The General"!
