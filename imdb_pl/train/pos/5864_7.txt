I did not like the pretentious and overrated Apocalypse Now. Probably my favorite movie from the Vietnam War is the Deer Hunter. The deer hunter focused on one part of the war and then focused on life before the war. This film is essentially Deer Hunter 2. The scenario is too loose compared to Deer Hunter. History has never developed to such an extent that the public can really understand and feel characters like Deerhunter. Retrospectives in Vietnam are not as engaging or involved as those in the Deerhunter Hunters. That's why I can give this movie only 7 out of 10. <br /> <br /> However, I think the game was great. DeNiro and Harris are really amazing actors. They completely immersed themselves in their characters and expressed the great anguish of two former friends who lost their best friend Bobby in the fight. Harris is a half-dead alcoholic who hides the guilt he has at Bobby, losing his life trying to save his own. <br /> <br /> I also like the cast. Everyone in the city is part of the movie. The city, of course, can not cope with Vietnamese vets very well. Like many small cities, the idea is to be quiet, humble and caring for your business. However, Harris's character can not be any of these things. I wonder how wars affect people. Some people are quickly bouncing, while others never really recover.
