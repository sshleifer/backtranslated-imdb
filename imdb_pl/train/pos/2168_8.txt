I saw this movie on TV late at night, but it was a disturbing experience that has remained with me today. <br /> <br /> The premise may seem a bit unoriginal - due to an earthquake, a hidden underground store of a toxic nervous factor in the hills above a small town is disturbed, and a microscopic amount of substances goes to their food supplies. Residents of the city are beginning to lose their ability to be restrained in relation to every whim and basic desire that flows from all our minds from time to time, and that we normally know that we simply can not act. <br /> <br /> The pace of the film is slow, but for me it just increased anxiety, because the residents' behavior slowly begins to fall apart. There are several surreal and very disturbing scenes that have remained etched in my memory all this time. <br /> <br /> There are interesting questions about what we would all be able to do if we gave in to our wildest instincts. Did I like it? I'm not sure if "enjoy" is the right word. Did it make me? Definitely. I still think about it. A terrible thing.
