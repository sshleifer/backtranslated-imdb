I'm watching this movie all the time. I have to watch it at least once a week. I'm from Africa and by looking at this movie I've taught me certain things that I did not even know about Africa. Denzel's films are full of lessons for people from all walks of life. I would like him to be my own brother. I also saw and love your Masala Mississippi. What an exciting situation. When Denzel tried to get his brother to work, he reminded me of my teenage ages when my brother was always mad at me and I was busy all the time. My brother always cared for my old father and wants to see me the same way. By the way, where did Denzel get this African accent in Cry Freedom? I saw this movie in Africa for the first time and did not know then that Denzel was an American until I moved here.
