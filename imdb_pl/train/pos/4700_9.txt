I could not believe in a low 5.6 score on IMDb about Johnny Dangerously the moment I wrote this review, and I thought I needed to do something to promote this memorable piece of comedy as much as I can. Seriously, to get a rating so low, people who voted must have a very limited sense of humor, not to mention a very shallow open mind. If you do not like funny movies, do not watch them! Combining absurd humor, very good story telling and the exceptional pace of many gags, this film has been included in my DVD collection. Not to mention the here and there visual visuals and, of course, the use of "clin d'oeils" and "clich√©s" based on our favorite organized crime movies. <br /> <br /> I showed this movie to many people, and getting to know it without any specific expectations (except maybe watching a comedy) - I should see the state of mind in my mind - everyone liked it. Everything is going well, you do not have to watch it for a long time and there are absolutely no slow downs in the evolution of this story, which I think is very simple. Of course it is not perfect, some of the gags are a little too short, but no movie is perfect, especially when you consider other reviews. That's why I rated this film 9 out of 10. This movie is in my opinion a precursor, such as "Top Secret" and "Spaceballs" in the field of absurd but well thought out comedies. Which are more and more absurd today while limiting thought and ingenuity. Sometimes, gags need more culture than many people imagine they are properly understood, if at all. As the last word I would like to say: look at yourself, do not follow the average saying Joe, and if you do not like it, you certainly know that it was not good for your tastes, which is understandable, but in my opinion unlikely .
