Yes, the plot is predictable; yes, there are a few holes in the story; yes, it has a quality created for television; and yes, Britney Spears "wrote" a book with obvious self-promotion. <br /> <br /> But forget about it ... this movie is funny. <br /> <br /> Fun at school A special kind of road, but still fun. <br /> <br /> Virginia Madsen as a great mother ... so good that I will start watching her films. Diane Lane reminded me of all the good reasons. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is doing very well too. If I was a casting agent, I would investigate some of these young actors. <br /> <br /> Production values ​​are above ordinary television standards, and the music was really great ... better than a few big budget movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> If you fancy a German noir, this movie is not for you. If you want to have a safe, funny and underestimated movie, it's good. It is the one that you can show your 10-year-old daughter, but also enjoy yourself.
