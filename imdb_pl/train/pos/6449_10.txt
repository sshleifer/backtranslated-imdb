I was taken to this film by a friend and I was skeptical about the Swedish film with subtitles. However, I enjoyed every minute of this beautiful film. Unnecessary cruelty to which a human is capable is presented with confidence without overwhelming images - although animal lovers may be forced to cover their eyes for a few seconds within the first 10 minutes. The traditional story of humbleness and brutality and hope versus tragedy has been illustrated with a satisfactory fresh angle, using the spectrum of characters with very natural defects and traits. I especially liked the way the film dealt with many aspects of the hypocritical human behavior that pertains to partiality, discrimination and the appearance of sanctity. The absolute jewel of the film, which I will promote for all who will listen.
