This film, although appreciated by critics, has of course not yet been released in the United States on DVD, just like another great - "Housekeeping" Christine Lahti in the same year. But if you can support Region 4 (Australian) DVD, this little masterpiece should be in your collection. There are several more copies of VHS on the Internet. Davis is complemented by a great story as well as unforgettable performances from her cast, especially Claudia Carvan and the late great Jan Adele. Strangely, or maybe not, this movie and its stars have not been confirmed at the Academy Awards, just like the movie Housekeeping, but treat them both - you'll be glad you did!
