I last saw this movie and really liked it. I was surprised and cried. This movie is in the same niche genre as "Away from Her" - and even "The Bucket List", but supports the whole subject of aging with incredible authenticity. It is really difficult to have a main character as unlikely as Hagar. The director does masterful work with this challenge. Hagar is difficult to understand. Her world has hard edges and is not a warm, affectionate woman at all. <br /> <br /> The first scene does it without compromise. Hagar (Ellen Burnstyn) is taken to a nursing home by her son and daughter-in-law. It calculates it on the route and goes crazy. Its edges are really difficult. She is mean. She is humiliating and selfish. She is a stone. I did not like it - even a bit. <br /> <br /> Throughout the video, we get an insight. We find out why he does not like petunia, why he favors one son over another, how her losses have created her character ... I began to see an angel ... and I started to like her. I especially liked it when she poured out her secrets to a boy in a hut. Ellen Burnstyn, you're a great actor. Fame. Fame. Fame. What a scene! <br /> <br /> This is not a "feel good" movie, but it is certainly a movie that allows the viewer's empathy. I understand more clearly that the hard edges in a person's life are to protect them, they are there for some reason ... <br /> <br /> Hagar is not my mother - she is not even my mother right or neighbor ... but some of it is present in many women (and men) in my life. These parts somehow make more sense to me when I watched The Stone Angel.
