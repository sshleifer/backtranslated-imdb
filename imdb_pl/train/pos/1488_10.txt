This is one movie to see if you want to get married or whether you are married. The film presents a couple in Italy and deals with such difficult topics as abortion, infidelity, juggling and family. <br /> <br /> The so-called "culture of death" that we are experiencing nowadays in the world is terrible this film will definitely make you think. <br /> <br /> Must see. I hope it will be distributed as it should. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to the cast and director. <br /> <br /> Two thumbs up and 10 stars from me!
