In 1993, with the success of the first season of Batman: The Animated Series, Warner Brothers commissioned the band responsible for the hit show to produce a full-length film originally intended for Direct-To-Video, but a theater-confused status. Becoming known as Batman: Fantasy Mask. Ten years after Phantasm, we had three feature films released by boys from WB, Sub-Zero, Return of the Joker, and now Mystery of the Batwoman joins the family. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple and in many ways similar to the Mask of the Phantasm: a new female modeling himself after Batman began aiming operations led by Mafia chief Gotham Rupert Thorne and Oswald Cobblepot AKA The Penguin. Now Batman must try to unravel the Batwoman secret before he crosses the line. <br /> <br /> Animation is a more elegant, futuristic style that was used in the fifth and sixth season of Batman: The Animated Series (AKA New Adventures of Batman). , it's pretty nice and as elegant as Return of the Joker. There is also some use of CGI, but it is small compared to the excess of that in Sub-Zero. The music was fine. Different and exotic and similar to the result of the Justice League, although the points in the results when there is an old animated theme Batman, will certainly send waves of nostalgia through the rodent-shaped hearts of older fans. <br /> <br /> Kevin Conroy, as usual, does a great job as Bruce Wayne and Batman. It is also great to recover former graduates of Batman: The Animated Series; including Bob Hastings (commissioner Gordon), Robert Costanzo (detective Bullock), Tara Strong (Barbara Gordon / Batgirl; her episode indicates a romantic relationship between her and Bruce, mentioned in Batman Beyond), and Efrem Zimbalist Jr. (Alfred). <br /> <br /> The villains were also great - especially since Rupert Thorne, the old mafia boss from the original series, appears for the first time since the fourth season. <br /> <br /> In general, although he did not achieve the Mask of the Phantasm standard ten years ago, MOTB quite nicely carries a torch for Batman's animated movies. And if you have a DVD and you're a hardcore fan, you'll love the five-minute short Chase Me.
