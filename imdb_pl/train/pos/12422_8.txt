Thanks to mixed opinions I did not expect too much and I was pleasantly surprised. It is a very funny little crime film with interesting characters, excellent portraits, airy writing, no glibbing and good pace. It also looks good, in a fun way. Apparently people like this movie or just hate it, and I like it.
