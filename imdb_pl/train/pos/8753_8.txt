I saw this movie in the theater and I was impressed by it. Then again, Claire Danes was a good actress, not a stupid, arrogant Hollywood bitch she is today. Anyway, this movie really hit me as one of the more harsh, realistic, beautiful films of friendship. How far would you go for your best friend? I have been moved to tears at the end and I'm still picking up when I watch him now (I have him). I remember when I left the theater, I called my best friend and I was sobbing how much I loved her. It's a great movie to watch with the best girl. However, get ready for almost a later conversation in which he will ask you and ask you if you would do something for her ...
