Despite the other comments mentioned here, this is probably the best movie of Dirty Harry; a film that reflects - for better or worse - social and political feelings of the country during Reagan's glory years in the early 1980s. It is also an action movie. <br /> <br /> Opening with a liberal judge who disproves the murder case due to the lack of tangible evidence, and then goes directly to a meeting with a cafe with a few unfortunate thugs (scene that suggests the famous line "Go forward, my day") "Sudden influence" is one non-stop roller coaster of the action movie. For the first time you catch your breath when the embarrassing Inspector Callahan is sent back to a nearby town to study the background of the murdered hood. From there it's only better when Callahan deals with a supra-group of grotesque bandits, and the sheriff with a mysterious past. Great direction and photography and sometimes funny scenario help make this movie one of the best in the 80's.
