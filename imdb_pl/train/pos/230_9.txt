When I saw this film on the cable for the first time, it immediately became one of my favorite movies. I am a big fan of James Earl Jones and Robert Duvall. The film presents an accurate picture of the South and racist attitudes. Most of the attitudes came from Solla, an old plantation owner who uses convicts for work. Soll is what makes this move, his funny wanderings give us insight into the way the South was then. I suppose if Soll were alive today, he'd be diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Nevertheless, his attitude towards the little boy who comes to work for him and the convicts is complex. Although he has racist views, he trusts some of the condemned blacks. Two of the convicts he trusts the most are Jackson (Mel Winkler) and Ben (James Earl Jones). Ben and Sol's talks are the best in the film, they have real chemistry. James Earl Jones and Mel Winkler in both great performances and Hassie. <br /> <br /> This movie should gain more fame. However it is on DVD and worth the money. <br /> <br /> Rayvyn
