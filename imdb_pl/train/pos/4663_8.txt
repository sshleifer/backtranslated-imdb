I saw the description of the movie on TCM and let it run because I like both Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith, so I was delighted to be surprised that I really liked the movie and found it unique. Of course it is seriously outdated, but as a piece from the era it is worth watching only for subtle humor in understanding life and lifestyle almost forty years ago. Now the only problem is trying to find it on DVD, so I can watch it more often. I was also very busy with performances of Smith and Ustinov as leaders, as well as Karl Malden, Bob Newhart and performances of Robert Morley and Cesar Romero.
