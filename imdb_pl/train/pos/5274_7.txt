Yes, I loved the movie when I was a kid. When I was growing up, I saw this movie so many times that my dad had to buy another copy of VHS because the old copy had worn out. <br /> <br /> My family received a copy of this VHS video when we bought a new VHS system. At first, my mother was not sure if this was the right movie for a 10-year-old, but because we just bought a new VHS system, she let me watch it. <br /> <br /> As I said, this movie or every little boy is dreaming? The film contains great surroundings, great muscular barbarians, beautiful topless women, great evil monsters and jokes that you will get when you grow old. A few days ago I put a video and after a long time I watched the movie again. At first I was bored, and then I started to think about how much I love this movie when I was a kid, and I was still watching. Yes, the experience was not as great as I remembered? Acting is very bad, the plot is pretty bad, the jokes were not funny anymore, but the women were still pretty. Yes, I grew up. Although the movie experience has changed for me, I still think it is worth 7 stars. Do you know that for good old times?
