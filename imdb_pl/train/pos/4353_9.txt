Fortunately, we saw this fantastic movie at the international film festival in Palm Springs. After entering the theater, we got a small opinion card that will be used for our personal film review. Looking at the card, I turned to my wife and said, "What do you think, how many movies in your life can you consider great? Only for me about 5 ". But then, watching the interaction of Peter Falk and Paul Reiser, watching a spectacular scenery in the New York state film scene, I am slowly beginning to run into a film in the category. It was certainly a good thing, but a completely natural reposition of the actors and the award-winning performance of a man who, unfortunately, will probably be remembered for a raincoat bearing a detective, not the movie, the movie jumped to an excellent level. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie there were a few dry eyes at home, and my usually stoic and soulless heart melted just as much as Grincha, and I ended up giving it a great one. <br /> <br /> This photo is a must for anyone who has parents. Without violence and nakedness, but with strong language.
