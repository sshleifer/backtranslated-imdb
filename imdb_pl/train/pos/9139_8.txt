The movie is fine, it has its moments, the music scenes are the best! The soundtrack is a real classic. This is an excellent album, it starts with Let's Go Crazy (suitable for starters, because it is a great song for a party and a very fast temp), Take Me With U (funny song pop ...), The Beautiful Ones (a cheerful ballad, probably the closest one R & B on this whole album), Computer Blue (slightly furious hymn on Appolonia), Darling Nikki (one of the funniest songs in history, very indistinctly joking about Appolonia), When Doves Cry (climax to this masterpiece), I Um Die 4 U , Baby I'm A Star, and of course Purple Rain (a real classic, very appropriate ending to this classic album). The film and album are very good. I highly recommend them!
