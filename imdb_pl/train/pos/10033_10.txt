The Titanic film makes it much more than a "night to remember". It writes a tragic historical event that will always be mentioned and will never be forgotten. Why so criticized? I have no idea. Will they ever make a movie like the Titanic that will be so moving and moving every time you watch it. Will they ever replace such an epic masterpiece. It will be almost impossible. <br /> <br /> The director undoubtedly had the biggest influence on the film. A simple movie about a catastrophe (boring to watch) turned into an unbelievable affair. Yes, I'm not a type of romance, but it should not bother you, because you'll never see such a romance. Guaranteed! Everything to get amazing effects, music, lofty acting. <br /> <br /> The film creates amazing visual and wonderful impressions. Everything looks very real and live. The legend of "TITANIC" itself is excellently shown in all classes, it also looks just like accommodation. Acting was a real effect. Dicaprio and Winslet simply play the roles there. No one could do better. They are in part the reason why the film is so great. <br /> <br /> I think there is nothing to talk about. The plot is simple, Acting is brilliant, based on a true story, Probably more than half of consumers watching a movie will share tears, thanks to an unimaginable ending that can never be forgotten. Well, if you have not seen this movie on something that is missing in something Hesterical, and a movie you love for Hollywood. Can it be better? Not at all. The most moving movie of all time, do not listen to people, see for yourself, understand. Landmark. (do not be surprised if you also cry)
