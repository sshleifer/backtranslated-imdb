Although I have not seen it in too many films before, you've certainly seen the basic storylines in too many movies. <br /> <br /> This is not one of Grant's and Loy's best films, they make a special effort together. In the end, with such talent and a very good cast, you know that there will be laughter. <br /> <br /> The film is light, it has dramatic spotting, but it keeps the story in motion and makes it smile. <br /> <br /> A great example of the classic American film tariff that has stood the test of time. <br /> <br /> A definite Saturday afternoon, heavy for popcorn.
