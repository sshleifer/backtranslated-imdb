Mr. Michael Jackson is an artistic phenomenon. His short films, or music videos, are simply the best. I do not care if I get a reasonable science fiction function from this man, but I care about getting a mix of his crazy dance, screams, cool choreography of the crowd and pieces of CGI and animation. There should also be several unbroken videos. Everything I mentioned is here. Stupid plot and exaggerated "vanity fair" are not a problem when I am witnessing Michael Jackson's action. For me, he will always be the best king of music videos (not "king of pop", which sounds stupid, especially for us Russians, because "pop" sounds like the Russian word "asses", and MJ is definitely not the "king of donkeys"). I can re-watch his best music videos (which are artistically beautiful) and never tire them. <br /> <br /> My first impression of this movie was: "What is ...?" (fragments of various films, some drawn images, disturbing jumps from one topic to another, lack of any coherent plot, some kids fooling around, etc.), but when I watched it to the end, I could say that it was great and really nothing like what is currently shown on TV. I also liked the fact that it never shows any embarrassing materials and can be easily viewed by children. <br /> <br /> Without Michael Jackson, the world of music videos would be rather weak. Even the best classic films by other artists can not be close to the energetic hyperbole of musical madness and the artistic quality of MJ. He knew how to get the audience at different ages and knew how to remain human with moral principles. <br /> <br /> When I see the correct version of the movie DVD from Mr. Michael Jackson, I know that it deserves to be purchased even if some clips have already appeared in another previous version. "HIStory I", "HIStory II" and "Moonwalker" are great, although only "Moonwalker" is more like one movie (with a solid theme "Smooth Criminal", the subject of "paparazzi" and a few strange fakes and twists). <br /> <br /> Not being a fan of MJ I can still give this "movie ... like no other" solid 9 out of 10 (I was hit by "Smooth Criminal" for sure and my main complaints are as follows: the initial segments of the movie could be rejected, while the main "MJ anti-drugs campaign" should receive more "crazy madness and stress" and of course there should be more "walking on the moon".). Thank you for your attention.
