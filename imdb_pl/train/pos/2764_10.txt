On the eighth day, God created Georges. But just as the eighth day does not match up to a week, Georges does not fit into the modern world: he has Down syndrome and is therefore marginalized by society, thrown into asylum after his mother's death four years ago. She was the only person who loved him. <br /> <br /> Harry is another man he does not love anymore. His wife left him for reasons he can not explain. He also loses love for his daughters when he arrives too late at the railway station to collect two children who want to spend the weekend with their father. <br /> <br /> Harry is a high-ranking businessman. He knows all the rules that allow us to succeed in our modern meritocracy. But he entered a state of crisis that culminates in losing the love of his daughters. He questions the meaning of his life without any concrete results. <br /> <br /> Harry and Georges meet. At first, Harry tries to get rid of Georges, just like everyone else. But Georges can not be shaken off. And gradually Harry begins to dawn how much Georges needs if he wants to break the identity crisis. Georges opens up new access to the world and makes him see his life with different eyes. Friendship and human warmth replace the calculations of striving for success. No wonder Harry can not avoid defeat at work now. <br /> <br /> Georges helps Harry regain the recognition of his daughters. Even his wife must admit that the fireworks he organized were worth seeing. Nevertheless, reintegration with old life is no longer possible. And the new turns out to be nothing more than a sleep with a time limit that will inevitably reach the end. The camera looks at Harry and Georges from above for one long minute, because they both lie on the grass, enjoying the moment. But just as this minute will inevitably pass, the friendship of two men, which was created in such a wonderful way, will not be long-lasting. Georges is destroyed by the impossibility of love of the opposite sex and sees no other way than to commit suicide. Harry turns into an urban wanderer who asks car drivers who wait for charity in front of the lights. <br /> <br /> The film describes contemporary meritocracy as a disastrous mechanism that devours positive values ​​such as human heart warmth or friendship. Georges, mongol, seems to be able to show the way out of the dilemma, but unfortunately his request is coming to an end. However, its failure does not necessarily mean that it is impossible or undesirable to achieve the goal. The manner in which he shows us is certainly satisfactory, although it requires enormous willpower and, above all, courage to apply radical nonconformity.
