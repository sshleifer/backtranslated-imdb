The National Lampoon's Class Reunion is a classic comedy film from the early 80s that combines unique characters, lots of laughter and great music from Chuck Berry. When Walter Bailor is absolutely humiliated by his classmates at high school, he takes the opportunity to take revenge on his class meeting. One by one he persecutes his classmates, including an innocent blind girl, a horny fat man, a beautiful high school student, a king of all preps, and even an ugly old lady from lunch, who served all the children in high school. This movie has something terrifying about it and it has a few short scenes of sexuality, so I do not recommend it to young children, but it's a great movie for teenagers. If you're looking for a movie with a beautiful score, complex characters or deadly special effects, you may not love the Class Reunion. If you want to sit for 90 minutes and have a great laugh and a lot of fun (and who not), this movie should be on your movies to see the list. ++
