To those who claim that this movie deserves something below the slave grace he showed, I do not agree. It's an amazing documentary about a shocking day. <br /> <br /> IMDB asks you to rate this video. I am asking you to consider the fact that the film was made. The courage required to make this film is the most remarkable. We learn that the two brothers are divided when this moment happened. They continue to document the bravest of the brave, not knowing about their safety and each other. To assess whether it is more noble to make a film about this tragedy, or to save life, as amazing, amazing firemen do, I can not answer. I just know that in 30 years a class full of children will not know one without the other. <br /> <br /> I send cordial 10. That is why the art of filming was created! To capture the natural emotions that real life offers. You can keep your garbage in kung-fu. The romance is sweet. The action will never reach this level. This film, September 11, will be timeless because it will not glorify. It did not have any preview. He did not have all the blatant vanities that awakens the lion's share of many films on many screens. He was of class, self-control, substance and had a record of the day that changed the contemporary face of America and even the world. He talked about the things inevitable for the camera. Please consider this movie, as he says, a moving tribute to all who fell because of the free, beautiful name of America. <br /> <br /> How can you give something less to the film that shows the ornaments, the natural courage of real people operating in unreal times. I love Godfather, but "9/11" is forever a different kind of film because it's now a different kind of world. This is art without questions and questions. <br /> <br /> jf
