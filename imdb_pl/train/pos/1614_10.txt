There is nothing to like in Moonstruck. I come from a New York Italian family and I really miss home a lot when I watch it. Actors and actresses, plot, storylines, humor ... everything was fantastic. It starts a bit slowly, but in two days a lot happens! I fell in love with LaBohem because of this movie. Moonstruck is number 3 on my favorite movie list. It's a "feel good" movie in which you leave the theater humming "it's more" or repeating some of your favorite lines: "old, if you give these dogs another piece of food, I'll kick you until you die "; "Chrissy, bring me a big knife," "who's dead," "do you love Loretta ..... good, because when you do, they drive you crazy because they know they can." I always put Moonstruck when there is nothing good to watch, because it makes me happy.
