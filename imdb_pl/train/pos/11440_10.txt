I went today to see Rivers and Tides. This is the second time in two days and yes, I see movies that I like as many times as necessary. Yesterday I was struck by the splendor of Goldsworthy's paintings and works. This morning, when I threw coins, I received # 29 The Abysmal (Water). Goldsworthy has affinity with water, hence the title. I received a change of the fifth line, which moved to the # 7 Army. Blake Art is a war. Anyway, I knew I had to see the movie again. <br /> <br /> I have read one of several reviews published by Online Examiner. The critic loved this movie, but said that Goldsworthy's comments prevented him from enjoying the movie. He would only like to have pictures and a great soundtrack. I was aware of it when I watched it a second time. <br /> <br /> Yesterday I thought I would vote for Andy Goldsworthy as the King of the World. Well, today I could go beyond the pictures and listen to what he had to say. Can I enjoy the movie without his comments? What he does, what he says, goes far beyond "art." His understanding of Water, Time, Stone, Change, and also further led me to think that a man is the reincarnation of Lao Tsu or an Avatar. Some of his works / words are similar to Zen. His knowledge ... <br /> <br /> Besides, the film is (only) screened here in the Bay Area. Be a determinant of trends. Go to the local cinema and tell them, do not insist that they have to reserve a movie you heard about from the hinter lands. His name is Rivers and Tides. <br /> <br />
