A good Korean movie about not only taekwondo, but about how it is to be good, just as the fight of thugs can not overcome taekwondo guy in his sport, because there are rules, just like in life and school, and this film has the concept . <br /> <br /> Martial arts in the film are not so good, but they are satisfying and pleasant. Friends who strive to achieve something that they once mocked, become stronger through the mind and heart. This movie should not be taken too seriously because it has a slapstick, but it also has a message. <br /> <br /> A good movie from Korea.
