Honestly, I did not like this movie when I saw it for the first time. But I think the problem is that I did not see him in the theater. A big mistake! Because the first thing to see in Cliffhanger are settings, and # 2 is cinematography. Try to see this movie on the largest possible TV and a great sound system. Music is good and takes the film to the next level (and commercial potential). The more I see him, the more I like him. <br /> <br /> This is definitely one of Renny Harlin's best films. This guy knows about the action. Die Hard 2, Long kiss goodbye, etc. This is especially good in this movie. The special effect is wonderful and spectacular. Stallone really needed this movie with success. It's still good to see him!
