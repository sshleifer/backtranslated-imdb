After reading a lot of good reviews about this movie, I decided to take it on a spin (I bought it on a DVD, hence the "spin" pun ... I'm a dork). The beginning was everything that I hoped for, perfect configuration (along with a few quotes I heard on the albums "Various Wu-Tang") for a good movie. But the story I heard was so great, it was so predictable. Every time I saw a character (with the exception of the Lizard), I guessed who Jad was. In addition, the only cool character is killed in the middle of the movie. Ok, so the plot was not very good, but at least it was a bit of a good kung-fu? Wrong. The fights were very short and few. Granted different styles were pretty cool, but I would like the fights to be longer. I was hoping to see Lizard running and doing crazy things on the walls, but that never happened. I was hoping to see Centipede at a fast pace, but it did not happen. I was hoping to see Scorpion in the film for over 7 minutes, but it never happened. In short, not much happens. The fight is quite routine. Do not be fooled because this movie has a story, it does not mean it is good.
