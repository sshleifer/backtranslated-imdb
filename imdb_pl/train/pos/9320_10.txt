MINIATURE MGM A short topic. <br /> <br /> The editor of Cole County Clarion needs to decide what is the real IMPORTANT NOTICE to his readers: the approaching frost, which could mean a catastrophe for their collections, or the sensational shooting down of a notorious gangster on their main street in a small town. <br /> <br /> This is a nice little one-liner, with a good performance from Charles `Chic 'Sale. Today's viewers will perhaps be more interested in the appearance of the invaluable James Stewart as a nephew / assistant to Sale. Slowly speaking and a bit stupid, Stewart shows many attributes that would make him a huge star in a very short time. <br /> <br /> Frequently overlooked or neglected today, short and one-piece topics were useful. Studies are an important training field for new or developing talents, both at the front and back of the camera. The dynamics of creating a successful short theme was completely different than in a full-length film, something like writing an innovative story, not a novel. Economical in production both in terms of budget and schedule, and enabling the presentation of a wide range of materials, short themes were a perfect complement to the studio's feature films.
