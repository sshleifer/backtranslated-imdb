Unfortunately, due to the tendency of American viewers to avoid subtitles, this film has not received the distribution or attention it deserves. His subtle themes of belonging, identity, racial relations, and especially how colonialism harms all parties, go beyond the obvious dramatic tensions, nostalgic memories of protaganist childhood and the exoticism of her relationship with her "boyfriend", perhaps the only "real" man whom know. We do not even look at her mother's relationship with this elegant man. There! I hope that I gave you enough of a hook to speak, regardless of whether you speak French or Polish. I challenge you to be as brave, strong and aware as La P'tite.
