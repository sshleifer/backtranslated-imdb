Hamlet is definitely my favorite of all Shakespeare's works. Branaugh is one of the actors. His image was simply amazing. His monologues were breathtaking. As long as it was rare, the film retains my interest, but I was busy with this particular song. I recommend it to everyone, both Shakespeare fans and others. It has everything the modern world is looking for in its films: murder, betrayal and deceit. Not to knock Mel Gibson's version, but Branaughs touches the whole job. It does not leave an inverted stone. When you finish the movie, you will feel as if you were reading the play yourself. Um, as you say "two thumbs".
