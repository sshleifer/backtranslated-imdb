Just a great movie without a doubt. Great story and great performances, be it Amitabh, Akshay, Shefali, Priyanka, Boman or Rajpal. The Hindu film industry shamelessly deals with Mallika and Co, this film is completely vulgar and therefore it must disappoint vulgarity addicted to our Indian society. But the message and concept that this film brings is absolutely amazing. You could avoid Anu Malika (boring cat), and Ismail Darbar or Himmesh Reshmmiya could be used as a musician. It seems to me that Vipul Shah should also touch Gujarati, especially in music. Anu Malik is the worst musician and is considered to be a pop star, but it is not a movie where presence is required - it looks good only with Govinda style songs. I felt some nice serious music with a few good Ghazals or sad songs that could make this movie more unforgettable.
