One of the best films by Fred Astaire and Giner Rogers. Great music by Irving Berlin. Robust support from Randolph Scott, Harriet Nelson, Lucille Ball, Betty Grable, Frank Jenks and Astrid Allwyn. <br /> <br /> The great songs are "Let Yourself Go", "Let's Face the Music" and "Putting All My Eggs in One Basket. The last song was introduced by Astaire playing a jazz piano and then a sweet dance with Rogers. Rogers also sings "Let Yourself Go" from Grable among the backup contractors. <br /> <br /> Harriet Nelson (then Hilliard) sings two nice songs and plays Rogers' dark sister. "Get Thee Behind Me" is a song that has been accompanying you for many days. She also sings "But Where Are You?" This lively and dynamic entry in the Astaire-Rogers series is one of the better ones. The classic and amazing beautiful finale of "Let's Face the Music and Dance" is one of the most famous numbers. Rogers wears one of the great dresses in the history of the film .... a shimmering sequin number that spins around her legs as she dances (weighted piping) and is also slightly let through. Just beautiful. This is the number that Steve Martin and Bernadette Peters created again in Pennies from Heaven. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott seems a strange choice as Astaire's buddy, but he also appeared in their Robert with Irene Dunne. Fortunately, he does not try to sing or dance. It seems that Grable and Ball would have larger parts in 1936, But they have several scenes and have little effect. Allwyn has a bigger role, but it's fine. <br /> <br /> Rogers has one of his best solo numbers in the series "Let Yourself Go" .... Jazzy and thumping, it's a great song. <Br> <br /> Funny all the time, although I got tired of "We Joined the Navy" for the third time ....
