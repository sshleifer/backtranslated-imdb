This movie is one of my favorites because it makes me think about all my choices and how my life will change if my choices are different. He's playing right into the theory of the "Universe". <br /> <br /> The only thing that does not sound the truth is how Larry Burrows (James Belushi) is so difficult to understand what is going on, that everything has changed. <br /> <br />
