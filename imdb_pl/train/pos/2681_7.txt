As you probably already know, Jess Franco is one fertile guy. He has made hundreds of films, many of which are nonsense. However, he managed to sneak into sporadic quality work in the entire assembly line operation. "Succubus" is not his best work (neither "The Diabolical Dr. Z" nor "Vampyros Lesbos"), but he has many of his trademarks that make him necessary for anyone interested in diving in his big catalog. He combines erotic (alternately showing full nakedness and leaving something left to the imagination) and surrealistically smoothly. It is a very phenomenal movie, full of great atmosphere. I especially liked the continuous creation of names. Despite being incredibly pretentious, it's funny to hear all of Franco's influence. <br /> <br /> Still, there are many users who do not like "Succubus" and I can see where they come from. His quiet walk, but I can deal with it. Inconsistency is more problematic. The screenplay was obviously hasty and within five minutes after the film I had absolutely no idea what was going on (and from then on it never happened). Those who want to have a substance with their style, are looking elsewhere. Also, if it's a horror, it never really gets scary or even tense. Still, all the psychedelic stupidity was a game for me that did not really bother me with these major drawbacks. (7/10)
