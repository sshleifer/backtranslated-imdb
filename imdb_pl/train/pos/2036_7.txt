- SMALL SPOILER HERE! - <br /> <br /> When I looked at the "Creep" voices today, I was surprised by so many IMDb users evaluating this movie "1". I wonder: what do people expect from this kind of film? Do so many people watch the movie without knowing anything about it? <br /> <br /> "Creep" is a HORROR movie and it's pretty cool! It automatically means: it has an absurd story full of holes, outrageous threats and simple unilateral forms. So why complain? Just take some popcorn and coke, sit back in your seat, and then ... ... enjoy being scared! The first 60 minutes, when there is almost nothing but Kate and the lonely subway station, is incredibly terrifying. There is tension and fear in every corner of the screen, and you will only struggle because of the sudden sound of flashing neon lights on your back. (In my opinion, the sound editor did the best job in this movie.) <br /> <br /> When Kate meets the persecutor, the quality of the movie falls, but it's still not a bad movie. The second part of the movie is not at all frightening, but the gore effects are well done, and the story is quite well developed. (... as long as you remember that this is the horror you are watching, not the Discovery Channel!) So if you want to take a very, very scary hour. Just watch the first hour "Creep", and then leave the cinema or turn on the TV. Besides, you know the rest of the story, right? The bad guy will die, and Kate will be the only survivor. But even if you watch this movie to the end, you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> ... and if you want to increase anxiety, do what I did after watching this movie: leave the cinema dark at night, go to the next metro station and take the last train home ...
