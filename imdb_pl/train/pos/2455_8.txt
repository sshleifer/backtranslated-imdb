It's a pretty good movie, but too American in its predictability. Change Kung Fu to football and Turkish family to Pakistani, and you will see the Bend It Like Beckham scene (2002). A good feature is that the basis of the film is the progress of fighting with the mysterious ninja under the highway, starting with unhappy losses and slowly progressing until the last fight is a win against each other, as the master Kung Fu stressed several times. On another level, Danish life is revealed in a completely different way than in the case of outsiders: non-indigenous immigrants who form a large part (in fact the majority) of Denmark's citizens, graffiti in the suburbs of Copenhagen, immigrant's mockery at the beginning of the film. They all represent a different picture than you think when you hear the word Denmark.
