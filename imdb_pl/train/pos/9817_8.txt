I remember this movie. Quite intense for an 11-year-old. Good assembly, I felt terrible for Saint. Bernard. I would watch it again if it was retransmitted, but the signal releases Pluto when I write. Robert Culp. The culmination of his career. I'm glad I did not live in THIS neighborhood. Oh those 70's. What a decade. If they convert it, I bet it would be very brutal and bloody. So what are they waiting for? An excellent movie for suburban boys from the suburbs. It was very intense. I think it was filmed in Los Angeles. Certainly not in Lodi NJ. Shot from Saint. Bernard was the best and apparently the most haunting picture in the movie ... and then they left the carrion on the porch. Rotten children.
