Apparently, few people have seen this movie because no one is posting any comments anymore. This is not a movie that you can miss. In the end, he won the George Peabody award and the Humanitas award. Paul Winfield should have won the award for his amazing performance in this film. Eugene Logan, who was a co-writer of this TV movie, was also part of another film about humanity or its loss, being a technical advisor to the film Truman Capote's Glass House. This movie is now available on DVD. If anyone is interested, I will publish another letter saying that Eugene Logan has become a technical advisor to the film of such an amazing person as Truman Capote. Thank you for reading this and I hope you will find a way to watch these two films.
