One night I came across this at the Bravo satellite station. Initially, out of curiosity, I decided to look at it. To be completely honest, I was not disappointed. The main character is beautiful and her body is well shown. he would be wasted as an executioner, but apparently not after watching the whole movie! My only serious problem is acting cast, especially the actor who plays Melnik.Christa is angry! The prison guard Hank is unhappy too. get drunk and try to approach Wanda's guardian badly, although he is lucky for us, and for Hanka he goes down and gets dirty with Wanda at the end. The music used is quite tense and creates the perfect atmosphere for the execution. This film is well watched for the beautiful, talented and very sexy Jennifer Thomas
