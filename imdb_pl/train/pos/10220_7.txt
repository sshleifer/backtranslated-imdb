This funny line is typical of these naughty sisters. (It's fun on your own terms and not too much fun.) Only two sisters are really bad. Boy, they are bad too! One of them is pinup poses and polite comments where she goes. The second is to look like Marilyn Monroe. He has these sensual, slightly parted lips. And to give up nothing, it is even more evil than others. <br /> <br /> All three sisters play Christmas. The man who falls into their lives is played by John Bromfield. He had something in his career. <br /> <br /> It looks like it's probably the first mainstream soft porn ever. Well, of course not the first, but the noblest at the time. <br /> <br /> Girls wear as little as possible and let's not forget about female members of the audience: Bromfield shows shaving with an electric razor - which was the fetish? - naked breasts. He was also shown to be wet in a bathing suit. <br /> <br /> Here is also the real plot: the family of girls, look, is cursed. They are prone to suicide - or dramatic deaths that can make them appear suicidal. <br /> <br /> The movie is not bad. I really do not know where it was shown. Maybe it was created for drive-in needs. Somehow and I could be wrong, I felt that the typical male audience is not the main goal here. Women are scantily clothed. They often resemble dark magazine covers, such as the police detective or jackets from the dime novels. <br /> <br /> But the guy seems to be the center of attention. Not everyone in the film likes it, but all girls love it. And I think the audience should also. <br /> <br /> It's a lot of fun - and on your own terms.
