"Bend It Like Beckham" reminds me of the best movies from the 80s directed by John Hughes. Everything is happening in the world with chewing gum, in which everyone is attractive, there are some easy to resolve conflicts that sometimes break away from most joyful events, and a huge amount of story is summarized by assemblies focused on bouncy pop songs. There's nothing wrong with it. "Bend It Like Beckham" is an absolute feast from beginning to end. My wife and I were completely excited about the deliciousness of corn, even when we laughed at it, and finally, as it is embarrassing to admit it, they applauded (and by the way, we saw it in our lives, not in the theater). Watch this video and enjoy. <br /> <br /> Class: B +
