I saw this movie when I was a kid. It destroyed me. It was before the day of television, so a movie of this size, he could send the child into orbit. It made a big impression on me that I went to watch this movie for twelve consecutive days. The special effects used during this time were much ahead of their time. Sabu was a delight, as did Rex Ingram as Gin. I found myself singing "I want to be a sailor" for many months after the movie left the city. I recommend this movie to everyone. I forgot to mention Conrad Veidta, who was as vicious as you would ever want to meet. In addition, June Duprez has never been more beautiful than in this picture. The color was excellent. Give this movie AAA!
