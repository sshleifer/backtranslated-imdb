Fay Grim is fierce, annoying and unbelievable, but it's hard to sit down, but Parker Posey is really the only actress who could take this story and run away. She is also moving, funny, cunning. Supporting actors also support it. <br /> <br /> I will not even try to tell you the story. It includes characters from Henry Fool Hartley and tries to talk about international espionage. <br /> <br /> The movie works well if you continue to understand it. in a sense, completely absurd. It becomes more and more ridiculous when you move. (I resisted the temptation to disable the DVD twice). <br /> <br /> Fay Grim requires an adventurous filmmaker willing to take care of something that is not disgusting. In the end, it offers something that defies the description.
