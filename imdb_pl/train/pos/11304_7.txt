I am not sure in what circumstances the director Visconti decided to make a novel by James Cain "The postman always calls twice" (I'm not even sure if Viscounti has acquired the rights to the book), but the resulting film is definitely interesting. This is not the best version of Cain's story (I like the version from 1981), but thanks to the great director Visconti and cast Clara Calamai and Massimo Girotti (very sensual pair), this is a must for Noir fans. Visconti perfectly combines neorealism with sensitivity to noir. The film is not perfect though. My main complaint is that the movie is a little too long for your own good; the story moves at a very slow pace (I do not think that Visconti would be very good at editing their films). I think the noir movie works better in a short time. Fortunately, Calamai and Girotti are magnetic actors who are interested in the viewer. In any case, just as I like this movie and the remixes, I think nobody has developed the final version of Cain's highly praised book.
