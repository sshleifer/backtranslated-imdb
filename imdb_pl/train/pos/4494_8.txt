This film straight from Bolton is obvious to me. Shots from the location are fascinating and show Bolton in a transitional period - there are many scenes of apparent neglect, but this serves to show the city being rebuilt - and the idea that the old must give way to the new, which is at the heart of the film. Not very well directed, James Mason leads a pleasant team in a tale of confusion around herring, which is transformed into a full-blown generation conflict, then pleasantly degraded in resolution. Although I am a bit young to remember it fully, the details of Lancashire's life in the 1960s are all here: earning on Friday, songs around the piano, Sunday constitution, good neighborhood, worry of courtship, massive self-respect, and I was pleased to see Naughton's funniest lines from the game that remained intact. There is no doubt that this movie should be made available on DVD - it is well made and most performances are well done.
