Because this movie was based on the true story of a woman who had two children and was not very well off, it was just scary as it really was! Acting is what gives the film magnificence. <br /> <br /> Diane Keaton played the character of the main character, Patsy McCartle, who had two sons whom she adored. Her performance made the real story of life come to life on the TV screen. It was very difficult to see some of the scenes because they were so real about what happens when someone becomes addicted to drugs. <br /> <br /> It was difficult to see this loving mother from sweetness to carelessness, but it was so real. I know people who have gone through withdrawal and it was very similar to what happened in this movie, from what I remember. <br /> <br /> I also thought that the director would like to risk a movie of what happened to this woman. However, it has been done so well. I praise the director for making this film. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it to anyone who knew someone who was ever addicted to drugs or just learned what could happen if you become addicted to them.
