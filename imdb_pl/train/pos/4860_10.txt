Damsel in Distress is a delight because of the great songs of Gershwin, Fred Astaire, Joan Fontaine and a great cast, headed by Gracie Allen and George Burns. <br /> <br /> He usually has a stupid storyline for Astaire as the star of the American dance in England with Burns as his publicist and Allen's secretary. They make up the story of being a love bug with women falling on him from left and right. He falls on Fontaine, who is kept in captivity in her castle by a dominant aunt and a docile father. Stupid plot. <br /> <br /> Great songs are A Foggy Day, Things Are Looking Up, Nice Work, if you can get them, and I Can not Be Bothered Now. Fontaine does not sing, but has a short (and decent) Astaire number. Surprisingly well in several dance numbers with Astaire are Burns and Allen, including ingenious and fun in the theme park. <br /> <br /> Also in the cast are Reginald Gardiner, Constance Collier, Montagu Love, Harry Watson (like Albert), Ray Noble and my favorite - Jan Duggan as the main madrigal singer. <br /> <br /> Jan Duggan is in the middle of a kind of trio who sings a nice job if you can get it. Her mimicry is fun. She was also a thief in W.C. Fields' comedy, The Old Fashioned Way, playing Cleopatra Pepperday. <br /> <br /> The film used a lot of abuse due to the absence of Ginger Rogers, who, as mentioned elsewhere, would be terribly confused. The TCM host notes that Ruby Keeler and Jessie Matthews were considered. Yikes. Two more disasters. Fontaine is okay, because Alice and dynamics let music numbers belong to Astaire, with a great comical relief from Burns and Allen. <br /> <br /> Funny movie, great songs, good cast and Jan Duggan in the rare spotlight!
