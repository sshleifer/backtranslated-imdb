I can be biased, I am the author of the novel The Hungry Bachelors Club, released by myself in 1994. The script was written by my good friend and hungry bachelor Fred Dresch, who was an inspiration for Marlon in the film. I could not be happier with this trailer, I hope that I will see the film in its entirety and I will continue to comment. But Jorja Fox, who plays Delmar Youngblood, my character, is stellar. It carries a lot of emotional vehicles in good shape. I could not do better alone! It looks like real people, barely formulated and, fortunately, they direct my statement against racial prejudice home, with grace and heart.
