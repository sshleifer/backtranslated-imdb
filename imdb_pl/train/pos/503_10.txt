After 7 years of watching this horrible nonsense called the Star Trek Voyager, I felt completely numb. Next generation and DS9 were damn good, and Voyager destroyed TV Trek. It probably opened with the best pilot for the Trek show. The crew was really good, as was the choice of actors for individual parts. Scott Bakula played the typical captain for the first time in space, and his unparalleled way of doing things was a refreshing change in the already known to all captains from the past. The rest of the team was really nice in their roles and I think they went for a good first season. When the performance was prematurely canceled, I was very disappointed. In A Mirror Darkly showed us what the cast is capable of. It is a pity that a movie or TV movie has never been considered. So much history and the foundation of the federation to tell, including the beginning of war with the Klingons ..........
