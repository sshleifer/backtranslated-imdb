Well, personally I do not like rap music, but I still think Fear of a Black Hat is funny. I'm sure I did not find jokes, but some I knew and it was quite fun to make me laugh right after I stopped laughing. I'm a big fan of the spine, so naturally I had to check it out. It was derived from This Is Spinal Tap, sometimes blatantly, but this movie still became his property as an original, intelligent and funny satire. My personal favorite: "In the time of the slaves, they did not have hats to protect them from the sun, so at the end of the day they were too tired to rebel. Now we have hats. "
