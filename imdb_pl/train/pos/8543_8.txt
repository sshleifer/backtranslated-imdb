It was one of those movies that I would probably never pick up on the shelf, but one day it appeared in IFC and I said - Eric Stolz, William Forsythe ... why not? If I changed the channel, I would really miss the treasure. <br /> <br /> The subject is depressing - a young author paralyzed in climbing convalescence in a lower-class rehabilitation center. It would be so easy and tempting to make this tearing manipulator. But this is not happening because it was written by Neal Jimenez after he was accidentally paralyzed. No Hollywood luck. All patients in the ward come from very different backgrounds, but they have a sense of helplessness, being at the mercy of others. Stolz is very good as a type of "lonely wolf", forced to embarrass dependence on his girlfriend (Helen Hunt); Wesley Snipes is okay as a former man whose family is falling apart; but William Forsythe takes the cake as a tough guy determined to pay someone to take his independence. <br /> <br /> See this movie.
