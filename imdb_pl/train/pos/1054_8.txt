If you want mindless action, hot chick and post-apocalyptic Seattle view, this is the program for you! <br /> <br /> The Dark Angel concept is nothing new (in fact there is controversy whether James Cameron stole the idea from the book), but I watch every hour from Tuesday to the end. <br /> <br /> Jessica Alba smokes, and Max's friends (original Cindy, Kendra) are just a shot. <br /> <br /> The fight scenes are getting better, but the dialogues between Original Cindy and Max have to be a little better (slang sounds forced and sounds like someone in the suburb wrote it). <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Dark Angel is a great guilty pleasure filled with everything that an action fan could ask for, but if you're looking for a strong, award-winning drama, watch "The West Wing" or something.
