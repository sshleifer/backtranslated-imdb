Although this movie is not classic in any episode, it is very funny, as I remember. I saw it about 15 years ago in HBO and I loved this movie. He was written by the same guy who wrote and directed "Arthur," and though he's not as entertaining as the movie, he shows the potential that Steve Gordon achieved thanks to "Arthur."
