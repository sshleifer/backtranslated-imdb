I am certainly happy that a film about the incredible history of Carl Brashear was made. As in the Civil Rights era, Brashear became an inspiration for people from all minority groups who did not want to be satisfied with the expected status. <br /> <br /> Brashear, played by Cuba Gooding, Jr. leading the life he chose. Very similar to Jackie Robinson, who integrated baseball and made him stick to his character and behavior. Like Brashear, Gooding knows that he does not want the life of his grandfather, which his father Carl Lumbly and Lumbly had, makes it really clear that he draws more from life than he has. <br /> <br /> But while Harry Truman has integrated the Armed Services after World War II, the navy still has its limitations. A black man can only be a cook or an officer officer, the real parts of the fight are refused. This is not good enough for Gooding, who is seeking to become a deep sea navigator. <br /> <br /> Once at a diving school in Bayonne, New Jersey, Gooding gets it all, mainly thanks to the Chief Executive responsible, Robert DeNiro. DeNiro may have some remnants of prejudice, but he is still a hero and the one who can inspire you if you can go through racial division. <br /> <br /> The best thing about Men Of Honor is the chemistry between DeNiro and Gooding. They certainly come from different places, but when they get to know each other, both turn out to be Men Of Honor. <br /> <br /> Other good performances to watch out for are Charlize Theron as the wife of DeNiro and Hal Holbrook as the head of the diving school the guy the Navy wants you to retreat for the reasons you see. <br /> <br /> Men Of Honor is an inspirational story about people who have the courage to save and are able to change.
