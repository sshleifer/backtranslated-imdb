Yes, the cameras were in the right place and time. It is interesting how a world leader (like Chavez) who supports poor people in his country can be so poorly rated in the US. His worst "sin", in my opinion, cares for those who are at the bottom of the barrel. What could be so bad? I have always been fascinated by the US government + media response to Fidel Castro. Initially, Castro was a good guy (around 1959), when he replaced Batista. Soon, however, Castro began to transform corporations in Cuba into the needs of poor, not fat, cats. We are a decent country, but why do our media and government have such a problem with sharing with the poor? If these guys are "dictators," then we could use more "dictatorships", especially where the poorest of the poor live in the world.
