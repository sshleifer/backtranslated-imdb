I can only say that if you do not fall in love with Big and Little Edie after watching this movie, you're not human! Even after seeing him for the first time, I was addicted. It is a hypnotizing experience that is difficult to describe, as other fans will surely confirm. After seeing this, you will cry thinking that these two wonderful ladies are not with us anymore. At least we have the Gray Gardens to remember them! I think that we all miss fierce independence for which both ladies have been blessed. Although I've always admired Jackie Onassis Kennedy, it does not stay in your heart like Big and Little Edie do. What a rare feast for such people; I just wish I had!
