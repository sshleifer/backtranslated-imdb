Isaac Albeniza Iberia Suite Masterpiece. Approaching the century, Saura has gathered an unprecedented wealth of talents from the Spanish community of performing arts to create this quintessential love of his homeland. Twelve "impressions" of the set are presented without a narrative in a harsh environment, which allows you to explode the power of each performance in front of the Saury camera. Creative use of large apartments and mirrors, moved throughout the set, combined with screens, shadows, fire, rain and back projection, adds great dramatic effects to a variety of songs, dance and instrumental performances. The program includes photographs of Albeniza, combining the passion of music with its great creator. Saura covers all Spaniards on stage from the beautiful elegance of older flamenco dancers in traditional costumes to children happily dancing with their instructors.
