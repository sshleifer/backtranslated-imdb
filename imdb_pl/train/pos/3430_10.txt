I caught it at a screening at the Sundance Film Festival and I was in Awe over the absolute power of this film. It is a study of the psychological effects for our brave soldiers who join the army hoping to protect and serve our country with honor, as well as to be looked after by our government for it. The film presents psychological changes that take place in the camp for soldiers, when soldiers become "killers for their country", and after returning home, they are introduced into war and subsequent effects. It also presents the impact of killing on the human psyche. He pays tribute to soldiers and never criticizes soldiers unlike other films, instead he criticizes a system that is not prepared and does not care for all the physical and psychological needs of returned veterinarians. <br /> <br /> This movie is powerful, moving, emotional and provocative. It is a call to arms to support our troops not only by buying stickers and going to parades, but also by listening to them and supporting changes in the way they care for their health and well-being after killing. <br /> <br /> The best movie so far, **** / ****
