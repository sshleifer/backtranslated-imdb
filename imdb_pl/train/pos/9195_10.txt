I do not give a movie or series ten very often, but this concert has moved my nerves in a way no other program has. I found the whole series on mysoju.com and thought that the premise looks interesting, so I looked at it. I was not disappointed with what I saw; I have been moved. This story remains on the delicate side, because the main characters take us through the scenes. Sumire Iwaya, played intentionally by Koyuki, shows us human nature because he wants problems not to be shown. Nobody really wants to show their soul to a prospective partner. Instead, he replaces a man played by charming Matsumoto Jun as a pet. This animal is like any other creature that we consider a pet. Difference; he can take revenge in the same way, in the end Momo is a man, not a dog. Because he is treated like a pet, he reacts to situations in which a dog can react. He spends time with a new boyfriend, Momo becomes jealous. When she realizes that her pet is not just a pet, the sexual tension between them begins to be dense - Momo is a wonderful dance. Her thinking is slowly changing when we begin to look at his own thoughts. Matsumoto takes us from seeing a character who is very one-dimensional at the beginning, two-dimensional, when we see him as a dancer, to a three-dimensional figure, when we see him begin falling on his master as a human rather than a dog. In my opinion, it's worth seeing this story to see how this character develops. Plus, Matsumoto plays Momo with such tenderness that you almost start to want her to have her. Nor does he want to think about the future and how their relationship will change, but how does Momo (the name he gives him, what would be his new puppy) say? we both knew that it would not be able to survive. Watch this program with an open mind, it's worth it.
