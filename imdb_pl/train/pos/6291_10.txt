Well, it was certainly an episode of surprise. In this anthology science fiction series, in which all these alien beings, extraordinary events and many Future brushes, this episode would certainly be considered extraordinary. His seemingly irrelevant settings apparently do not convey any morale after the story ends. Or so? Starting with Silent Movie Form, without a recorded dialog, but with musical accompaniment. In this case, it is a soundtrack, not using the organ or piano playing by the viewer. This part of the episode, along with the final section, also allowed for the liberal use of title cards, as in "Old movies". While these titles are a bit exaggerated and exaggerated, they are done on purpose and with love than with any contempt for The Silent Film. <br /> <br /> Veteran Comedy Film Director, Norman Z. McLeod, was a man in a chair for half an hour. He was the director of many of the greatest comedies of all time, in which people like Marx Brothers, W.C. Fields, Harold Lloyd and Danny Kaye. He was not a stranger on television because he did a lot of work on the TV series. <br /> <br /> It seems that he and Mr. Keaton have never worked together before (because I can not find any evidence for that) "but judging by the results of the film, they did it in flying colors! Anyone who managed Keaton was aware that Buster was also a great comedic director and a comedian. He was just as comfortable behind the camera as before him. Their short partnership had to be harmonious, with "giving and being" in the matter of doing things. You can see that many gags were Keaton, revived from his own Silent Picture Days. For example, a gag with folding trousers with Rollos (help from Stanley Adams was done by Keaton and Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle in one of Roller Arbuckle 2, THE GARAGE (1919). This was a clear example of his craft at a glance. <br /> <br /> Buster knew that we are filming our world with the camera, which makes it a two-dimensional image.This one fact is at the very bottom of many gags film production. <br /> <br /> The cast was small and once again it was full Stanley Adams talent veterans was Rollo and was a simple man of Mr. Keaton. Jesse White, an old "Maytag Repair Man", repaired the "Time HJelmet" repair. Gil Lamb, a calm veteran of the RKO Short Comedy series, was a policeman from 1890. James Flavin , George E. Stone, Harry Fleer, Warren Parker and Milton Parsons completed this largely quiet cast. <br /> <br /> Without spilling seeds, let's say yes, there is probably a lesson here that you can learn here He said: "The grass always looks greener on the other side of the fence!" and then "Watch what you ask for, because you can get it!"
