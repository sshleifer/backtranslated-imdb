Before we start, I'm afraid of dentists. This movie gives me creep and even makes me moved. This is what I love in this film. The film is boring. For this purpose, I turn off 3 stars! <br /> <br /> * Spoiler Alert * <br /> <br /> The movie revolves around Dr. Alan Feinstone, who just learned that his wife is cheating on him. He soon begins to hallucinate and begins to torture his patients, killing collaborators, and even torturing his wife to death and killing the man with whom he had an affair. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler * <br /> <br /> The movie is very bloody and bloody. I recommend, if you're up. <br /> <br /> I give this film 7 stars for 10. Dr. Alan Feinstein is not a normal daily dentist!
