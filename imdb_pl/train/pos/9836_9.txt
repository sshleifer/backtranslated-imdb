Although it is not as frightening as its classic antecedent (ZOMBI 2), I really like this one. This is due to faster tempo, better settings and a cool soundtrack from the 80's. It's loaded with action and has the sweet side effects of Lucio Fulci. Zombies do not look as bad as in ZOMBI 2, but they still look good. It has been done quite well, but definitely has its share of cheesy; for example, some zombies move very slowly, while others are as fast as the ninja. some are nosy, while others are funny, but who expects consequences when it comes to Italian horror? There is even a flying zombie head! How is it? Definitely a must see for lovers of gorehounds and zombies. it will probably also satisfy most fans of action movies. Also check Zombi 4.
