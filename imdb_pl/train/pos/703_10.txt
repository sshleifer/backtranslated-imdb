I rated it as only ten because it is as impressive as one 18-year-old can do with a video camera. This is not an epic, but it is very addictive and I have never been bored. If tens of millions of dollars can go to countless bad movies that are poured in a mass, give the director the same amount of money and see what happens. I know that I will set myself up at the local cinema for her first major release. Darn good job and worth the money. What a script! It can be a low budget, but it hits the heck of half of the main images that I've seen lately. Nanavati knows how to tell a story, both in writing and on the screen. Serious feelings for her, I can not wait to see more.
