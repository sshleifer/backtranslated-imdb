From September last year, I borrowed four to six films every week from the Harold Washington library, which boasts an impressive DVD collection. (HWL is really a circulation library: three-quarters of its films are currently being broadcast!) Recently, I was delighted to find short films by David Lynch. Yesterday, knowing little about the animated series, I chose Dumbland. I am here to report that for fans of David Lynch, watching eight episodes is a well spent half hour. <br /> <br /> The most remarkable feature of these short pieces are their soundtracks. Each episode has its own rhythm. Respiratory and digestive systems provide impacts. Outrageous voices accentuate the breaks. Physical violence provides bits. The birds chirping and the buzzing sockets rush along the edge. Many other elements fill the orchestra. The pace of raw animation is often synchronized with the sound, but the soundtrack itself struck me as Lynch's main interest in creating and spreading this work. In a sense, these eight shorts are a unique Lwynian rhythm. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the situations are strange, ugly, deep, stupid and funny as hell. And there is enough space in them to think about how absurd can people be. I can not say I will look at the collection again, but for anyone who has enjoyed the moves that are suites in the Inland Empire, Dumbland is worth half an hour of your time.
