This movie surprised me when he started in a cafe in Arizona and Richard Grieco, (Rex), "Dead Easy", "04, he decides to have something to eat and gets hot and takes a very hot sexy waitress. While Rex leaves the cafe, he sees a state soldier and asks him: "ARE YOU FAST?" And then hell broke loose in many ways. Nancy Allen (Maggie Hewitt), "Dressed to Kill", "80", is a TV reporter and is always looking for messages to broadcast. Maggie appears in the hot tub, and Rex calls her to tell her that she wants to show up in the western style with the best local policeman in the city. It's a different movie, but Nancy Allen and Richard Grieco are the only actors who help this picture TOGETHER!
