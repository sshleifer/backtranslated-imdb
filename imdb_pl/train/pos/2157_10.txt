Fine. As you can see, this is one of my favorite, if not favorite, movies. It's a character drama that's totally funny. The main character is a businessman who got stuck in the "the same, different day" mentality. He sees a woman who looks melancholically every day through the window of a dance studio and wonders about her and decides to find out more about her. He decides to join the dance class to find out that he is not an instructor. From there, it involves four other dancers and learns to enjoy dancing, as well as learn about a mysterious woman. <br /> <br /> There is no free (or no) sex in how a small group of people learn how to develop and develop friendships. <br /> <br /> This movie has been reworked with Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez, and the new, though attractive, nowhere is as pleasant as the original. The film never became great in America because it did not qualify for the Oscars because it was broadcast on television in Japan (films can not be released on TV or are disqualified for Oscar nominations). He won many awards in Japan for the best film, cast, director, etc. for his Oscar winners.
