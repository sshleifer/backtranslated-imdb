some people think that the second series was where scooby was ruined ... I totally disagree. the quality of the shows did not go up or down, did not win, win my opinion, as a very good chrecter. and saw the survey at jumpedtheshark.com 72% of people said that the second series of scrappys is the fall of scoob√≥w. So the charges said yes, but 28% still can not be wrong. I like the way most episodes focused on comedy. the same 5 people / dogs solving the puzzle in the same formula.scrappy was a breath of fresh air to the show. Sure, some people have tuned in, but when the unfortunate data of DOUBLED has been entered. Return to the show. All episodes and episodes were very funny. I was intrigued by yabba and shorts. But at the end of the day it's a question of whether you like scrappy or not, it's a question of opinion, it's certainly not a fact. But in my OPINION it was a great series that gave rise to fatigue by showing a new formula and lease of life.
