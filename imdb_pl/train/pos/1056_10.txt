If someone can say that he is wrong, he is beyond me. I loved this program before I saw it. For 3 reasons: 1. History intrigued me, 2. Jessica Alba and 3. James Cameron! Ignore bad comments and watch the first season before you think it's bad because I know that if you watch the first season, you'll love it and get out and buy season 1 and season 2 on DVD, then join the campaign to produce the Season 3! <br /> <br /> I hate Fox and I am sure that many of you "Dark Angel" also hates them. They have something to do with Canning Good Shows! Not everyone agrees?
