I'm only 11 years old, but I discovered Full House when I was five and watched him until the age of seven. Then I grew up and came to the conclusion that Full House can wait and that I have "more important" things to do. Besides, there was also the fact that my younger brother, who had been watching me faithfully with me for the past two years, did not like him, considering it to be "girlish". <br /> <br /> Then I realized that every afternoon at 5 pm it was 23 and I became addicted again. Full House made me laugh and cry. I realized how cool it would be if our world was like the world of Full House plus my mother. I've heard people say that Full House is tacky and unbelievable. But look at the big picture: three girls whose mother was killed by a drunk driver. The sisters are fighting and hurting their feelings. Three men who live with girls can sometimes get into quarrels. What is more real than this? <br /> <br /> If something happened, the show picked me up when I fell, and lifted me higher when I thought I was in a point of happiness. I took out a hyena on display and I became very obsessed with Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen. (Of course, Hilary Duff now took the place, but they were literally the sweetest children I've ever seen, they're great actresses and they seem to be very nice people.
