I saw it in the theater in the early seventies. The most memorable and frightening scene is that the German army is attacking yellow mustard gas for the first time. The Germans and their horses are covered from head to toe (or hooves) with amazing protective suits. Experienced British soldiers have gas masks (only) and once again are waiting for clouds of gas and German attackers. The gas clouds are moving closer and closer, eventually shielding the British defenders. The Germans are slowly moving forward threateningly in their terrifying outfit. Suddenly the cry of the defenders ... This gas is like no other, which they experienced before ... <br /> <br /> Now you know why I have remembered this scene for the last 30 years I'm shaking, I think you'll be too!
