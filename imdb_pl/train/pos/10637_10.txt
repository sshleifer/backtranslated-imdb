Harem Suare is the best movie I've seen in 2000. Bravo Ferzan Ozpetek. Sensuously shot and stunningly portrayed by Harem, Suare is a bold movie that touches inter-racial romance, which is such a taboo in Hollywood. Women of all shapes, sizes and colors fill the film. Detached from the outside world, women play with each other, telling stories about intrigue, rivalry and jealousy in their ranks.
