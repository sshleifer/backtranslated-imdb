Colorful western. <br /> <br /> The Wyoming cowboy James Stewart approaches the Yukon Territory to dig gold, sell his oxen, and try to make an appointment with the pretty owner of the Ruth Roman salon if he can shake the tail of the crook sheriff John McIntire who wants Stewart's cattle. Beautiful photos as part of the cooperation of William Fritzsche and Bill Daniels. Adventure Technicolor from Universal-International directed by Anthony Mann. <br /> <br /> With Corinne Calvet, Connie Gilchrist and Walter Brennan as Stewart's midfielder.
