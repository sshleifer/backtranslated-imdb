Mary Tyler Moore and Valerie Harper can still turn the world with their smiles. The combined talent of these two great stars makes this combination of reunion / newstart work. Watch it and wait for it to hit sixty! Mary opposes a youth-oriented society with grace and grace. A bit of drama adds 2000 realism. Subsequent TV series would expand new characters and give us the opportunity to see Lou Grant, Phyllis, Sue Ann, Murray and Georgette!
