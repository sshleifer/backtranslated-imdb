It seems that there are only two types of reviews of the film on the web. Those who hate him and curse the name of Ralph Bakshis, and they love them, call it a genius work. I'm willing to be inside. I am forced to agree with most critics of this film (eg cruel felling of stories, bad rotoscoped charecters, over acting etc. ...) But still, I still love this movie. Rotoscoping (when done correctly) adds an amazing, realistic dimension to charecters, and the final battle scene at the end of the movie is fantastic. The surreal scenes, when nineriders chase Frodo, are stylish and well made, and the musical score ... magical. Unfortunately, the movie about the bad spots is overweight, but if you manage to ignore it, it's a great movie. <br /> <br /> (No doubt I'll be lynched by the angry crowd of people who hate this movie after writing this review, well, that's life)
