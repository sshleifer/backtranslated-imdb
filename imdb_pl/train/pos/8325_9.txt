I loved the idea of ​​this movie from the moment I saw the trailer for the first time. Einstein has always been one of my heroes, and his image as a kind, playful, somewhat crazy genius was enough to make a movie. An additional Matthau spice like Einstein made it even better. <br /> <br /> The story is pure fantasy but delightful. A car mechanic falls in love with a beautiful woman who is Einstein's niece. With the help of four Physics Fathers Fairy Ed, he sets off on a journey to win Catherine's heart. Cast a jealous fiancé (who is an example of the worst experimental psychology) and Eisenhower into the mix, and you will have pure fun. <br /> <br /> The movie is filled with great character actors and delightfully sweet and daffy performances. Walter Matthau plays Einstein as a malicious imp; Cupid with slide rule. Tim Robbins is great captivating because Ed and Meg Ryan are taking a step closer to their normal level of rom-com. Stephen Fry is joy as "RRRatman" and Ryan's fiancé; who does not have a single romantic bone in his body. <br /> <br /> The movie has fallen below most radars, but it is a great treasure that does not solidify with repeated views. It offers the highest quality writing and performances and is a delicate feast in less than a delicate world.
