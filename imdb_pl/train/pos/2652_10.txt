Why can not more directors create horror movies like "The Shining" these days? There is a simple answer to this: modern directors are not Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick proved once and for all that he is really one of the greatest directors and authors of all time. <br /> <br /> So the plot is quite simple. A man named Jack Torrance (played splendidly by Jack Nicholson) and his family move to a large, quiet hotel to watch over him out of season. The thing is that the previous hotel caretaker brutally murdered his wife and two girls. What follows is the easiest way to summarize the title of the movie, but you have to watch it to see what I mean. <br /> <br /> This is the first movie from a very long time, which seems to me "scary" It's a bit seriously confused things, but in a good way. One of the things that contributes to the growth of fear is incredible music. Music was the main part of Kubrick's films (2001: A Space Oddssey and A Clockwork Orange, just to name a few) and it definitely is not disappointing. The result sets the tone completely and this movie would not be the same without it. <br /> <br /> Finally, I have to comment on Nicholson's legendary performance. Jack is terrifyingly convincing as a crazy killer. In fact, only his eyes steal a few scenes of this film. This is the highest-class game you need to believe. <br /> <br /> There will never be a horror that would suit that. TEAR. Stanley.
