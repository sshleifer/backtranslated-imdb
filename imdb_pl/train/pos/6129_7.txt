Note that I did not say it is better ... just nicer. Lack of social commentary and realism helps in maintaining traffic. <br /> <br /> I was somewhat surprised that it was not Troma's film, because it has all the trademarks of Troma, including spitting acid liquids, wisecracks from the villain after each murder, an absurd rape scene on the bathtubs (which is quite difficult to upset, because the rapist is a snowman) and stupid alternate. <br /> <br /> There is a lot to love: <br /> <br /> 1. A snowman, who is said to have no legs or feet, goes on a police cruiser around the city. <br /> <br /> 2. Even if it is to be near (or below) zero, no one shows a breath and there are no signs of exhaling the car while driving. <br /> <br /> 3. Snow reminds more flocking or styrofoam nuts than actual snow. <br /> <br /> 4. Teenage teenager is enjoying her boyfriend only a few hours after her brother is murdered murdered. He tells him to break into the sheriff's house, all places to get him. But first he tells him that he must build a nice fire in the fireplace and open the wine. <br /> <br /> 5. After Jake's teenage head is cut off by a runner, his father argues with the sheriff about whether Tommy, the sheriff's son, has something to do with it. The sheriff claims Tommy would not fight Jake because Jake "is at least two feet taller than Tommy." At this moment, someone in the background calls: "No longer!" <br /> <br /> 6. When the angry snowman finally begins to melt, the sheriff struggles with a flat snowman made of some material for a long time. This is much better than Tarzan's struggle with rubber crocodiles or gladiators grappling with stuffed lions. If I was an actor, I would not be able to retain it at the moment. <br /> <br /> In total, a funny movie. There really is not even enough blood.
