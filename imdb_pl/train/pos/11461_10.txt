In addition to the fact that in all its splendor this film has risen above all my expectations, it's a masterpiece of cinematic portrait portrayal of shitty filters at its best! Paul Johansson and Craig Sheffer show the brothers' conflict with all that is on it. As usual, a woman who understands her true intentions. The end was just as surprising as the murder of Keith Scott by his older brother. <br /> <br /> The scenes in the "land of the Vikings" are as I remember from my early journeys. - Honestly, my strong passion for junk movies makes this movie must have in my never finished collection. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to all people in love with the most amazing brother planted at One Tree Hill. <br /> <br /> -Odin-
