I was drawn to this film the moment I saw his preview on the Oscar night. When I read about Kay Pollak, I was addicted. We Americans are a sucker for a returning child. <br /> <br /> I understand that this movie was a huge drawing in Sweden. As a very provincial American, I can only speculate on the cause. Perhaps because of the provocative joke Lena is making at the beginning of the film and other social comments, maybe because of the main message that I think has the same appeal everywhere in prosperous societies. <br /> <br /> The message of this movie for me is the same as in the movie Titanic. Life is short people and if you really know, it's all we have. You can take it at any time. Is not it a shame that we spend so much time hiding behind the walls separating us from other people because we are so scared of being hurt? Breaking the walls is painful, but the feeling of living lies on the other side of these miserable walls. It's worth to feel alive. Give and receive. So start living NOW. <br /> <br /> Many people criticize this film for lack of characteristics and other disadvantages. I say that you are all pseudo-sophisticated. Gather people, this is a parable, a fairy tale for wealthy people from the West who are materially rich, but whose souls are in extreme poverty. <br /> <br /> Join the choir or band or help build a flat or give out food to those who are less fortunate than you. Develop some joy and make the world a better place, provided you go out and associate with your neighbor. Writing a check is not enough. By the way, we are a social species. Even the most modest of your neighbors can affect you in a way you have never thought possible. <br /> <br /> Strict individuality has its place, but it is overpriced.
