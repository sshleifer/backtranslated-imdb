Finally, an indie movie that really delivers great scare! I see most of the horrors that appear ... Theatrical, simple on DVD, cable, etc. ... and most of them suck ... some of them are possible to watch ... still less is really good ... Dark remains is one of the good ones. I caught the screening of this film at the South Padre Island Film Festival ... the audience loved it ... and my wife and I loved it! Without actors with names, I assume that the budget for this movie was quite low, but you would not know ... the movie looks fantastic ... acting completely works for the movie ... the story is good ... and the horror is great! While most filmmakers focus only on their fears, they often forget about history and character development, two things that help to more effectively implement fear. Brian Avenet-Bradley needs to know that this character and history are important. It develops to the extent that you take care of the characters, know the heroes, and are therefore more terrified when they are in danger. <br /> <br /> Watching horrors that cost between $ 80 million and $ 5,000 to do, I consider "Dark Remains" to be one of those gems. Check out this movie!
