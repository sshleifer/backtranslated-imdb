Wow. I saw it last night and I still can not help feeling how good it was. Each character felt so real (though most of them were small, selfish **), and the bizarre story - a middle-aged widow begins to spin around a skinny boy - felt completely convincing. Best performances all over the world, but hats off to Daniel Craig with Anne Reid and Our Friends in the North (the latter is another David Thewlis). <br /> <br /> And director Roger Michell? It's as far away from Notting Hill as possible. Thank God. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie !!!
