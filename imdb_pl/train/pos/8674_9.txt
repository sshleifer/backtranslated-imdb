This is a very typical shortcut from Tom and Jerry - the situation is designed, conflict arises and chaos arises. Characters behave in a proper way, natural tensions between different characters lead to general chaos. The best (and the funniest) part is the situation where the peace treaty is in force and is respected - many strange miracles appear before your eyes. A word of warning - it is most unwise to let Tom help you perform a routine cleansing! Highly recommended.
