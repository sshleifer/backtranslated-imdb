Every time you think you have a Deathtrap handle, another turn of action appears. It's best to just sit back and enjoy the ride on it. Best known for his kiss on the screen between Michael Caine and Christopher Reeve (who unfortunately was cut off from the television version that I saw), this movie has much more to command. <br /> <br /> Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine) is a very unhappy man. Once a successful playwright, his last few plays on Broadway fell. And while his wife Myra (Dyan Cannon) is nothing but support, both in monetary and emotional terms, she does little to make Sidney feel better. To add insults to the injury, the young playwright, Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve), just sent Sidney the art to watch. It's the first Anderson, and Sidney sees that the young man is a talented writer. He jokes his wife that he should invite Anderson, kill him and present the game as his own. At first he laughs at him, but when Sidney actually invites Anderson to dinner, he worries that he can really put his program into action. And her concerns can be justified ... <br /> <br /> It's a great scenario. There are twists and turns in the story, and when you get to the end, they come faster and more furiously. This is the kind of movie that from the very beginning has you on the edge of the chair and keeps you on all the time. An absolute masterpiece of tension and mystery. <br /> <br /> Acting is perfect. Caine gives his usual excellent performance and is a talent for playing a cultured, sophisticated and intellectual man. Reeve also gives an excellent representation of a man who is not nearly as open or innocent as it seems. Cannon's madness works well for Myra. And Irene Worth gives a nice performance as a nosy neighbor who is also a medium. <br /> <br /> It's an ending movie that you would never have expected, and repeated observations help you pick up things that were not there before. watching. Unknown classic, which is unfortunately remembered only on the stage, which at that time stirred up some impressions - and it is a real shame.
