I saw the movie when I was young, and I remembered it as one of the first movies I really enjoyed, which were not action movies or comedies. So in later years, I decided to watch it again and see if it was just nostalgia, if there really was anything in this movie. To my surprise, the film met all my expectations. It's a great movie. Emotional in the right amount, some jokes, nice songs (though not great, and that really explains why I do not remember that it was a musical) and in general, very useful for my time. I was surprised because the last films from my childhood that I came back did not even meet my minimum requirements for a decent movie, and yet this movie, which I saw for the first time in the second grade, caused me to cry today, just like when I cried. Maybe because my dog ​​died recently or maybe not, but the important thing is that I felt it and that's why filmmakers make films (of course, and money). Yes, there are continuity defects. Yes, the script has holes, but it does not matter. The film itself is funny and intelligent. So do not be fooled by cynical people who are always looking for bad things in life because nothing is perfect, and this movie gets 10 because it is not perfect. He gets 10 simply because I felt.
