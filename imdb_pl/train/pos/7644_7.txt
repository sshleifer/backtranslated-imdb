Jim Belushi is wonderful as "Average Joe" who has 15 minutes in "The Twilight Zone". Michael Cane is a mysterious bartender who not only listens to the "history" of Belushi, but has a "cure" for all problems of the middle class Belushi: a magic elixir that evokes an avalanche of changes in Belushi's life. br /> Flashbacks show 15 years of terrible shame at causing defeat in the Baseball Championship. Belushi continues his "pitiful life", seemingly happy, but he always wonders "what if ..." In a few days, Belushi experiences "another" life, a huge success, admired by others equal measure. <br /> <br /> It is not quite "It's A Wonderful Life", but some elements are similar and very endearing. The "ending" is predictable, but still satisfying. Watch out for the very young Cortney Cox in the part of "deadly attractiveness" - just like other women. A very nice movie!
