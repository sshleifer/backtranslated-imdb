This movie is amazing. If you have a chance, look at this. Although, warning, you will cry with your eyes. I do it every time I see it, and I have it and have watched it many times. The performances are outstanding. He deals with darkness, pain and loss, but there is hope. This movie made me look at the world differently: according to my English teacher - substitute experience. Also, if you have seen it, pay attention to the interesting use of shadows and light. The house is a phenomenal movie and I rate it as 10/10 - for real - because of the excellent acting, amazing story and moving dialogue. Very tight, very moving. He does not give all the answers, but he does a lot of good things about humanity
