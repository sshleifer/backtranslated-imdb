Short, but long enough, Cat Soup is a very wild trip to watch. One day I just searched my list on demand in the anime section and stumbled upon it and decided to watch it. I spent all the time basically sitting with jaw gaping. All the time I was either free of thoughts, or I had a fleeting flight that screamed "Turn OFF !!!". But I do not. And indeed, I'm glad I did it. <br /> <br /> The animation is stunning. Very artistic, strange and dark. Personally, I loved this amazing animation, but the seemingly empty story behind it is equally convincing for me. <br /> <br /> A young boy - well, a cat - is looking for his sister's soul. In the first part, she is sick in bed and soon she is paid by a kind of grim reaper. Her soul is divided in half. One is recovered by the boy and the other is lost. <br /> <br /> Then the rest of the movie is a bit lost to me, honestly. I expect them to come back, and their world ... maybe it is slowly falling apart? Perhaps her lack of soul is the answer for this because the rest of the film contains different stages in which the world is located. First there is a great flood, and then it dries up into a bleak desert, and then everything freezes (thanks or what is God or fate, as you'll see). Then I believe that they find the soul of my sister in the form of an orange flower. After that, the whole world disappears. Haha, I do not understand it completely, but every time I move my back. <br /> <br /> Despite the seemingly random scenes, I'm sure there is a deeper message behind it, if you look at it enough and do some research. Personally, I love such monsters and would love to spend time to understand it. But for some people this is not their cup of tea. It's very disturbing, so if you like your simple anime, this is not a movie for you. However, if you have an open mind, I highly recommend this movie.
