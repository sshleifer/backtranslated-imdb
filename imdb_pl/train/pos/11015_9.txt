This film was directed by Renny Harlin, a Finnish miracle. Stallone is Gabe Walker. Cat and Mouse in the mountains with ruthless terrorists. Renny Harlin knows how to direct the action movie. Stallone needed this role to get back on track. Snow Mountain is a very good place for an action movie and it is better to make a movie where there is snow, ice, cold weather and bad weather than a Finnish man. The action is good! The music in the film is spectacular. The bad guy is John Litghow, other stars Micheal Rooker (Portrait of the serial killer), Janine Turner (Strong Medicine). It's placed in a beautiful place and it's a very exciting movie. Overall dobry filmu **** / ***** <br /> <br /> Remember Extreme ääliöt: special collector's edition with good additions. Soon in Finland, go straight to the video.
