This is not a bad movie with Sanders, Barrie, Hale, Cowen, Hamilton, Gargan, Fitzgerald, and even Willie Best we could be either with Charlie Chan, Moto, Falcon, Blackie, Holmes or Saint etc. In other words, have the chance to spend the next hour in accompanied by a few old friends, from ordinary to polite, murdering and murdering - always a pleasure in my book. <br /> <br /> Barrie is a boiled dame to avenge and cleanse her framed and dead father, a police detective, planning and carrying out a series of homicide kills with her coterie. Which would certainly have the opposite effect! Sanders joins the party simply by dancing at the right club in the right place in the right city at the right time, with the right lighting falling on him and the first killer (at the right time!) And killing him. > <br /> History and acting are fine, the only objection I have is the end towards the end of a hasty and almost funny discovery, who was the evil genius (Waldeman) - did they almost forget about its importance in the plot? That said, a solid entry in the series.
