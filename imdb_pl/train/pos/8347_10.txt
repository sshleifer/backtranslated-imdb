Maybe I'm too generous with the rating ... but I just love this movie! I've seen it so many times, but every time I see it, I fall in love with it anew. It is simply a simple romantic comedy in which nothing great or monumental happens. But I am a great romantic and this film * is * romantic. I love Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins, and Walter Mathau is so funny. Scientists make me laugh so much ... I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who has not seen it. It's such a clean, good movie - and these are so rare now! My 20-year-old brother also likes this movie, so it's not just a movie. ;-) I recommend it if you want to laugh, or you are just lonely and you have to * watch * romance, if you can not participate in one yourself. That's good!
