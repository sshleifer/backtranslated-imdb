This animated movie is a masterpiece! Narration, music, animation and story are remarkable. My girlfriend and I saw it a second time and got more insight from her. We invited several friends to see the Spirit with us and they loved it. When I asked them to come to see it, they thought it was a movie about horses, but then they realized that it was more than that. I liked Esperanza, Spirit, Rain and Lil 'Creek, which reminds me of Nathan Chasing, who is Smiles A Lot in Dances With Wolves. The spirit has deep symbolic meanings and metaphors that I found to be strong and inspiring. <br /> <br /> I saw the Spirit for the third time and I want to see him again. The "spirit" enjoyed me enormously because his image of the American Indians is realistic, dignified and non-stereotypical, in contrast to the film "Road to El Dorado", which was a complete farce, because it depicted American Indians in a disrespectful and stereotypical way. But Dreamworks bought back, making Spirit a great movie that I thought was acceptable! I hope they will continue to create more animated films, such as Spirit, and would like to see sequels or spinoffs to Spirit if they are done with respect and without stereotyping American Indians. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it to others who have an open mind to go and pay to see the Spirit: Stallion Cimarron.
