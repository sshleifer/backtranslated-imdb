As a young teenager at the time, Airwolf was an obligatory viewer for a generation that wanted their "cowboys and Indians" to have amazing gadgets and explosions. <br /> <br /> In many respects the show was essentially a knight Rider in the sky: a similar comic technology, a central figure who was essentially a loner and reflects the concept of one man who makes a difference. <br /> <br /> But in other, important ways, it was thematically very different from Knight Rider, Street Hawk, The A-Team and other action shows of those times. First of all, the premise of the series is not based on the desire to help the needy, but on having Airwolf by Stringfellow Hawke for essentially selfish reasons (as an attempt to find a brother MIA, St. John). And then a dark edge appears, basing the series firmly in the context of the Cold War in the 1980s, along with Soviet espionage and dictators from Central America, not to mention the enemy within. Of course, Team A constantly appealed to Vietnam and the status of the team as refugees, but generally it was done with a light touch and was rarely crucial for the action itself. With Airwolf, the intrigue was the key to the tone and direction of the concert - although it was (unreasonably) diluted with the continuation of the series. <br /> <br /> In retrospect, the setting of the Cold War clearly dates the series, many stories are creaky and invented, and much of what Airwolf does is clearly unbelievable even with today's technology. But that is not the point. Airwolf was great fun, he tried to tell interesting stories without relying solely on the big sequences of action, and that did not make everything a miracle, assuring that no one died. Sometimes it failed, but often it worked great - and on a television budget. <br /> <br /> For British readers DMAX (Sky channel 155) just started (January 2008) daily replays of Airwolf. Set your Sky + box to this outburst of the past - we may even get a converted, replanted (and unfortunately much worse) fourth season, which to my knowledge has never been shown in the UK before.
