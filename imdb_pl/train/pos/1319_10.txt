This movie is great fun. I recommend that you look at it yourself and then watch it again with your friends. I did yesterday evening and it was fascinating how well Norma Khouri could attract everyone to her world! I felt a bit strange watching my friends pass the same roller coaster as I did the first time. But everyone thanked me and liked the movie. You know, it's a great movie if you spend 2 hours after the movie, telling about the movie! <br /> <br /> I once saw a cheater almost at Norma Khouri level, but there is no place near the same size. He cheated the very credulous and rich people in my old Berkeley CA A.A. a group in which everyone trusts everyone else. He "sponsored" only people who seemed to be doing very well. Who knew that he would have stolen over 100,000 (In 1987, When It Was Real Money), after he stayed in the city for only 1 month. His victims were very fragile because they were in the first month or week of sobriety. He was angry with a big laugh and a big smile on his face. <br /> <br /> The above crime is nothing compared to what Norma Khouri did with her old neighbor. But I do not want to reveal anything. <br /> <br /> I just found this one night on the movie channel late at night, "I think Showtim." It is always the most experience for movie fans to completely cheat to see something and enrage the mind. Just drag your friends to see it and tell them nothing. It's a very funny movie, it moves quickly and it never bores you. <br /> <br /> This should be an international classic forever. I believe that all great films will eventually reach the top. The time will be very good for this movie. I am sorry but nobody has heard about it yet, in some respects it makes surprises even better. <br /> <br /> The director and editor were fantastic. They deserved to win the best document. <br /> <br /> SEE THIS FILM!
