A wonderful and fascinating drama about the hunt for the famous Russian serial killer Andrea Chikatilo. A wonderful performance by Stephen Rei, like a forensic investigator who thinks that the biggest obstacle to his progress is the Russian government, in particular former members of the Communist Party who want to keep a closed society. <br /> <br /> The film has a theme about the fall of communist society, and progress in the killer hunting reflects the progress in the social and political changes in Russia, which is subtly cross-sectional. There is a conflict between the old ways and new ways, and they are represented by two points of view of Rei Superior (played by Donald Sutherland) and Rei himself. They are initially polarized, and Sutherland "high" in the system looking down, and Rea "low" to the ground, looking up. However, they have a common cause? catch a serial killer. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, the relationship between the two develops, and the tension gradually decreases, until at the end of the movie Rea and Sutherland and Rea and Sutherland respect each other, the killer is captured and Glasnost symbolically arrives. An excellent scenario. <br /> <br /> Another merit in the Sutherland performance, which is wonderful and lovable, Jeffrey DeMunn as the killer we despise, but we can not hate, and Max Von Sydow, who is convincing as a modest psychologist who risks his reputation, to help.
