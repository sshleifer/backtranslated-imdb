Who has no unresolved problems with parents? And which parents do not have unsolved problems? <br /> <br /> I know it sounds hard. But it's game for laughter in the movie, so that both comedy is better and drama. I've always liked Paul Reiser and Peter Falk, and although I was a bit worried that their star traits could be too big for a small movie, I was charmed from the first scene. <br /> <br /> The discoveries made by the son about his father as a person were especially funny. And the monologue of Peter Falk about being hard working, devoting herself to father and husband was a perfect point of balance. If this scene did not work so well, the film would look much less nuanced and the character much less interesting. <br /> <br /> Nicely done, Paul and Peter!
