Artemisia Gentileschi, daughter of Orazio Gentileschi, introduced the painter's early promise. Artemisia, taught by her father, was born in an era that denied gifted women the right to see their work done in addition to the art created by men. Her tragic life is described in this biographical film, directed and co-written by Agnes Merlik. <br /> <br /> After reading the novel "The Passion of Artemisia" by Susan Vreeland, we made we have examined the woman's life, her work and heritage. We also read "Artemisia Gentileschi" by Mary Garrard, which should be a must read for all lovers of art. <br /> <br /> "Artemisia" presents the fictionalized facts we have read about the early life of a young woman as she begins to paint. It was clearly influenced by the work of her father, Caravaggio, Agostino Tassi and other Florentine painters of that period. Her relationship and romance with Tassi is the basis of the film. Artemisia, unfortunately, could not go as far as she could because of prejudices against women in art. Nor did it help trigger a scandal in which she was accused of being raped by Tassi. She had to go to Rome to distance herself from this unhappy time of her life. <br /> <br /> Valentina Cervi is doing beautiful Artemisia. She is a wonderful being who woke up manhood. Michel Serrault plays Orazio, her father. Miki Maojlovic is seen as Tassi, the man who wanted Artemisia, but found himself in prison. Emmanuelle Devos appears for a moment. <br /> <br /> The film has a glossy finish that Benoit Delhomme gives in all its glory. Scenic places of the film offer an idea of ​​what inspired this school of painting to be shown on canvases. Krishna Levy's music serves well what we see. Agnes Merlik has certainly directed her hand showing her own visual style.
