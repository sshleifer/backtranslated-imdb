I really liked this movie. Kurt manages to act without speaking, allowing moments to speak for himself. He does not have to verbalize or rationalize his actions, he simply decides and takes action. It is supported by a good cast of actors and scenery, and is able to show us the more human side of the soldiers without entering into cunning.
