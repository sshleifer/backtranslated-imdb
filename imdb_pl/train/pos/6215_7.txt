Although I'm not a huge fan of musicals, I loved the films of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, because they are so much fun. Sure, they can be a bit bizarre, but even if you know what's going to happen, they're still happy about watching. Still, I was a little disappointed with this trip. Part of it was due to the fact that this movie does not have a great cast that you saw in TOP HAT or WE HAVE DANCE. Without Edward Everett Horton or Eric Blore, the movie seems to be a bit lacking - especially in the "fun" section. The stupid antics of these supporting actors have given other charm movies that you simply will not get with FOLLOW THE FLEET. In addition, unlike the usual character played by Astaire, this one is more of a jerk - because his fat head makes Rogers trouble again. As a result, it is much harder to like him or see him meet at the end of the movie. Plus, although the music was written by Irving Berlin, the songs simply do not seem so unforgettable. In fact, none of the songs was so special and I can not remember any of them, even though I just watched the movie. Although it is still a nice and valuable movie, it just lacks the glow and magic of some other movies. Good, but far from great.
