First of all, I would say that I remember somehow how I saw this movie in my early childhood, I could not read the subtitles and thought that Sonny Chiba was Sean Connery. But I really liked the idea. If you can not at least partially suspend your adult skepticism and embrace your inner seventh, you can avoid this movie. Having said that, after watching the restored version of the 137-minute DVD, I must say that I liked it, although not as much as when I was seven (I remembered the ending). <br /> <br /> There are some aspects of the film that deserve criticism, the first 15 minutes and the last 15 minutes have some really comical moments, my favorite is the contrast between the scenes played in the last 10 minutes and an interesting selection of background music (listen to lyrics ). <br /> <br /> In the action movie, a lot of attention is devoted to the personal stories of some soldiers and the dynamics of the social team, because the effort associated with time travel brings losses. At the end of the movie, I thought it was a good thing when seven, although I think "relationship" is a bad idea. <br /> <br /> In the action movie there are also many satisfying bloody actions, especially some epic battle scenes between the platoon and hordes of warriors of the Shogun era. The creators of the film assured that as many deaths as possible are bloody and, let us say it humorously. I thought it was a great aspect of the movie when I was a kid, and I'm not ashamed to say I'm still doing it. <br /> <br /> I also like the fact that modern soldiers generally do not spend a movie going on egg shells, trying to avoid changing the space-time continuum, have heavy machine guns, mortars, rocket launchers, tank and helicopter and are infernally inclined to feudal Japan. What I would like to think that any energetic IMDb user would do it in his shoes. <br /> <br /> In short, the films that are worth watching make the viewer regret that there are no more movies with similar assumptions and at the same time offer some important tips on why a film such as GI Samurai is unique.
