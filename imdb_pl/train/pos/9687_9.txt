Talking parrot is not a very ingenious idea for a new movie, but Paulie turns a simple idea into a brilliant, thrilling movie that will delight the whole family. We are able to fill the gap between sentimental trash and cruel severity during the separation of Marie and Pauli, and all the events in the film lead to an extremely satisfying emotional conclusion. Animal training is well done - everyone will be touched when Paulie spreads wings and flies for the first time. Paulie is a great character and should have been more successful, although this movie was not the highlight of 1998, unlike Saving Private Ryan. This one and a half hour will certainly be pleasant and the one you will remember. Paulie's story is moving, sad, happy and interesting - from the moment you see him the first time you connect with your original owner, you'll love to follow him and observe how he learns the friendship and grim reality of life. You can not miss it if you have any heart or emotions. 9/10
