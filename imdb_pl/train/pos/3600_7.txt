At first glance, I expected this movie to be ugly because I thought the plot would be too feminist. But I was wrong. As you probably read in previously published comments, I agree that the feminist part in this movie does not bother. I never knew that the main character exaggerates her position as a woman. It's as if Guzman was presented as someone with a backbone, in contrast to classmates. So I was surprised by this story, in fact I thought it was quite good, except for the predictable end. Perhaps a better idea would be to give the story a radical turn to make the viewer a bit more surprised. <br /> <br /> In addition, I would like to say that Rodriguez gained her respect in the way she put her character down. I really can not explain why, but especially in the love scenes, she convinced me. I think it just looked real. <br /> <br /> I gave him 7 out of 10, just because of the boring last half hour.
