Many classic films of the late 1960s did not retain the ability to disrupt and confront the audience. "In Cold Blood" has not lost a minute of its power. It is exceptionally well made, but it forces the viewer to think. Some people complained not only about the film, but also the source novel Truman Capote "non-fiction" that the central message is insubstantial. This may be true, but it is definitely a case in which the lack of ambiguity does not diminish the film at all. Its refreshing, especially considering today's simplified and manipulative moral drama, to see a movie with a convinced political voice, not afraid to force the audience to consider his point of view. Honestly, I'm not sure if I agree with the central message of the film, but I still admire his audacity. <br /> <br /> Even if you disagree with the message about the death penalty, you can enjoy a lot of cinematography. Operation with two leads is great. Scott Wilson (still one of the most underrated actors in history) cools himself down as a nihilistic leader who uses his charisma to hide his weaknesses. Robert Blake is also chilling in his veins as more obedient to the two and the conscience. His character apparently has the voice of reason, but he is terrified that he may go against Wilson (there is a large amount of homoerotic subtext in part of his character). The photos are wonderful, elegant, but also give the impression that the viewer is watching the document. Add another classic Quincey Jones music and you will receive a masterpiece. (9/10)
