My siblings and I stumbled upon The Champions when our local station broadcast re-hits this summer in the 1970s. We loved it very much. There was something so exotic and mysterious in this, especially compared to the usual American replays (Petticoat Junction, Green Acres ... you have an idea). He had a similar climate to The Avengers (not very surprising because he was also British and in the spy / adventure genre). <br /> <br /> I'd like to see it now - I hope it keeps it. I mentioned this concert to others and no one had ever heard of it, so I wondered if I had imagined his whole existence. But the miracle that is on the web has allowed me to find information on this topic. I hope he finds a new generation of fans.
