The invisible style is more like old Hollywood secrets than horror. The film is a bit slow, but many bizarre images keep it alive and visible. The basic idea of ​​young girls persecuted by something in the basement is old, but good play and production make the film worth watching. The film is distinguished by emotional influence, and certainly not for any clear actions or special effects. I evaluated it on 8 out of 10.
