This movie deserved better. It's great fun, it has some great jokes and sight of gags, some things for "Geeks" among us (And we know who we are), and the effects are really effective. Watching Paul Reubens fart in the face of the Oscar winner is worth the price of the party itself. I never read a series of comics before I saw the movie, but since then. as good as they are, I still recommend MM movie. (Although having Flaming Carrot as a character would be nice too) Greg Kinnear is, oh, amazing as Captain Amazing, and No one else could be Shoveller except William H. Macy. My favorite line in the movie? "We have a blind date with Destiny. It looks like she ordered a lobster. " See this movie. BUY this movie! It's only 5 bucks and some changes in your local Wal-Mart. You thank me You will really. Oh, and Mrs. Garafolo is in it. THIS IS SECURED
