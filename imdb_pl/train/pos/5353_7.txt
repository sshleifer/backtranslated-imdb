Run in 2017 (although it can be easily confused with 1987, judging by hairstyles and clothes), The Running Man sees a versatile good guy Ben Richards (Schwarzeneggar) bound in a crime he did not commit. After a bold break in prison, he is captured and becomes a participant in the brutal game show The Running Man, along with several other escapees and a pretty wife Amber (Maria Conchita Alonso). <br /> <br /> Used by the totalitarian government as a way to control the masses, demonstrations condemn the convicts to a series of colorful (and often very camp) opponents, each of whom has its own unique style of killing: Dynamo shoots with electricity from a special suit, Buzzsaw uses chainsaws, Sub Zero has a hockey stick with sharp edges, and Fireball prefers a flamethrower to finish rivals. But those assassins do not fit Ben Richards, who sends each of them in the right macabre way (followed by a compulsory joke). <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, Ben joins a group of freedom fighters in the fight against the authorities and vengeance on the nasty host of the series, Killianie. <br /> <br /> Twenty years ago Arnold Schwarzeneggar ruled the universe of the action movie and, according to his legion of fans, he could do no wrong. The Austrian biscuit had a successful formula that almost guaranteed the success of the box office in his films: comic violence plus a conspiracy free from logic plus a pretty female midfielder plus witty ones, minus acting ability equaled huge profits. The running man faithfully followed the hit recipe for T and the audience of Arnie (mainly male teenager) overheard him (including this). <br /> <br /> Now, two decades later and just finished watching the movie for the first time in years, I consider it a strange movie: completely devoid of technical value, decent action and convincing effects, but in some way completely entertaining. Director: Paul Michael Glaser (best known as Det. Dave Starsky from the cult series of the '70s, Starsky and Hutch), as well as the adaptation of Stephen King's story (writing under the pseudonym Richard Bachman), The Running Man is a bad Tattoo of the 80s that looks incredibly cheap and very outdated, but despite (or maybe because of) the trashiness of the film, it has a special charm that is difficult to describe. <br /> <br /> Without trying to create a realistic zoom - The future setting of the movie provides a lot of unintentional giggles. Check the scene where Ben discovers Amber's secret cache, banned tapes (!); admire the silly "futuristic" graphics used on advertising billboards and board game The Running Man (as a graphic artist, I think they are especially fun); be surprised by the clear lack of convincing technological advances. <br /> <br /> Running man can be a complete trash, but it's very funny, complete nonsense, that I can recommend Arnie fans and sci-fi action in general without any hesitation.
