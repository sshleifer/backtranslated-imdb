I thought it was a great showcase of Body Mandy. If you do not expect anything else, such as clever twists and credible character development, you will not be disappointed. Consider this photo from the series Sports Illustrated, whose character revolves around killing people, especially those who threaten to stand between her and her "mummy" (Suzanna Arquette, who apparently does not want to play a sexual cat - he leaves it to his daughter). <br /> <br /> Mandy's face is a bit too perfect, but her body is a complete 5-alarm fire, in the ranks of Sophia Loren when it comes to a natural fever, a perfect 7 to 10 waist to hip ratio and wonderfully configured legs, until to the feet. (There must be some perfect configuration of the knee-to-ankle thighs, which is quite pleasing to the eye, Mandy is certainly a model for this ideal coefficient). <br /> <br /> And there is no flat butt to the shoe, which seems to be the loss of many busty babe with curves everywhere except for the "lower hemispheres". Mandy could use the double body in the back shot, losing the towel as she went down to the candle-lit bath with a victim from Germany with crew No. 2 with blindfolded eyes, but from everything I saw from her bikini shots, she had a butt for it and I did not need two to prove it. <br /> <br /> Mandy's acting abilities had little to do with her impression of the psychotic "Mommy's Girl", with obvious erotic subtexts of lesbians. Her bisexual nature (allowing her to nibble in a hot tub after long flirting with the German guy No. 2 who also turned out to be her mother's lover) added an extra dimension to the one-dimensional caricature of an adolescent female horror contrary to pathological murderous impulses (always with water with men - the final fate the Latino hostess was edited in the television version for some vague reason). <br /> <br /> Mandy's Uber-Nordic features in combination with her Uber- A sensual body can be either a blessing or a curse. If Mandy really wants to continue her career as an actress, I would advise you to immerse yourself fully in Romance languages, especially Italian and Spanish - and maybe French, though I do not know if they will go for her type. But that would allow her to come to terms with the face of Bo Derek with her body, Vida Guerra - but maybe her face is just too Nordic, and she showed too much of her extraordinary body in a shoddy movie to let her get promoted to any more fame she enjoyed Michelle Johnson from the 80s, whose early fame in "Blame it in Rio", was preceded by a series of films about the skin that did not escape the earth. <br /> <br /> Vambo Drule.
