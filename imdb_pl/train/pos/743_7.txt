This work is striking in accurately depicting the lives of teenagers at the time of its implementation. Although it is a broad generalization, the parents of those times were too absorbed to be real parents, and those who were at home were too distracted in the real matters in which their children were concerned. <br /> <br /> This movie teaches us how to let go, even if it is painful, and does it with a sweet, melancholic, but conscious style that makes Foster philosophically think about the pain of life. I loved this scene. This was my favorite scene in the movie. <br /> <br /> The transition from the funeral to the wedding was to show that life goes on, just like us. Skateboarding Baio through a herd of goats and overtaking them was supposed to show us that the times of restlessness will pass, and we have to go through them to better times. <br /> <br /> The whole metaphor of "moving around" and the procession of life is present throughout the film and finally serves us with hope. <br /> <br /> I like this movie, although I do not watch it often because it tends to make me melancholy. <br /> <br /> It should not be watched by young children and probably only those brought up in the 70's and 80's will want to. <br /> <br /> Ocenia siÄ™ 7.4 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
