Gray Gardens (1975) is a bizarre documentary of the Maysles brothers about Jackie Bouvier Kennedy Onassis - an eccentric aunt and first cousin who live like pigs in a neglected mansion with 28 rooms on East Hampton, Long Island. 78, witty and dry, and her daughter, "Little Edie" Beale, 56, (emotionally around 13) still beautiful woman who once had a promising future, lives in isolation from the rest of the world, with the exception of many cats and raccoons in the attic. They play quarrels all day, listening to the radio or singing to each other (they do not even have a TV set). Their fall from society is amazing when they learn about it, and the viewer attracts these two unique, though of course dysfunctional people. One of the best documentaries ever made and still a cult classic.
