I'm sorry to say, I have no idea what Hollywood is doing. Sure, give us movies like Batman Begins. Oh, by the way, Hollywood, I think they can discuss the story in the Batman movie, but please do not have fun, what we want to see together with Batman and Superman. I really hated this trailer because I wanted more. I looked around to see when it would come out. It was like a terrible joke. Graphics in which a good story seemed solid and had all the advantages of a great movie. Unfortunately, it will not happen so far. I do great work for producers, directors and all actors, but I hate you for doing it to me. You left me wanting more.
