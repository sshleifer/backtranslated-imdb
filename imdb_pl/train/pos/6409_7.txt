I did not hear about Brashear before I saw it. It's the story of him and the man who trained him, helping him become the first African-American diver in the US Navy. A tale of strength of will. The plot is well written and develops nicely. This is what seems typical, weaker and there are not many surprises. It's also quite Hollywood, but hey, I do not know a real man, maybe it's close to how it actually happened. Nevertheless, the work is done, with dramatic scenes and adversities on the road, and this is inspiring for anyone who has ever heard the words "no, you can not" talk about their life's dream. All acting performances are excellent. DeNiro and Gooding Jr. both glisten when they are displayed on the screen. Rapaport is also wonderful. Characters are well-written, reliable and consistent. It is well assembled and has good photos. The production values ​​are high, and this is quite a convincing task to transfer us back to the 1950s. This is the only movie I've seen with this director and screenwriter, although I can now consider how they are responsible for more. There is a moderate amount of strong language, otherwise there is no offensive material. I recommend it to anyone who finds this topic interesting and / or fans of those who created it. 7/10
