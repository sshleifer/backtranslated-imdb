Another hit by Norman Lear describing the problems faced by African Americans in the turbulent 60s and 70s. <br /> <br /> With Esther Rolle and her husband and three children living in a high-rise Chicago skyscraper, the show was what black people with the owner (black agent Mr. Bookman) pass through, as well as prices and everyday problems just existing. <br /> <br /> Three children have presented how people seem to face their problems differently - from comic JJ to Ralph Carter's fighter, to their daughter, who also aspired to success, this show was a great description of African-American life.
