Another quiet film about a love triangle from Hitchcock is not a secret, but very English, very well mastered and photographed. Smooth Boxer Bob Corby (Ian Hunter) recruits Jack Sander's boxer "One Round" (Carl Brisson) to become his sparring partner, partly to keep the nice but changeable Mabel (Lilian Hall-Davis) nearby. At Jacek and Mabel's wedding there are a lot of actors - characters and grotesque. A buddy, standing in the aisle of the church, is shocked at the sight of very tall and very short men, a thick lady, connected twins, which, of course, argue on which side of the passage to sit, and the wedding feast is fun. In the rest of the movie Jack loses Mabel and returns to his heart, or something like that. It was a completely different era when the audience was in an evening gown, and the boxers were also changing outside the ring. Camera angles, tempo, symbols usage, cutting - all very stylish and masterful. Working with the camera and editing the last boxing match is very addictive. Brisson's good looks are well used in this; his smile is not as unaware of what's going on around him as in Manxman Hitchcock, so he's not annoying. But can boxers have such dimples?
