A great film from 1943 with Paul Lukas, who gave Oscar a calibrated performance as the head of the family, bringing them back to Europe from Europe, when the Nazi threat deepened. <br /> <br /> Ordinary, wonderful Bette Davis keeps her reputation here, the change has not been nominated for the best actress for this or any movie from 1943. <br /> <br /> Determining treachery around them, Lukas successfully copes with the situation. He knows that he must return to Europe during a secret mission and return. <br /> <br /> Davis again pulls out all the tears in Katharine Hepburn style, when they have to part. Resolute, she knows that her older son must follow him on the road to freedom. <br /> <br /> A great movie highlighting American positive propaganda against the wicked enemy.
