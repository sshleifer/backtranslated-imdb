It helps a lot if someone knows the culture and the period in which the film takes place. First of all, these ladies are NOT geishas, ​​they are oirans (prostitutes) in "green houses" type of Yoshiwar, around 1860, they give or take ... This should help to explain some details that can be misleading to the unconscious. The film deals with issues of loyalty, love and, perhaps most importantly, how people deal with adversities, both their own and others in their immediate surroundings. This plus scandalous photography combined with incredibly beautiful music make driving a pleasant one. Just connect, suspend disbelief and enter their world. You will not be dissapointed.
