A really nice movie. A must for every music snuff. You really do not need to know about bands to enjoy the movie. Before the film, I heard only two songs from Dandy Warhols. All you need is an open mind. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on Brian Jonestown's massacre. Dandy Warhols plays a role in the film as a "competitive band", but they are the second violinist for BJM. The Dandy Warhols do not play such a big role in the film as I initially thought, but on the other hand they did not have the element of excitement and unpredictability of BJM. and his very charismatic frontman, Anton Newcombe. It is an insightful film and learning about the music industry in itself. Just watch this movie and enjoy.
