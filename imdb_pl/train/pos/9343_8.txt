I'm not a fan of Adam Sandler. Actually, I do not think I ever liked him in anything I saw. The opening scene of this movie confirmed my worst fears. There was Adam Sandler, playing a slightly funny-looking character riding a scooter on New York, looking pitiful and lost. A typical Sandler character lost, I thought. I almost gave up. But when I got stuck, I discovered something I had never known before: Adam Sandler can act! He is really outstanding in this film because Charlie, a lost and lonely figure, whose entire family (including the dog) died in one of the abducted planes on September 11 and which consequently lost all contact with reality. Don Cheadle plays his ex-college roommate who unexpectedly makes contact with Charlie and accepts him as his mission to help him improve. Of course, Alan Johnson of Cheadle has his problems and sources of unhappiness, and somehow these two men can help each other through their difficulties. They both created a completely reliable team, and Sandler in particular made Charlie real, working on his emotions and feelings. This is not Sandler's comedy. If you're looking for it, go to his other, sillier, things. It's quite a heavy movie - sometimes sad, sometimes hopeful and always addictive. There are some fun parts in it. I loved the scene where Charlie convinces Alan to confront his partners, reminding him how hard he was in college and then the conversation they both had later. <br /> <br /> Personally, I did not think that Saffron Burrows added much to the film as Donna, undoubtedly in need of Johnson's patient. The only reason the character seemed to be (based on one retrospection) was that she looked amazing like Charlie's late wife, but she was never really developed, and I did not care much about the character. However, look for the part of the referee Donald Sutherland plays. As for me, this is Sandler's film and fame for him for a great performance. By far its the best in my opinion. 8/10
