Hello Playmates. I recently watched the movie for the first time and this is also my first experience with Arthur Askey, I must admit that I was impressed with this film. As a fan of overall black and white films, a passport to pimlico, a lavender crowd and Tommy Trinder (who is apparently a distant relative), this movie appealed to him because it provided good old British humor. I noticed that there are some who criticized Askey's performance, but in my opinion this is a test of time as a great example of a comic forties game and if anything adds to the image, creating characters that are more than just stereotypes that seem to dominate now movies. If you manage to get this movie, I recommend that you win it, it is a pity that these films are no longer shown on Sunday afternoons. I am also glad that I had the opportunity to watch another work by Arnold Ridley (Private Godfrey in dad's army). Thank you
