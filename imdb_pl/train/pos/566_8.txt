Cleverly interesting western from the director, who had few peers in this genre. Like other Anthony Mann's photos, The Far Country combines a strong story of pot cooking with skilful awareness of the effect of the scenery. Both of these elements take place among some Mann peccillons, such as honor, honesty, betrayal and of course death! The story presents partners for fortune hunting, Jeff Webster (James Stewart) and Ben Tatuma (Walter Brennan), traveling to Oregon Territory with a herd of cattle. Realizing the thriving gold boom, they plan to get a clean profit by selling cattle in the city of Klondike. Arriving at Skagway, they found a self-appointed judge Gannon {John McIntire} ready to meet Webster's justice for Webster's breach of law, all in a fair case along the way. As a punishment, Gannon takes a pack of partners from them, but they steal them and drive them across the Canadian border to Dawson - with Gannon and his men in pursuit. Here, beautiful women and a mild and unlawful city will fill the fate of all those involved. <br /> <br /> Interesting from the beginning to the end, The Far Country benefits a lot from the bubbling hero James Stewart in anticipation of the portrait and Mann's smooth direction of the tight scenario of Borden Chase. William H. Daniels' photos are great because they did not make any favors based on current DVDs, and the movie has a few surprises and "will not he?" A core that engages viewers. Paying dividends for re-watching for hardened fans of the genre still remains something of a basic look at the first people who venture into the wonderful, though dark, western world of Anthony Mann and James Stewart. 8/10
