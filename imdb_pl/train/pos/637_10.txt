Ok, this program is just AMAZING! It has a great story and story, great actors and actresses. Jeremy Sumpter is such a hott and is perfect for the role! He is great in Hollywood. He has a bright future ahead! This concert will last longer, because I really like this concert and I hope it has many successes! It's so interesting. I've been waiting for him to appear for about 6 or 7 months and he's here, and he's great! I also record it. I can watch it whenever I want! It is a pity only once a week. It is a pity that it was not at least twice a week, because now I would like it to be Tuesday every day! I hope you all like this concert! <br /> <br /> ~ Ashley ~
