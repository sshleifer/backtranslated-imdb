Possible spoilers: late appearing scenes <br /> <br /> Rarely can you see so many great and unforgettable character actors (almost completely actresses) in one movie. Even if a few appear only in scenes, each of them is a jewel. The British are doing a mix of comedy and real pathos better than anyone with IMO, so it's no surprise that most of the actors are British. <br /> <br /> Music is great; no doubt a lot had to be dubbed (or Leslie Caron * really * playing bass well - maybe who knew?) But Clio Lane was undoubtedly alone - her warm, lively sound still turns my crank like few other jazz singers. > <br /> As an aging musician, not so old, and certainly not in this class, it was also a movie full of emotions - a great movie for anyone who wonders if he is in his profession or avocation, whatever it can be. And of course, a great celebration of the life of the scene. <br /> <br /> I missed some of the opening, but 9/10 makeshift - and that certainly makes us want to see the whole thing.
