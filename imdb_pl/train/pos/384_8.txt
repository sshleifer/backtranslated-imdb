The film version of the highly emotional and influential novel by Alice Walker from 1983 (written largely as a list from the central character Celie to God) was a great success for Oscar and rightly so. <br /> <br /> awakened Celie, Whoopi Goldberg gave her the best show on screen in miles. Not far from her was Oprah Winfrey as Sofia, a fiery woman tamed with fate. Others in the cast showed the characters that Walker showed so clearly on the site - Danny Glover as Albert, abusive husband Celie; Margaret Avery as Shug, the power of change for good; Willard Pugh and Rae Dawn Chong as Harpo and Squeak; Susan Beaubian as Corrine, the wife of the preacher; and the very unsuccessful Carl Anderson (otherwise known as Judas in the movie Jesus Christ Superstar from 1973) as Samuel's preacher. <br /> <br /> Beautifully thought-out and carefully written "Violet Color" captures the justice of the source by opening the story to engage viewers in a full-length drama.
