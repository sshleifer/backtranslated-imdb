This video is the reason why I found this page. I could not find this movie anywhere else! I'm glad we found it here! We've seen it before on TV and we wanted to find it desperately and buy it, and some friends interested in buying it. Another poster commented that it is boring, although I must say it is NOT. Especially if you're a horse, you'll love this movie. The horses are amazing, well-trained, and the film is well done. We will certainly buy them in our home DVD library. We will recommend it to our friends. The bond between man and horse in this film was so inspiring and made you want to spend more time with your horses. This is certainly a movie that we will watch several times.
