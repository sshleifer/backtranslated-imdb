Let me start by saying that I'm a big fan of Carrey. Although I must admit that I have not seen all his films * cough * magic * cough *. Bruce Almighty was pleasant. None of the other reviews really came out about how bad it is at the end, I do not know what the writers thought. I could not help but somehow, I felt that this movie was a poor attempt to recreate Liar Liar. <br /> <br /> A positive touch is that Steve Correl from The Daily Show is HILARIOUS, just like the rest of the cast. See Bruce Almighty if you're a big fan of Jim Carrey, or just want to see a funny comedy with light piano music.
