Just mention one more thing about Gentleman Jim. I agree with all the assessments that make it among Errol Flynn's biggest performances in the career of great expeditions. I think that boxer Jim Corbett is more like his real personality than the one he was wearing. Flynn seemed like a party animal from his memories and was one guy whose real life was more exciting than his screen life. An additional thing I wanted to pay attention to are the great montages, transitions and insertions that emphasize the film. Although the director was Raoul Walsh, frequent Flynn's collaborator, with operator Sid Hickox, the editing was prepared by future editor Don Siegel. I never knew that Siegel had gone so far, but he was right. Sam would go to a great career as a director of action.
