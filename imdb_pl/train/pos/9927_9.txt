Domino is a great movie. It's about a young woman named Domino Harvey (Kiera Knightley), who becomes a bounty hunter because of her boredom with her lifestyle. He joins two fellow hunters (Mickey Rourke and Edgar Ramirez) and the adventures begin. The script is good. Very down-to-earth and realistic with the tone of the film. The only problem I've had with this movie is that it focuses on the different things they do, not on the Domino. <br /> <br /> Even in this case Kiera Knightley gives a strong performance. It shows the right amount of anger and dedication in this performance. Mickey Rourke continues his Oscar-winning performance in Sin City with another tough performance. Edgar Ramirez really does nothing but speak Spanish every once in a while and stares at Kiera. Delroy Lindoi gives a good support performance. Mo'Nique was alone, although she surprised me on one stage. Lucy Liu has a great chemistry with Kierla Knightley in her scenes with her. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the movie, however, is the direction. Tony Scott's fast style really animates the movie. Pictures are some of the best I've ever seen. He makes a regular movie and introduces acid. All blacks are darker, white are brighter and have a kind of green glow. Action scenes are joyful. <br /> <br /> GENERAL: If you like Sin City and Man on Fire, you'll like Domino.
