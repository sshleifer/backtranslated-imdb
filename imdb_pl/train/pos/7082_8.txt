First of all, we know that Bruce Willis is a good actor, but if you take most of your movies, you'll see that the characters have those moments in which they are the same. His character in this film is far beyond any previous ... and counts. The story begins in a (not so distant) future, when man is sent to the past to find the source of the virus that has swept away most of humanity from the face of the earth. History seems to be heading towards SF, but I think it is closer to the drama because of the slow rhythm of the story. About that. Movies tend to be faster and slower at some points and develop more towards the end than at the beginning, but when you see this movie, you will be aware of this continuous rhythm of history and revealing facts that do not accelerate or slow down. It is the same speed that flows smoothly and quite well. But that does not mean that the end will not upset you, because it's pretty good. As for the direction, it is perfect. Movies as such are easily destroyed by bad directing, but it has become much better. So, if you're preparing to watch a Sci-Fi movie or some action, you'll miss it. B There should be more such films.
