This is an amazing movie. In addition to showing real recordings of key events in an unsuccessful putsch to overthrow Chavez, we received a background image that describes a class-divided society. It seems that many of the rich have a choice thanks to the democratic election of the people and are ready to use the army to change the regime. "Watch what you say to your servants" is a comment. The head of the country's largest oil company is appointed as the new president with US support, and these young Irish filmmakers have it all in their camera. A great educational film for young people about democracy. We see clear documentation of how to manipulate the media and use forces in the interests of big business, against the interests of people's democratic wishes. Riveting.
