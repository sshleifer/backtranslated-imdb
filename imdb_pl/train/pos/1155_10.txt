This is very funny. He has a great cast, each of whom gives great performances. Especially Sally Field and Kevin Kline. This is a well-written script by Andrew Bergman (Honeymoon In Vegas). I do not like soap operas, although I never watch them. But I love this movie because it's so crazy and wall-less that it beats off the stupid soap they have on TV during the day. In my opinion, this is the best movie from 1991.
