In 1983, director Brian De Palma decided to make a film about the rise and fall of the American gangster, and that he did - thanks to the great script by Oliver Stone and the flawless work of an outstanding cast. The result was "Scarface" with Al Pacino in one of the most memorable roles. The story begins in May 1980, when Castro opened a port in Mariel, Cuba, to allow Cuban citizens to join their families in the United States. 125,000 left Cuba at this time, for greener pastures of freedom in America, and most were honest, hard-working people, grateful for the opportunity they had been granted. But not everything. Of the "Marielitos" who came to Florida, about 25,000 had criminal records and were nothing more than the remnants of Cuban prisons - criminals considered as undocumented, whom Castro simply wanted to get rid of. And they also saw America as a country of opportunity, even if Al Capone thought Chicago was some fifty years earlier. And among the most ambitious was a man named Tony Montana (Pacino), known to his co-workers as "Caracortada". Scarface. <br /> <br /> Now that he was free from the yoke of communism under which he grew up, Montana wanted what he was watching, approaching him, and now he wanted it; and from the moment he left the boat in Florida, he was determined to have it all. Wealth and power - it was Montana's dream, and he would get it, doing what he did best, starting with a favor for a man living in Miami named Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia). It seems that Lopez had a brother in Cuba, who met with a premature end at the hands of one of Castro, a man who survived his usefulness to Castro, was rejected and was detained in "Little Havana", along with Montana and all Cubans near the boats, where they waited for their documents from the government, which will affect their transition to a new life. In a short time, Montana will make sure Lopez's brother is avenged, and this prepares the ground for his own entry into America's underworld. <br /> <br /> Lopez, a wealthy businessman with the right contacts, back at a favor causes Montana and his friend Manny (Steven Bauer) to be released from the camp and put them to work. In his time, Capone could have had illegal profits as a means by which his treasures could be gained by illegal profits, but Lopez has a contemporary equivalent and is even more lucrative: cocaine. Lopez takes Montana under his wing and indoctrinates him into life, but when he has the taste, Montana is not satisfied with what Lopez deems appropriate to throw his way, and sets a course that will take him where he wants to be: " summit. " With cold-blooded, iron will, Montana decides that he will do anything to get there, no matter the cost. but before it ends, he will make the price for his dream come true and pay; but for a short while he may know what it's like to be a Man. And he will also know if it was worth it. <br /> <br /> According to the vision of De Palma, Pacino plays Montana more than life and does it beautifully. From the accent he influences (which he has carefully examined to make sure he did it well - and he did it), from body language and posture, he has it all and makes Montana convincing and very real. What he brings to the role is the nuances and style in such a way that few actors (De Niro would be one) can. Surely this is not a character who is nice in any way, nor is there anything in Montana that you can relate to on a personal level; but Pacino's presence on the screen is so strong that it makes him an engaging character, although it's difficult to tie him emotionally. It's just a dynamic, unforgettable performance. <br /> <br /> Michelle Pfeiffer gives solid results, also in a role that puts her on the path to fame. Like Elvira, a woman who becomes an integral part of Montana's dream, Pfeiffer is subtle and understated, giving a sense of what is happening underneath, affecting a rather cold and distant external face. She, like Pacino, definitely makes her presence felt when she throws herself on the screen with stoic, enigmatic and sensual behavior. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast includes Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio (Gina), Miriam Colon (Mama Montana), F. Murray Abraham (Omar), Paul Shenar (Sosa) and Harris Yulin (Bernstein). The excellent precursor to the newer and highly rated "Ruch" and "Blow", as well as the climactic scene reminiscent of "The Wild Peckinpah", "Scarface" De Palma, originally led by critics, has since been cited by many as the final American gangster saga. Much of the violence is rather presumed than graphic, but this film still has the edge of realism that many may find to be a bit worrying. But if you stay with it, the lesson will eventually be learned. And as many lessons in life, the most valuable are often the most difficult to take at this time. But the prize is always worth it and that's how it is with this film. I rate this one 8/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
