To be honest, I expected car chases in this movie. There was only one, but otherwise "Freeway" was a great movie that I enjoy on DVD. The only really big names in the cast are Richard Belzer HOMICIDE as a radio psychiatrist and par excellance villain B-Movie Billy Drago as quoting Freeway Killer with a quote. But the rest of the cast generally gives good performances. I especially liked how Darlanne Fluegel gave her heroine Sunny a little bit of courage. She could be a form of defenseless victim, but she is completely rounded when she searches for Drago with the help of the bounty hunter James Russo. <br /> <br /> I am afraid Russo is rather wooden, but then again the character he plays, Frank, is not well developed, except for the story that Sunny tells his former commander. The horror tone is wonderfully maintained throughout the film, and the atmosphere of the lonely LA highway at night with a murderer rolling his length in his ominous gray sedan is a great way to build tension, and the music used to emphasize the film is composed accordingly. I do not know why there are people who hate this movie so much. I suppose different hits for different people. But I absolutely liked the "Freeway" and I can definitely recommend it.
