This movie is definitely on the list of my 10 favorites. The voices of animals are great. Sally Field and Michael J. Fox are brilliant as sassy feline and young inexperienced poochs, but the real distinguishing feature is Don Ameche as an old, faithful golden retriever. This film is a great family movie because it can be appreciated and loved by both children and adults. Humorous and full of tension, they guarantee that every animal lover is crying! (tears of happiness!)
