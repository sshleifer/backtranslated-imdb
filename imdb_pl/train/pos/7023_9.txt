I loved that this film recognizes the viewer's intelligence, allowing the layers to break away from the characters by interacting with the unspeakable losses that affected each of them. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is beautiful and is an inspired reflection of the vision of someone who I think is an extremely talented new filmmaker with a maturity and artistic insight to tell a story that other people with more experience have failed to achieve. I see a bright future for this scriptwriter / producer / director who was able to focus on the goal and achieve it honestly. <br /> <br /> Kudos for this achievement.
