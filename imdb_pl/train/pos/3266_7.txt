Another Downey must see! If you're a fan of obsessions like me, you must see this movie! A game of Alex Finch, a 22-year-old Yale graduate who realizes that the life he just entered is the life he left 26 years earlier. Alex is the reincarnation of Louie Jeffries, a senseless lawyer who has happily married Corrine (Cybil Sheppard). Louie dies on the anniversary when she is hit by a car. He demands a return, this time only in Alex Finch's body. Enter Robert Downey Jr., a lot of confusion and a lot of laughter. <br /> <br /> Although this movie is 15 years old, you're still wondering if there really is such a thing as reincarnation. And if so, how often do you meet the life of the same soul after life. I do not know the answer. But I know you have to see this movie. It will live, and Downey looks good in a tuxedo. This movie makes you believe in love, and true love never dies. It simply is recycled.
