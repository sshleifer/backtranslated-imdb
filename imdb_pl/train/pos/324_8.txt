I did not expect that I would like this film as much as I did. I just got it because I saw it on the list of the 25 most controversial films of all time. It did not look particularly good. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that it was one of the most cleverly composed films from the latest memory. <br /> <br /> The point is that a twenty-year-old woman wants to know everything. It stores all the information it collects in a huge archive. He experiments with experience in sex, political activism and interpersonal relations. Meanwhile, the film crew is shown during filming and watch their reactions to history and each other. Nudity, explicit sex and controversial politics prevented this film from being shown in the United States, while its attachment by the customs authorities was contested. The film is a narrative, but it is a documentary film that shows us the behind-the-scenes world of filmmakers during the narrative, and the fourth wall is broken. This movie is the most direct way to make a movie I've ever seen. The film works primarily as a time capsule of the psychedelic struggles of the 1960s, the fight for freedom and sexual liberation. I like to think about it as much more. <br /> <br /> I did not think I would waste time on the blue version of this movie, but I really do. This movie is a buried treasure. Try it.
