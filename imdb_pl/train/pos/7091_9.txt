The big problem is where to start, because this movie requires your attention in the next two hours, and you better not miss a few minutes to get Coke, because there is a danger you can not follow. But the pause button is also good. Bruce Willis must go to the time machine to find an antivirus program for the virus that caused the animals to rule the world in 1996. Thanks to some mistakes, it ends for the first time in 1990, and then in the First World War and how it all may look confused like Terry Gilliam thinks what must be one of the most intelligent scripts in history. This former Monty Phyton man knows exactly how brilliant SF stories have to be told, his cast selection could not be better, he is crazy Brad Pitt (his performance in the asylum is unforgettable) and the wonderful Bruce Willis, who proves that is more than someone who wants to be Schwarzenegger. It's a movie that you can watch many times because the script is so strange and complicated (and yet you can follow it) that every view gives you other surprises. One of my favourite.
