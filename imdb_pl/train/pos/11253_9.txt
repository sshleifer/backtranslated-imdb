It is an extremely long movie, which means you can become very bored before it becomes interesting, but its length provides its characters with the opportunity to find a lasting attachment in your sympathies. <br /> <br /> If you are moved by the guilty sense of guilt, it will prove particularly painful for the heart, because it is a story that finds heroes among the bad and the weak. If you can love the monster, you will be crying for Magnus Pym, a spy who betrays everyone - especially his country, his friends and family - a man who has also been manipulated and shaped from childhood by the same people. <br /> <br /> There is not one really nice character in all of history, not one loyal, "moral" personality with which he could feel sorry for. But watching the whole without the help of the tissue would be unusual. <br /> <br /> In the end I really liked it. It is worth it for people who like inflammatory films about the vile human character.
