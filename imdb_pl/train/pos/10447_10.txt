There are many people in our lives that we only meet once in a lifetime, but for some reason we remember these people for the rest of our lives. These life-long friendships take place between people of great distances and there are always natural reasons why we do not meet these people. We do not always know their names, because we are never represented, and sometimes we even forget what their names are. It's funny how ordinary people make occasional friends and we like to keep it because reconnection can spoil nice memories or we do not know if they're doing it. We are too afraid to check it out. <br /> <br /> The movie "Before Sunrise" caught me. I never intended to watch it, but because the discussion between the pair seemed interesting, I checked the rest of the movie. I did not know what to expect from her, but the young couple did not. They had time to talk to each other until sunrise and anything can happen before they have to separate. I believe this movie has good reviews because the situation is something that everyone on this planet has lived at least once or twice. It makes us think of all the people we've only met once in our lives.
