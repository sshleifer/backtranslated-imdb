At the end of the 1980s, Warren Beatty created and played in the literary epic "Reds" about the founding of the Soviet Union, seen through the eyes of the orbiting radical John Reed. It was a deep movie, both funny and sent by a star cast. Towards the end of the decade, Warren Beatty created another kind of epic in Dick Tracy, who does not pretend to be anything other than entertainment with a whole group of the best actors who have a great old time, conquering it with tons of make-up. br /> <br /> That both the Reds and Dick Tracy can come from the same person, many say about the range that this man has as a player. In this movie Beatty managed to get all the famous cartoon characters from the tape and put them in one original scenario. <br /> <br /> The biggest city gangster Big Boy Caprice is taking a step to really eliminate competition. The film begins by grinding the followers of Lips Manlis in the Valentine Massacre shooting, and then adjusting Lips to the cement coat himself. But Caprice moves make it a goal for Tracy. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, the third mysterious and faceless person wants to overthrow Caprice himself. Will our hero clean up this thicket of crime? <br /> <br /> The fun spirit that has this movie is really contagious. When people like Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, Paul Sorvino, William Forsythe, R.G. Armstrong is scandalously invented to look like cartoon creations by the author of Chester Gould, and then indulge in sculpting the largest piece of ham, you must love this movie. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino received a nomination for the Best Supporting Actor, but each of them could have, only that Pacino as Big Boy Caprice gets the most time on the screen. Only Beatty plays it quite simply, others seem to play his role. Dick Tracy won Oscars for the best play and set design, the best song by Stephen Sondheim and introduced him Madonna, Sooner Or Later. The fact that he was able to persuade someone like Sondheim to write a score for the movie shows only that Sondheim wanted to have fun. When it comes to Madonna, Material Girl does more than any heavy actress, such as club singer Breathless Mahoney. <br /> <br /> Before this movie, Dick Tracy's films were sent to B photos and worse afternoon series on Saturday. The only thing that competes with this extravagant star is a radio program made for the Radio of the Armed Forces during World War II, which reached the vinyl. Can you believe the cast like Bing Crosby, Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra, Dinah Shore, Jimmy Durante, Judy Garland, Frank Morgan and Andrews Sisters? Try to find a recording of this gem. <br /> <br /> Until then, Warren Beatty's classic comic on the big screen will look good.
