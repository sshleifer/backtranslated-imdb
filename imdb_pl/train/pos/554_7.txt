(contains minor spoilers) <br /> <br /> It's interesting how Anthony Mann is using James Stewart here. Stewart is of course remembered by many as George Bailey from "It's a Wonderful Life" by Frank Capry, so it's easy to find the similarities between the two films. In "It's a Wonderful Life", Bailey sees the world as if he never was born. In "The Far Country" by Jeff Webster Stewart, without getting involved in helping anyone else (except himself), he sees essentially the same thing: a world in which he (in all practical matters) does not exist. /> <br /> Not engaging (and not caring for anyone), Webster is forced to see those for whom he can not help, but the care is hurt, pushed, and even killed when he stands next to doing nothing. This reminds the viewer George Bailey watching the world that turned upside down because he also decided not to get involved because he was never born. <br /> <br /> Both films end with the same image - the ringing of the bell. It seems Stewart, turning his philosophy of lack of commitment, has won his "wings".
