It pleased me that she has black hair! I have been a fan for about 30 years and was disgusted with two previous attempts to film history. <br /> <br /> I was glad that the screenwriters updated this period to include a computer. spoil it at all. In fact, I watched the movie twice in one day, which was a sign that it was a standard. This is what I do with books that I like. <br /> <br /> I thought that all the characters are well represented and represent the early days of Modest Blaise very well, as evidenced by both books and comics. I would also have to disagree with the comment of the previous reviewer that the villains must be ugly. Did he really read books? <br /> <br /> I thought it was a very good movie and I'm looking forward to the sequels with impatience.
