The DVD for "Danaza Macabra" (Castle of Blood) is very strange. This is because parts of the film are in French with subtitles, and the rest is dubbed into English from French. Sometimes the characters switched between them in the middle of the stage! When I tried to make the movie ONLY written or simply dubbed, it did not matter! Strange, but still possible to watch. <br /> <br /> The story is to be based on the story of Poe, though I do not remember which one. In fact, Poe appears at the beginning and end of the movie - though it did not look like it. <br /> <br /> A rich man bets with a guy for his happiness that he can not stay all night at home. It seems like an easy bet to win - even if the house is very scary. However, it can not be that simple because a rich guy says that all those who took the bet earlier died - but this stupid STILL wants to bet! Being at home, he meets the charming Barbara Steele and falls into madness. Later, however, she learns that she died more than ten years earlier! How can it be ?! I could tell you more about the story, but I do not want to mess up any tension. Convince yourself to get to know the rest of the story. <br /> <br /> This film reaches very high marks for creating a terrifying atmosphere. Home, black and white cinematography and music work together to create a frightening movie. As for the plot, it's interesting - especially that there are many twists and turns - so many people are wondering who is and who is not among the undead at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> The only downside is that I feel sorry for a poor snake who was unnecessarily killed. Crazy, it might seem, I was sorry and it did not seem necessary. <br /> <br /> Parents may also want to know that there is a bit of nudity at the end. A strikingly beautiful woman seems topless, but it is not necessary for the plot.
