Astronaut Steve West (Alex Rebar) and his companions take on a space mission in which they fly through Saturn's rings. His companions are killed immediately, but it seems that they are actually lucky. Steve comes back to Earth with a still-oozing mass of humanoid pulp; when he turns into a wild killer melting at every turn, he is followed by his friend Dr. Ted Nelson (Burr DeBenning). <br /> <br /> It is often so noisy fun - with quite absurd lines and situations to get around - it's hard for me to believe that laughter is unintentional. I think it's a bit stupid in the low-budget efforts of the 50's and 60's, and as such is a wonderfully funny movie. This sequence with the nurse is simply fun. We even treat the sequence of a split screen that does not really add anything, but it's still a gas to watch. <br /> <br /> Writer / director William Sachs deserves credit for inventing this ingenious idea; its ultra-slimy nature is indeed unforgettable. I think its stimulation is a bit off; some scenes (such as the one with an older couple) last a little bit long, but ultimately provide solid, schlocky, B movie movies with some vigor. The climax is particularly funny. <br /> <br /> The music of Arlon Obers is pleasantly shocking (but also stupid at times), and Willy Curtis' photos sometimes create really great photos. This brings me to the fantastic and convincing effects of Rick Bakers' make-up, which is a very valuable element of the film, until the final final melting. <br /> <br /> Rebar is under heavy makeup for almost the whole movie (Sachs also praises me for the movie hit the ground) and does what he needs to do well. DeBenning is a rather stupid and stupid hero, and Ann Sweeney is not as hot as his wife, but Myron Healey, Michael Alldredge and Lisle Wilson are doing well. It's also worth seeing people like Cheryl "Rainbeaux" Smith (making a noticeable topless shot), Janus Blythe (with "Eaten Alive" Tobe Hoopers and "The Hills Have Eyes" by Wes Cravens), and even director Jonathan Demme in a bit. <br /> <br /> It is a very funny movie at midnight with enough chills, chills and laughter to judge it as a worthy capture for sci-fi / horror lovers of low quality anywhere. <br /> <br /> 8/10
