Critically, people say that Antz is better. Antz is a good movie, but I liked Bug's Life more. I do not remember the Pixar animation, other than the two Toy Story movies I used to laugh at. The animation is clean, the story is original and does not preach. Voices contribute to this. Dave Foley is a serious ant, which often gets in trouble. Hopper is a great character by always the great Kevin Spacey, just like Haydn Panettiere as Dot. There is also support from the favorites Dennis Leary, David Hyde Pierce and Madeline Kahn. The screenplay is fantastic, so funny and sometimes even touching. He lacks Antz social messages, but we have solid entertainment. 9/10. Bethany Cox
