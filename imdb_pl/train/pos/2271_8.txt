I just finished listening to the director's commentary on this movie and I think that one big thing I get from him that I agree with is that this film, like The Insider Manna, is completely subjective. It's from POV POV. So any review or attempt to consider a set of comments on the subject, as Ebert did, really concerns Nolte. If you feel, like him, that the movie "does not work", then you say, I think Howard does not work. Honestly, you can be right. Howard's reasoning and personality would not really endure professional psychological treatments and analyzes. <br /> <br /> But, hey, that's the nature of people. <br /> <br /> Andrew.
