It's hard for me to criticize everything Mitzi Kapture does. It simply radiates beauty and grace on the screen and is a phenomenal actress. Still, the plot was predictable. I think maybe if Jill HAD slept with Richard, maybe it would make him a little more crazy than he was already, which would add more tension. It would also be nice if Jill and her husband found out about Richard's little problem with his ex-wife, and maybe a little more history. I was a little disappointed with the end of the movie. I would like to see more closure with Zack's death and perhaps a closure with my husband. However, I must say that I will never be able to look at a flare gun and not picture it standing there. It was a very fitting end to Richard. Of course, Mitzi ROCKED! I am looking forward to her future projects.
