This video shows the type of teamwork that one wants in each film. Barbara Bain and Donald Sutherland (who play husband and wife) are positively cooled, discussing "family business" as if it was a grocery store or dry cleaning. Macy, Campbell, Ullman and Ritter are also great. They play each other like members of a top-class theater group, who realize that a high-quality product requires each actor to selflessly support others. And finally there is Sammy (David Dorfman). What an amazing performance since childhood ... and what a remarkable similarity he has to Ullman, whose son he plays! <br /> <br /> We treat a unique story in "Panic", a rarity in these days of tired, nonsense. The dialogue is sharp and intelligent, and yet this relatively short film has the power to bring the viewer a full range of emotions. There are places where you can laugh, be shocked, be terrified, saddened, aroused, angry and love. It's not a movie that makes you jump for joy, but when it's over, you're more than happy, knowing you've spent the last ninety minutes going through a fucking good job. go to theaters if you have been treated to such a good quality. When will the forces in Hollywood wake up? It is a real shame when something so good is not revealed outside festivals and households that are lucky.
