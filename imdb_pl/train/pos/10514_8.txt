Emma is a terribly flawed movie based on the classic Jane Austens novel. I did not read the book, so I did not really know much about the story, and yet I predicted almost the entire story. There were also many scenes that frustrated me because of bad writing or directing. The movie is for some reason very funny and I loved it. Of course there were all the scenes I did not like, but most were well-kept and funny. Gwyneth Paltrow gives one of her best performances as a heroine in Emma. The film also features Toni Collette (who's doing well, but he was much better) Ewan Mecgreger (who was also better, but he's still very good here) Alan Cumming (who I've never been impressed with and is almost the same here)) and Jeremy Northam (Who at first glance is rather wooden, but actually quite subtle, even if it was not needed). There has been a much better adaptation of Jane Austen's books, but this one is still very funny and worth watching.
