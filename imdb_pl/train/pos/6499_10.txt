After all these years, I still consider this series the best example of making documentaries from World War II. Interviews with many participants from all countries differentiate it from other projects. It would be great if a contemporary documentalist (Ken Burns?) Took up this topic and tried to collect information from the veterans before they disappear. Thanks to modern technology of improving old archival materials and a lot of information that was discovered since 1974, when The World At War was produced, the updated version of this series will be welcomed. The Channel story has made some great shows on many aspects of World War II, but since the original, it has not been possible to carry out an extensive series, such as World At War. If you are interested in this era, do not miss this series. Viewing is required.
