Oscar-caliberal performance by Peter Falk in a role written by Oskar. I loved the sophisticated, well-balanced search for a long-lasting marriage - how often do we have it in movies, where usually the movie ends when the boy and girl meet? It is an adult film, a complex view through the eyes of all sides - husband, wife, son - as each of them has adapted to each other in the past and develops during the story. What's more, it gave me about 10 large stomach laughter and I am one of those people who usually sit without emotions when the rest of the audience laughs. It was one of the few really fun movies I've seen. Great, original jokes.
