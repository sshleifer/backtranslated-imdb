Jörg Buttgereit sometimes exaggerates with his films and topics, even for my taste, but his films are always something special and difficult to classify. They are artistically created, and often have a deeper meaning for their subjects. This movie is a great example of his work. <br /> <br /> It's really hard to describe this movie. This is not a movie with a story, in the sense of beginning, middle and end. There is also no main character, but he focuses on 7 different suicides and homicides on 7 different days. <br /> <br /> All the different stories are told with lots of classes, although some of them are obviously more "interesting" and realistic than others. They are not necessarily connected, but they still tell a story together. The film is not chaotic at all. All different stories have a different character, but Buttgereit tells a story without the use of words (also typical of his style), but it allows the images and the obviously meaningful emotions of the characters to tell the whole story. It helps to make this movie effective to watch. <br /> <br /> Again, all production values ​​are not too high and it can be something that can scare off some people. This, however, helps in this particular film to set the right tone and atmosphere for the whole movie and its dark, disturbing and depressing themes. <br /> <br /> Film Buttgereit, which I liked to watch. br /> 7/10
