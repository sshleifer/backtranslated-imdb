It did something for the crime that "Not Another Teen Movie" did at school. I laughed when 2 clumsy gangs fought with each other and among themselves. An indecent comedy with overt jokes and gags that kept me busy. I suppose the biggest gag in the whole movie was that time never seemed to go forward, leaving the characters trapped in the 1930s.
