I read Holes in fifth grade, so when I heard that they were making a movie, I was delighted! Of course, being my busy self, I did not have the opportunity to see the movie in cinemas. The openings were at the entrance just outside the city, but, unfortunately, we were too busy. I was surprised to hear that all my friends saw it and none of them invited me! Everyone said it was good, but I read great books that made shit movies, so I was definitely worried. <br /> <br /> Suddenly it was a great opportunity to see it. It was this week, and my parents were going on a cruise, and I stayed to the babysitter. My sister, who is 9 years old, and I watched it and loved it! Then I took him to other people where I was home to look after children, and their children, 9 and 4, liked it. Even my parents loved it and they are definitely film critics. In general, I recommend this movie to anyone who understands the family's morale and loves a fun cast! This movie should be on the list of the 5 best to watch !!!!
