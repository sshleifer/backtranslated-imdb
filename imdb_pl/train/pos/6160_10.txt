SPOILER ALERT !!!! <br /> <br /> I just watched the extended version of Bedknobs and Broomsticks. Although I liked the extended version, I would like them to leave the original version on DVD. <br /> <br /> Portabello Road may have been limited to the original length. It was too long and I was filming. Although the dance is great, it would be better on the DVD as the scene removed. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a great movie. I liked my 5-year-old child. It's great that the movies I liked as a child are passed on to the new generation. This and Mary Poppins are added to my collection. <br /> <br /> As I remembered! <br /> <br /> *** with **** <br /> <br />
