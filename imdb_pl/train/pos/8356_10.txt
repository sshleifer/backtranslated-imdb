I'm not sure if it counts as a spoiler or not, so watch out: <br /> <br /> Only a small but important thing to look out for, an intriguing opportunity: boys steal green Citroen at one point, ride a joy and return it to the owner who has made a deliberate and vengeful, hidden damage to the car, hoping that the owner will fail. Is this the same car that they steal much later from the picnic family? We know that the original owner sold it. They leave at the end of a dangerous road which, I understand, has been closed to all but pedestrians for the last ten years. A completely new approach to the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> In another case, this film could be called "The Scent of a Woman." I do not remember another film, certainly not American, which treats the woman's fragrance in such an open and honest way, just like the "nose" of a good Bordeaux.
