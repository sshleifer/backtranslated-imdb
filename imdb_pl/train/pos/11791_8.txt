This is a very intriguing short film by David Lynch who says that David Lynch is enough for many people. This is your typical Lynch. Blonde and brunette are in a dark room. The blonde is crying, the brunette is threatening to blonde and that's all. <br /> <br /> With many quiet moments, but with the haunted music of Angelo Badalamenti, there is a strange form of tension. This shortcut is a bit like the movie "Mulholland Dr." which I loved, which is why I liked this film. This is probably especially for Lynch fans, but there is a chance you will like it.
