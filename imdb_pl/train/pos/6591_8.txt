An invisible person is a show that everyone must love! It reminds me of a series from the 80's (band, airwolf, knight). Special effects are small, but very effective !! but the most important thing is that they shot the series. It really shows! the entire cast fits perfectly into the roles and it looks like they can do what they want !! especially Paul Ben Victor and Vincent Ventresca. Ventresca really shines in this! It's incredible for me that an actor with such a big sarcasm is his acting style. He does not take a picture in a big movie (Mr. Tarantino was a program you should have directed! show if you can.) it's really worth it !!!
