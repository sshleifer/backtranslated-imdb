Rohmer returns to his historical dramas in the true story of Grace Elliot, an Englishwoman who was in France during the summit of the French Revolution. It was always suspected that Rohmer was a conservative, but who knew he was such a bloody reactionary. If you put aside the unrestrained defense of Rohmer's monarchy (and this is not easy to do, considering, for example, that the lower French classes are portrayed here as hideous bastards), it is in fact an elegant, intelligent and refined film. Rohmer, having no money for the great cinema reconstruction of 18th-century France, has actors playing against the obvious painted cartons. It is a glaring artificial conceit, but it works somehow. And the novice Lucy Russell manages to make a nice character that should not be.
