I was in a bad mood when I saw this movie for the first time. For some reason, he clicked on all my levels, tensions in the family, loneliness and willingness to share his life. It did not hurt that someone you could share your life with was such a beautiful girl as Claire (Cyndy Preston). I also bought a soundtrack for this movie (it's very hard to get it). I loved it and I hope that one day it will come out on DV
