"Journey of Hope" tells of a poor Turkish family and her odyssey of hope, which plunges into despair as they travel to Switzerland in search of prosperity. Although this Oscar-winning film is quite well made, it lacks content and has a lot of unbelievable. A significant part of the duration of the film is 1.7 hours to get on the bus, get off the bus, get on the boat, get off the boat, get in the van, get off the van, etc.; a time that could have been better spent or completely missed. This story has a predictable conclusion, especially for those who are aware of the widespread crime of trafficking in illegal immigrants. A valuable and reasonably funny watch, but overpriced.
