SPOILERS 9/11 is a very good and VERY realistic documentary about the attacks on WTC.2 French filmmakers who are in New York to film NYFD activities are confronted with this event and use it fully. Before 9/11, nothing really happens, which makes the film even more frightening. On the day of the attack it seems to be another boring day at work, but it will change soon. As one of the filmmakers is on the road with firefighters filmed by the first broken plane, this is the only material from the first hit. He goes to the WTC with firefighters and enters the building. When the second plane crashes, people understand that this is not an accident. In the next period, we see firemen who plan to save as many people as possible, in the meantime we hear sounds of strokes, these are the sounds of people who jumped off the tower and fell to the ground, this is the most exhausting moment in the documentary. Then the tower collapses, and our French friend has to run away for his life, you hear him breathing like a madman as he runs out of the building. Then the big sandstorm blasts over him and the screen turns black, he was very happy to survive, and now he can film empty streets in the center of New York. Because this document has so many historical materials and because the movie was meant to be something completely different, this document will probably remain in everyone's memory. I've seen attacks live at home because I had an afternoon, so it makes it even more realistic to watch. 10/10
