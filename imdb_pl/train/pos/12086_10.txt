A great family drama / comedy with MacClaine and Garra, who entertains and warms the heart every time I see it. Definitely recommended for all ages from 9 years to grandma. A wonderful piece from 1962. The story includes Garra, her two children and Aunt Zena (MacClaine) trying to make ends meet without a man as the head of the family. The "family" is heading west to take over the heritage of a long-forgotten relative who left Garr ruined, ruined cafe since the late 1940s. Stubborn Garr, as a sweet but determined mother, introduces the whole family to the restaurant and the opening of the cafe. But wait ...... Auntie Zena is an old circus artist with card tricks, magical powders and jester humor ...... she loves to draw her children in silly and sometimes dangerous games ... ..What happens next, there is a marvelous combination of the "Miracle in the Lords" dropped with the Cuban rocket crises (with authentic TV news from a real event) and the "spiritual" antics that are completely out of control. This film entertains, philosophizes, questions religiousness and gives a worrying look at the terrifying fear of the Cuban missile crisis of October 1962. In the end, there remains the miracle of faith, the family and the newly discovered love. Oh, and the music from the early 1960s is just great! <br /> <br /> I recommend STRONGLY as GOOD GOOD FILM 10 out of 10
