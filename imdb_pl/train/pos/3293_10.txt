If I was ever asked to remember a song from a movie from years ago, it would have to be "Chalo Di Daar Chalo Chand Ke Paar Chalo" because of its importance, the way of singing Summer Mangeshkar and Mohd. Rafi, Kaif Bhopali's lyrics and not to mention cinematic photography when the sailing ship goes out into the black background and shining stars. The second would have to be "Chalte Chalte". Pakeezah was the last of Meena Kumari's films before she died, and the amount of time she took could be seen on the screen. In each of the songs that are pictured, it looks young but then not. But one of the actors who did not change their appearance was the late Raj Kumar, who falls in love with her, and especially in her feet, after accidentally enters her cabin and after seeing them leaves a note describing how beautiful they are. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Pakeezah is a beautiful romantic tale, which, if it is possible at all, should be watched on the big screen only because of the cinematic photography and songs. The film features Meena kumari, Raj Kumar and Ashok Kumar, and the director is Kamal Amrohi. <br /> <br /> Grandson Kamal Amrohi began to revive his grand father's studio, creating a comedy film.
