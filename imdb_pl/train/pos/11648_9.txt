There are people who say it is another "bad language" ultra-Mexican movie. They are right, but more than this movie is a call to create awareness of what we have become. The terrible truth hurts or bores you once you have accepted the paradigm of the third world's life as the only possible goal. One of the most important things of the "Cero y van cuatro" is an open invitation to deep reflection on our present identity. Is this what we are all? Is this all we want to be? I'm abroad and I realized how spoiled the Mexican society was when the Tlahuac incident happened. I still do not understand viewers who witnessed a mass murder. I almost vomited when I saw some of the pictures. It was not Iraq or Rwanda, just a small village near Mexico City, when the craze was carried out with indulgence to the media and governments. Playing a similar situation in this movie deeply shocked me. Other stories were good showing other situations of corruption, dishonesty, betrayal and violence, but I consider "Tamales de Chivo" the best. <br /> <br /> The movie is deeper than some "cabr√≥n" and "pendejo" screams. These are irrelevant compared to people's actions. With a few exceptions, they are perfect examples of human garbage. As in real life, honesty becomes more an exception than the rule in our country. What's more, honesty is rewarded only miraculously.
