I thought this movie was fantastic. It was funny. Kinda reminded me of Spinal Tap. This must see every 70's rock fan. (I hope my friends and I have not been around for twenty years!) <br /> <br /> Bill Nighy gives a great performance as a clumsy singer trying to regain his old spirit. Stephen Rea fits the film perfectly as a glue trying to keep the band together, but it does not work well. <br /> <br /> If you love music and have been in a band, this movie is definitely for you. You will not regret this movie. I know not. Even my family thought it was funny, and that says something.
