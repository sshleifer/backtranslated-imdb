PG-13 was assessed for violence, short sexual humor and drug content. Rating Quebec: 13+ (should be G) Canadian video rating at home: 14A <br /> <br /> I've seen Police Story several times. In my opinion, Police Story is Khan's best film from the 1980s. Initially, I did it because he did not like the second cop movie in which he played The Protector. I have not seen a protector, so I can not compare it. Acting is not so bad, and the plot is quite good. remember the story very well because I saw this movie some time ago, but I remember that this movie has many great actions, acrobatics and comedies, what a good Chan movie needs. If you find Police Story and you're a fan of Chan, buy this movie! <br /> <br /> Action time: 106min <br /> <br /> 9/10
