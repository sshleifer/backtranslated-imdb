Robot Jox does not suffer from history or bad effects. It was 1990, if you know what I'm talking about. RoboCop 2 continued to use stop animation, like most movies in the 1980s. If you look at your greatest hits during this period, most of them did what they could, thanks to the special effects that were available at the time. It was not until the following year, when Terminator 2: Judgment Day was released, a breakthrough in technology took place and players began to use this motif. But if you watch this movie, you'll have fond memories of Transformers, Gundam Wing, and even Power Rangers. The enemy robot is very dangerous. This means that you do not want to face a man without a really good emergency plan. There are also great moments in this film. The traitor / spy is working inside. Whoever thinks he is on your side, supporting you all the way, can be a person you did not expect to be. And that's very embarrassing, do not you agree?
