Was the script more suited to the 30-minute show? Yes, but it still works! I thought the actors did a fantastic job with a somewhat bland scenario, especially Jack Black and Christopher Walken. Most of the people on board really hate this movie. Personally, I do not see how it's possible, but Envy is just one of those movies that you either love or hate. Like Napoleon Dynamite and every Leslie Neilsen movie ever made. Or you think it's one of the worst films ever, or one of the funniest. Do not avoid this video because of reviews. Watch and see if you are one of those who really like it! If you do, I guarantee that it is worth your money. If you do not like it ... well, now you know.
