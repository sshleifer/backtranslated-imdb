The word "classic" is currently too loosely thrown, but this movie deserves to be appealed. The combination of Neil Simon, Walter Matthau (probably the best living comics actor in the world) and the late lament of George Burns creates a comic masterpiece. It is interesting to consider what the movie would look like if death did not prevent Jack Benny from playing the role of George Burns as planned. It just so happens that the downhill scene in Matthau's apartment probably will not be exceeded as a side page. Definitely one of my films on a desert island. <br /> <br /> "Come in !!!!!!!!!"
