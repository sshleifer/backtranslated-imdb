Shown at the San Francisco International Film Festival under the title "Come Undone", on 25, 26 and 27 April 2001. The operator uses techniques that contribute to telling stories. Even in the autumn-winter background for the "present" and spring summer for "retrospection" there may be some difficulties related to continuity. <br /> <br /> Regardless of whether any of the leaders are gay, the actors present the beginner relationship well under real conditions; from physical violence towards oneself to their passionate love. This story draws you slowly into heroes. But when the end is coming, you really care about where the guys are going to be next year! You also want a sequel to find out.
