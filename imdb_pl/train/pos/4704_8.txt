This movie is just great fun. I've seen it several times, but it always has something funny that I remember. The car scene with "ducks and bunnies" is one of my favorites, and I still quote versions of some of Morone's words! <br /> <br /> There are so many jokes that it's amazing. But I still love Michael Keaton!
