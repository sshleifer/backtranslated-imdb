From the first five episodes of the short series Hammer House of Horror, the fifth episode with the wonderful title "The House that Bled to Death" is probably the most frightening. As a big fan for many years from the gothic Hammer Studios horror movies, I wonder what took me so long until I finally started watching the show quite recently. So far, I've only seen the first five episodes and I have a strong feeling that the best is yet to come, but even if the series remains as entertaining as the first five episodes, I will be happy. While the second and third episodes were great for viewing their morbid and ingeniously dark sense of humor, this fifth entry is definitely one of the first five that provides the most authentic Horror. The episode begins when an older man kills his wife from unknown motivations. Many years later William (Nicholas Ball) and Emma Peters (Rachel Davies) move home with their little daughter Sophie (Emma Ridley). However, soon after the introduction, the family must know that something awful is happening at home, which seems to be haunted ... The second episode directed by Francis Megahy is much better than his average previous entry: "(Episode 4), and quite unknown actors they provide good performances. The film is also well made in terms of effects, cinematography and score. "The House that Bled to Death" is a solid episode that provides elements that my fellow Hammer fans should see in Short Horror short story. The film provides a terrifying atmosphere, real moments of fright and intelligent twists, and from the beginning to the end is full of tension and entertainment. In general, it is highly recommended for Hammer fans.
