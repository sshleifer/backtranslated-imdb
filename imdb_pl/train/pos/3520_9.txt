This is the movie "B Series" Noir, and my voice reflects his membership in this genre. I saw this movie yesterday in the left-bank cinema in Paris, where he opened a two-week film noir run. The film has some drawbacks, yes, but much for the delicious elements to ignore. <br /> <br /> As the previous reviewer has noted, the drum scene is amazing! (Films B may enter movies A, in which they have been banned!) And the plot is intriguing. As for the franchise tone, please do not agree: for me it is appropriately mysterious; only the right shade is terrifying. You have to remember that something like German expressionism is happening here (the director, Robert Siodmark, he was a German who came to Hollywood during the war), so the atmosphere of exaggeration fits the whole movie. At least that's the way it is for me. <br /> <br /> However, it is the beautiful Ella Raines, who in her third recognized performance, delighted the viewer throughout the film. Type "Girl Friday" with a great similarity to Gene Tierney, it's strange that she did not become famous. But it's so good here that I just ordered her film ("Impact") from the Internet and I can not wait to see it.
