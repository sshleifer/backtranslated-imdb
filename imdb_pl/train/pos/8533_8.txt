This film is more Lupine than most, especially with Funimation. Besides the bad dub, it's not bad. <br /> <br /> The first hour is very similar to the comic (on which the whole third thing Lupine rests). Lupine is trying to get a huge treasure. Fujiko uses Lupine's weakness for women to try to get something out of it. The last track is not so bad, it is with other women, but of course Fujiko is still his number one. <br /> <br /> Many other Lupine movies are more family-friendly with cuss than Lupine. I think that every good Lupine fan will be pleasantly surprised (I know that I have heard a lot of bad things about this movie). It can be a little bit better without the small animations going on during the subtitles (make it a bit nauseating), but overall, it's not a bad movie. Good enough to be one of the few that I watch again in Lupine III's films.
