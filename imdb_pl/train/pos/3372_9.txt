The time has come to pay homage to the great Kharton Heston after his recent transition, but this film is not the only one. His other films from the previous generation were BEN HUR, THE TEN COMMANDENTS, OMEGA MAN and PLANET OF THE APES were his better works. <br /> <br /> This film was made in 1973 and aims to tell the future land, in 2022 it is so overcrowded that the human race was manipulated by the authorities to consume a commonly produced food product called "Soylent" Green ", produced with a human body. This bizarre and unbelievable movie was just as ridiculous at the time of its release as it is now, and assumes that the population of India, which at this stage would amount to about 2 billion, would then be meat eaters without knowing it. <br /> <br /> Charlton Heston's character conceals the secret international conspiracy that global powers have come up with to meet the nutritional needs of overpopulation using cannibalism. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for the producers of this film the green message they provide is not a Green Party about today's ethos, thank God. Cannibalism was practiced by the indigenous population of New Zealand, Fiji and Borneo up to 40 years before the creation of this film, but has long been abandoned by human civilization. <br /> <br /> Another stupid prediction in the film is that women become quasi sexual slaves that reverse the wave of radical feminism that grew in 1972 when the film was made. <br /> <br /> The movie was stupid then and it is so stupid now, but it contains a very incredible last movie performance of the late and great Edward G. Robinson, but there is still no valid reason to return to the film for reasons other than academic. <br /> <br /> This is a dud movie and I do not even recommend it to baby boomers or Charlton Heston fans. All the other reviews of the film I have read sound the same, referring to the dystopian society, in which the centralized subject seems to concern only the US in which the ecological disaster occurred. <br /> <br /> The only merit of the film is that the earth is struggling with overpopulation.
