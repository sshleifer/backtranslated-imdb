**** SPOILER ALERT **** Throughout Australia, summer has turned into a torrent of rain and baseball hail that has wreaked havoc on coastal cities such as Sydney. It was in these hectic conditions that a tax lawyer, David Burton, Richard Chamberlain, got involved in the case as a lawyer in the death of a local aboriginal who was found dead in front of a bar in Sydney. <br /> <br /> Having five other aborigines arrested for Billy Cormans, Athol Compton, the death of the police determines the police coroner that Billy died of drowning not through violence, although he had bruises on his neck and shoulders. However, the court decided to prosecute against the five for his death, accusing them of murder instead of murder. <br /> <br /> David defending the Fives does not receive any defense from them, and the accused attackers decide to stay in peace and keep it happen to Billy for themselves and take what comes to them from the court. One of the accused, Chris, David Gulpili, begins to somehow attack David's dreams, as if he wanted to tell him what really lies behind Billy's death. <br /> <br /> Dawid, at first, he did not really care about Chris's dreams that they would be true when he met him in court. Chris confirms David's dreams by showing him a strange-looking black rock that David saw in Chris's dreams. Later, I met Chris and, as it turns out, he was an Aboriginal shaman, Charlie (Nandjiwarna Amagula), who came to his house that evening, David was told that, like Charlie, he had the spiritual powers that he inherited from his mother's grandfather. These powers will reveal to him a future that is related to the strange weather conditions that flood the Australian continent. Earth, Chris tells David, he's undergoing a gigantic cycle of purification with the old world to be washed away, and the new world is ready to take his place. <br /> <br /> David is confused about what both Chris and Charlie say to him, but as the rain rises and the waves rise, he feels something terrible will happen. David wants to know if it's all folk folklore, or are there any scientific facts or logic behind the end of world revelations. <br /> <br /> It is now obvious that both Chris and Charlie are members of the aboriginal tribe in the heart of modern Sydney. Only he can take off Chris and his four friends for the murder of Billy. Because the Australian government will not pursue tribal aborigines, leaving all justice to the tribes themselves. Even so, Chris refused to admit to membership in the native tribe, and he and his four friends were convicted for murder in Billy's death, and the judge issued sentences within a few days. <br /> <br /> David decided now to find out what was the reason for Chris's silence and why Billy had to die, he was taken by Chris to the crime scene. That's where David learns that Billy betrayed members of the Chris tribe, going there, and Billy was not a member of the indigenous tribe of Chris. He also learned that he himself had some spiritual connection with the Austrian aborigines, as both Charlie and his stepfather, Fr. Burton, David Parslow. <br /> <br /> The stage is now prepared for the great and final clean-up cycle David saw in both his night dreams and the visions of the day. It appears in the form of a massive tidal wave flowing from the Pacific Ocean to the Australian city of Sydney, and then submerges the entire continent.
