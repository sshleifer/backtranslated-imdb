For someone who remembers Jane in the Daily Mirror, watching this movie is an exercise with nostalgia. In this context, it is wonderful, but younger viewers would undoubtedly discover that the comedy is inert and would lose the point where the actors are cartoon characters. The plot is also a bit unnecessary for today's audience, but very well reflects the naivety of the 40's and 50's. Jane, you must remember, she was part of the escapist fantasy of war, created to increase the soldiers' morale. She gave the double meaning to the "strip" in the striped cartoon. <br /> <br /> The story has something to do with the stories of Edgar Rice Burroughs and Rider Haggard. The subject would be known to readers in that era, a group of inept Nazis foiled by a few equally dark Englishmen and of course set in the African jungle. <br /> <br /> For fans of Jane, he must see. For the rest of you, a damp rustle. <br /> <br />
