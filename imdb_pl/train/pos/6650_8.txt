I would not like to comment on how good the movie was or what the disadvantages were because I am not a professional film critic and I do not have enough knowledge about making films. I only know that making this kind of film in the first shot is a great achievement and I would like to congratulate the director for that. However, in some of the reviews I read, critics complained that the relationship between Hiralal and his brothers was not underlined, and his siblings were completely erased from history. Now, I would like to emphasize here that, as the name suggests, this is not a film about the brothers of Hiralala, it is a film about the relationship of Mahatma Gandhi and his son Hiralal Gandhi, nothing more. If we start complaining about the fact that some characters do not work in the movie, it would be a bit unfair because these characters do not fit the picture, no matter how important they were. So I think it would be better if we stick to the main idea and stop satisfying criticism. <br /> <br /> Enjoy !!!!
