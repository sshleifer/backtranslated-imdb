It happened to me to see this movie two or more times and I found it to be well done! World War II ended freshly and the so-called "Cold War" began. This film can thus be defined as one of the best "propaganda", patriotic films preparing Americans, and secondly, people from the still-forming "Western bloc of NATO" countries to face the imminent threat. The film celebrates the power of the United States for centuries and then moves on to the present war that has just ended. The way of describing the discovery of the American continent by Columbus and the nice "espisode" of New Amsterdam and the purchase of Manhattan from a drunken local Indian is nice and funny. propaganda in time)! :)
