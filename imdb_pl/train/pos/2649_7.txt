A walk with cavemen, led by Alec Baldwin, is a look at all species of hominids (this is us!) From the last 5 million years: who they were, how they looked and how they died out. With a very interesting scientific look at information about these species, Walking with Cavemen also investigates what makes us human. I waited several weeks to watch it and I was not disappointed.
