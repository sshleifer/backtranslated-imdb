Oh, what's the fun here? <br /> <br /> Amy Heckerling has a talent for directing comedy (Fast Times in Ridgemont High, Look Who Talking), but it seems that she told the actors to go out and have fun. Micheal Keaton is delighted with the role of Johnny, easily his best performance on the screen. Joe Piscopo is great, as Danny Vermin appropriately named, and the directors of shame did not notice. I even mentioned Richard Dimitri playing Moroni and the unique vocabulary of the character. I think it is not a coincidence that most of the character's name is saved as MORON. <br /> <br /> Good lines are sprinkled throughout the film, with Peter Boyle, Griffit Dunne.Maurren Stapleton, Merilu Henner gave good lines. Even actors with smaller roles, such as Dick Butkus and Alan Hale, are doing well. <br /> <br /> recommend it to a friend.
