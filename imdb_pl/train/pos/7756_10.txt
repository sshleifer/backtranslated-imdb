I'm not sure if it's a masterpiece or just a dingy fluff raised by performances and visualizations. In any case, I'm sure I loved it. From the wonderfully twisted, gloomy, interwoven tales to the wonderfully evil performances of Robert Stacek and Dorothy Malone, to the lively, flashy color with which everything is captured, it is high-class garbage and great fun. Not to mention the funny, crafty and poorly concealed sexual undertones that permeate the whole movie, always threatening to escape from the image to dialogue, but never do. I would be lying if I said that the pure entertainment value of the film did not contribute to my love for it, but there is some bizarre artistry for unintentional (or maybe?) Comedy and I really, really dug it up. I could really enter this melodramatic music.
