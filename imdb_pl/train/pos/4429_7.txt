Personally, I thought that the movie is quite good, Tadanobu Asano plays with Ichi the Killer fame very well. I really can not say much about this story, but there were also parts that confused me a bit, and generally I think the film is too long. In addition, the film contained excellent, well-functioning fights, and many places were beautifully shot, great effects and many sword games. In my opinion, another solid effort of Tadanobu Asano. Well, I can not really say about the movie anymore, but if you only look at Asian cinema, then Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon or House of Flying Daggers, I would suggest that you try to rent it, but if you're a dying hard Asian cinema fan I would say it must be be a very good Japanese movie in your collection.
