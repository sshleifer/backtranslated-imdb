Japanese animators have a unique freedom in animation, which is why they tend to go out with such movies, films that eventually hit the hard drives of anime fans and student floors, but they do not notice anyone outside their country of origin. Cat soup is one of those movies that have to be experienced on drugs or deeply analyzed from western eyes. Really, it is just a beautiful detailed surreal journey. <br /> <br /> There is no real dialogue that facilitates the transfer of other interested parties who are not interested in such things as subtitles. The cat and his half-dead (dead brain?) Sister travel through different landscapes of imagination and associations. There is a general or no water theme (probably because of the cat's drowning at the beginning? Probably because of the title?). There is an interesting kind of Genesis. There is a pig that eats itself. Elephant made of water. And it's great, fascinating, exciting and fun - as long as you do not see it in pharmacies that can not experience anything unique visually, without comparing it to a sour tour. Ultimately, the movie turns off, adding another convincing level of self-reflection to the proceedings. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
