Any Way the Wind Blows is Tom Barmans (also known as the first movie from the debut film "dEUS"). The film made in Antwerp (Belgium) begins on a sunny Friday morning and skips quite superficially between the events that fill the day of a dozen or so main heroes. When the movie ends, you have many things to think about because most of the different story lines remain wide open. <br /> <br /> The film has a (purely instrumental) soundtrack that will satisfy your socks. In most scenes, music really improves the overall atmosphere and atmosphere, making the film hallucinate to watch at certain times. The main stage of the film, the party, is very well made. <br /> <br /> The director did not hesitate to use the techniques of video clips, having his main characters dancing on one of the best soundtracks, I heard recently. <br /> <br /> The script is great. The angles and colors of the cameras are very well chosen. "Costumes" are very hot and very "seventies". And I loved (most) acting. <br /> <br /> What I liked the most about the film are the subtle accents of absurdity, surrealistic, very dry and even cynical humor that are intertwined. <br /> <br /> Not saying that he is a comedy (this film is certainly not a comedy, but rather an alternative work of art), he still manages to chant the audience and sometimes even laugh out loud. <br /> <br /> This is another directorial debut, which should not be the end. I hope that in the future I will see more films by Tom Barman because I had a good time. Your health.
