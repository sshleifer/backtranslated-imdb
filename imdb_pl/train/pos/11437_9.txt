One of the most unbelievable works of animation. Although this is the most sophisticated use of the "cut-out" animation method (a la "South Park"), the real talent of "Twice Upon a Time" is the vocal characteristics of Lorenzo Music's (Carlton from TV "Rhoda") Woody Allen-ish Ralph- the-all-purpose-Animal is the focal point. The "accidental nightmare" sequence is undoubtedly one of the best animations ever filmed.
