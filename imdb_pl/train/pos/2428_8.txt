As an old white housekeeper, I still appreciate that Laurence Fishburne is one of our best actors. anyone who appreciates his work as in Deep Cover, can enjoy watching the actor's incredible acting range. Because I think it's his directorial debut, it may turn out to be even more interesting. All acting is pretty good. If you can not take away the scrapen worlds of lower Manhattan or the reality of a criminal life (not glorified shooters), then this is not a movie that you would enjoy. This is Mr. Fishburne's usual contribution to extremely subtle relationships. I'd like to see how Larry and Anthony Hopkins go to each other in a movie.
