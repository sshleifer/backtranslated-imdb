I am a huge fan of films where people are deceived, and the House of Games is almost the top of the genre of "movies where people are spinning." In short, it is a unique thriller that keeps you on the edge of your place, delivering interesting characters from many levels and never really revealing what's happening, while throwing many surprises and surprises to completely upset what you've just seen. The film brings a lot of audience and despite the fact that we know about it; it's still difficult to guess where it's going, and every twist is a surprise. As I mentioned before, I am a big fan of flaws in movies, and the story of this movie concerns a psychiatrist who accepts a patient with a lot of debt to another gambler. Then he goes to the gambler, trying to help his patient, and on the way he gets involved in the art of reading people in order to make a deception. <br /> <br /> House of Games breathes a disgusting atmosphere all the time, and David Mamet is good at fixing his movie on the underground levels of the city. The film is also well-preserved, and all those interested bring life and faith to their heroes with the greatest skill. Joe Mantegna plays the role of a cheater in the heart of the movie, and although his performance is somewhat filmed, he is always reliable and credible as the villain of the song. Lindsay Crouse plays next to him as a psychiatrist seduced by his work, and is again credible in his role. Maybe he is not the best observer, but at least he can act. The way the movie makes its story, however, is the main star of the series and you will no doubt be amazed many times how the film manages to amaze and deceive the viewer. Sometimes it's almost as if we were in the middle of the action and cheated by the crooks in the movie. Another thing that's great about this movie is the way it shows the audience how to draw some cons, which is useful if you want to get $ 20, say. In summary, House of Games is a truly exciting ride.
