I have been watching "Dick Tracy" for years and as a result he has become an important part of my life - he was with me throughout my childhood and often saw it. Seeing it now, as an adult, it is still a very good movie - dark, satirical and incredibly misunderstood. The only thing you can say is the nomination for the Oscar that Pacino received - except that it is rarely discussed and has not caused much confusion when it appeared. <br /> <br /> Pacino is exaggerated top, but with good results, because it has lots of fun. Beatty is great as Dick Tracy, and behind the camera he manages to capture the atmosphere of film comic noir better than any other movie, maybe I've ever seen. A look at one scene from the movie is breathtaking. Lighting, velvet accents and smog / smoke create a great effect. <br /> <br /> There are some really funny scenes, including one by Dustin Hoffman as "Mumbles", and I do not think there will be any disadvantages when it comes to acting - even the obligatory childhood figure is much better than it is They expected. <br /> <br /> In general, a really great movie that has been misunderstood over the years since its release and is unbelievably undervalued only 5.7 / 10 average on IMDb. Critics' opinions are very positive (see RottenTomatoes.com) and after watching the movie once again it is not difficult to understand why - it is a perfect example of capturing the essence of the comic, from style to eccentricity. <Br /> <br /> Highly recommended. 4.5 / 5 stars.
