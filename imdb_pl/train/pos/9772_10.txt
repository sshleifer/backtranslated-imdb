Theodore Rex is probably the greatest cinema experience of all time and is certainly a milestone in human culture, civilization and artistic expression !! In this fascinating intellectual work, Jonathan R. Betuel adapts to the great film-makers of the 20th century, such as Francis Ford Copola, Martin Scorcese, Orson Welles and Roman Polanski. The special effects are nothing short of breathtaking and make every Spielberg work look banal and elementary. At the time of its release, Theodore Rex was such a revolutionary jewel that he raised the bar for creating films to levels never foreseen by filmmakers. The concept of creating not only a movie with dinosaurs, but an adaptation of an action-packed, exciting crime novel in which a "talking" dinosaur with a postmodern name such as "Theodore" and a changed existential policeman, as we know it. The world will never be the same after experiencing such wonderful beauty. Observing Theodore Rex is very similar to looking at God's face and listening to him saying: "You are my most beloved creature." This is one of the few movies where you just die!
