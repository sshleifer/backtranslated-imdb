Dirty Sanchez is a more extreme British version of Jackass in which four boys (Pritchard, Dainton, Joycey and Pancho) try to hurt and humiliate themselves. The reason why the performance is better than Jackass is that most stuntmen are not planned, which makes the reaction much more fun. There are three series of the series, the first follows them and looks at their lives for a long time, eg there is an episode about their love, work etc. The second series sends boys to try different professions. The third follows their European route. It seems that the boys are becoming more and more bold when the series goes through the series. In my opinion, the third series is the best, but trust me when I say, if you have a week of stomach, DO NOT ASK because you are slightly seeing a lot of blood and vomit in each episode.
