Francesca Annis, Michael Kitchen And Robson Green !! Wow, what a trio ... OK, so it's not Anna Karenina, but it's a good love story, very well written and done well by everyone. Even a few "laugh-loud" moments mixed up with quite serious insights on fidelity, age bias and problems related to aging parents / Alzheimer's. <br /> <br /> Bizarre guitar music has also added to the story. br /> <br /> When I was a fan of Mrs. Annis 'from' Lillie '(in the' 70s) and Mr. Kitchena from 'The Buccaneers' and 'Enchanted April', I recently discovered Mr Green ('Me and Mrs Jones', 'Touching the Evil' etc.), Making me ask a question - why have not I seen "Reckless" until recently? !! Although more "chicks" than something that the man will be sitting on, it's perfect for a lazy afternoon watching.
