Sure, it's been 65 years since making the last Thalberg production. But other members of IMDB, come on, this movie is certainly one of the masterpieces of the 1930s! To 10. <br /> <br /> This was the first movie I saw in the New York Museum of Modern Art, circa 1970 (I was a teenager). Dear appearance, but with scenes of such misery, masterfully photographed, often exciting and always engrossing, for me it was MGM's film at its best. What did the audience feel when they saw the locust attack, the person through the destruction of the court, the terrifying poverty and then the splendor of wealth. <br /> <br /> Last week, those who watched the Oscars had the opportunity to see the "senior" Oscar winner, Luise Rainer. How great it is to see an actress who probably performed one of the most masterful, haunting performances in history, choosing a return to the ceremony. but do not blame Luise. Talkies had only a decade when it was released, and her dialogue was limited. But like Olan, her visual and vocal use is unforgettable. <br /> <br /> A large scale and touch that a movie fan might want!
