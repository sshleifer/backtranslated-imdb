I've never been huge in IMAX movies. They're cool, but once you finish this initial tide, "Whoa, you feel like flying!" The films themselves are usually quite trivial and ordinary. <br /> <br /> The exception was the powerful "Everest", the exciting "Wild California", and now the "Human body" of the BBC, a very large look at the inside of our bodies. <br /> <br /> Our bodies are machines with complexity that are simply unimaginable. This 50-minute film can last 10 hours, and yet it would not reach all systems working in tandem, as I write this review and listen to the radio, and most of us consider it for granted. <br /> <br /> Here you can see the interior of the pumping heart (looks like a foreign spaceship), the inside of the lungs, tiny hair in the tympanic membrane that processes the sound, the child's development inside the mother's womb and, surprisingly, a few ... less attractive features that I thought would run away from it (pimples, whipping acid in the stomach ...) <br /> <br /> This movie also has a rather funky style, which distinguishes it from other IMAX documentaries. For example, we've all seen sperm get into the egg, but have you ever seen the melody of Marvin Gaye's 'Let's Get It On'? Such creative moments make "Human body" not only a lesson of health, but also fun.
