I have a 19-month-old baby and I'm tired of watching Care Bears all the time. Rooney is a great dancer who cares if he is gay. This guy had to be a cheerleader or something. <br /> <br /> Beats Barney, I can not get the songs out of my head .... she must ... stop singing ........ Doodlebops songs. ....... NOW. <br /> <br /> It must have 10 lines of text, so I have to continue ..... and when they say all Canadian stuff, like OOOUT Aboooot. Whacky Canadians ..... Jazmine is very rhyming, must be Dutch. <br /> <br /> Knock knock who's there, Dee Dee, super Hottie <br /> <br /> Bob's bus driver can not dance, take Rooney lessons
