I remembered that it was one of my favorite books as a child and I wanted to read it to my five-year-old daughter. I knew that the film would be released soon, so we went to the library for a book and gave us passes for the next day! We ran home and spent the afternoon reading a book so that we could compare. It was not necessary. The only common feature of the book and the movie is the name of the main character, the fact that there is a bet and a lot of food worms. Oh, I almost forgot, the kid who cooks most worms, he likes to present his masterpieces with a French accent. As children know each other, the number of children involved, how the plant was created, the number of worms that need to be eaten, the time frame in which the worms must eat, how they are cooked, the progress of friendship, the culmination of the scene, etc. NOTHING is not the same. But somehow it did not spoil my film. The characters are nice and the movie did not disappoint me. Speaking cautiously for parents, there was one moment when you could hear the adults in the room draw their breath together and then Billy's younger brother described his penis as a "shaky dick". The troublesome part came when my daughter asked those sitting around us: "Does anyone know what a stupid dick?" Lol. This and occasional "closure" is as foul as this movie. My daughter thought she could get sick around worms 3 and 4 (and just in case she kept an empty container for nacho), but the worm was fine 6. We both really liked the movie and we spent a great time sharing this experience.
