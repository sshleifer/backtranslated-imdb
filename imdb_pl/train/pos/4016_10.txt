This wonderful, small movie contains all the elements that made Spaghetti Western so exciting and fun: GREAT music (by one of the few ... not only ... a female composer to work in the genre, Nora Orlandi), WONDERFUL sequences of action (and very nasty for this day!), and BEAUTIFUL scenery and sets (all in Almeria, of course in Spain). It also has a very good story with a nice tragic romance. Actors perform wonderful work - with truly exceptional performances by Lawrence Dobkin and Rosalba Neri (in the most important role of women in Spaghetti Western .. outside Cardinale in "Once Upon a Time in the West" Leone). Without posting any spoilers, let me just say that this movie contains one of the best endings of every movie I've ever seen!
