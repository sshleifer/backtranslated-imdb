Simple, meaningful and provides an emotional blow. I regularly go through boring short films and it is always nice to come across something that has a simple and enlightened message, without any gripes or self-satisfaction. <br /> <br /> A boy at school must attend a lesson when his friend plays a truant and receives the most important lesson in his life, only to discover that when he does not have enough copies, he must share with the school bully . <br /> <br /> Unlike most short films involving children or actors that these children keep in check, and this is reliable. The soundtrack nicely complements the excitement of the song, and the punch of the movie works well.
