This is without a doubt the biggest movie in history. It is almost incomprehensible, even with many repetitions, trying to find out what exactly is happening. The film was almost completely improvised and contains random music numbers, commercials, contests that can be mailed, and many other innovations. Besides, what other movies do episodes of Martin Luther King, Jr? To decipher the movie, hunt for the director's book I Was Curious. Everything will become clear. It's a wonderful and bold experiment in improvised recursive filming. Triumph. Now, if only someone released a version with color * other * than white ... subtitles have a tendency to wash out and become invisible.
