I just watched the movie for the third time and enjoyed Lindsay Crouse and the rest of the cast as before. It just gets better and better. You just have to admire a carefully measured way of speaking, slow, deliberate action, everything is exactly right. <br /> <br /> Really one of the best and definitely my favorite!
