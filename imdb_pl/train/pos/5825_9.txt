Most of Stoogefili considers this to be the best lack of Stooges, and they are right. Curly is a cry disguised as a tramp as "Senorita Cucaracha", and Moe and Larry are in "Senor Mucho" and "Senor Gusto" respectively. Christine McIntyre's beautiful operatic voice is fully mastered - she was actually a trained opera singer - and that's great. The great Gino Corrado is as funny as a pompous Italian singer terrorized by Stooges at a social party. Some really funny gags, a good direction and very tight editing make this game the Stooges fertility peak. Even more surprising is that Curly had serious health problems at the time, and in the few shorts he had done during this period, he was clearly ill; his sense of time is very distant, he talks very slowly and hesitantly, and he has problems moving. Fortunately, his health improved when he made the film and it shows. The classic comedy Stooge, which even non-Stooge fans like (I had a girl who could not stand Stooges, but even she laughed at it). You must see.
