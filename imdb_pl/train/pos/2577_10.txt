My father grew up, watching George Reeves as Superman, and when I was a small kid, he had episodes on VHS and let me see them, including this movie (if you like, I'll pass them on to the family). > <br /> Clark Kent and Lois Lane are sent to a small town with an oil mine, and moles are emerging moles of radioactive men and targeted by the city, which is considered deadly and Superman must stop this chaos. <br /> <br /> Watching is so great and enjoyable. Special effects and old-style sound - the crew drew such beauty thanks to such a small technology. George Reeves was my hero when I was a small child, and now I'm 16, it just shows how timeless and classic these adventures are.
