Vanilla Sky is a remake of the 2001 film Abre Los Ojos (Open Your Eyes) from 2001. And, in my opinion, a much more human and emotional version. Tom Cruise plays David Aames, a selfish egoist who accepts the emotions of other people as self-evident and thinks only of himself. Jason Lee plays Brian Shelby, David's best and in many respects his only friend. Penelope Cruz plays Sofia Serrano, Brian's girlfriend, who accompanied him to David's birthday party. Cameron Diaz plays Julie Gianni, David's occasional friend. Kurt Russell plays Dr. Curtis McCabe, a psychologist interviewing David. All their interactions and consequences make Vanilla Sky one of the most exciting and complex thrillers ever made. I will not explain the plot anymore because it is much more convincing, the less you know. Ignore all people who call this video too confusing to follow it. If you pay attention, you will not be confused. The film is very complex, but not misleading. And in my opinion one of the best movies ever made.
