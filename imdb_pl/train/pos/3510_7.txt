True movie fans will love this authentic movie. <br /> <br /> I do not agree with trolls who rate this movie as one star and call it unrealistic. Although I do not have a background or come from an environment of heroes, I spent many years working in lower-income and working class districts and I feel that acting is very real and represents the behavior of teenagers. I do not know what is the basis of others' comments that the film is "unrealistic". Dialog is great. <br /> <br /> The low production value did not bother me much. I felt that natural lighting strengthened the nature of the film. The focus was only on the plot and character development, not on the brilliant Hollywood requisition or melodrama. <br /> <br /> I completely took over the motivations and reactions of the character. Acting was reliable and impressive for new and non-actors. <br /> <br /> If your idea for a good movie is Transformers or Fast & Furious, skip it. If you like good dramas driven by characters, see them. <br /> <br /> (Referring to negative commentators as "trolls": click on their names and you will see that most of them have no other reviews or only negative reviews).
