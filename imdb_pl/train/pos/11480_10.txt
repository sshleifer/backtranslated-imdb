Cut to the chase: This is one of the most amazing, the most intense movies I've seen in a long time. The first movie of the year that completely surprised me. I could barely leave the theater, I was so overwhelmed. <br /> <br /> I stared at the screen for about fifteen minutes, trying to find a way to describe the power of this movie, it simply fails. Emphasizing one aspect - the format of a video journal in the style of a documentary, unwavering presentation of events, the strength of the characters - just seems to trivialize all this. Some may laugh that every killer can be characterized as normal. But not all assassins are crazy about crazy people frothing in their mouths. Many are quite regular, humble people. They are simply connected differently. <br /> <br /> And this is probably the most chilling thought in my veins.
