Other commentators described in detail the plot and social parables and comments (or better) that I could, but I would like to join my admiration for this little jewel of the film. It holds up well over 50 years later in every category - script, acting, photography, set design, sound design ... it's really a classics. This was my first contact with the "young" Alec Guinness and is obvious from the first cages, which made him so special that he eventually received the title of nobility. <br /> <br /> I only rate it as "8" because it is rather a light parable that explores human nature, but does not really make it through; and because the plot is easier at the end than solving the conflict between the inventor and the mill's employees and industrialists who chase him around the city. In addition, a few minutes of thought reveal the basic disadvantage of the logic of the scenario - consumption is not a decisive factor when buying new clothes (especially clothes); children grow up, people change sizes, gain and lose weight, and always use the latest fashion trends and have as long as looms have woven fabrics. And if nothing else, the producer would make a fortune by supplying indestructible material for military uniforms (especially BDU). <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, this is a great movie. If you have a chance to see him on the classic movie channel, you should.
