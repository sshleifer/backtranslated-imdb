I was not a fan of watching this movie at all, but when my gf called me and said he has a free advanced pass, I marked it only because of seeing eva longoria and laughing at the joke of biggs. <br /> in general, it was better than I expected, but not much. it was like a hybrid, how to lose a guy in 10 days and like heaven. a typical romantic comedy with her moments. the film was however quite short (about 85 minutes), but it was enough to tell the whole story, build some character development and have a decent ending. the whole idea of ​​the spirit of the haunting ex-husband was an interesting plot to imitate. eva was good at maintaining sarcasm and Paul Rudd, and the rest of the cast (especially Jason Biggs) kept laughing at a steady pace. <br /> <br /> I liked the movie in general just because I had a lot of laughter to not let me rest, because I would give the film a lower rating. Hey, this is a chick and I'm reviewing this movie from a persepctive, okay guy, it would be a more honest fight if the females looked through this movie and thought about it.
