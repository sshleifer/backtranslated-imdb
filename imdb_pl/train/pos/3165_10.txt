It was one of the funniest and largest sitcoms on national television. It is unfortunate that the show is not counted among the great sitcoms to which it really belongs. The actors did a great job, and the seasons from the first to the sixth were the peak moment. Although the seventh season was not as great compared to the previous six, it was still fun. Season 8 was a real problem. Without the grace of Topher and Ashton Kutcher, the series simply fell apart. Let's not say the other actors were not great if they left one of the two main characters, such as Danny Masterson, Wilder Valderamma Kurtwood Smith, Debra Jo Rupp, Mila Kunis and Laura Prepon (Don Starks and Tommy Chong are also great). show that it would have the same effect. And joining Randy (Josh Meyers) did not help either, because he was not well received by the show's fans. I believe that if the show ended a year ago, he would certainly be in history as one of the best series. Season 8 was a bit boring, but the finale was perfect. I will miss this concert, I just hope that one day I will wake up to see that the show comes back as a concert from the 80s with the same cast, because I will miss it.
