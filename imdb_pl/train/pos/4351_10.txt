Peter Falk is a diverse and talented actor. The film is well-written, and acting looks like a real life. For all Columbo lovers it's a great job. Because it shows what Peter Falk's talent is. He is not a detective, he is a retired carpet seller. Before credits start to play a role, you already want to watch. An interesting part of the movie is that the message will concern every person who watches it; the depth of its accuracy will be the only difference. It is a pity that the Hollywood liberals only promote stupidity and skin because it is the kind of film that business people should be proud of. It would be a great movie that can be turned into a live game.
