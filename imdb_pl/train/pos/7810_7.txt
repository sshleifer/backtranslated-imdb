What does "Cry Freedom" look like? It is simply a great and unique experience in creating South Africa and how Black people in this country were repressed by whites. The protagonist of the story is Donald Woods (Kevin Kline), editor-in-chief of the Daily Dispatch newspaper in South Africa. Woods writes several articles in which he speaks critically about the views of Steve Biko (Denzel Washington). Soon, Woods meets Biko and changes his views about him, and also begins to understand what the authorities are doing black in South Africa (from the very beginning, even from the head of the police). When Biko dies in police custody, Woods decides he must write a book about him and that no matter what he publishes. But Woods must escape from his country to publish this book, and he must also put his family in second place so that the world can find out the truth. <br /> <br /> Attenborough managed to make a good movie about people, with the main message that black and white are the same because we are all human. History leads us to South Africa and this film (film) is a great way to get to know what has happened in this world, and I am disappointed that only 3,200 people rated this film. This is a movie that we can all learn from. Although it is a bit too long, this story could not be presented in a shorter way, because the director wanted to show us how hard it is for Woods to publish this book after Biko's death. <br /> <br /> Also relations between Woods and Biko have been shown well, just like the families of these two people and all the problems they are going through. But sometimes sacrifices must be made (Biko's death) so that truth can be enjoyed (Woods' book).
