I watched it every night on VH1 last week. This is a great portrait revealing an epidemic of drugs and the way drugs were displayed in the media in the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s. Woodstock, Easy Rider, The Beatles, Death of Morrison, Hendrix, Joplin are here. Vh1 has shaped a complete, intricate picture of life and times of "drug years". From Sanfrancisco Bay Area to Studio 54, this film documents the evolution and progress in the drug industry as well as death and a new life that has breathed into American culture. From Marijuana to LSD to Cocaine, this document shows how drugs got into the country, the hippie movement, conservative resistance and the way drugs have influenced art (music, movies, etc.). It contains a lot of fascinating interviews and recordings with rolls. <br /> <br /> Drugs: A trip up in the smoke of Madness Blow Boogie Nights
