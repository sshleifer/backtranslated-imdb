this film is practically impossible to describe. the alternative title "Do not Look Up" is much more descriptive. Like most Japanese cinema, history is not as linear as American. The story revolves around the director who makes the story about the WW2 deserter. The set is haunted (?) By an actress who died (?) During the making of a television program in the 1960s. the director is ONLY the one who saw this program. if you've seen the Ring (director Hideo Nakata is the same) and liked him, you'll like the actress-ghost. I loved the actress spirit much more than the ring. a really frightening and disturbing movie. 10!
