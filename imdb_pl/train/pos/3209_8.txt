Interesting combination of comments that would be difficult to add to something constructive. I will try, however. It was a very good action movie with some great sets. You will notice that I have described the species. I did not get into the lack of characteristics and did not criticize acting. Enjoy, if what it is people, well above-average action movie. I could continue, but commented.
