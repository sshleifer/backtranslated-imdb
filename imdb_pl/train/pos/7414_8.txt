It was a very nice movie. A funny but moving look at the family and the responsibilities it entails. The story of a man who returns home from his life in the city to the bathing house of fathers in a small Chinese village. There he learns to appreciate and even cherish things he left at home to escape. The film is as beautiful visually as it is emotionally beautiful.
