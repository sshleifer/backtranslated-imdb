Acting in this movie was great, but mixed with the truth about the condition of many Africans in South Africa made the heart beat him. It is good that the writer has isolated Boesman and Lena from others fleeing from the houses so that we can fully participate in their triumphs and failures; conflicts that they shared when they grew together and shared. It's worth seeing when you put a movie in the right context.
