I'm a big fan of classical cinema, but I'm just getting into silent movies. Many silent films do not draw my attention, but Show People is a notable exception. <br /> <br /> Marion Davies and William Haines are simply great in this photo. Davies in particular shows a wide range, changing from a giggling little girl to an asterisk who takes herself too seriously. <br /> <br /> Show People is a fast movie with a fantastic range of scenes by one of the biggest stars of the silent era. The film immediately caught my attention and I forgot that it was a silent film. (I know it does not make much sense, but it happened.) The actors are so skilled in their craft that a few dialog cards are necessary. <br /> <br /> Show People is a great introduction to silent movies. It is a fast, interesting movie with two of the best stars of the silent era. Add satire to Hollywood and Show People should be on the "must see" list for all lovers of the classic film.
