In Paris a shy and uncertain bureaucrat Trelkovsky (Roman Polanski) rents an old flat without a bathroom, where the previous tenant, Egyptologist Simone Choule (Dominique Poulange), committed suicide. The unfriendly concierge (Shelley Winters) and the tough owner, Mr. Zy (Melvyn Douglas), lay down strict rules of behavior, and Trekovsky feels moved by his neighbors. In the meantime, he visits Simone in the hospital and befriends his girlfriend Stella (Isabelle Adjani). After death, Simone Trekovsky is obsessed with her and believes that the owner and neighbors are plotting to force him to commit suicide. <br /> <br /> The strange "Le Locataire" is a disturbing and frightening tale of paranoia and illusion. The story and the process of madness and the loss of the identity of a lonely Trelkowski slowly develop in a nightmare atmosphere in the macabre location of his apartment, and what is happening in reality is completely unpredictable. The performances are amazing, and Isabelle Adjani is extremely beautiful. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "About Inquilino" ("Tenant")
