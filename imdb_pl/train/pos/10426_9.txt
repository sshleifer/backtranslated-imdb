I like it because of my recent personal experiences. Especially the ideas that everyone is free and that everything is finished. The company's heroes really did not like their "real" life, but they had a good time, i.e. What they were. The film did a good job making this simple day a good memory. Good memory is not only romantic feelings about a beautiful stranger and beautiful European city, but a much deeper discussion about their values ​​of life. Many films are like discussion about the definition of life or love, relationships or current problems in life or such. Before Sunrise dealt with this in a pleasant way, which makes the viewer stop and think, adjusts his breath and continues watching the movie. Before sunrise, I did not try to instill a specific thought in your head. It just encouraged you to think about certain problems in your daily life and gave you alternative options. This made the conversations between the characters interesting, not just typical whining complaints or flowing stupid ideas. You would still be thinking about these issues for yourself and the next thread of history would be interesting. The end was not quite important. After the movie, you could get something out of it and feel something good or positive. Movies should be pleasant. It is a nice movie and worth watching. I'm also traveling. The movie somehow represented part of me and answered some of my questions.
