Cinderella was one of the first movies I've seen, and for me it's timeless. It is a beautiful looking movie with great animation. My favorite scene of the animation was the dress scene - I just love these mice. The songs are also beautiful, not as good as Śnieżka, but they are a joy to sing and resemble Tchaikovsky. Sleep is a wish, so is it love? they are unique. The heroes are also delighted. Cinderella is idealistic and strong, and the mice provide great comic relief. The sisters were well done, as was Lucifer. But I loved my stepmother the best, she was really angry, compared to a great figure in the name of the Godmother Fairy. It's true, the movie drags on lightly, with mouse freaks, but it's really fun, so I do not care. I think it is not overrated, underestimated, you do not mean? He rarely plays on television, but the really bad sequel he makes on Cinemagic regularly. If you want a great adaptation of Cinderella, try the amazing Ever After, or the sumptuous Slipper and the Rose, which is not so good. But whatever you do, avoid the sequel, which I am the owner of an error, because you will thank me. 9/10. Bethany Cox
