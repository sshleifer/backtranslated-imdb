One of Tarzan's best films is also one of his most packed actions (and graphics). <br /> <br /> Taking a year after Tarzan the Ape Man, Holt Niel Hamilton asked a rich friend to fund the safari back to the elephant cemetery to collect the ivory. His friend also comes in, carrying dresses and perfumes that Holt hopes to use to get Jane back from Tarzan. Before they can leave Holt, his stolen map becomes crazy, trying to get a competitive trip. When they finally take thieves, they discover that the whole party has died and they were surrounded. They have no choice but to break out of the way and soon discover that they are outside the pan and the fire. Eventually, Tarzan and Jane will appear, and everyone will have even more adventures. <br /> <br /> The infamous video has been heavily censored to limit graphic violence (its graphics even according to today's standards, probably get PG 13) and to remove all traces of nudity (there is a few minutes of nude baths with Jane, which is full front in its nudity, has recently been restored). It is clear to watch the restored version, why this video has been shortened by 20 minutes while the TV is in operation. In the reconstructed version, it is a very adult film that is romantic, moving, filled with action and everything a film should be. This is an amazing movie of almost any standard. Best of all movies that play well as an independent adventure, you did not have to watch the first movie to enjoy it, but it is also a movie that deepens the characters and themes that were created in this original movie. It's an amazing thing. <br /> <br /> I really like this movie. <br /> <br /> If there are any drawbacks in the film, maybe the movie did not get old well. The back screen is often very obvious, for many monkeys there are gorilla costumes, and some of the other effects are more peculiar than convincing. However, on almost every other level, this movie is at the highest level. <br /> <br /> You really owe it to yourself. Make yourself a large bowl of popcorn and curl up on the sofa and let yourself be back to a simpler time. This is one of the great adventures.
