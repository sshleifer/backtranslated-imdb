The true story of a real revolution, April 25; a revolution against the repressive regime for 41 years, which imposed the colonial war on the army, to maintain the empire (Angola, Mozambique, Guine-Bissau, Cabo Verde, S. Tom√© e Principe, the first and last of the great colonial empire of Europe), 600 years since it began Conquest of Ceuta in 1415; revolution of the army for people and for democratic Portugal; the most surprising fact in this revolution is that people did not die in it (except for those who died in the hands of PIDE, the political police of the state, during brutal fire against an unarmed protesting crowd in front of its headquarters on the day of the revolution, April 25, 1974, this takes place on the film). And all revolutions have heroes, one of them was Captain Salgueiro Maia, a recurring soldier from a war whose convictions with the rest of the army consisted in fighting (since 1961) into a hopeless war, and a soldier sometimes has to disobey his country.
