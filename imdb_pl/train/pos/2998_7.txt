I really enjoyed watching this movie on TCM and watching very young William Powell (Philo Vance) playing the detective, as he did with Myrna Loy in the "Thin Man Series". In the 1930s, William Powell played in the Philo Vance Series, and in this photo the famous veteran Mary Astor (Hilda Lake) becomes one of the suspects of murder / suicide, in which a man named Archer Coe (Robert Barrot) was found dead, and Archer was in the room bolted from the inside. Ralph Morgan (Raymond Wrede / Secretary Archer) gave a great supporting role and was the brother of Frank Morgan, who appeared in "In the Wizard of Oz" in 1939. Vance films, as well as a great performance in "Robin Hood" with Errol Flynn. Always remember that the least likely actor can be a killer. Enjoy a great classic from the past.
