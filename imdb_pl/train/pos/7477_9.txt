This movie consists of such great emotions, especially thanks to the excellent soundtrack that coincides with the movie. Tom Cruise is one of my favorite actors because of his enthusiasm for making movies and entertainment. This movie was not the best the first time I watched it, but after about 3 more years I decided it was one of the best movies I've ever seen. It takes place in New York and continues his lifestyle. He discovers the delimiter in his life with his girlfriend (Diaz). It goes through a state of depression and then penetrates the imagination. This movie has exceeded my expectations and is one of the best Cruise films ever!
