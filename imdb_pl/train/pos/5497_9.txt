An extraordinary documentary showing a vivid picture of a deeply divided country (for more evidence, check out some comments on IMDb ...!). Exceptionally well suited to the "Comandante" by Oliver Stone (which is mainly an in-depth analysis of the hair of the nostrils of Fidel Castro). I do not know if Chavez is anything that portrays himself as being or yet another in a long line of populist Latinos, "caudillos." I do not know if he can meet the huge expectations he has clearly built among the weak majority of Venezuelans. It is hard to expect that such a film will be able to answer such questions - but I certainly have a fairly vivid idea of ​​what is at stake and what it is like to be caught during the attack. Someone says in the movie "We make history" and this is exactly what a movie looks like. Great things.
