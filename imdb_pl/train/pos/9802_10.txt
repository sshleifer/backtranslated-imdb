At the beginning I have always been a fan of Batman cartoons, because the theme is so universal that "everyone has an alter ego". That's right in the Batwoman Mystery. Although the overall story is good, I'm disappointed that they did not do much for this series. <br /> <br /> Throughout the movie you try to find out who Batwoman is, unfortunately you can find out easily by looking at the credits published on this site (so if you have not seen it yet, do not go there). I was a little disappointed that the film was not longer. 75 minutes is too short a time for a movie. The batwoman's mysterious identity is also too early in the film, halfway and later becomes anti-climatic because you know that good guys always win and that a new character known as Batwoman will disappear after the movie ends. br /> <br /> I'm not too sure about the new animation style used in this movie. I love slender new characters, but there should be more details where details are needed. Some parts of the animation look so awkward and stiff that they immediately attract attention, diverting attention away from the story. I did not like the bright atmosphere used in most of the scenes, in a sense, it loses its dark and Gothic character, which is Batman. Likewise, we should have learned more about the batwoman personality so that we can build the same deep sympathetic feeling that we do with Bruce Wayne. I also think that fighting with Bane should be better. In a typical way for a child, a bad guy meets his death too easily, stumbling, falling, electrifying or doing something stupid that works against them. Think about it, there was not even one drop of blood spilled in this movie. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is a good entertainment movie and I recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Batman to watch it. It has a good storyline, a universal look, and even a great game to complete it. I just wish they could make a more permanent change in history, making Batwoman a stay to make matters more interesting. Do not just present it, then throw it out when it's finished. I would also like to see someone finally discover the secret of change. To have something other than Batman, solve the puzzle and fill it in later. <br /> <br /> I hope there will be more animated films and we're waiting for a time when we'll be able to see the breakup of Bruce Wayne and Barbra Gordan. He pulls her forever and does not even like her. I can not believe she was stupid enough to fall in love with someone 20 years older. I also want to see the time when Tim Drake leaves because he's fed up with the old one. In short, I want to see all the things that led the characters to the place where they will be in Batman Beyond. Otherwise, the same repeated formula will end sooner than if they decided to move on. <br /> <br />
