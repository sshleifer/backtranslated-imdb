It's true that the idea for this TV series could have been derived from the huge success that Ally McBeal enjoys all over the world, even here in Germany. However, it has been said, Edel and Starck are very different from Ally McBeal in many respects. <br /> <br /> Both main characters work great together. Felix Edel (Felix Noble), played by well-known German actor Christoph M. Ohrt and Sandra Starck (Sandra Strong - Noble & Strong, take him ???), played by the charming Rebecca Immanuel, exchange quick romantic repartees and constantly spy on each other by engaging in criminal matters similar to the sitcom in Berlin and the surrounding area. What's more, they are helped by great stars, in particular their secretary, played by Isabel Tuengerthal, who is a rare gem with a great comic strip potential. The wheel trader, Otto and the noble childhood friend Felix Frank, are also doing very well, not forgetting the best friend and friend from the room, Patricia, played by the beautiful Barbara Demmer. <br /> <br /> A great joy to watch on Monday nights: no wonder that the series and its stars have received several awards. Will Felix get Sandra? <br /> <br /> I hope we will have to wait for many more episodes to find out ...
