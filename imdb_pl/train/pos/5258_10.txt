The Ladies Man laughs loudly, with a great variety of casts, and has very stupid but excellent scenes (including the funniest love song ever written). <br /> <br /> a brilliant side role. <br /> <br /> Tim Meadows plays the idiot surprisingly well and wrote some of the funniest lines you'll find in the comedy. <br /> <br /> Certainly it's worth buying as watching every 6 months will cause you to continue to laugh as much as you did the first time. <br /> <br /> I am desperate when I write that she has a modest 4.7 / 10 and I encourage you to vote! <br /> <br /> And remember about the children - "There is more movement in the ocean"
