I liked the movie very much. I remember reading it as a child several times and I was glad that a movie about the book was made. <br /> <br /> I was a kid for a boy and a girl, aged 11 and 8, and I had to lead the girl to watch the movie. But fortunately, she was glad she saw it, and even said she wanted to buy it on DVD when it appeared. <br /> <br /> There were some great laughs and the movie was not as "disgusting" as I expected ... even though it was a high place for gross-o-meter ... <br /> <br /> The only thing which I can not understand because they had to have a "careful" line that Woody made with regard to his private part ... for me it was the only shocking moment (and you've heard the adults in the audience loudly gasp at the moment in the movie) ... I have no idea why it was included in the film; it did not add anything to the actual movie, except for this shock / snatter factor ... besides, quite a good movie. It's nice to see a "Pepsi" girl grow up.
