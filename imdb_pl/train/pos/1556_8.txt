Like other people who commented on "FrÃ¤ulein Doktor", I accidentally came across this little jewel on the TV late at night without hearing it before. A strange mix of stories about fiction about a sexy, but unscrupulous anti-heroine on the one hand, and a realistic and well-researched show of war in trenches on the other hand, made me start from the beginning. /> For me it is one of the five best films about World War I (the others are "Silent on the Western Front", "Paths of Glory", "Gallipoli" and post-war "La vie et rien d'autre"). And the scene with poison gas attack is really chilling in your veins; horses and men look like riders of the apocalypse with gas masks. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that I did not record the movie.
