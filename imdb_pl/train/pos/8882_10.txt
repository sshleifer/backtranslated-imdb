John Singleton's best film, before hit hits, such as Shaft remake, is a thought-provoking film, with great acting in general and a perfect balance between the stories of the three main characters, each of which has identifiable problems with youth. <br /> <br /> What I liked best was that it also includes the problem of selfishness among young black people, the problem most often ignored by the media and other films that focus mainly on socio-economic problems and racism by whites. This film shows that blacks can be equally ignorant and racist. <br /> <br /> The most important thing about this movie is that it touches so many topics that it does not get shallow. It's not just about racism, it's about how difficult it is to adapt to a new world (college), date rape, discover sexuality and isolation. Omar Epps, Michael Rapaport and Kristy Swanson provide excellent performances, and the supporting cast is as interesting as Jennifer Connelly as lez (yay), and Ice Cube and Busta Rhymes as college bums causing small riots. <br /> <br /> The only downside is the caricature of Professor Laurence Fishburne ("Peppermint?"). Certainly many professors are crazy. But they are not so flat. Skinheads are also a bit of a caricature, but I think that they are also in real life. <br /> <br /> Generally a great underrated movie, if you liked American History X, you'll love this movie. <br /> <br /> 8.5 out of 10
