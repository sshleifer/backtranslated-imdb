When I saw the trailer, I just had to see the movie. And when I did, I felt that I felt dissatisfied. It was a great movie, do not get me wrong, but I think great parts are already in trailers if you catch my drift. It went very fast and it began to roll, so I never got bored, and I liked to watch it. Humor was absolutely great. My first contact with laziness (... or something like that).
