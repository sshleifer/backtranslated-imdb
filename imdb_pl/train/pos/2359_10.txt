I think that if you were to ask most of JWs if they expect a miracle cure because of their faith, you will find that they do not. I know not. Instead, you will learn that they believe in the promises that Christ made of the resurrection. So even if the worst happens and we die, stick to our integrity, Jehovah can and will fix it. <br /> <br /> It really comes down to a simple question: is God real for you or is it all just believing? If he is real and you trust him, you will follow his instructions no matter what the short-term result may be. <br /> <br /> I had a heart attack about a year and a half ago. One in my family was terrified when she saw the words "NO BLOOD" written in large letters on my chart. I reasoned with her that if I was in a situation where only a blood transfusion saved my life, would it be a good time to get angry if only he could bring me back to life when the time came? She did not understand - God is simply not real enough for her. Detriment. I would like her to have the comfort of strong faith.
