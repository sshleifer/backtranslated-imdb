One of the most beautiful films ever made in the former Yu.Story, is very familiar to former Yul people, because the generation after the war lived in the same way. he is 50 years old when Josip Broz Tito refused the SSSR and politbiro and that is why our borders are becoming open to Western influence. But in the country, people did not have much money. Jeans were just an ideal, and friendship was everything. Friendship between young people and a girl was so strong that after 40 years of their emigration with Yu he is still alive. They meet after all these years at the Ester funeral and start to remember their childhood, before they go abroad and become successful people.
