Lapyuta (Castle in the Sky), more than any of Hayao Miyazaki's films, brings the audience the joy of telling stories. It is a kind of movie that makes you feel like a child; it's just magical. It's a crime that it took so long before it was released in the states, but now that it's here, check it out! And stick to the original language; dub slightly changed my impressions about the characters, what should be avoided at all costs in the translation of the film (or book, whatever.) <br /> <br /> I give him ten / ten.
