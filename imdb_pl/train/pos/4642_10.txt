The reviewer, who called this movie a bust, apparently overlooked the point. It is obvious that he had not been young or innocent for a very long time, because he would have understood that the tragedy consisted in the fact that prosperous young heroes thought that they CAN make a difference by posting and keeping the enthusiasm of peace. If this would be so easy. But the cynics are sitting and scoffing at people who are trying hard to improve the situation, because the situation is getting worse every day. Well, if you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem. <br /> <br /> The main theme is that revenge generates more revenge, which is born even more, in the growing bloodshed. Both sides will tell you stories about the atrocities committed by the other side, which in their opinion justify them even MORE in retaliation. Where does it end? And apparently he missed the meaning of the "bubble" mentioned in the name, namely that people living in Tel Aviv are strangely cut off from the ugly realities of what is happening around them, which is partly the reason why they seemed so naive. (It also seemed that Ashraf could easily go through the checkpoints, which tells me that he did not pay attention when Ashraf related the delays and problems he encountered.) I found this very brave director, screenwriter and both lovers in the stars, to update the story of Romeo and Juliet to the modern, restless land and make both lovers a male. Let's be honest: very few people would have a problem if one of them was a woman (young love wins all hearts) - but when people's anxiety about their sexuality is added to the fact that it's unbelievable, the same people would rather let each other hate each other, so the conclusion is inevitable.
