"Emma Woodhouse" Gwyneth Paltrow (Shakespeare in Love, Duets) has nothing to do with himself, but he paints, goes with his friends on the chariot up and down, greeting people in the city and trying to match so that everyone knows. I think that in those days there were no movies, no television, and the girls had nothing to do except gossip. It is a pity that she did not read a bit more. I like Gwyneth and I think she is a beautiful young woman. She is talented, and in "Emma" is honored to hear Gwyneth singing. I am looking forward to "Duets", where to sing. He boldly speaks English in English with all native British, including sister Emma Thompson "Miss Bates" Sophie Thompson (Four weddings and a funeral, a dance in Lughnas). "Mrs. Elton "Juliet Stevenson (Truly, Madly Deeply) was named one of the most promising actresses in 1991. Gwyneth belongs to the American film family, being the daughter of director Bruce Paltry (St. Elsewhere) and Tony Award winner Blythe Danner (The Fingerprint Myth). I hope it will be around for a really long time. We are lucky! I liked Emma and I recommend her too. This is one of those old stories that are still accurate these days. Favorite scenes: Emma sings and plays the piano. I especially like it when singing a duet. Favorite quotes: Mr. Knightley: Emma, ​​you did not ask me to add a riddle. Emma: "Your whole personality is a puzzle, Mr. Knightley. Miss Bates: "It's stupid, I'm quite stunned, I'm telling you, and we have not stopped talking about it."
