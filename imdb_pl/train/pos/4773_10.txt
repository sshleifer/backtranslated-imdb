A beautiful piece of good cinema. It's one of those movies you see smiling and you do not know why. One of the reasons may be that we are today in front of one of the most surprising directors and he is able to film emotions. <br /> <br /> When you watch a movie, you can feel what Mr. Straight felt when he made the decision to visit his brother with his "wonderful" John Deere. What changed in his mind? What has changed in YOUR mind while watching this movie? <br /> <br /> A beautiful brotherly love story.
