My favorite character in movies, but in almost all forms, Zorro has a small mask of material as a mask and if the villain can not say who is under this material, they are stupid. <br /> <br /> But in "Reed Hadley`s" Zorro`s Fighting Legion "(series 1939) the mask fills his whole face, making it a real secret, who Zorro really is. <br /> <br /> But still Zorro is one of the best characters in the movies and to update it, I think that Anthony Hopkins in "Maska Zorro" (1998) is a delight. <br /> <br /> My interest in films is huge, but very lubiÄ™ serial from lat 30. / 40. <br /> <br /> Bond2a
