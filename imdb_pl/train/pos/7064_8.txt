Deanna Durbin really saved Universal from bankruptcy and enabled him to remain a large studio. In the mid-1930s, most of the great directors who worked at Universal, such as Milestone, Browning and Wyler, left. Only James Whale remained, but his prestigious horrors were behind him. Deanna and Judy Garland appeared in the short "Every Sunday" and initially Garland was proposed the role of Penny in "Three Smart Girls." When Garland was unavailable, Universal switched to Durbin. Initially, she was definitely a supporting player, but her potential was so vivid that the script was rewritten to become a star. The film directed by Henry Koster was of European character. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a beautiful panorama of the lake in "Switzerland". "Three smart girls" - three sisters, Joan (Nan Gray), Kay (Barbara Read) and Penny (Deanna Durbin) are sailing with Penny giving her a wonderful voice "My Heart is Singing". Everything is not very good on the home front - their father is planning to marry a younger woman again (Binnie Barnes), so three girls with the help of a trusted nurse (Lucille Watson) decide to go to New York and connect him with their mother. Lucille Watson is best remembered for the role of Robert Taylor's raw mother in "Waterloo Bridge" (1941). <br/> <br /> Donna is a gold seeker who, along with her shaky mother (Alice Brady), is determined to marry Judson Craig (Charles Winninger). For someone without a film experience, Deanna is as wonderful as Penny, a typical unbearable, enthusiastic child sister, and as pretty as a photo. When he sings to his father, "Someone who cares about me," you just stop - what was her wonderful voice. It also has one of the funniest lines in the movie. When her father comforts her with the words: "I will take you to the zoo tomorrow", he answers "Oh, I can see enough monkeys here" !!! <br /> <br /> With the help of Bill Evans (John King) they decide to hire "Count" (Mischa Auer) to have an affair with Donna. They are contracting at a nightclub meeting, but because of confusion Lord Michael Stuart (Ray Milland) is confused with the Earl, and Donna falls for him (he thinks he owns half of Australia !!!). Kay and Donna want to speed up their marriage to Judson. <br /> <br /> Penny decides to take matters into his own hands and escapes. She is taken to the local police station, where she charms the cops with her interpretation of "Il Bacio" (she tries to convince them that she is a young opera singer). Everything ends happily when their mother (Nella Walker) sails to patch up with her father, and meanwhile Donna meets the false Count (Mischa Auer) and flows with him to Australia. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it.
