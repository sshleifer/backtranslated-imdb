The story of Hare Rama Hare Krishna really came to mind of Dev Anand when he saw the hippies and their fallen values ​​in Kathmandu, where he was after visiting the protests against his previous Pujari Premieres in Calcutta. He had weak ghosts because his film was against, and some burned posters from Prema Pujari. But the life of the hippies once again ignited the story in Dev's mind, which is to become a movie. <br /> <br /> It was probably the best effort of directing Dev Anand. The film was a super hit hit at the box office, and Zeenat Aman as a sister of Deva made a huge impact. <br /> <br /> This film was a Dev Anand call to the nation to maintain its moral values. <br /> <br /> It's about an Indian family from Montereal, and the role of a brother is very affectionate to his sister. But parents are arguing and parting with Prashant (Dev) with his mother and Jasbire (Zeenat). She is often told that her mother and brother are dead, and she finally believes she will never see Prashant again. <br /> <br /> She is treated by her mother and runs away from home. Dev grows into a pilot and learns that Jasbir is in Kathmandu with some hippies. <br /> <br /> To re-connect with his sister, Dev travels to Kathmandu and meets Shanti (Mumtaz), who would later marry Janice, who is actually Jasbir with a new name and new identity. She also forgot about childhood and Dev. <br /> <br /> Dev has to get his sister back from all the other events that include his suspicion that he is a thief in Kathmandu, and people are after his life. <br /> <br /> It was a story well directed and played by Dev Ananda. We see more Zeenat Aman than Mumtaz. But Rahul Dev Burman's music was well composed. Dev first proposed music for Sachin Dev Burman to compose, but Burman Da did not want Dev to make this movie. He was very close to Dev and his earlier film Prem Pujari, although he was good, but he was opposed in Calcutta. Burman Da wanted Dev to try a lighter subject because he thought that the hippie cult movie could revive the anger of people against Dev. But Dev continued the film calming Burman Da, and the movie was really successful. <br /> <br /> R D Burman told Asha Bhosle to sing the award-winning Dum Maro Dum. Kanchi again Kanchi was another good number. <br /> <br /> Generally it's a good movie.
