Nobody really understands the logic behind the numbering of Italian zombie movies, but? honestly ?? Why should we worry? Each film in the series "Zombi" provides great fun, unpleasant madness and unwarranted shocks, and "Zombi 3" is no exception, despite all the production difficulties that occurred during shooting. This film began as an interesting project by Lucio Fulci, who had to further develop his success "Zombi 2", but ended up as a typical Bruno Mattei product with bigger drawbacks and stolen ideas from previous films. The script is hopelessly inept and ignores all forms of continuity, every ingenious idea of ​​George A. Romero "Night of the Living Dead" and "Madmen" is shamelessly repeated here, and the acting performances are really unhappy and painful. However, all this did not annoy me for a moment, because the sublime superstar compensates for everything! In a secret military base in the Philippines, the scientists completed the bacterial war virus "Death One" and prepared it for transport. After an unsuccessful attempt to steal the virus, the infected terrorist's body is cremated and the zombie-ashes pollute the entire population of the nearby tourist village. The last group of survivors must fight against overactive and inhumanly strong zombies, as well as soldiers in white overalls who have received instructions to kill everything that moves in a contaminated area. This film is comparable to Umberto Lenzi's "Nightmare City". Really bad ... but incredibly funny thanks to quick sequences of action and a few very creative situations from zombie-madness. For example, undead birds were original, and the whole sequence of the birth of zombies in an abandoned hospital was pretty cool. The infamous scene of the flying head is not as bad as it is supposed to be, and fits perfectly with this tacky and completely pleasant Italian zombie. Recommended for fans; do not worry about negative opinions.
