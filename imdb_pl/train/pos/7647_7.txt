Ok, so he borrows a little from "It's a Wonderful Life", but it was 44 years before this movie, so why not a new attempt. Belushi has a rotten 35th birthday. He did not get his Wheaties, his coffee and he lost his job. Capper is when his car describing the "big blue piece of sh **" breaks down at the end of the day. He goes to the empty bar to call the lobby. While waiting, he is recognized by the bartender (Caine) as a kid who lost the city championship in baseball 20 years earlier. This forces him to think about how life would look like if he won the game. He learns when Cain unknowingly gives the potion to move in the glass that gives him the residence, the ball queen (Russo) as his wife, and makes him the president of a company that produces sporting goods from which he was preserved. Caine later reveals himself as the one who is responsible for this change, but Belushi is not completely on board. It never fully adapts, and during a story that does not kill the movie, but is still strange, he tries to judge his wife (Hamilton) with his real life, who is now married to someone else. The good thing is that they do not spend too much time on him because they basically rip off the "Spirit", and Belushi keeps telling Hamilton what she could know. He also brings a hokey drama element, like his two lovers kevetch in the shade, new wife Russo and his unbalanced lover Cox. But the keys to the film are quite a long start and a happy end. Also a good job from a large and recognizable cast, because Belushi is very nice, he chose a VERY attractive woman, and Caine is perfect as a title guy. It is strange that it was the second Belushi movie of 1990, in which he dealt with acquiring an alternative lifestyle of wealth that was found in "Take Care of Business." Both films are similar, but they are similar. So check it out to get to know "what if?"
