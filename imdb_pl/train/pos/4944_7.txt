There is not so much in this movie, but many meanings. The woman thought she had everything she could in life, but that was not true, and she found out herself when she met the person who was doing some research for his next job. In fact, there should be more types of movies, even not as old as they were considered "mature" (by the way, them 13), and I still have the idea and meaning of the film. The most important thing is in my opinion: DO NOT THINK THAT YOU CAN NOT HAVE A BETTER LIFE BECAUSE BECAUSE YOU HAVE THIS ONE. <br /> <br /> Although I have to admit that I thought about watching a different movie, but after reading all the reviews and watching the trailer, I decided to make this movie, although I did not know that there would be a lot of action in the film. I recommend everyone to watch this movie because it has very good points in the film and is a really good ending.
