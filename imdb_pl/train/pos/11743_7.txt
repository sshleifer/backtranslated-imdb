Although it was not without flaws, this drama was suitable for showing during Easter. It reminded us of our spiritual self and showed that behind our facades we often hide our deepest sufferings and experiences. There was so much fun in the drama, especially rapping teenagers who were better at accompanying the music than a rather poor sound score in the background. Acting was excellent, and Timothy Spall was once again wonderful. The climax was very satisfying, if rather simplified. Timothy Spall's "letting go" of his long-dead wife was credible and reflected well the feelings of despair in a teenager who had hurt herself. The solution between a graffiti boy and a Muslim was satisfactory, but less reliable. A great drama that made me and my husband start to fear that the evening was well spent. Congratulations!
