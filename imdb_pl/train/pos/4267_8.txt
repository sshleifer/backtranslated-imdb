During the Kurt Weill ceremony in Brooklyn, WHERE ARE WE HERE? he was finally turned up for the show. It's amazing that the screens may lack a movie from any era in which Weill-Gershwin works. The score is high, and the CD with the material, Gershwin and Weill, only emphasizes its advantages, which are significant. Yes, the movie has its problems, but the result is not one of them. Ratoff is not in his element as the director of this musical fantasy, and Fred MacMurray can not comprehend this material. Then also the "modern" segment is poorly written. BUT, fantasy elements take the film to a high level, as well as the work of two lovely leading ladies - Joan Leslie and June Haver. Both have the charm that this job desperately needs to work. As the salute of the Second World War for the history of our country - although "never was", the film has its place in the Hollywood musical history and should be available to everyone to see and find its significant advantages.
