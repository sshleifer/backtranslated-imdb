Here I thought that "Nanook of the north" was the last word in the archaic "eskimo" films on the semi-document. How bad! As a diehard canoeist I spent up to 330 in the morning to watch it in the hope that I would see some hand-made "boats". The movie did not disappoint me. Every student of kayak / Umiak construction should see here. (Note to other SKers: it seems that they use Norton Sound kayaks with single blade blades). <br /> <br /> But the film has gone beyond that undoubtedly little interest. Even if others have noticed that some small parts of the film are so stupid that they are just a little irritating. It was (from this point of view very amateur anthropologist) probably the perfect time to make this movie. Early thirties: "talking" is so new that (including Louie B. Mayer!) They actually allow the Inuit to speak their own language. There are so many things that were still authentic, despite the inspired melodrama. They really hit a polar bear, a whale and a caribou. The version of this film from the 1950s would be so tacky with "stars", Technicolor, etc., to scratch it. Version from the seventies? Not even. A very good element accompanying this excellent film is "White shadows on the southern seas" (1928). Geographically mirror image "Eskimo" also refers to the constant and deep disruption of Western culture / technology in unsuspecting people.
