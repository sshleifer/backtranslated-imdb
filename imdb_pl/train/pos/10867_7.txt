In the list of movie guides I noticed at the Santa Barbara Film Festival, where I went, when I was in Hollywood, that this movie was screened. Basically, the elections for the new chairman of the Wo Sing Association in the Hong Kong Triads are approaching, so you can imagine how much violence will take place at that time. The fight takes place between the "candidates" Lam Loken (Simon Yam) and Big D (Tony Leung Ka Fai) in order to control the oldest and most powerful parts of the society of the Triad. He also starred as Louis Koo as Jimmy Lee, Nick Cheung as Jet, and Cheung Siu Fai as Mr. So, Lam Suet as Big Head and Lam Ka Tung as Kun. There are a few good realistic themes and moments of corruption, almost enough action, except maybe when the cops are involved, but the sequel continued, so it's quite an interesting crime thriller. Very good!
