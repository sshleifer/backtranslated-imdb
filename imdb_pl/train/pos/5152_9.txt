"Hitler, the rise of evil" is clearly produced by emotionally unstable people because of the horrors of World War II. This makes watching a refreshing experience. <br /> <br /> I think that its greatest value is the crystal clear exposition of the Nazi mechanism. From the completely broken ways Hitler did it at the top. When you arrive, the movie ends. <br /> <br /> At the top of the "Fuhrer" (= Germany for the "leader"), he led his Germany to the greatest and most destructive war in the history of mankind. The end of six years later in the total defeat of Germany. As a result, the Germans lost eastern provinces (= about 35% of pre-war land) and were forced to accept the 44-year division of the remaining territory. Both West and East Germany had to be rebuilt from scrap metal, their reputation was severely damaged by many Nazi atrocities inspired by racism. <br /> <br /> As I said, "Hitler, the rise of Evil" makes it a good watch. Set up in an acceptable thirty years with (more than) competent action. In particular, the role of Peter O'Toole as the senior president von Hindenburg stands out, and even adds an extra dimension. <br /> <br /> My copy "Hitler, the rise of Evil" also contains a second DVD with two good documentary films. One concerns Hitler's personality, the other concerns the falsification of Hitler's diaries. In 1983, this forgery created a funny scandal in England and Germany, destroying the reputation of several historians and journalists.
