A charming old-fashioned thriller approaching the intersection of Alfred Hitchcock and David Lynch, "Red Rock West" traces the unfortunate events of an injured veteran, Mr. N.Cage's unemployed oil worker, because his happiness changes from bad to worse after the empty tank ends gas and little money for a cup of coffee in one ute city at the back. It has been established from the outset that Mr. Cage may be absent, but he can not be out of the house and can be broke, but he will not steal, even in the current difficult circumstances. Therefore, when you mistake Mr. J.T. Walsh for the man he ordered to murder his wife, Mr. Cage calls his wife to warn her about her husband's intentions. In turn, she, in the person of Miss LFBoyle, offers him even more money to murder Mr. Walsh.Mr Cage decides to leave when he is still at the forefront, but when he leaves the city, hits the man on the road. He tried to go on, take him to the hospital, where he turns out to be shot. Mr. Cage is detained by deputies who call on the sheriff, who turns out to be Mr. JTWalsh. Events are even more complicated when, escaping from custody, Mr.Cage avoids wailing through the real attacker on his way to his commission. Now you can be forgiven for thinking "just enough", but as it happens on the screen, it seems a completely logical turn of events, the narrative flow of the film at this moment seems unstoppable. Mr. D. Hopper is comfortably manned as a hired killer, like Mr. Cage, a USMC veteran. This little coincidence keeps Mr. Cage alive long enough to think about the murderous trio and survive, a little more battered, but still unbending. It is a tribute to everyone involved that what sounds like nonsense on paper is actually a tight, exceptionally well-made image with excellent performances around. "Red Rock West" is a film - a film of a lover. In five minutes you know that you often go somewhere before, but you will be very happy when you travel.
