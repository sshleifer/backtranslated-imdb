The hot policeman accidentally kills the murder suspect and then conceals the offense, but must deal with the guilty conscience when trying to solve the murder case. Andrews and Tierney meet with director Preminger in the film noir, which is as effective as "Laura", their earlier collaboration. Andrews is perfectly manned as a serious policeman, a good guy caught in unfortunate circumstances. Acting is fine, including Malden as a tough police captain and Tully as tending father Tierney. The script by Hecht, a great and prolific writer, is tense and tense, and Preminger creates a great atmosphere.
