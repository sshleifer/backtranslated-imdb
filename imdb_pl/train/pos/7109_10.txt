First of all, let's start with negative points: 1) In the storyline there are huge, gaping totals and questions that will be raised and which will not get an answer nearby; 2) The movie is not for all people, so rude viewers will start to worry and start jumping during the movie. <br /> <br /> The second point above is important because the movie is very quiet. In an older theater (like the one I went to), sometimes a drum passing through the projector is heard. I loved it. The film does not take you music or effects: it lets you think about what's going on. <br /> <br /> There is a lack of rhythm that generates a fascinating and completely pleasant atmosphere. The same kind of atmosphere generated by Stanley Kubrick in Eyes Wide Shut. Not for all people. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend the cinema fans, because the cinema work is amazing. Those who base their recognition of the film solely on history will be completely disappointed. This is a kind of story that you must complete in your minds. (My version is pretty damn cool, but probably not quite on the trail!) If you go to catch a movie, there's one very cool part: when two cops talk to each other over cell phones. A very nice sound effect that really makes you feel right now. Hats off to the person who thought about it.
