The Woman In Black was British for the purpose of a television movie that was first broadcast on the BBC in Christmave Eve of '89, and again in '92. I believe that she made a round on American television on A & E. It was released on VHS in the UK in the early 90's, but it stopped being printed. A company from the USA released it later on DVD, but this version also sold out. According to the author's website, the rights to the film are now owned by someone else and will not be re-issued, and eBay sells unofficial bootlegs. <br /> <br /> For the first time I heard about this film recently on the forum and I had to check it out. I found a copy on eBay for about 28 bucks. It will certainly be a fake seller in the Far East, although the DVD says "done in Canada", ha ha. But it is a good copy and you can not really blame bootleg labels for spending things that are rare, exhausted and lost in legal disputes. <br /> <br /> I love this movie. This is a piece from the 1920s, with very authentic and original British settings of those times. The Woman In Black is very moody and dark. In most cases, the film is very low, but effective and frightening. In special effects there is no indulgence, violence or not at all, but The Woman In Black is still able to create absolutely chilling moments in her veins. It's a chilling movie about ghosts. The film itself looks as if it could be made in the 1930s, with the exception of color. Without the whole flash of all modern horror movies, I'm afraid that this movie will always be a lost gem. For me, this is one of my favorite times.
