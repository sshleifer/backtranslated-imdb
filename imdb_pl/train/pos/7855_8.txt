Tess of the Storm Country was a Mary Pickford vehicle that I intended to get for some time. In the end, I found a copy of VHS at a reasonable price and I could enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Mary gives her a typically brave, innocently sexy portrait of a girl from the wrong side, who gains the heart of a rich heir. Only this time the rate is higher: a false accusation of murder, an illegitimate child (and the resulting case of wrong motherhood) and suicide under consideration. <br /> <br /> You can see why Pickford wanted to do it again. History is a true tale of morality, the one in which she loved to play. Controversial topics are not always clearly defined; must the viewer pay attention and approach the clues to catch everything that is implied during the first viewing? although in the end everything is more or less explained. <br /> <br /> The only negative remark I can make will be about Jean Hersholt and the dog. Hersholt, whose character, Ben Letts, looks about 6-2, 200 pounds (of course, next to Mary, of course!), He is sent in a panic when a 60-pound chocolate lab lunges towards him! Then, to supplement it (and perhaps justify his embarrassing fear of the dog), he manages to nail him to the ground and somehow hurt him so much that he still struggles to get up much later when he is hit by a bad storm! This is the same nice laboratory that sleeps with Frederick (Lloyd Hughes) and cuddles up to Mary! But later, Mary throws boiling water in Ben's face, which barely slows him down! OK, I blew Ben and the chocolate lab out! In addition, the film was quite moving and certainly attracted my attention. Pickford's staff was strong and credible. This is certainly one of her better movies.
