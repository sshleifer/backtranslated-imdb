I saw this movie a long time ago, but I found it amazing and it never ceased to amaze me today. <br /> <br /> A great movie that describes the story of a group of Australian commandos who tried to sink Japanese ships in the port of Singapore during World War II. <br /> <br /> Commandos are caught in ordinary clothes and are considered spies by Japanese hijackers. But something is happening that has not been studied too much in any Hollywood movie from the Second World War I saw. <br /> <br /> Close and friendly ties develop between kidnappers and prisoners. They begin to respect each other, while the captain of captured Australian soldiers becomes the best friend of the senior Japanese prison guard. This is the greatest part of the whole movie and it really attracts your heart. <br /> <br /> Soon, one day when both friends are talking, the Aussie captain learns that several other prisoners will be tried and executed for sinking Japanese ships in the port of Singapore. <br /> <br /> He remembers that his team, not others, sank the ships to his Japanese friend and after hearing this, the Japanese guard says he is silent because it can lead to the execution of his entire group. But the captain does not cease in confessing this to the Japanese authorities. <br /> <br /> Finally, the Japanese authorities sentenced them to death in the most respectful manner, according to their rules. This is the highest honor granted to captured warriors in Japan. <br /> <br /> This is the most amazing part of the movie, in which Australian soldiers are waiting for the imminent death and tense indecision of a friendly Japanese guard who is still not ready to believe why his Australian friend pleaded guilty. <br /> <br /> I will not reveal the end. But it is more poignant than you can imagine, and can easily go to tears. <br /> <br /> In all, an excellent underestimated film that probably did not get the recognition it deserved on the international stage. Get one copy today and be hypnotized.
