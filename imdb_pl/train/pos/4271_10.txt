This is the best movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I saw a movie on Dutch TV in 1988 (?). <br /> <br /> This month they were showing a Yugoslav movie every Sunday evening. <br /> <br /> The next week was another great movie (involving the train, not the bus), whose name I do not remember. If you know this, let me know! Anyway, how can I see this movie again ???? DVD with this movie, where? Please, tell me at vannoord@let.rug.nl <br /> <br /> The next week there was another great movie (with the participation of the train, not the bus) whose name I do not remember.
