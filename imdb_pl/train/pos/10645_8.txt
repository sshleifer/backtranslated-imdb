The manic desire of Adolf Hitler to impose his will on the rest of the world is the subject of the latter in a seven-part series of films produced by the US War Department as an instructional tool for new soldiers entering the Armed Forces during World War II. Hitler's plan was methodical and well-conceived, beginning with the conquest of Eastern Europe, expanding to the European heart, and then moving to the "World Island" consisting of Europe, Asia and Africa. His last move would be to reach the oceans for the ultimate conquest of the Americas and the World. <br /> <br /> In 1935, Hitler ordered national conscription, because the rest of the country fell under his evil spell. School children sang his praise, and young German boys were trained and indoctrinated in military camps. Marching without objection to Austria in 1938, Hitler then annexed a strip of land bordering Germany and Czechoslovakia called Sudetenland. In 1939, Hitler took over all of Czechoslovakia. Later, this year, the world was surprised when he learned that the Germans had signed a non-aggression pact with his deadly enemy, Russia, a catch for delaying Hitler's military engagement on too many fronts. Immediately after that, the Germans attacked Poland, leading Hitler to conquer Russia. He will deal with it later. <br /> <br /> During this period, the United Kingdom continued to refuse to oppose Hitler's drive across Europe. Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain believed that he won a great victory for his country by accepting a treaty with Germany, his infamous declaration "Peace in our time". It did not turn out this way. <br /> <br /> The most fascinating information that can be learned in this part, at least for me, was provided by a small piece of material from Hitler's German rally in the middle of '30s. He was led by a German American who took the signal directly from his homeland. Place - Madison Square Garden!
