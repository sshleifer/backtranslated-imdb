It's a difficult movie to classify "10 items or less." Generally I do not care about defining genres, but in this movie there is something that makes you want to put it in a specific category, to pass, even with one word, your feelings about it. I totally recommend this movie to anyone, and if you really like cinema and you like life, you'll want to do the same when you look at it. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie and I call it beautiful and charming, admitting that it is not perfect, but it does nothing wrong. I do not want to sound like I deny myself, but I believe that writer / director Brad Silberling knew exactly what he was getting into when he finished writing this inspirational script. I am sure that he wanted to create a product that would have nothing to do with perfection: a product that would be as simple, attractive and uncompromising as its title. He did this. <br /> <br /> Silberling, director of long, complex, dramatic films such as "City of Angels" and "Moonlight Mile", proves that "10 Items or Less" ends in 70 minutes. he has for his work and also the faith he has in it. Placing an actor (Morgan Freeman) in front of a woman (Paz Vega) in a grocery store and taking them exactly to the places where ordinary life would take them is what Silberling proposes here. <br /> <br /> I can not tell you more, because in apparent simplicity lies a provocative background that should not be underestimated. Because here everyone is exposed: the camera focuses directly on the two main heroes who share a never-ending conversation while driving a car with stops that is not unlimited just because life is life. Let me praise how well Silberling deals with the situation, saying that he achieves in a shorter time (not only during the film but in one day in which the film develops his events) and in a smaller place, like the relationship between two characters that Sofia Coppola generated in "Lost In Translation". <br /> <br /> This movie set in Tokyo also met an actor and a woman, and they talked about the moments in which they lived their lives. It is in conversations in which we sense the provocative quality of "10 items or less", and like in the Coppola movie, the naturalness of each situation is never lost, and images with all music and without words do not seem forced or included in the picture "buy time" ". <br /> <br /> In this aspect, cooperation between Silberling and his director of photography, Phedon Papamichael. The man who shot beautiful landscapes in "Sideways" and focused on every emotion in "Patch Adams", delights us with visual fragments of real beauty. <br /> <br /> But the most beautiful beauty of "10 items or less" can be found in his cast (Avy Kaufman), in two heroes. They convey this feeling I mentioned at the beginning, and I can not define it; we feel their relationship and we can say that they are having fun and that they can even improvise. Academy Award Winner Morgan Freeman, also executive producer of the film, simply stands and confirms the status of the film industry today and deserved: a calm man, full of wisdom who can easily make you cry, can make you laugh. And beautiful Paz Vega (well, I said that she was great at Spanglish). She proved it to be a real business, and Hollywood is not small for her.
