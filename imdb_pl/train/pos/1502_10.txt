The late great Robert Bloch (author of PSYCHO, for those who did not pay attention to it) wrote the script of this horror story and it was absolutely one of the scariest films I have ever seen as a child. (I had to walk MILES just to see the movie, and when I left the theater it was usually dark, watching the horror was always annoying, but especially when it was as well made as this one.) When I had the opportunity to see it a few years ago videotape (which should always be a last resort), I was surprised how well it lasted. Take part in the test of terror: watch it at night, alone, and tell me that it is not terrifying ...
