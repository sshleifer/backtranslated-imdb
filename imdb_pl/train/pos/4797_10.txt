I've always been a fan of David Lynch and thanks to this film, Lynch proved to critics that he has talent, style and artistic integrity to make films outside the surreal aura of which he has become known over the last decade. Although the film is rated as G, it is pure Lynch in style, pace and tone. The film moves in a masterly hypnotic pace and is full of scenes of real emotions and power. <br /> <br /> The pictures are great, as you'd expect from Lynch's film, and the transient assembly sequences are breathtaking. It is also very refreshing to watch a movie in which characters are friendly, good-natured people and non-motivated characters that are clearly marked as "good" or "bad". <br /> <br /> Richard Farnsworth turns into a beautiful performance like the rest of the cast, especially Sissy Spacek in an endearing performance as his daughter, and Harry Dean Stanton in a small but infinitely key role. <br /> <br /> With this film, David Lynch proved to the critics that he could create a powerful movable movie, like in the '80s thanks to' Blue Velvet 'and' The Elephant Man '. Critics seemed to be losing faith over the last decade after producing such surreal films as "Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me" and "Lost Highway", but he showed that there is a method for FWWM and LH and it looks like critics in the end, they caught their last movie Mulholland Drive, taking into account the praise they received and the Oscar nomination for Lynch. <br /> <br /> "Straight Story" is one of the most moving movies I've ever seen. It is a loving story about the family, friendship and courtesy of strangers. I would highly recommend.
