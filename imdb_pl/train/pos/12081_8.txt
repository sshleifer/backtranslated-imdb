Nina Foch delivers a surprisingly strong performance as the title character in this fun gothic game. He accepts the post of secretary of the London society of widows (played by Dame May Witty) and her terrifying son (cheeky and embarrassing George Macready). Before she realizes, she wakes up to be in a seaside residence she has never seen before, where Witty and Macready call her Marian and try to convince servants and nearby townsmen that she is Macready's crazy wife. Of course, this couple can only plan dishonest actions, and even if we know that Julia must finally escape the trap, director Joseph Lewis builds the real tension in answering the question of how he can handle it. <br /> <br /> "My Name Is Julia Ross" has nothing stylistic to distinguish it from the many films that appeared at the same time, but I was surprised how good it was, despite the budget for shoes and the origin of the film B. There are a few moments that may have you on the edge of your place, and I really supported Julia when she grabbed under her foot and began to outwit her hijackers. In every other gothic thriller, the heroine would swoon, scream and tremble, waiting for her hero to come and save her. I can not tell you how refreshing it was for the heroine in this movie to use her brain and come up with a way to save herself. <br /> <br /> Bravo. <br /> <br /> Class: B +
