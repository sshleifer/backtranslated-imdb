As others have mentioned, all women naked in this film are absolutely absolutely great. The plot very well shows the hypocrisy of the female libido. When people are around, they want to be hunted, but when there are no "men", they become the persecutors of a 14-year-old boy. And the boy becomes a man really fast (we should all have such happiness at this age!). Then she takes courage to realize her true love.
