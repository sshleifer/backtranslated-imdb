Given that this movie has a lot of great entertainment, I think it should have more points than imdb. <br /> <br /> It's your primary "who did it? thriller with sex and murder, but lets you guess to the very end. I like these movies and I think that this meets the standards. <br /> <br /> It was worth watching more than once for me, so I'll give them 8 imdb.
