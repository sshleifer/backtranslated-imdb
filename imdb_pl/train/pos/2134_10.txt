The contribution of Ernst Lubitsch to American cinema is huge. His legacy is a great group of films that will live forever, just like "The Shop Around the Corner". This film has been converted into other less prominent films and musical art, without the charm and elegance of its own or a specific version of Mr. Lubitsch. <br /> <br /> Margaret Sullavan and James Stewart worked together on several films. Their characters in this film stand out as an example of how to be in the movie, hardly appearing at all. Both stars are delighted, like pen buddies who do not know each other, but what happened to them made them work together in the same store in Budapest. <br /> <br /> The reason why these classic films worked so well is the amazing support of studio castings combined into a picture after image. Here we have a great Frank Morgan, who plays the shop owner. We see, among others, Joseph Schildkraut, Felix Bressart, William Tracy and Charles Smith, doing an impressive job to believe that they are in Budapest. <br /> <br /> That's why these films will live forever!
