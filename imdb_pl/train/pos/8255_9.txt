Fido is a lovely comedy that deserves wider recognition, especially considering the main nonsense that is supposed to entertain us today. <br /> <br /> As mentioned, this is not a real movie about zombies, but rather a sweet satire that uses undead to point your fingers. Although there are necessarily bloody scenes, almost no gore and the way this movie is presented (good style of the 50s), I can not imagine anyone being really scared or turned off by Fido and his companions. > <br /> While cast is generally good, I felt Moss and Nelson stand out. Humor is not face to face, but rather subdued; I attach great importance to details and I found myself smelling gently throughout the film. This is certainly not a masterpiece of cinema, but it does not strive to be - instead, Currie manages to create a warming heart with a black comedy.
