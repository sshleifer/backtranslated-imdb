I really liked this movie and it was a bit difficult when your brother makes stupid comments in 30 seconds. But I liked this movie, mainly because I'm used to ordinary HK action movies. Most films like this one do not watch the story, they watch it without thinking. And mindless action is right. You can see Jet Li Jump, shoot, kick, hit, shoot, make impossible jumps and avoid countless bullets. It's true that this movie was released to a wider audience after Li in Lethal Weapon 4. This is one of the reasons why the film's ratings have dropped. Most people probably expected to see a movie that was as polished as a movie from North America. But you have to remember that most HK movie budgets are not as high as in North America, and the style in the HK action movie is usually very different, usually demanding many of them to work with wire. If you want to see a good action movie, you should see it, just ignore the dubbing. <br /> <br /> My rating is 8.
