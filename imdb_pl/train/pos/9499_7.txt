The boy and the girl are hunted down by a local warrior because the boy killed (accidentally) the warrior father (or whoever it was). And they travel through Africa's most hiding places. <br /> <br /> Acting in this movie is not very good (except for the baby elephant). But it is a very good adventure and is not very censored, there is some blood, body and nudity (which slightly brightens the film). <br /> <br /> I give this film 7 because of its picture of African nature and its operation.
