The meteorite falls in the land of a small town, bringing a jelly-like creature. The old farmer is attacked by a stranger in his hands, and the youth Steve Andrews (Steve McQueen) and his girlfriend Jane Martin (Aneta Corsaut) take him to Dr. T. Hallen (Steven Chase). The local doctor treats the blister cautiously and asks Steve to investigate the place where they found the old man. When Steve returns, he sees a stain killing the doctor. Steve and Jane try to warn the police and residents, but no one believes in it, while the blob consumes many people, becoming bigger and bigger. <br /> <br /> "Blob" is a cult classic sci-fi. It is a low-budget movie, with many actors and actresses with ham (except Steve McQueen), horrible effects, but also delightful and very, very funny. I see this classic for the first time (I've seen 1988 remake with Kevin Dillon) and I really recommend it to fans of Steve McQueen and science-fiction B movies from the 1950s. The subject of the film from my review number 1400 could not have been better. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Bolha" ("The Blob")
