I must say that I waited for him to come. <br /> <br /> I will not try to spoil it and a lot of people really talk about the remote. On the other hand, I'm not sure if I understand critics who claim to be BSG fans and do not like the pilot. <br /> <br /> What did they expect? With the background of 50 years before BSG, we are there to help in the birth of the Cylon, see the life of Adam's family (did we know a bit from BSG), get a deeper explanation of the population of Caprican and its perception of other colonies and potentially the origin of the Gods of faith about people and unique faith God of Cylon. <br /> <br /> I do not expect the same abundance of special effects or space opera as in the previous series, I make the difference between them, although I know that Caprica will strengthen BSG. <br /> <br /> This is a promising start at 1:30, and I think it will also make scenarios as good as BSG. I expect a lot from the following, but I have no reason to doubt that we will learn a lot more. <br /> <br /> Watching the removed DVD scene gives more material for the brain to chew. <br /> <br /> We're waiting for January 2010
