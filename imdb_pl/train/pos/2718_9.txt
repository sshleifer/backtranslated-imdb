Last year we were treated to two films about Truman Capote writing a book from which this film was made - Capote and Infamous. <br /> <br /> I can not imagine a movie like the one from 1967. a harshly brutal drama; raised to the rank of classic film by the master director Richard Brooks (Elmer Gantry, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, The Professional, Blackboard Jungle). <br /> <br /> It is interesting that Robert Blake, who played the lead role in this movie, has many problems that may be related to his presentation of the killer in this film. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that stays with you after watching.
