I have to start saying that it's been a long time since I saw it, but I've seen it five or more times; a wonderful little noise that was clearly inspired by musical / comedy combinations of new or disappearing stars with outstanding musical groups. A good example would be the secrets of Kay Kyser. <br /> <br /> Spike Jones broke out best because he and his band play a lot of melodies and are part of the action, doing great job support. Hugh O'Brien plays on the face, Buddy Hackett is part of the rumors that Lou Costello offered, and Abbott and Costello are replacing leads. I do not know if it's true. <br /> <br /> all in all, a nice movie, but it's important to have so many Spike Jones and his band on the film for history. I would like it to be released because I have not seen or heard about it for two decades. I hope it will not die
