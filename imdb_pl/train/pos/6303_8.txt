Hearing pretty positive reviews and watching the trailer, I had to see this movie. In the case of William H. Macy, Luis Guzman, Michael Jeter and Sam Rockwell, the gift had to be good. And it succeeded. In general, the film is not funny, but there is one scene that really stands out and is in my opinion classic. SPOILER At the end, where they break through the wall to get to the safe, we see that Rockwell and Washington are staring at Jeter is simply fantastic. This is just as good as the scene at The Big Lebowski, where The Dude uses a chair to barricade the door, but he forgets about the door outside! THE END OF THE SPOILER. Just watch this movie, you will not be disappointed.
