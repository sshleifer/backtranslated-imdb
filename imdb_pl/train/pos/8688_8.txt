The Columbo story of a very high standard, which was actually the first filmed episode of a long-lasting series, but was originally broadcast as the second (after "Murder By The Book"). <br /> <br /> Robert Culp makes his first of three appearances as a guest-killer in the series and plays the owner of a private detective agency that blackmails his wife (Patricia Crowley) of a wealthy, influential businessman (played very kindly by Ray Milland) after that how he falsifies the report, in her favor, after it was discovered that she had an affair. The wife later rebels against the scheme of blackmail, but dies in an attack of rage .... <br /> <br /> A very satisfying episode in many respects, especially since the plot is so heavily organized and then developed and also because of the rare ingredient Columbo, that crime is a deadly murder. The whole is further strengthened when a widowed husband uses a murderer to help Columbo in his research: a feature that facilitates numerous good-quality scenes, especially in the first sequence, when three main characters meet and the extremely deceptive features of Columbo are miraculously visible. <br /> <br /> The director with the talent of Bernard L. Kowalski and acted at a sufficiently high level, it really gave tone to the whole series (because "Murder By the Book" was disappointed by the weak ending). The script by the creators of Columbo, Richard Levinson and William Link is precise, well-structured and thoughtful, based on a stable, productive pace and significant sequences that really show the unpredictability of history. Ultimately, the finale perfectly embodies that Columbo has always been one step ahead of the killer. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a great piece of detective work for Columbo and strongly suggests that the production team has worked positively and constructively to reflect the polished history of Columbo.
