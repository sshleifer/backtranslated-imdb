Put yourself in Carla's shoes. He is an overworked, underestimated administrative killer who is invisible. You know her: she trained three of the last three bosses, she knows where all the bodies are buried, and maybe even look at you in the mirror when you brush your teeth. Always having time for another ungrateful task and doing it better than most despite having a serious disability, he has a desk on the way to the toilet, which becomes a storehouse of unfinished cups of coffee begging for a spill. What? Do not you want to hear it? Well, you can not and can not do it until your hearing aid is in place. Get ready for life from the perspective of the hearing impaired. <br /> <br /> Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) needs a change in her life. Work leads nowhere; friends rely on her to satisfy her home needs, and the only way out is a fall, which is practically not noticed. He will not go on holiday - the contract is critical - so the only alternative is to hire an assistant. Carla presents requirements that reflect her real needs: a "well-groomed" man. This gives the applicant an approval which reminds us that we should be careful with our wishes. <br /> <br /> Paul (Vincent Cassell) is doing everything wrong from the start of the interview and his employment clearly shows Carla's interest in his non-work related features. He notices the potential of this former thief, and as the story unfolds, their relationship grows in a very unusual system of interdependence. <br /> <br /> Paul has a difficult transformation that returns to the world outside the prison walls and is in a different type of prison: one of office diversity and another with an ungrateful bond to pay off old debt. His skills as a thief help Carla win a political battle in the office. But Paul sees a better chance with Carla's lip-reading skills and draws her even further into the world of intrigue. <br /> <br /> This is a brutal noir movie with no rating and probably suitable for older teenagers. Carla becomes more and more powerful, professionally and personally, as the story unfolds, and her disability gives her a clear advantage over the rest of us. She grows as a woman discovering her sensual side, while she uses her resources to overcome obstacles in the male's world. <br /> <br /> The two main characters are designed for themselves in a strange way. Without Paul Carla he will remain in the role of a doormat. He has our compassion, hopes and best wishes, even if he does not make the best decisions along the way. <br /> <br /> You will hear the world through Carla's ears, from awkward adjustments of the hearing aid, muffled sounds, but inaudible, with no relatively clear voices when you see who is talking. When one main sense is turned off, we see that Carla has an increased intuitive netting power. We can all use this sense to hear not only what people say, but also what they really mean.
