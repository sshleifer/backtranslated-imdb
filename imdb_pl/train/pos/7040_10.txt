This movie was perfect for the following reasons: 1) It contained wonderful backgrounds and sets. 2) He showed the discrepancy between the environment torn by war and the technological environment. 3) The acting of John Cusack was great. He showed anger very well. 4) He showed the weaknesses of everyone in a war-torn situation. 5) It gave us a picture of what might happen in the future in many respects. I was also impressed by acting in the majority. I think that Hilary's acting was the most slim. The morale and values ​​of all in a war-torn situation are to be gained. A liberal journalist and conservative businessman are able to do everything in every situation and are equally unpredictable. A great thing. PSP
