I love this program! It's like watching a mini movie every week !!! The first episode was so thrilling and frightening ... so there was a part of the 2 pilot ... I will definitely continue this concert! This is real survivor! I looked at a few other comments and see that after just one or two episodes of the moron are already crying wolf ... I'm sorry if this is not another reality show, kids! Once there was a time where they were ... now get ready! Actual TV programs! And this one is really good, unlike most shit sitcoms, or in the tenth copy of "Law & Order" or "NYPD Blue" or CSI series that expire ... Be careful to create your own opinion, don 'take one of the churches!
