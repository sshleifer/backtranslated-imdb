It's a very good movie. Do you want to know the real reasons why so many here are knocking on this movie? I'll tell you. In this movie you have a black criminal who outwit the white professor. A black policeman who tells a white professor that he is wrong in defending a black criminal, and a black cop turns out to be right. - makes the white professor look stupid. It always comes down to the race. It's an excellent movie. Do not pay attention to the racist. If you manage to overcome the fact that there are characters in this movie played by black people who outsmart white characters, you should not have any problems watching this movie. I told everyone to go see this movie.
