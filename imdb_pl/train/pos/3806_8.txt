This movie was breathtaking, I just loved it! <br /> <br /> I admit that character and story dialogs could have been done a little better, but hey, it's just a simple (short) story of a few guys trying to kill the dragon, there's nothing to it! <br /> <br /> General design, atmosphere, beautiful landscapes ... it's all magical! <br /> <br /> They got interested in this movie. The character patterns were great and fun. Little Tim Burton-ish, if you like. I can recommend this film to anyone interested in a great project, displayed in a simple, small but charming story.
