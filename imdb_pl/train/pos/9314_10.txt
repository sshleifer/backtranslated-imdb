I have seen this program only a few times, but I will live in my memory. <br /> <br /> It's very frustrating that it's so hard to find it anywhere to buy, and yet it seems that there are endless repetitions of things like Friends! Particularly harder to get in England, I think ...? <br /> <br /> They say it's a low grade, or was it a complaint from Bakersfield PD itself? Maybe it was too clever for some people? <br /> <br /> In any case, almost one comedy that I would like to see again, but you can hardly find it. I heard that it is or has been repeated in another network? But unfortunately not here !! <br /> <br /> Summary: Brilliant.
