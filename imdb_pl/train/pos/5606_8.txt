It is a very difficult film and it is almost impossible to understand what is happening. At first it seems that it is rather a pedestrian film about a guy (Trelkovsky), who needs a flat and is rather blatantly invited to the one in which the current tenant (woman) commits suicide. Then the twists and turns begin. Do the neighbors try to kill him? And why do the clothes of the deceased tenant appear in the apartment? He finally wonders if Trelkovksy is the previous tenant. <br /> <br /> SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER <br /> <br /> One of the tricks that Polanski draws us is to lie to us. We assume that when we see things from a character's point of view, we see things as the character does and that distortions of reality may occur. We assume that when the camera shows us things from its omniscient point of view, we see reality - but Polanski has a lie for us.
