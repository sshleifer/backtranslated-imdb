This movie, along with WESTFRONT 1918, are my favorite films directed by Pabst and I enjoyed them more than its more famous films, in which Louise Brooks (eg PANDORA'S BOX) performed. Probably because both are very similar to neorealistic films, which Italians have perfected in the 1940s and 50s of the 20th century. This stylish movie required the use of non-actors (only typical people) in everyday settings to create intensely engaging and realistic films. <br /> <br /> In this case, the film is about French and German miners, so people in roles seem to be miners - not actors. The central conflict at the beginning of the film lies in the fact that there is a huge mine on the Franco-German border. Instead of one large mine, it is divided on the border, and German employees are not welcome in the French mine, although there is more unemployment in Germany. Language differences (splendidly illustrated on the stage of the dance hall) and the First World War conspire to create a huge split between the factions - which results in the mentality of EC vs. Later, the explosion causes a huge collapse of the French, and the Germans do not want to sit down and do nothing. At the risk of their own lives, they prove that there is a real bond between miners and people in general. <br /> <br /> The film is a strong critique of xenophobia and in vain tried to convince the German public to the futility of war and hatred. It was a wonderfully moving movie with the most terrifying and claustrophobic images I have ever seen. However, taking into account the history, the impact of the film was minimal at best. It's a real shame, like this one, WESTFRONT 1918, J√ÅACCUSE (Gance) and ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT (Milestone) had a great message of peace and harmony, but ultimately they were failures in positive public rocking. Historically, it is an amazing and sad relic that is worth seeing.
