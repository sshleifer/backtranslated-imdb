The movie shocked me. I personally mainly accumulated a bad buzz. Well, after all, after I had a DVD for many months, I put it on a sleepless night. although the film dragged, additional material was used for the seriousness of his passion, and its recovery after adding to the game would be less realistic if they skipped any scenes. The best thing about the film is consistency with the relationship. There was no appearance of ex or forms threatening the union. Usually, we see that the girl meets the boy with some amazing fate, they meet, what we saw, come, and then they come back together in the last five minutes of the movie. but this movie did not follow this form. We have indeed experienced a relationship and its disadvantages, and although the heroes had anti-love moments there, they did not have dramatic breaks when they left and assembled every 15 years, and then re-united in love. I did not feel that the movie is as predictable as the rest of the love movies. The story was unique and true to reality in the way I felt that these people in the film were the most credible ones I saw in the romance film of modern times. And it did not hurt that all the baseball games were real and they were in the real world series, and the fate broke in there a bit. This is not "my beautiful lady", but it is a thrilling and honest movie. I will just say that I like it.
