I saw it on Afro Promo, a collection of film trailers for films with African-Americans. It looked like what it is; a very tendentious "crazy" comedy in which a tense black man realizes that his son is gay. It would seem that the wife of Redd Foxx (RF) left him for a brother who works with him in a "store" in Phoenix. He went by bus to visit his son Norman in Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> When the RF arrives, Norman, dressed only in powder blue bikini shorts, comes out of the water bed to pick up the door. Trying to buy time, trying to get his older father up the stairs to the 60th floor, Norman tries to wake his lover, who steadfastly refuses. Until I wrote "WHY he will not wake up?" When he suddenly does, and my friend's jaws and jaws fell for the first time on many occasions when we present our first glimpse of the blue-eyed Garson, Norman's white lover who just "had the most unwavering dream? "Garson is a blazing type queen who can only be imagined as emerging from LA 1976. He has dresses, a purse and large adherent jewelry, and he seems to have modeled both his appearance and the image of Carol Brady from The Brady Bunch. > <br /> Norman orders his lover to find a place to stay during his father's visit. Garson stays with Waylon Blacks, and Madam answers the phone when Norman calls. <br /> <br /> So RF is trying to reach his wife in Mexico. When he talks on the phone, Garson comes to pack his dress and RF confronts him. With the outbreak of soul music from the '70s, he was to trigger his early revelation (but sounding more like we were supposed to hear the unique song The Emotions), he realizes that his son is gay. <br /> <br /> His first impulse is "I will kill him. I'll kill him". Then RF goes on a long walk, during which he goes through all the thoughts that a confused parent may have, eg "Maybe our toilet trained him too early". His thoughts are triggered by what he sees in his walk, for example a robust truck driver appears when he ponders what the real man is doing. Amazingly, he goes to a bookstore and buys about eight books on homosexuality. This, I must say, is about eight more books on homosexuality than those bought by MY parents. Then he goes straight to the park bench and reads them all! <br /> <br /> RF then employs Audrey, a 6-foot Amazon prostitute (in this amazing furry thing) played by Tamara Dobson of Cleopatra Jones. He hired her for Norman to try heterosexuality, but it pisses Norman off, and he rushes to stay with his friend Melody. <br /> <br /> Then Garson approaches and suggests taking RF for the night. He feels for the loss of his RF wife and tells the story of his own mother who has irrational prejudices against Pilippinos because "she was molested in luau." They attend the long performances of Wayon and Madam, whose culmination is Madam, violently striking her head against the piano, until her hair is relaxed. Once again, the lips were agape. <br /> <br /> It looks like you do not know RF and Garson will spend a great evening together! You see, staid, traditional older black men just have to see the mushy, highly effeminate mega entertainment to come to the EVERY gay world that has to offer! It's really that simple! It still does not bother RF to shout "Rape!" When Garson wakes him from a bad dream. It ends less predictably than you might think. <br /> <br /> There were so many things that just ended. What is the basis of Norman and Garson's relationship? They do not seem to have ANY relationship, and Norman has no qualms about throwing Garson away, and even when he comes to defend himself, he never defends Garson or talks about their relationship. There were some adorable, cute touches like RF to buy all those books about homosexuality - and sit on a park bench to read them! I like the idea that the parent will actually try to find something about homosexuality instead of just running away to get drunk or feel sorry for his friends. <br /> <br /> Besides, it's just what it looks like: a small relic of a bygone era, an epoch in which some gays thought that if straightened people just sit down and watch puppet performances, we'll all learn to love and understand each other! Due to the naivete of this phenomenon, extreme stereotypes and dialogue with the message are simply delightfully outdated and provide a lot of information about how gay issues have changed over the last 30 years. I think the only thing that seems offensive is the idea that gay friends are desperately in love with them and are willing to get them drunk to sleep, and thus convert to them. <br /> <br /> ------ Hey, check out Cinema de Merde, my site for bad and bad movies (with some good videos thrown in).
