OK, first correcting the tag on the main page of this video. Abe Lincoln did not go with his sister in the movie, nor did he stop at the grave of his sister. It's about Ann Rutledge, who was a very close friend of Lincoln in the days of New Salem. Some say that Ann was actually Lincoln's girlfriend, but there is no evidence to support her. <br /> <br /> In this movie there are fabrications and fictions. Hollywood has always used a dramatic license for everything under the sun, and "Young Mr. Lincoln" is no exception. However, the lawsuit that is in the film is based on a real incident: the accusation of murdering William "Duff" Armstrong, and although it is largely fictionalized in this film with many name changes, it will still attract the attention of the screen. This is the Golden Age of Hollywood, with the drama at its best, and Henry Fonda probably gives the best Lincoln played by anyone.
