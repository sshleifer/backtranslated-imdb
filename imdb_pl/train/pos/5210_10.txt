It is a pity that she did not get a loan, the best work in the film definitely has a girl on the cross, the best part of the movie. It had a much greater impact than Avril, or almost everyone else in the film. It almost made S / M look like fun! It was really credible because the S / M model is afraid of her situation. Although it seems that they really failed this kind of sleepy feeling of looking for a bad guy, these sets were very well built, but they simply slipped across the surface of what was shot. This is one movie in which both cuts should be available. They seem to have missed much of what has been filmed, and almost all really dark things that would make the film mad. It's a bit like they stopped in front of the sign they were going to make the movie for. What was shot would not score an R grade likely NC-17 or X, but that would be what it would need to do the movie the way it should.
