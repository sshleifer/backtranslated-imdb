Like the mild giants that make up the second part of the title, Michael Oblowitz's latest production has grace, but it is also slow and heavy. The last performance of the producer, "Mosquitoman-3D" had the same problem. It is hard to imagine a boring shark movie, but they managed somehow. Hammerhead's only asset: Shark Frenzy was his nice animatronix, which is always fun when we're dealing with great worlds beneath the surface of the ocean. But even that was satisfactory. Poor concentration in some scenes made the production seem amateurish. In the case of dolphins and whales, this technology is almost wasted. Overcast scenes and too many close-ups of giant movie objects do not allow the use of stunning 3D IMAX capabilities. There are too few scenes of any depth or variety. Approximations of these amazing creatures just look flat and there is often only one creature in the field of cameras, so there is no contrast in depth. Michael Oblowitz tries to follow his father's footsteps, but when you have Shark-Week on the cable, his introspective and boring treatment of his subjects is a constant disappointment.
