Even 15 years after the end of the Vietnam War, "Jacknife" came not too late or even unnecessary. This is one of the few who are trying to deal with the other sad side of the war: time after. Unlike movies such as "Taxi Driver" or "Rambo", which depict their main characters as spoiled heroes in a bad environment after the war, this movie allows the audience to face another view of Vietnamese veterinarians. Their development is shown very precisely before the war, and especially after it. The problems are obvious, but in all this tragic there is always a feeling of hope based on love and friendship. "Jacknife" may be the quietest film in Vietnam, but after almost 15 years it is really credible and justified. What's more, it can convince us that the war is not over yet; at least for some of us. <br /> <br /> The three main characters are amazing. De Niro did one of his best works, but Ed Harris is the star of the movie. Perhaps it was his best performance ever.
