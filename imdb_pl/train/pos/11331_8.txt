Usually, I do not have to write a movie review, but the only commentary on the movie is rather unfair, so I feel that I have to share my point of view. <br /> <br /> "Krisana" (or as it was called in the theater, I saw it, "Fallen") follows Matiss, a lonely Latvian archivist who tries to find out about a woman he did not try to stop from jumping off the bridge as well as its reasons. This is the plot in a nutshell, but this film does not deal with history in the same way as the guilt of a man who did not work. As the detective investigating the incident says, we usually do not care about the anonymous faces we pass every day until we die. <br /> <br /> Comparing with Michaelan Antonioni and his "Blowup" will most likely be full of every review you read about "Krisanie". The influence of Antonioni's philosophical and strict style and the story of "Blowup" are clear, and the writer / director Fred Kelemen obviously refers to this film in scenes in which Matiss tries to get to know a woman who jumped off the bridge, or at least what he thinks. <br /> <br /> The only person who shared his views on the film, weakens the appearance and sound of the film in the "student film class." He does not take into account the budgetary constraints that are most likely encountered by the existentialist Latvian film, but the atmospheric black and white cinematography and the sound of the surroundings are successful at showing the loneliness of Matiss on the artistic level. The sound of the background and the sounds of the street give an ominous aura and reminiscent of Fellini's film, regardless of whether it was Keleman's intention. The creators of the film undoubtedly had little money, but this limitation is used in favor of the film. <br /> <br /> "Krisana" is successful as a study of a character with enough humor to not become too serious. It could easily fall into the trap of a mysterious story, but it avoids it and becomes an intelligent film about loneliness and guilt. If you are more interested in the plot, this movie and its ending may frustrate you. Otherwise, take some time to get involved. It's worth finding out.
