Excellent comedy with Dudley Moore supported by Liza Minnelli and the well-known John Gielgud. Moore is Arthur, a man belonging to the multimillionaire family who was close to $ 750 million if he married a woman (Susan) from another family of multimillionaires. In principle, Arthur accepted the conditions, but eventually refused when he met nice and poor Linda Marola (Liza Minneli). Arthur was just a parasite because he did not work, he only enjoyed drinking hard and playing with prostitutes. After some serious thoughts in life and for the first time, Arthur decided not to marry Susan a few minutes before the wedding. The end was happy for Linda and Arthur, although the latter knew that his life would change in the coming future. This comedy is a good lesson for everyone. Rich people are usually not happy with their lifestyle.
