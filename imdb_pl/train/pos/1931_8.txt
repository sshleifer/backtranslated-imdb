The joint pool in Connecticut is the setting for this movie "under the radar", which is charming, funny, funny and attractive. Although she won awards at the most important film festivals, "The Big Bad Swim" was not released to hordes of theaters across America, but was distributed in the form of a DVD and selectively shown in cinemas. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that "The Big Bad Swim" has never had a marketing hype in the Hollywood release, considering how many trucks Hollywood released this year, such as "I Know Who Killed Me." "The Big Bad Swim", a really good independent film, had to swim up by itself. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, in "The Big Bad Swim" actress Paget Brewster is endearing and credible as Amy, a math teacher who not only is abandoned by her husband, but also intends to lose her job and end up risking a new life. Jeff Branson - TV soap actor - who is HOT - plays Noah, a serious, defenseless swimming teacher who goes for an additional pool to help his students overcome fears and discovers that he can learn from his students. Nice, sexy Jess Weixler (did I see her only in a bank advertisement?) Cleverly playing Jordan, a future swimmer who works in two positions, one as a dancer on the pipe, the other as a blackjack dealer. Her character is a catalyst for changes in the band, but it is the least understandable for heroes, because of the lack of "history" or motivation, why she does what she does. Jordan is young enough to still live at home with the ubiquitous younger brother who is spying on her. However, her parents do not appear to be involved in her life in any way, which seems strange. There is no drunken mother or abusive father here to explain why a normal, attractive girl from a suburb of Connecticut would choose a self-healing polar dancer who humiliates herself for dingy bachelor nights. <br /> <br /> Despite this dispute, "The Big Bad Swim" succeeds, to a large extent, because it is a happy, good movie. <br /> <br /> As you can expect, learning to swim is a metaphor for life. Ultimately, it's better to jump on both feet and swim instead of sitting on the deck because life is happening to you. <br /> <br /> Big Bad Swim is a great dating movie, a great dorm movie, a great movie "what I have not seen", and men like him and women.
