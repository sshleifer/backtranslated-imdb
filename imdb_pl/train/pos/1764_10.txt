Steve Carell plays his first lead role in the 40-year-old Virgin, with only supporting roles in such movies as Witch, Bruce Almighty, Anchorman and his work on the Daily Show, we only had a small comedy that Carell really does. You could say that Will Ferrell influenced his "comedy air", but Carell moves him to another level, everything he does is innocent, nice and fun. I would not hesitate to say that Steve Carell is one of the next great comedians of our time. <br /> <br /> The 40-year-old Virgin is two hours without a break (or 4 hours, if you see it twice as much as I do), excellent cast and great lead enchant the audience throughout the movie. The script was perfect with so many great lines that you would want to watch the movie again to try and remember them all. The music fits well with the tone of the movie and you can say that the director knew what he was doing. <br /> <br /> Full of sex, nudity and multilingual jokes, this movie is not for everyone, but if you liked Crashers, Anchorman or other films from these lines, you'll love The 40 Year Old Virgin .
