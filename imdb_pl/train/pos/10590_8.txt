This series was a cut above the rest of the TV series that day, but somehow did not find the audience. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​a blind detective may not be completely new, but he added so much to the plot. And who could forget Pax, the beautiful guide dog in the series! <br /> <br /> Although the stories themselves may have been no better than the average series, settings in New Orleans, acting and music (I notice a comment on the score in other comments ... I remember it clearly) everything works to make it even better create a good TV series! <br /> <br /> Well, you never know ... one day Paramount can just dig into his archives and release it on DVD!
