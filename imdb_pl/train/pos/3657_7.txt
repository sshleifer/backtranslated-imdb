This film resembles the version of Brutti sporchi e cattivi Ettore Scoli from 1950. Less sex and less realism, but a story of great humanism and warmth. I would not call it a neorealistic picture. It is very sentimental and resembles a fairy tale, and should probably be classified as a comedy, although it deals with serious matters (a bit like Chaplin or 1930-comedy). A typical Italian, but very emotional and hard to resist, except for a cold person. Sentimentality is disappointed, although this picture was not meant to be a realistic drama. This is not a masterpiece like Umberto D or The Bicycle Thief. But it is a nice and fun comedy with good music. <br /> <br /> 7/10
