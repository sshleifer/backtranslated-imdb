for anyone who plays video games here, someone noticed that GTA: Vice City Mansion in the game and other things, including the weapon from the movie that are linked to this movie and this movie inspired the creators of the game (Rockstar Games) to copy a few things from this movie, and by the way is one of the best movies from the 80s, I recommend it to anyone who has not seen it yet 10/10 without asking
