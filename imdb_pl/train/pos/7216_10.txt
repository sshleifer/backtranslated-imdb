Nobody will break this piece better! Great movie! Written expertly by Ira Levin and presented with the best job of Christopher Reeve and one of the best Caine, it's just perfect. I would like to catch a staged version somewhere ... maybe someday I will do it. I hope that this grossly underestimated, overlooked movie has not become too difficult to locate, because it is a "must" for any Hitchcock, Agatha-Phil or lover of a great movie. One of the few movies that I could not immediately solve or predict and worth the second or even third watch, "Deathtrap" gets 9/10 and earns every part of it. We need and deserve more such videos!
