This is the perfect start of Mickey Rooney's film career. His talents show that a long career awaits him. The chase of cars and trucks is exciting in the 1937 era. This beginning of the Andy Hardy series is an American treasure in my book. The efficiency of Spring Byington is as perfect as ever. Please, Mr. Rooney or the owners of the rights to the film, take a chance and get it on DVD. I think he will be the winner.
