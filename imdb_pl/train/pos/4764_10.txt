There are some comments about this movie that say it's bad and stupid, and such an outstanding actor as Pierre Fresnay should not have accepted his actions. <br /> <br /> I think, simply, even if the movie is strange and has some weaknesses, Pierre Fresnay's performance is so powerful that he transforms the movie into something perfect. <br /> <br /> His performance is probably the best in history. <br /> <br /> The film itself has a very polemical scene about the consecration of wine in cabaret. <br /> <br /> For someone who does not believe that a priest? even ruined? he can convert them in the blood of Christ, the scene may be strange. But for someone who grew up in a Catholic environment, he is very emotional, even if it is quite unpleasant. <br /> <br /> The death scene of the younger priest is incredibly shocking. But it is very well preserved. Pierre Fresnay turns a crazy act of murder into something understandable in the mundane madness of his character, tortured mad Morand, who in this horrible way returns to his duty.
