At first glance, it is an above-average post-war romantic comedy. Under the veneer is the funniest actor in the form of MGM. <br /> <br /> The pencils are simple, but all secondary ones are cast against the type. Margaret Hamilton (aka Wicked Witch of the West), Edward Everett Horton (professional obsessive-compulsive fussbudget) and Sig Ruman (nemesis of the Marx Brothers in: "Night in Casablanca" and always gorgeous "On Night at the Opera") deliberate gang trying to combine both lines together , instead of distributing them, as their "ordinary" characters do. <br /> <br /> It also pokes fun at many romantic and comedy conventions, which is another indication that it may not be so much a "simple" romantic comedy, which is a loud posting of many post-war romantic comedies and their two-dimensional characters. <br /> <br /> I only saw it once, with breaks, so I can not be positive, but this movie can be one of those that worked better in the context of the time they were made, but it's less effective now that viewers "see" these secondary characters through a completely different lens. I assume that this is when I give it 9 stars. I thought it was hysterical.
