I was an Accountant for Production in this film and I also had to do some work on the lecturer, so I'm not completely impartial, but if it was terrible, I would say that. I thought it was a funny movie, not a critically acclaimed masterpiece, but there was a lot of laughter along the way. The Bible says that laughter is good like medicine, so watching this movie can be good for your health. <br /> <br /> So many actors in this photo have not yet reached the top level of this film. Susan Sarandon, of course, is the one that has since gained much more fame. Melanie Mayron was watched on television every week as a photographer in the television series "Thirty-Something." Robert Englund later became known as Freddie Krueger, still haunting people's dreams. One of my favorite actors was Dub Taylor, who played the sheriff. He was a great comedian and a really nice, sincere person. We all had a great time working on this concert and I think the fun is coming.
