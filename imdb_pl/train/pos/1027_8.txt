I'm not great at writing reviews, so I'll just express my opinions ... <br /> <br /> At the beginning I loved this series. Adventure, action, comedy, drama ... I thought it was all genius. Anderson, Tapping, Shanks, Judge, Davis ... I loved them all. It seemed that Davis was the fifth most important person in the cast. No problem. But when his character (General Hammond) left at the end of the seventh season, and the figure of Anderson (Colonel O'Neill) moved from the field to the office, the quality of the series suddenly fell off the cliff. I do not know if it was because Hammond was more important than what I realized or what, but for some reason, after the seventh season, the series turned to ****. <br /> <br /> The first seven seasons, however, were amazing. The Stargate film seemed average the first time I saw it, but it turned out that it was, even if it was not the original intention, a brilliant set for the series. I recommend watching the movie first and then watching the first season of the TV series, then watching the movie again (you will have a completely new recognition for the second time), and then watch the rest of the TV series. <br /> <br /> The last three seasons of the series are not as good as the first seven, but that does not mean they are not good. That means they are disappointed if you broke down in the first seven seasons. <br /> <br /> After completing this series, be sure to watch the spin-off series, Stargate: Atlantis. He is a worthy successor to this brilliant series. <br /> <br /> EDIT 7-18-08: I just found out that Don S. Davis died a few weeks ago. It is a great loss.
