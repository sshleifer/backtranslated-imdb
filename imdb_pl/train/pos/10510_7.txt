This is a good adaptation, but not as good as the TV version. Actors are usually okay, but Jeremy Northam was rather a wet Mr. Knightley, especially compared to Mark Strong in the television version. Gwyneth Paltrow is fine, and her English accent is pretty good, but again I preferred Emma Kate Beckinsale. Toni Collette, Juliet Stephenson and Sophy Thompson have excellent support. <br /> <br /> The screenplay is often played too much laughter, the book is a comedy, but there are too many gags here, and the sub-story of Frank Churchill is almost completely absent. <br /> <br /> Scenery is the biggest criticism. It's too lush. England has never been like that. It looks like a chocolate box. Only Americans would do it. <br /> <br /> Despite these critics, I enjoyed this film, but I recommend a more TV adaptation.
