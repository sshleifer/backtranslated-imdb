Like Ishtar and King of Comedy, other great, misunderstood comedies, Envy has great performances of two actors playing essentially, losers (maybe too harsh words, I call them suburban insufficiency). <br /> <br /> This movie was a dark comedy gem and I'm not sure what people expect. I enjoy watching a large studio comedy that is not filled with obvious humor and I believe that the small moments in this movie make it worth it. Looking at Stiller's face when he sees a dog doo, disappears for the first time, grabs a moment, a moment that most people should recognize in themselves. Yes, it was a fairly simple story, but it explored the root of envy in a really interesting way. There were a lot of great scenes (damn "J-Man's cabin by the lake", Corky's unceremonious funeral, role of Weitz's wife and J-Man Walken - all great things. <br /> <br /> I can "Stand on people who get on IMDb and mercilessly destroy movies when they have absolutely no idea what to do, I will take Envy on almost every of the ten most profitable comedies of the year (with the exception of Napoleon Dynamite) and an unusual, pleasant jewel. <br /> <br /> Remember these people, in most cases Popular is not good.
