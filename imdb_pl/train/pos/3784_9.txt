One of the most underrated films I've seen for a long time, Bogus Journey Bill and Ted is the second funny adventure of Bill S. Preston Esq. and Ted Theodore Logan, aka Wyld Stallyns. There are two ways to watch this movie: First, you see a stupid dialogue, a far-reaching plot, a juvenile idea. OR ... You see ingeniously belittled idiots who once again find themselves in a situation too big for their brains. Throw Bruce Willis or Arnold Schwarzeneggar on this story and become a big movie hit. Bill and Ted enter the story with the same level of sincerity, only Bill and Ted. It's a difficult fence, but when you watch a movie not as a comedy with one-off screws, but as an adventure involving two guys who have no interest in adventures, it becomes a lot more.
