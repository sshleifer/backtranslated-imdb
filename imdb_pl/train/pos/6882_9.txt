I have not watched the movie yet, but I can not wait to see it! It seems very interesting and inspiring. It was one of the most interesting harbingers I have ever seen: the questions really stopped me and prompted me to think, a unique approach to boxing as a metaphor of "battle in the middle" ... thank God, someone is hitting a different angle in the box. This film looks so fresh and elegant. And the actor is really hot. I especially liked the short clip with the actor from Rocky movies, really clever. I thought that the topic chosen to overcome adversity and trauma from childhood - is timeless, and God knows that many people need it. Bring it.
