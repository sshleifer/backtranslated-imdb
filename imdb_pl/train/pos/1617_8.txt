"Moonstruck" is a love story. There is not one romance, there are at least three, but they all have a relationship with the same family. The Loretta family. Loretta (Cher) is about to marry Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello). He does not love him, but he is a sweet and good man. When he leaves for his dying mother in Italy, Loretta meets brother Johnny, Ronny (Nicolas Cage). He and Johnny have not talked to each other for five years, and Loretta wants to invite him to the wedding. Of course they are falling on each other. <br /> <br /> How this love story and stories of parents, your uncle and your aunt Loretta are developing, is something you have to see for yourself. Everyone is watching a delight to watch, with Cher as a bright star in the middle of everything. This year she won and really deserved an Oscar. Cage is pretty good and goofy, and Olympia Dukakis as mother of Loretta and Vincent Gardenia as her father are wonderful. This movie is funny, charming and therefore very pleasant.
