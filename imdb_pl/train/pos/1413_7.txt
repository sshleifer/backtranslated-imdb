In 2006 AMPAS awarded one of the most innovative documentary films depicting wildlife in the coldest place on Earth. The film is March of the Penguins narrated by Oscar winner Morgan Freeman. monopoly on the animated circuit for decades. They took their scissors while filming live, and it all hit the spot. Then Disney created a sub-unit called Disneynature and released his first feature film "Earth". This is absolutely one of the most touching and instructive documentaries I've seen in a while. <br /> <br /> Told by the great James Earl Jones, Earth offers nothing new to anyone who has watched the Discovery Channel in the last five years or is closely following the global warming crisis. The Earth is deeply concerned with this issue and is taking a very liberal approach to the subject. <br /> <br /> It enables emotional connection with nature, which I have not experienced before. It also shows not only the beauty and mysterious parts of our wonderful planet, but also the grunting and disturbing aspects that it often entails. One thing is to observe how "Mufasa" falls from the cliff to panic, or Bambi's mother is shot by a hunter in the middle of the forest. Everything is fine, because at the end of the movie we know that it is a movie. This shows penguins, polar bears, elephants, all kinds of families, from all environments, living and dying in their natural habitats. These real things make the film a real experience. <br /> <br /> The Earth is a bit heavy in the graphic nature of the film (which many people will not agree with). Great work in the cinema by a great team of photographers and the amazing result of George Fenton. Compared to March of the Penguins or Grizzly Man, he has no means, but he is great in himself. At the end of the day you appreciate our planet and some sadness, because many of us will probably never visit the places we will see in the film. We live here, but it's as if we never met the planet for one reason or another. The earth is beautiful. <br /> <br /> *** / ****
