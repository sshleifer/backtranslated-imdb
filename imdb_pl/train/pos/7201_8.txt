A very good dramatic comedy about a playwright trying to figure out how to keep her head on the water after running out of ideas. I can not say much about this film without revealing the story. I can say that it was not as it seems, because you are watching the picture. Everyone has their own program. Nice surprise at the end - after all other surprises. Well written with good performance by everyone.
