I meant in a GOOD way, believe me. Faithful to life, it is not. Oirish's whole thing is getting pretty thick, but you'll love the cast - Flynn, Smith, Bond, Watson, Frawley, etc. Everything's fine. I also liked to see Mike Mazurki-of Course, who played the boxer, what else? The typical forties are overflowing with well-known faces and quick scenes, one after the other. <br/> <br /> Flynn is alright as Gentleman Jim, you'll never go through a 1 dimensional look at him or the rest here, I think, but he's alright, he's cartoon and he has to like it, that's all. Boxing scenes were pretty good, vaudeville registration of Ward Bond behaves like a rebellion, and you wanted to see all these clawed bobbies that come back to the stage several times. <br /> <br /> Really good, Flynn was on the roll at the time and you can see why the audience loved him. <br /> <br /> *** outta ****
