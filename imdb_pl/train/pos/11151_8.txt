The only reason I knew the Midnight Cowboy was because it was in Top 100 AFI Critic. For the top 100, this is not a very well-known movie; indeed, I had to look hard to find a copy, I got a DVD version for about half the price. Surprisingly, it was only rated as M15 + (uncut version). <br /> <br /> I doubt that many will pay attention to this review (more like a comment), so I will do it briefly. <br /> <br /> This is probably one of the strangest movies I've seen, partly because of the use of montages, artistic filming (a very artistic home) and an extraordinary subject. There are many things in the movie that I still do not understand (I've seen it twice), and that makes the film emotionally misleading. <br /> <br /> Filming and acting were very good and it is bigger than life of characters that make this film unforgettable. The main character is Joe Buck, a cowboy from Texas who moves to New York to become a male prostitute. He meets the injured horse Enrico "Ratso" Rizzo and, of course, become friends going through ordinary escapades. What makes the movie interesting is the fact that the two characters are so different. <br /> <br /> I felt that the film did not really develop the relationship between Buck and Enrico Rizzo, that the audience would have any emotional connection, although the ending is certainly very sad and tragic. You probably already know what's going on, reading the reviews, but it's obvious from the very beginning. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think that the film explores its main themes beautifully and poignantly. Depriving mankind (visible through the darkness of the city streets, crumbling tenement houses). Most of the characters in the film exist outside the law (conman, giggolo.etc), but you can not help them. Joe Buck is engaging because he is so na√Øve and optimistic, and then we start to feel pity for Ratso in the later film. <br /> <br /> I think the film was rated so high because it was certainly a very breakthrough for its period. At that time (and even now) it definitely was not a typical movie (quite an art house). At a time when cinema was dominated by tired westerns, musicals and dramas, there is a movie about such an unusual topic as Midnight Cowboy. <br /> <br /> At the personal level, I have to say that I really enjoyed the movie. The images conveyed a dream-like quality. I especially liked the stage at the party, music, paintings, etc. They stay in the memory for a long time after watching. However, as a movie, it was a bit lacking due to entertainment (it was not really my movie style). It is a film that should be tasted and appreciated, not a cheap action stock movie. <br /> <br /> Although I would not consider myself qualified to analyze this movie, the characters and their motives were quite interesting. From what I understand from retrospection, Joe Buck was sexually abused by his grandmother as a child, although it still does not seem to be related to history. He is a young happy young stud dog who suppresses darker memories. Religious connotations in the film are also mysterious. Some suggest a homosexual relationship between Buck and Ratso, although I do not see where they got the idea. The subject of homosexuality in general is more than stirred in their conversation, and later in the meeting of Joe Buck with a lonely old man, but it has little to do with the main story. <br /> <br /> Certainly from a technical point of view on one of the best films of the decade (it's more 70's than it was in the 1960s) and revolutionary in its time touching the themes of several other movies, he dared to do it. Although it has a simple, sentimental story (hidden under the hard edge), the beauty of the film lies in strange, often psychedelic sequences.
