Jack Frost is a really cool movie. I mean .... It's funny. His Violent. and very pleasant. Most people say they are rated B, but they can not be further from the truth. It has great special effects and good performance. The only strange thing is Course, The Killer Snowman. I think that this movie was actually one of the best films of the late nineties. In most of the Films these days, there is a missing Piece of Master Clive Barker. That is, Be original and give the viewer what they do not expect. Jack Frost is very nice. 10 out of 10. Class: A +. Ed also recommends film uncle Sam to fans of Jacek Frost.
