I went to the movie for cast and crew show, because my friend who is the producer of the movie invited me. Forget about what you saw in the ads, forget about what you heard, go to this movie. I was more surprised. In the world of The Grinch, Charlies Angels, The Sixth Day, Unbreakable, a movie worth of hard earned dollars is coming! Glorious scenes, wonderful movie and cast you want to eat with your heart. I think it is one of the most titled films of this summer with common sense. Robert Deniro deserves a nod. If you could give oscar to everyone involved in the package, it would be a movie.
