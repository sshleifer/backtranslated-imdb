An amazing performance by Simon Pegg, who is getting better with every role. As usual, he plays the role of a very skimpy hero who sometimes makes you want to hide behind his pillow in embarrassment, but that's what Pegg is all about. <br /> <br /> Laughter was regular and tearing eyes and everyone was aiming at Penn. The film was very cleverly collected, where each character plays a very sophisticated and serious part, and Penn is the only engaged humor, which is a great appreciation for the director Robert Weide. without a quick applause for Gilliam Anderson, who shone all the time. I highly recommend it to everyone.
