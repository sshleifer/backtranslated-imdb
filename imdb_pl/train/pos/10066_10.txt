King of Masks (Bian Lian in China) is a shockingly beautiful and deeply touching film. Winner of 16 awards from around the world, the film based on real history focuses on Wang Bianlian, a street performer from China in the thirties who is aging, but he has no heir to convey his art of face-changing opera. He has a unique talent for quickly changing masks in performance and no one knows how to do it. He has a desire to have a grandson because his art is a family memento that can only be passed on to a male heir. Then we go out into the streets and see that people sell their children because they can not afford to look after them: some even beg for taking their daughters for free, because daughters are not worth living in this society. The story of Wang Bianlian goes on. <br /> <br /> The film was so amazingly good, the acting was amazing and the issues were so heavy and well thought out. There is gender inequality and the depressing fact that no one wants a little girl at this time and place. It is also interesting that the famous opera actor, who always plays a woman and is known as a Living Bodhisattva, is a man who dresses up as a woman, and although he is famous and respected, he is considered to be something low, half woman. Going further in the film, we face the issue of trafficking in slaves and their needs, and thus the lack of a possible solution to this problem, brutality and corruption of the army and police as well as helplessness and powerlessness that anyone can face because of unfortunate events or even good intentions. <br /> <br /> This is definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life, and Xu Zhu, the actor who plays Wang Bianlian, presents another beautiful performance.
