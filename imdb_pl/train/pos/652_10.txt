this movie is so complicated that you can give it any description and still use it. you have an uncertain, restless and fascinating main character (in this role Jean-Pierre Léaud), who is imprisoned between two (non, three) women. we listen to his social, philosophical and moral peculiarities in endless monologues, we see him working on his magic around the three women he loves. it may be a premise for a bird movie full of stiff, cold, uninteresting comments. and yet the director Jean Eustache manages to maintain freshness, irony and wit. being such a long movie, you can not just laugh when after 2 hours of polite speaking Jean-Pierre Léaud suddenly shouted on the phone, remembering the cheesy line from the movie. such situations are purely cinematographic and can not be fully restored in the commentary. it is also impossible to restore the tragic and painfully beautiful monologue of Françoise Lebrun at the end of the film. 3 and 1/2 hours and worth every minute.
