It is a film about deep and unspoken interpersonal relations. <br /> <br /> They finally speak, but is there any chance to change anything in this situation. <br /> <br /> Originally produced in Shanghai 1948 and completely free from propaganda, the film introduces us to the Dai family. There is still some weight in history that surrounds the family. History usually has meaning in Chinese literature and serious film. <br /> <br /> A young couple - Liyan, an invalid and his wife Yuwen live in a once-great family that is partially ruined. <br /> <br /> The bright contrast is younger sister Liyan, who really does not remember the family history, but accepts everything in a very natural way. Her spirit is as bright as the other two are reserved. <br /> <br /> In this seemingly stable world comes an unexpected guest ... <br /> <br /> It ended up being sad - but definitely the best movie.
