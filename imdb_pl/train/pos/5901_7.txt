This is the reashation of many of the latest movies, only this one has fewer stars, fewer complications and a more blurred impression. Abhay and Ritika (played by Fardeen Khan and Esha Deol respectively) meet at a friend's wedding, where their own marriage (unconscious for them) begins the arrangement process. In a short time, both strangers are married and sent to a newlyweds' camp, where they meet other couples who undergo similar movements. When they spend time together, secrets reveal themselves, hearts broken and / or repaired and bloom love. <br /> <br /> If you saw Honeymoon Private Limited and / or Salaam-e-Ishq, then you saw this movie. The plot returns are the same, there is not a single element of surprise within two and a half hours of the movie. Everything is predictable. I liked it only because I had seen "Darling" before (which also featured Deol and Khan) and I was happy with their chemistry, so I said "why not" when my sister suggested that we rent "Just married". <br /> <br /> View: Because Kirron Kher interacts with the stars and is her usual favorite. <br /> <br /> Skip: Because you've had enough of this whole steam nonsense! <br /> <br /> C +
