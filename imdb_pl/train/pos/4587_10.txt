Although hard boiled, John Woo is my favorite movie number 1. But I have to say that the police are my favorite film number 2. I say this because the acrobatics, fights and action that my favorite part of the movie is when Jackie Chan jumps off the rail at the top of the esculator in the shopping center, he catches himself on a pole surrounded by Chrismas lights and slips off the fall through the skylight and finally land on his back on a hard marble floor. OUCH! Buy on amazon.com for 2:98. (Or something for $ 14). A new home video VHS. Please answer any questions or comments. (I'm only 14, but I know where you can find any movie.) If you're looking for a movie and can not find it, answer me. Thank you and good night!
