I came across this series by accident. After the episode, I was addicted. American Gothic was a dark, strange series in which Gary Cole was a mysterious, probably bad Sheriff Buck, who tries to gain control over his illegitimate son Caleb, played by Lucas Black. I was impressed by the slander sheriff Gary Cole and I was even more impressed by Lucas Black. Caleb Lucas Black was able to stand up to Sheriff Buck, one of the scariest characters ever created for a TV series. I rarely saw a child actor with the same presence or talent as Lucas Black. If you were not lucky to see Lucas in American Gothic, see him in Slingblade. <br /> <br /> It was an amazing show with many ambiguities and mysteries that were never explained during the short run.
