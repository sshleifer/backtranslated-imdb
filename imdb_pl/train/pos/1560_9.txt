This meeting, team and a great episode of Justice. From hesitation to solution, Clark made an important leap from a restless teenager who feared a controlled destiny to Superman, who, like Green Arrow, puts his emotions away on his loved ones, ready to save the whole planet. This is not only an exciting story about teamwork, loyalty and friendship; it is also about what is more important in life, a lesson for Clark. I do not want the series to end, but I hope that the next episodes will strictly stick to what justice shows without "scrolling", and puts a good end to Smallville --- and a great start for Superman. <br /> <br /> In this episode, however, we should see a greater contrast between Lex and the band. Nine stars should give him enough credit.
