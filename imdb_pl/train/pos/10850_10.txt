What a good movie! Finally a painting revealing the unknown side of rock: illusion of fame. Famous Rockers age and forget, not music. And with a good sense of humor. Have you ever danced in Bill Haley's Rock Around the Clock? <br /> <br /> Anyway, Still Crazy is probably the best rock n'roll movie I've ever seen. Much better than for example Spinal Tap. Why? Because people are ripe in Still Crazy. They have a different point of view about rock, love and life. They want to catch up with their crazy youth, for which they miss so much. In addition to the story itself, we see heroes with their own personality, weaknesses and dreams. Like all of us. <br /> <br /> Have a nice time watching this (listen to the amazing soundtrack!) and finally think about your future. <br /> <br /> Hi!
