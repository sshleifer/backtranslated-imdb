Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais have a high hit rate in the field of television work. However, their film work was much more checkered (The Bank Job from 2008 was fine, for example last year's Across The Universe definitely weak). <br /> <br /> Still Crazy, thankfully, is a solid success. It has a great story, great performances, a lot of humor, great music, and above all a real heart. <br /> <br /> I enjoy "moments", and this movie has one of them - when everything during the festival convention will be pear shaped ... <br /> <br /> Extremely pleasant.
