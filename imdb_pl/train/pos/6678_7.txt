I really did not expect much from this film, but it was not bad; actually it was pretty good. This movie included some of the funniest scripts I've ever seen in a movie. I'm not saying that this is one of the funniest films of all time, but in some parts I was laughing quite hard. "The police recognized my father's death as suicide. They said the elevator shaft had fallen. For a few balls. " Now this movie is not for everyone, mainly his stupid humor, such as Zoolander or Dodgeball; so if you hated these movies, I'd probably recommend that you avoid them. Overall, it was a nice movie about a group of superheroes who eventually become real heroes. It's a very overrated comedy that many people probably have not seen before, because like me, before watching, she expected it to be a complete trash. After watching this movie, I finally understand why this movie was able to gather such a cast of superstars, which includes Ben Stiller, William H. Macy, Hank Azaria, and even the kid from Good Burger. That's because Mystery Man is full of great comedy 7 out of 10. A very big surprise.
