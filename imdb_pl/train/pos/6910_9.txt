Paul was completely deceived by someone who was the most important and who did Dave. It's the same story, though not so much fun. <br /> <br /> Paul connected with me this morning about the scene when sammy davis sings the new national anthem Paradora. he came to Brazil after a long flight from Vegas, three planes, a car ride to the plan, etc. he was defeated. he could not bear it, he had to use a cane. he stayed in the trailer about the size of my bathroom. <br /> <br /> he did not know he could do it. then he saw a crowd of 6000 extras, he paid 7 bucks. he revived and shot this scene for two hours. he was gorgeous, and then he almost fell. <br /> <br /> Pawe≈Ç is a great guy, though very liberal. real talent.
