This film begins with a family that has been going in different directions, and their teenage daughter Martha MacIssac (Olivia Dunne) was very much in love with Joe MacLeod (Zack). Mother plays Mitzi Kapture, (Jill Dunne), who suddenly bumps into her daughter, and Zack looks around, and then all kinds of problems appear. Jill Dunne has a husband who travels frequently or stays away from home. There are also big problems that arise when the family decides to go camping, which their daughter Olivia does not like and just can not adapt to sleeping outside and requires that the tent is not exposed to any mistakes. In many respects, Olivia performs outstanding performances as a teenager and Nick Mancuso (Richard Grant) gives a great supporting role as the hotel's owner. This movie will make you guess how it will end and you will enjoy a movie full of terror and horror. Enjoy
