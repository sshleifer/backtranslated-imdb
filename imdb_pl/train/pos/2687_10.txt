No other movie made me feel like this before ... and I do not feel bad. For example, I do not want a refund or time when I was waiting to watch the movie (9 months), nor do I feel bad when I use two hours of sunny summer day to see this ______. The reason I say "_____" is that no matter how hard I break my brain, I just can not think of a word in any of the seven languages ​​in which the movie was to sum it up. I have no idea what happened all the time and I needed a break in the middle of the movie. No movie has ever done it to me before. I never wanted cauliflower, milk and baguettes in my life.
