"The Case of Scorpion's Tail" contains all the elements necessary to create an effective giallo movie. The story is standard giallo. When a man dies in a plane crash, his wife (Ida Galli) collects a million dollar life policy. The widow goes to Greece for payment, but follows a series of macabre murders. There are many suspects, including a persistent researcher (George Hilton) with an insurance agency and widow's mistress. Director Martino keeps the tempo at a fast pace, while the viewer tries to guess the identity of the killer. Anita Strindberg (also remembered in "Your Vice Is Locked Room and Only I Have the Key" and "Who Saw Her Die?") This is a stunning heroine. This is one of the best Martino films.
