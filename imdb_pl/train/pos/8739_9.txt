This is the FUNNY movie. It contains all the typical components of Disney (music, rich range of characters, history, attractiveness), entwined with excellent animation and excellent voice talent of lesser-known actors such as "Antz" and "Price of Egypt". /> <br /> Heroes work really well and have a strong charm, and humor is directed at a wide level that overcomes generation barriers. The film is also presented in an excellent cinemascope format, which increases the cinema experience. <br /> <br /> Call me crazy, but I've seen this movie three times and I'm going to take more friends to see him this weekend. Many skeptics saw this movie on my recommendation and I was not disappointed. I work in a multiplex and I can honestly say that nobody ever left this movie without a sense of satisfaction. <br /> <br /> See this and do not be discouraged because it is animated. You will definitely like this movie and make sure you stay at the end points! Bloody and interludes at the end are the funniest part of the movie, which is full of laughter.
