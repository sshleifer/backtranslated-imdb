How many of us want us to throw away our social and cultural commitments and be free? I suspect most of us. Shall we dance? it is not a movie about dancing. It's about getting to know each other, recognizing what we're looking for in life, and having the courage to look for it. Sugiyama is a member of a middle-aged Japanese society where ballroom dancing is seen as inappropriate behavior. <br /> <br /> One day Mr. Sugiyama sees a beautiful girl leaning out the dance window. she is fascinated by her and eventually enrolls in dance lessons. He is ashamed of his dance and is afraid of ridiculing himself. He hides the fact that he is attending dance classes on the part of his friends and family. <br /> <br /> In the men's room in the office there is a funny scene, when Sugiyama and Watanabe, a colleague from work, who also dances, is interrupted by practicing some of the dance steps. There are many other funny and cordial scenes. <br /> <br /> The ending is not a fairy tale, but leaves the viewer feeling good. <br /> <br /> This movie helped me understand Japanese people a little better. It is a warm and very valuable movie to watch.
