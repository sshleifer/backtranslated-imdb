One of the funniest John, Eugene Levy is also great, I just want the studio to understand that it must be on DVD, I have it on video, but I think this movie deserves a DVD (and the addition would be great) Skit Kung Fu Uuniversity (Kung Fu U) is very funny, like the whole movie, also the scenes that he has with his girlfriend and her family are great, this movie never seems to be on TV, but loses the most of his gayness when editing television if you can find a movie that I would suggest to buy (eBay is a good place to find a copy) I will keep my VHS until one day we will see it on DVD. there are so many great movies that have not yet been released on DVD, and this is one of them.
