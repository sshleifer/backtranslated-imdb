Men can murder Lollo if they like (or her lollos - she gave her name to the slang word for breasts in French), but ladies have even a tastier morsel in divine Gerard Philipe, who is not only beautiful, can act. Do not be discouraged if your version has no subtitles, because in this simple, thrilling story of love and war, where everything is fair, you do not need it. All you need to know is that at the beginning of the movie Lollobrigida reads Philipe's hand and tells him that he will marry the king's daughter. Then the story is quite simple with Gaulian gestures and running, jumping and fencing. <br /> <br /> On the down side, the obviousness of the story and the heavy playfulness of the tone are getting weary, it's annoying that the French seem to consider themselves too good for Hollywood to bother themselves with even trying to convince about the exciting acrobatics. And of course a non-French speaker longs for occasional fragments of ooh-la-la, such as: A virtuous girl: I must tell you that my heart belongs to Fanfan. Seducer: My dear, what made you think I'm interested in this little thing?
