Henri Verneuil's film may not be as famous as Parallax View, 3 Days of the Condor or JFK, but it is certainly not inferior, and sometimes even better than the classical representatives of the genre. The action takes place in a fictional western state in which the fictitious president was killed. After several years of investigation, a special government commission decides that the president was killed by a lone gunner. But one man - prosecutor Volney, played by Yves Montand - thinks that you should investigate something more, so the film begins. This film does not deal with certain exact theories, but covers the entire structure of the relationship between government and society in today's world. Such a film could be created only in the seventies, but it will never lose its current status. What's more, it's even a bit scary how precise oracles are. 10 out of 10.
