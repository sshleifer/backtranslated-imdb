If you grew up on a diet of games, you will understand that you gradually need a bigger and better solution. In the world of the running man, your needs will be met. In this game show, prisoners compete for freedom and the final reward - their lives. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie. It was such a parody in the mind-numbing flakes we see every day. This is not one of Schwarzenegger's best performances, but overall it is a very good movie. The basic idea that TV corporations will once be "real" rulers of the planet is very credible and very well portrayed in this film. Of course there are the usual Arnie one-liners, my favorite is when he is going to be catapulted in gamezone, the host of gameshow asks: "Any last words?" Arnie says: "Yes, I'll be back", but the host yells "Only in restart" and pushes the button eject. I give this film 10 to get pure originality. I had to watch it 30 or more times. The only movie except the Die Hard series, which I often watched !! <br /> <br /> In short, do not think for a moment that you are the owner of T.V.
