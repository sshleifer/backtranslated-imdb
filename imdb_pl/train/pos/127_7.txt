Zentropa has much in common with The Third Man, another film similar to noir, embedded in the ruins of post-war Europe. Like TTM, there are many imaginative works with cameras. She is an innocent American who is emotionally connected to a woman she does not really understand, and whose naivety is even more striking compared to the natives. <br /> <br /> But I must say that the Third Man has a better prepared plot. Zentropa is a bit chaotic in this respect. Perhaps it is intended: it is presented as a dream / nightmare, and making it too coherent would spoil the effect. <br /> <br /> This film is inexorably gloomy - "noir" in more than one sense; He never sees the sun. Gloomy, but intriguing and frightening.
