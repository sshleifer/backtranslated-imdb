this movie simply shows that you do not need big explosions, multi-billion dollar computer graphics, or high-paying actors and actresses to make a good movie. which master of all Japanese films, Akira Kurosawa, ends perfectly. I recommend this movie to everyone who loves the epic song. and for those who like the earlier work of Kurosawas. 10/10
