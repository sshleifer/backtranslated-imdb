Two bold teenagers, best friends, go on a trip to Thailand for the last experience before they leave and go to college. It seems that it is a pleasant time to explore an exotic land, until they meet an attractive stranger who seduces them on a trip to Hong Kong and places drugs in their luggage. They are caught by the local police and state that justice in Asia is very different from justice in the United States. <br /> <br /> This is the main feature line "Brokedown Palace" and it was good. The film does a decent job, presenting arbitrary and corrupt justice systems of third world countries. In fact, the appearance was rather mild, because conditions in prisons are often much worse than shown. It serves as a reminder that no matter how bad our justice system is, it is pristine compared to the rest of the world. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, in the film there were too many imaginary situations that made history difficult. The whole attempt to escape was a false fantasy. To think that friends will be able to smuggle money into a jail in a padded bra and will not be discovered by guards who have systematically checked everything that was brought by the guests, assumes that either the guards or spectators are complete fools. <br /> <br /> The story does not bring up the nagging question of how the drugs got into Alice's backpack (Claire Danes). Did she really agree to drug transport? It remains to guess us. It was intriguing to guess the girls' innocence in the whole movie, but we end the film without knowing whether one or both girls are guilty. With the exception of this significant disadvantage, the ending was excellent and the results unexpected. <br /> <br /> Acting Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale was very solid and well made. The Danes, who were sold out and overgrown, actually appeared as an actor in this film. Although her portrait was often immature (like her character), she improved as the film progressed and circumstances became more tragic. Beckinsale, in contrast, flew under the radar throughout her short career and shines like good-natured boots that are suddenly in prison. This was the best performance in the film. <br /> <br /> Bill Pullman was unsuccessful as a lawyer. His gaudy and uncertain style is an asset in films such as "While you are asleep", but as a lawyer in a third world country in a crusade to free two innocent girls from injustice, he had the wrong personality. <br /> <br /> The tourist's look at Thailand was interesting, but it did not make me want to go there. <br /> <br /> In general, a funny movie made incredible in part by adding some funny scenes. I gave him 7/10.
