I really liked this movie ... it was cute. I liked it, but if you do not, it's your fault. Emma Roberts played a good Nancy Drew, although it is not exactly similar to books. Old fashionable costumes are strange when you see them in modern times, but it looks good on them. For me, the rich girls did not have the costumes that made them look rich. I mean, it looks like they got all the clothes - blindfolded - for sale in the garage and decided to put it all together. All costumes were cheesy, especially when they wore moccasins with regular outfits. I do not want the movie to look bad, because it certainly is not! Just go to the theater and watch it !!! You'll love it!
