I've loved this movie since I was 7 years old and saw it on the opening day. It was so moving and beautiful. I definitely recommend it to everyone. It's a movie to watch with the whole family. <br /> <br /> My opinion MPAA: PG-13 for thematic elements, extended disaster scenes, nudity / sexuality and some language.
