For those interested in business and the world of corporations, this program is simply the best of the best. As one of the former participants of the show on this innovative program wrote on his blog: People in business finally had buyers. The whole idea is perfect; having a group of entrepreneurs competing with each other in business related tasks, placed in the best place in the world, in New York. Donald Trump is perfect as a boss, although his ego is larger than the entire universe times infinite. He also makes many dubious decisions about who to fire, which is one of the negative aspects of the program. <br /> <br /> Season 1: A great overall season, the best season of "normal". This season was the one that most concerned actual business skills. Later, the series almost drowned in marketing tasks with too many placements. Great and interesting players, with the most nice character in this series: Troy. I know I'm not the only one who suspects that the episode of the Trump World Tower in which he was fired has been faked so that Amy and Nick will win this special task. <br /> <br /> Season 2: also a great season. The tasks were still fine and had many interesting participants. Jen M was terrible and she should never have reached the finals, IMO. This season was also the worst in history (Pamela). <br /> <br /> Season 3: Scary. Actually, I liked the concept of book wisdom and street cunning, but the cast was so horrible (it turned out that Trump hated the cast) that the whole season was a total disaster. The best moments are the second episode (renovation at the motel), in which Prime Minister Brian fired, a guy who did not add anything but a huge amount of comedy. <br /> <br /> Season 4: An excellent season, very because of the interesting and fun players this season (especially Randall, Alla, Marcus and the total disaster, which was called Toral). The episode "Take me to the conference room" is one of the absolute classics of this concert, ending with a well-remembered quadruple burnout. Unfortunately, I think we were robbed for the final of Randall Vs. Alla. I think Trump was afraid he could win and prevent it. <br /> <br /> Season 5: A boring season in which there are no special things. Brent was simply embarrassment and of course only there to create drama. The tasks were generally horrible (how does creating jingle have something to do with business?). I think the best man won, but personally I do not care. <br /> <br /> Season 6: I see why they wanted to try LA as a new venue for a concert, but looking back it was a mistake. New York will always be a new place. This season we have added so many new things, most of which were terrible (eg losing a team sleeping outside in tents, for example winning a PM is still PM). The tasks were terrible, and Trump also chose the wrong winner. James deserved it, no doubt. <br /> <br /> Season 7: Star edition. The best season in history. Completely different rules (eg Using rolodex), but all the fun and entertainment. The biggest problem was that many players were not real celebrities at all, especially women in which everyone was unknown to me, except for Omarosa, which is a total disgrace of everything in which she participates. It looked like the season of Gene Simmon, but after he made a complete fool of himself during Kodak's task, another man emerged from the shadows: Piers Morgan. Nobody ever dominated in the season like him. He crushed his opponents and turned out to be a guy with a great sense of humor (although some restless Americans (not all Americans, of course, do not take me badly) unfortunately did not have social skills to understand this). HOW TO GET THE BREAST !! <br /> <br /> For fans of this I highly recommend the British version with Sir Alan Sugar as the boss. In fact, the British version is much better, and that says something because the American (and original) is a really great show. One of the things in the British version is that players usually behave like decent people in a conference room, as opposed to the constant shouting and rude behavior that takes place in the American version.
