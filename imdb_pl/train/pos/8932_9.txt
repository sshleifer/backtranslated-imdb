The film is not visually stunning in the conventional sense. It does not present a series of nice pictures. Instead, it is a visually interesting movie. It forces the viewer to constantly process or imagine the context of different shots. Such things are easy to try but difficult to achieve. The film refuses to use the genre of the genre to help less than the fully engaged viewer what is happening. Instead, the film moves and moves many different genres. The art of loving a movie is the opportunity to enjoy this fun. I suspect 99% of North American viewers will not understand it. If you try to determine the narrative of this film, the philosophical message, the structure of symbolism, etc., you will waste your time. There is none of them. The film only revolves around these genres and others. The only force uniting in the film is the sense of Claire Denis, which fits together. There are so few full-length movies that approach Kant's satisfactory description of what art is, namely enjoying the power of the court itself, and not simply drawing the experience under the concept of. The film usually goes to the straight path and chooses a simpler pleasure of understanding what is happening. Most movies are not art. Most of the films are not close to art. When a movie does, as it does, and is still enjoyable for many viewers, it's a miracle. My negative comment is that sometimes I think the movie is too easy to buy different narrative threads that go through it. The narrative of father and son from Tahiti, although not exactly conventional, ends with the explanation and simplicity of things. It dominates too much.
