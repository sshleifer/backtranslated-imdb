A unique film ... one of the best of all times. Acting, script, Quincy Jones score, photos, editing, etc. - simply fantastic. As most viewers know, this movie is based on a book by Truman Capote about the famous killing of the Kansas farmer family (Clutters) by several young boys during the robbery. I've never seen a movie that brilliantly turned a real story into a riveting movie. <br /> <br /> The actors are solid, but they focus on the killers, Dick and Perry, and the pursuing team. Scott Wilson, because Dick Hickock is amazing. Conceited, nervous and devoid of compassion, he turns out to be so charming, oily and credible. Robert Blake as Perry Smith is also extraordinary - lonely, yet empathic and cold-blooded. Who could put these qualities into one person and force us to buy it? He does it and he is brilliant! The key point of this book is the way it took the intersection of these two very different sociopathic people to create a critical mass to commit such a stupid and hideous crime, and these two actors make it work beautifully. They both had moments in successive careers, but these performances are high marks of water, and that means a period of action. <br /> <br /> Cops are great too. The investigators are John Forsythe, but the other three detectives are also great. Unlike modern films, where producers think that it is necessary to give the police superhuman assets or weaknesses, these are simply real flat rates, working with determination and competence. They seem so real. I have never seen cops on a screen so powerful in their authenticity; and I saw most of the crime classics coming back. Really one of a kind. <br /> <br /> PARTIAL SPOILER COMING (this movie is unique because you already know what happened, but be warned about recording). <br /> <br /> Of course, the best scenes from the best crime shows and films are interrogations - intellectual fencing between cops and cheaters, Mano and Mano. This movie has the best interrogation scenes you will ever see in the movie. Follow Dick and Perry, who are trying to bluff and slowly unravel, unaware that the cops are wearing good. But the cops must deftly prepare the suspects to break the alibi and hopefully confess. These are some of the best activities you will ever see. Think Glengarry Glen Ross without a showboating. <br /> <br /> To help translate the sad and frightening aspects of this true story, ICB was filmed in the real Clutter house, and I heard that Clutters were played by film students to give them a real vibe. It works. They look like decent, simple people. This makes the crime so tangible and sad. <br /> <br /> I will stay here. This is not a good movie, but it is one of the best films ever made, and it is so special that it is a must for every film lover.
