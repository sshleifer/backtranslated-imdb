I can understand why some people like this movie and why some do not. For me, however, I really like it, even if I noticed some good pieces, and not such impressive pieces. The animation was really great, like Charlie's dream. The heroes were mixed bags, preferably Anne-Marie, whose voice was played by the late Judith Barsi. (When I read what happened to her, I was physically ill). (Especially, I loved the "Morons that surround Morons") and together with Rasputin and Warren T. Rat is probably the most memorable of all the villains of Don Bluth. Charlie and Itchy just did not have the same luster, but I loved Gator King and his song. Part of the movie is very haunted, like Annabelle, "You can never come", which still scares me. Unfortunately, there were some bits that I did not like so much. History tended to be clumsy and out of focus, but the Black Disney pot was suffering from the same problem. There were also some dark scenes that young children would find anxiety, but the ending is very moving. However, the biggest disadvantage were rather nondescript songs and the way they were singing. None of them stick out, except for "Let's Make Music Together" and "Love Survives", and Burt Reynolds can not sing, and Dom DeLuise sings much better. In summary, the movie that you can watch could be more, but it is definitely unforgettable and I will definitely watch it again. 7/10. Bethany Cox
