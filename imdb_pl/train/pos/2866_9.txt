I grew up in this classic western series and as a child I always thought that playing on late Sunday evenings is a pleasure for me. Bonanza is still infinitely re-watched in re-runs. <br /> <br /> The series tells the adventures of the Cartwright family who live on a ranch near Virginia City, Nevada during the Civil War. Their ranch (called Ponderosa) is led and defended by widowed father Ben and his unmarried three sons Adam, Hoss and Little Joe. These three brothers have different mothers, all of whom have departed years before. <br /> <br /> Cartwrights is a hard working, prosperous and honorable family, respected in these parts. Ponderosa is large, so its ends require a lot of horseback riding. In addition, trips are often necessary to buy or sell cattle and so on. Needless to say, a few of these trips pass by. Although hospitable, much of the Cartwrights energy must be spent on defending the ranches against intruders or protecting them from city dwellers envious of their prosperity and reputation. Cartwrights are doing enough to shoot weapons in the air and so on, but they only shoot to kill when they consider it absolutely necessary. They are involved in various urban affairs, even in political life in Nevada. <br /> <br /> One of the main strengths of the series is the basic warmth that is always present (despite sporadic disputes) between Ben and his three sons and (despite frequent misunderstandings) between the three brothers. Now one brother can beat someone from time to time, but generally he has a good reason, and his anger never lasts long! All characters are very well drawn. Ben is portrayed as a successful and noble man of great integrity. The eldest son, Adam, the most rational and courteous of the brothers, left the series. Middle brother, Hoss, is a gentle giant teddy bear who has an insatiable appetite for food and is a little shy among women. The youngest, Little Joe, is a handsome, handsome conjurer who, unlike women, is quite expensive. These three brothers enjoy different romances, but their love interests are usually killed at the end of the episode, otherwise the marriage will prove impossible for any reason. <br /> <br /> All actors are stars in their roles, including Pernell Roberts (Adam), Dan Blocker (Hoss), Michael Landon (Little Joe) and of course Lorne Greene as the principled patriarch of the family, Ben. I also love the ranch cook, Hop Sing, played by Victor Sen Yung. <br /> <br /> It's a great western full of great actions. Cartwrights are always noble heroes, and most of the bad guys are pretty wicked. If today there were more programs like this vintage western on TV!
