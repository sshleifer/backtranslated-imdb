Re: Pro Jury <br /> <br /> Although the main actress is disgustingly beautiful, the story has little chance of being accepted, because too many distracting details are encountered by the audience while developing the story. <br /> <br /> It can be assumed that high school girls from the middle class in the 1950s easily gave up their virginity without thinking about marriage to 30-year-olds, whom they barely know, but I doubt it. <br /> <br /> "EASY DELIVER AWAY VIRGINITY"? WHAT SHREWD ABOUT THIS FILM. REAL. <br /> <br /> You can think that young high school teenagers are very confident and confident when interacting with the elders in complex social situations, but my experience was more than awkward than teenagers you feel very uncomfortable and behave awkwardly when they experiment in the adult world. <br /> <br /> ONLY YOU CAN NOT SEE THE WORLD DIFFERENT THAN BY YOUR OWN EYES? IT'S SAD. <br /> <br /> You can think that an experienced doctor would not know the sharp smell of Stroptomycin - a smelly fermenting by-product of busy microorganisms on Earth - and did not detect that some dead, bland powder is false, but I do not think so. <br /> <br /> AND ANOTHER "EXPERT" OPINION FOUND FROM EXPERIENCE. DANDY. <br /> <br /> You can think that 30-year-old embarrassing people can go inside and spend time in a public school room during social activities at school and cause trouble, but I think that school escorts are a traditionally protected environment, and parents , chaparones and school staff would be nearby to prevent this. <br /> <br /> NOW WILL BE GOOD SPORTS AND TELL US WHERE YOU ARE A GREW UP INSTITUTION. One last penny, in all of Hey Babu Riba, five teenage friends described themselves as four. There is probably an explanation of why FIVE was FOUR, but because it was never detailed, each reference distracts attention from each scene. <br /> <br /> COURSE PROBABLY EXPLANATION. GOOD WORK LOOK LIKE TO GO! NOW I AM GENERAL AND HELP YOU WITH YOUR MAN: WAS IT AS TRANSLATED AS A GENERAL "FOUR WORLD", THE WORD "ƒçETVORKA" WERE ANOTHER MEANING: IT'S THE SPORT TIME USED TO DETERMINE 4M OR 4W SETTINGS - A NUMBER OF CREWS OF 5 PEOPLE: 4 BICYCLES AND COXSWAIN. <br /> <br /> This movie did not really call me. <br /> <br /> YOU MUST LISTEN TO YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AND OPINION. Dude.
