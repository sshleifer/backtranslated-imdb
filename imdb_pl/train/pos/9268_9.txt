At first glance, the film about women who want to see a football game would not be very appealing to someone who is not interested in football, for example me, but not about football, but about discrimination and women's enthusiasm for a sport that they love . <br /> <br /> The film begins on the day of the World Cup qualifying match between Iran and Bahrain, the girl tries to get to the Azadi stadium in Tehran dressing up like a boy, it looks like he will get until the soldier tries to search her. After being caught, she is taken to a small chamber outside the stadium, where there are a handful of women who have already been caught, here a small group of conscript soldiers, whose leader would prefer to return home, dealing with his livestock. We never learn the names of heroes, but we recognize them as people, when the girls beg the guards to let them look, even in the nearby slot in the wall, and when they refuse, try to at least give a comment. <br /> <br /> In addition to the important point about rigid sex segregation in today's Iran, the film contains many funny moments, such as the "disguise" that one of the girls is wearing when going to the toilet, and the girl who changed clothes for a soldier and she was caught just because she decided to watch the match from a place reserved for a senior officer. The girl's enthusiasm for the game is that in the end the viewer will probably be on the edge of his seat, hoping that Iran will win and thus go to the final in Germany. Soldiers are not represented as fundamentalists, they are simply conscriptists who are there because they must be, and when they explain to girls why a woman can not watch male sports, do not seem convinced by her own arguments. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that this movie can not be seen in Iran, but it's good that the wider world can see it and see that ordinary Iranians are not a group of desperate fanatics to fight the war in the west but normal people with the same passions and fears as people around the world. The cast did a great job, making their characters look like real people, not just caricatures.
