Fifteen years later and Paris Is Burning are still burning. It's a classic in black gay movies, and other gay black gay films, The Color Purple and Mahoganoy. This groundbreaking work reflects the underground and subclassic (i.e. "Undervalued") black and Latin culture and gay community like no other work before or since then, including all sentimental retrospectives and gay renderings of the Renemissance Harlem. I'm just talking about a "real" movie about it. This is Relentlessy Cunty (a classic invention of house music) coming to Hollywood, non-stop, happy camp (as we only do) and dead social critic All this by a white director (who apparently had to be Sister Gurl or Mizz Thing in a previous life). ) I could continue, but I think you understand: I love this movie!
