is the quintessential narcissus and manipulator; in this case portraying the lawyer (and murderer) of Tom Capano. <br /> <br /> Kathryn Morris is nice as a victim, Anne Marie Fahey, but at the beginning there is a bit too much sacrifice. We are sorry for this situation, but at the same time we are disgusted at seeing his victimization of several other women (including Rachel Ward). <br /> <br /> The sad part is that it actually helps her self-esteem problems, and Capano actually killed his psychologist. It is hard to believe, but it was based on a real story. <br /> <br /> There is an episode with Olympia Dukakis (excellent) as the mother of Capano. In summary, an interesting story because it is based on a real murder, and you will want to read Ann Rule's book to get accurate data. 8/10.
