What a funny movie St. Ives. It reminds me of the kind of film made in the 1940s. A classic story, complemented by characters and story, which is neither dramatic nor explicitly complicated. In fact, that's not all. The story of Robert Lewis Stevenson - here adapted to the screen - sounds like Jane Austen for men. We get a story that has an affair, but there is also a lot of fun: battle scenes (genre), escape from prison, wrong identities, fencing and the funniest line I have heard for years: "Only in Scotland could be announced by name on a masked ball . There is a lot of cheerfulness, difficulties, and not a bit of a profession when St. Ives tries to fight and find a way to the family and life he barely knew. <br /> <br /> The cast is absolutely amazing that he rarely saw Jean Marc Barr absolutely perfect in the title role. Anna Friel is a refreshing joy when resourceful Flora and Miranda Richardson almost leave the film as wise and global, she was there and she saw it all - Aunt Susan. Richard Grant provides comic relief at the highest level. <br /> <br /> It will not be the biggest movie that anyone has ever seen, but its charm is undeniable, and the whole movie is quite bristling with energy that springs with life.
