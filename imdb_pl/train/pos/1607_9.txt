As someone else has said, every scene in this movie is a jewel. Most movies are lucky to have one scene perfect, but director Jewison goes home every time. The cast gained the right approach to the perfect script, and in addition, the musical settings of Dick Hyman's opera and other music contributed to a perfect match. It is hard to imagine how they maintained the exact mood during the long production of the film. The comedy is subtle (mostly), and the work with the camera reflects every small emotional variation of the narrative. Cher is such a natural comedy, Vincent Gardenia (whom I know mainly thanks to the role of Frank Lorenzo in All in the Family, until I saw him in this and then off Broadway in the 80s) deserved much more fame than ever, and Aiello's wretched the loser is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to paying homage to this incredible cast. Did Jewison ever write about this film? <br /> <br /> I would like to read it. It is difficult to understand why the average rating here in IMDb is so low ...
