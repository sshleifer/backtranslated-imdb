This film is based on the art of Frank Frazetta, a mythical fantasy illustrator. Some characters come straight from his paintings (the Death Dealer is the best example). Surprisingly, the animation manages to retain a sense of original art. Bakshi is well known for intensive use of the rotoscope (live action tracking techniques) and this film is no exception. However, because the theme of the movie is quite realistic (all characters are human), it works quite well. <br /> <br /> But what I really like is the story: once we have a story with interesting characters and nice action sequences, a really hideous villain and a wonderful child. This film has the impression of the best comic Conan, which is not surprising, because Roy Thomas is the author of the Marvel series of our favorite Cymmerian! This is far from Conan's shit action, not to mention the entire B movie of this genre. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend it!
