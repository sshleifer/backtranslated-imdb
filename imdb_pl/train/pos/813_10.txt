After '' Empire strikes back '' 'Return of the Jedi' is my second favorite movie from the series Star Wars. <br /> <br /> Luke went to Tattoine to save Han Solo from Jabba. At the same time, the Galactic Milieu is secretive, creating a new space station like the previous Death Star. If this station is completely built, it will be the end of the Rebel Alliance. Both Vader and the Emperor are impatient because of the delay of the new Death Star and must kill many of their commanders so that the project will be carried out on schedule. <br /> <br /> R2 and C3po are in Jabba's palace, send a message from Luke to Jabba, where Lukes pretends to negotiate Han's life. It gives R2 and C3po as a gift for Jabba as part of his plan. Jabba does not accept negotiations because he uses Han Solo as part of the palace's decoration (Han is still frozen in the Carbonite) Lando is hidden, because Jabba's and Chewbacca's guard is also given to Jabba by the bounty hunter. When the same hunter tries to save Han's solo and makes him stay in human form, we see that it's actually Princess Leia in disguise. The problem is that Jabba discovers Leia's plan and takes her as his slave while Han is thrown into Chewbacca's cell. <br /> <br /> ≈Åukasz comes as a Jedi Knight to save his friends. During the first attempt to kill Jabba, he drops into Jabba's monster cell (Bantha), but easily kills her. Jabba remains furious and decides to throw Han, Chewbacca and Luke to Sarlacc, a great creature from the desert that has been digesting his "food" for 1000 years. Luke, Han and Chewie are again successful in scape, and even Bob Fett dies when Han accidentally throws him into Sarlacca's mouth. Leia kills Jabba and follows Han, Luke and Chewie, and c3po and R2. <br /> <br /> Everyone is safe again, Luke decides to go to Dagoba to finish the training as a Jedi, and also a promise to Yoda. The problem is that Yoda is too old and ill because she is 900 years old, and before she dies, Yoda tells Luke that he does not need more training, but to really be a Jedi, he must fight Vader again. He confirms to Luke that Vader is the father of Luke, and there is another Skywalker besides Luke. In her last moments, Yoda asks Luke to remember his advice about the temptation of the dark side, and Luke transmits his Jedi knowledge to other people. When Yoda dies, the spirit of Obi Wan appears to Luke and tells him that Luke's father killed his good side Anakin to become Darth Vader, and also that he is more machine gun than man since he was sith. Luke is worried about killing her own father and says he feels his father still has goodness. Obi Wan tells Luke that his twin sister is Leia and says why Luke and Leia were separated from the children. He tells Luke last advice, saying that if he refuses to kill Vader, the emperor will win the war. <br /> <br /> At the same time, the emperor tells Vader that he must give Luke when he appears, because Luke is stronger than before and they both need to combine their efforts to bring Luke to the dark side. <br /> <br /> Now we will have one of the best battles in the Star Wars series, when the Rebel Alliance plans to attack the new space station, "Death Star 2", Luke confronts Vader and the Emperor, and Leia, Han and Chewie must turn off the power field "Death Star 2", with the help of EWOKS. (small creatures that look like little bears) <br /> <br /> It is certainly one of the most exciting star wars!
