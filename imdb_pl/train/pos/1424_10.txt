Rather annoying that reviewers are still comparing this to Planet Earth ... From * course * Planet Earth is better - it has much more of the same. The Earth is like an extensive Planet Earth trailer and as such is inevitably worse and simpler. But it is not comparable with like. <br /> <br /> As a full-length documentary (actually a full-length movie) it surpasses almost everything you see in your entire life (unless you choose to travel the Earth with helicopters with long-range cameras for many years and wait for months in the most extreme environments to see the strangest creatures on earth, which - let's face it - is unlikely.> <br /> On the narrative: yes everyone in Britain - including me very much - loves David Attenborough and there is no excuse for him not to tell here, but it does not deserve a star or three, he was not a presenter on Planet Earth, just a narrator, and I'm sure he's modest and kind enough to realize that everything that attracts more viewers is a Good Thing . <br /> <br /> Anyone who sees this will be overwhelmed by his admiration, majesty and glory. All reviewers agree with this. they love him (ie Everyone) will / should see to buy Planet Earth. So three shouts for the movie premiere and a great boooo for anyone who is cheap enough to buy it on DVD, not for the Planet Earth set. But people do not compete here as works of art. <br /> <br /> The earth is big enough for both.
