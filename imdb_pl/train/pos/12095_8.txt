When American writer Edgar Allan Poe visits London, he is approached by a British journalist, Alan Foster, who becomes the target of a peculiar plant. Not believing Poe's claim that all his macabre stories are based on real experience, Foster accepts the Poe plant and his friend Sir Thomas Blackwood that he can not spend all night in the haunted Blackwood castle. After being installed in an abandoned castle, Foster discovers he is not alone to which various beautiful women and handsome men and a doctor of metaphysics approach - which explains that all are lost souls, damned, to reconstruct the stories of their deaths the anniversary of their death ! For the first time I watched this wonderful piece of classic horror, I was hypnotized all the time. I consider the film really frightening and sad at the same time. Steele's babes are undeniably beautiful. The musical result makes the atmosphere twice as stimulating. The topless scene threw me on the loop because I did not expect it. It seems that Synapse has done a great job with image enhancement because this movie looks damn good for its age and it's the Uncut International version to run. This is the film responsible for starting the Babs Steele and Klaus Kinski collection.
