Franco proves once again that he is the prince of surreal and erotic cinema. It is true that much of his work can be seen as a funny game, but thanks to Succubus (Necronomicon) he shows what he is really capable of, when he allows his distorted creativity to rebel and give us a movie that is both hypnotic and and enigmatic, while maintaining the delirium of eroticism inherent in his work. The wonderful result of Jerry Van Rooyen pulsates when the viewer is thrown from one weird scenario into another, when we follow the attempts of a strip artist (Reynaud) who can be a schizophrenic or maybe (as one mysterious figure says) be a devil, try to come to terms with the world who lives. A beautiful and enigmatic piece of cinema recommended to everyone who is even interested in an alternative cinema.
