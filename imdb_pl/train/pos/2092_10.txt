I watched the movie with curiosity. I wanted to see if 1) Paul Muni can play in Chinese and 2) Luise Rainer deserved her Oscar. I left thinking about the film YES! Seeing Muni in only one movie, in which he was quite noisy, I expected the same type of performance. Fortunately, it turned out that I was wrong. Although some may criticize him for being too childlike and stereotypically simple in the Hollywood idea of ​​Asians, I thought he was right. Keye Luke, if he had a chance to play the main role, he could play it in the same way. <br /> <br /> I was particularly impressed by the camera and the use of the crowd scenes, especially during the release of the palace, where O-Lan was once a slave. The graphics and bleak atmosphere of the firing squad and drought made it an epic that was unlike any other at the same time, in which everything was shiny and shiny. I watched this movie from the beginning to the end fascinated. I can not say the same for today's "epics".
