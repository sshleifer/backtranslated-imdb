ME! Television is a great channel, and Talk Soup is so funny that you can see the episode changes in the blink of an eye. We want more fun writings from the best writer, Stan Evans. Patron of mindless masses ... He is a really talented, talented writer, actor, comic, producer, director and creative consultant. but he was not a billionaire, so he left him for the billionaire. Many super stars wanted to make movies with actor Stan Evans, who has the acting style "Humphrey Bogart" {Clark Gable}. He should do a lot more movies. Maybe with Stephen Spielberg, maybe with many talented producers. We wish FAME a moment of great happiness. Did he produce some mocking U-dramas? or maybe any docudrama ?? A project about Bern Madhoff would be a great TV movie written by STAN EVANS. How many scenarios did he write? Is it for $$$$$$$$$$$$$ billion with Disney? He should make over 50 million dollars ... He could also write a TV movie about late KING OF POP ... Michael Jackson. We want to watch a lot more and through Stan Evans in movies and on television. Thank you very much. Elvis left the building !!!!!
