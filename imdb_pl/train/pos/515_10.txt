I remember seeing this movie for the first time - I worked in the office over the weekend, and the television was on because the background noise. But gradually I became more and more involved in this movie that I never saw or heard before I was completely absorbed. A Matter of Life & Death (British title - Stairway to Heaven in the US) is delightful, fascinating, capricious and moving, in one well-written, well-organized, well-directed package. This is a classic that really ranks there, in Casablanca, It's a Wonderful Life, Gone With the Wind, Citizen Kane and Chariots of Fire. WHY has never received the same information and video store publicity? Fortunately, experienced SOME critics have put him on the list of "100 best in history". There is hope - Fantasia from 1940 was not a hit until the 1960s, and the wizard from Kraina Oz was a dud at the box office, but he went on television. Buy - rent - look - request! You will not be dissapointed!
