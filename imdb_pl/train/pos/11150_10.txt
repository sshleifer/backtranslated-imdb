I sat down to watch the Midnight Cowboy, thinking it would be another movie with overrated music of the 1960s and 1970s. Some of my favorite movies come from the 1970s, like "Midnight Cowboy" ("Taxi Driver", "Mean Streets", "Panic in Needle Park" etc.), but there are many, many overrated well that have gained a strong reputation among critics for being a breakthrough - unfortunately the vast majority of them can not stand it today. I feel so in "Easy Rider". (Although this is also one of my favorites.) <br /> <br /> So I did not expect much from "Midnight Cowboy", but I came back a lot. It is a moving story, well done and well told with the best performances of all time. Dustin Hoffman, as Enrico "Ratso" Rizzo, gives some of the best - sometimes it's a bit funny (when he says - sounds like a cartoon character - maybe because of Lenny / "Simpson" connection), but Hoffman is completely convincing. Half the budget of the film went towards its payoff, because it just became the main star in Hollywood. Opposite him, Jon Jonight appears as Joe Buck, the "cowboy" who travels north to the Big Apple in the hope of becoming a male prostitute. Soon, his naive ways get him into trouble, and he parries in with a crippled artist called "Ratso" - who proposes to become Joe's "manager" for a certain percentage of profits. <br /> <br /> The movie is quite long after two hours, but never really seems very long. Some movies may have a tendency to drag, especially some movies that were made in the '70s, because (as said in "Easy Riders, Raging Bulls") directors were movie stars in the' 70s and sometimes got a little enchanted by their material, too long badajÄ…cy postacie / stages / etc. is not important. The only scene that seemed too long and unnecessary was a drug party - it makes the movie very outdated (like Odysseys in "Easy Rider") and really harms its flow because it is not needed. <Br /> <br /> In addition, "Midnight Cowboy" is almost a flawless movie. I was pleasantly surprised. It has its flaws (eg Flashbacks are a bit tacky and never used as well as they could be), and some of the scenes are a bit non-specific (such as a gay cinema sequence), but if you can deal with their content, "Midnight Cowboy" it's a really great movie, an uncompromising study of street life in the late 1960s and early 1970s. This depressing movie, yes, and according to today's standards may seem a bit outdated and heavy in the liberal perspective "life is terrible, etc." ... but I still love him, and especially the extremely touching ending will remain with me a long, long time. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it. One of the best films of the 70s. (It was released technically at the end of 1969, but I would still classify it as a movie from the 1970s. It also won an Oscar for the best film, being the first and only film in this ranking with the grade X). R in appeal.) <br /> <br /> 4.5 / 5
