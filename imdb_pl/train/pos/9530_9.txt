Conrad Hall came out with a bang. A great movie photographer ended his excellent career with this film before he gave it. He was proud that this is one of the best-looking crime movies you'll ever see. <br /> <br /> Of course, acting is not bad when Tom Hanks and Paul Newman play the lead! The number of activities here is also correct: not too much; not enough. <br /> <br /> None of the characters here, to be honest, are "good guys" because Hanks is a professional hitman for the Newman city boss. Hank's only salvific feature is not to let his son end up with a killer like him, although he teaches him how to be a runaway in robberies! Huh? <br /> <br /> Just as the game is as interesting as history, the real star of this movie is the operator Hall, who uses a lens to paint the scene on a beautiful stage. His work is simply amazing.
