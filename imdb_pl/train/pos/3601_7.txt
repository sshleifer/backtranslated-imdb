Michelle Rodriguez is a decisive actress who can be a force that other actresses draw attention to. She has the courage to play very early in the rare role of a tough girl (and dismiss it), which should be considered a feat. Although her later films include her in the same role, this movie was made with a view to her rawness. <br /> <br /> Her character is a romantic student / fighter / lover, struggling to overcome a disappointed existence in projects that is a bit exaggerated in the film ... but not by a girl. This aspect of the film is not very original, but the story goes deeply when the hot relations with which this girl is dealing begin to cook, and her original rage takes control. <br /> <br /> I haven 'I saw an actress who adopted such an aggressive attitude in making movies, and I'm glad she got the original phrase in Hollywood. This film received 7 for me because of the average history of youth from the ghetto, but she has such a wonderful actress who presents a rare role in a minimal budget. Well done.
