I saw this movie once as a kid on a late-late show and fell in love with it. <br /> <br /> It's been over 30 years, but recently I found it on DVD - it was not cheap, or - in a catalog specializing in war movies. We saw it for the first time last night. The sound was good, but it was grainy and had trailers between the drums. Even so, it was better than I remembered. I was also impressed with how real it was for the game. <br /> <br /> The catalog is somewhere here. If you're honest in finding, send me a message and I'll see if I can get the information. cartwrightbride@yahoo.com
