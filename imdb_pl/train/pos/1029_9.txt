I would rate the perfect 10 series for exceptional and consistently high quality of story and character development, if not for the last episode of Season 10! <br /> <br /> The last episode of the tenth season of "Unending", where (it would surely seem) that Asgard was killed in a very hurried, unconvincing and very unceremonious manner, left me in disbelief! <br /> <br /> From the unusually fast end of the series, it is obvious that many feature arcs were originally planned for at least one season. I suppose they quickly accelerated these stories to set up the Stargate SG-1 franchise for two upcoming moves directly to the DVD! <br /> <br /> Unless Asgard returns in the next movie SG-1 (with a very good explanation for "seeming" extinction), I think that the fans have been deceived by the weak cleansing of the loose ends! <br /> <br /> Weak end of a brilliant science fiction series.
