This is a culinary competition, Americanized. This will not be a Japanese version. <br /> <br /> The concert is great. I did not care about cooking, but this show is simply entertaining to watch ... From the intensity of chefs put into the dishes by the stupid chairman. A really good way to spend time watching television. <br /> <br /> One would criticize the program for the fact that guests like Marc Ecko appeared as a judge ... But ... Meh. It's fun enough to watch and generally the winner deserves a prize. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, and I'm pissed John Besh is not the new Iron Chef ... <br /> <br /> Ala's Kitchen!
