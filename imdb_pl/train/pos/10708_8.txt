John (Ben Chaplin) is a lone bank clerk who lives in a small town near London. Although the Internet, he contacts the Russian agency of brides. He chooses Sophia (Nicole Kidman? A guy can be lonely and shy, but he certainly has good taste, right?) And when they meet, he realizes he does not speak English. Communication between yourself is basically limited by sex (again imagine what a terrible situation for a guy, just a bit of perverse sex with Nicole Kidman!). On her birthday, two Russian friends visit her. Then there will be many surprises. I liked the film: first, it is almost impossible to "mark". Is it a black comedy, action, sensational film? I believe all choices are correct. Nicole Kidman is as always great and I am very curious about her Russian: does he really speak Russian in correct accent or is he just pretending? In any case, I think it's a nice movie. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Isca Perfeita" ("The Perfect Bait")
