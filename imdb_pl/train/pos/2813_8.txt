It is a complex document that shows many things about early gay life. Putting it in retrospect, Gay was the word used for the homo-sexual revolution, not just Gay as a descriptor. Is it also used in this way today? I believe that most of the movie dates from around 1968 to 1989. It was released in 1993, so it was around. <br /> <br /> I was moved by documentary films about the love of one man to another over 20 strange years. Love expressed in a way that can only be true love. There are many scenes of incredible empathy and pain, as well as scenes of joy and pleasure. There are scenes from life as homosexual and life as gays. The film itself was a work of love and I believe it is a diamond. <br /> <br /> In this video, at least one will come out of understanding the destructive impact of AIDS. Writing this, I think about it, if earlier this movie seems to me to be set. Advances in medicine, politics and social sciences and culture that have taken place since the film was established (about 15 years ago) are amazing. However, of course, in the case of the AIDS disease itself, we are not yet finished. Heck I think we are not finished on all fronts. <br /> <br /> In any case, it's just a nice document. I encourage anyone who thinks they do not understand the life of homosexuals, gays or the AIDS devastation to watch this movie.
