I've seen Slaughter High several times over the years and I've always thought it was a nice cut with a weird sense of humor, but I never knew it was filmed in Britain and I never knew an actor who plays Marty Rantzen (Simon Scuddamore ) committed suicide after the film's premiere. It seems to me that I noticed this when I saw yesterday in the evening that phrasing of actors seems quite strange for Americans, and some of them are not very good at hiding their English accents. <br /> <br /> It's all aside. it's a stupid class story, Marta, who is a buttock of jokes from her classmates, and on one particular day, April Fool's Day, lured him to the girl's locker room by one Caroline Munro (yes, playing a teenager) and a humiliated big time on film. Of course, the trainer catches the gang at work and everyone has an energetic workout to punish them, but not sooner than a few men slip on Marty who is trying to smoke in a chemistry lab, but he's full of something that makes him sick and as he runs into the toilet, one of his classmates slips in and puts on a chemical that reacts with something that Marty mixes, causing a fire and a bottle of nitric acid leak that leaves poor Marty burnt and horribly crippled. <br /> <br /> Ten years later the same gang goes to a class meeting in an old good Doddsville High, which seems strangely killed and inaccessible, but thanks to ingenuity they manage to enter and find a seemingly abandoned place ... except that there is a room where banquet and alcohol are spread, so of course they eat, drink and be cheerful. Soon they will die, of course. <br /> <br /> The gang is persecuted one by one by the character in the jester's mask, but can it be Marty? They do not know they think they're in a strange container or are working at IBM, they are not sure which one. But whoever it is, it does it quickly. A girl is especially ugly who bathes to wash her blood from one of her classmates whose guts sprang up on her when she drank poisoned beer. She is the victim of a sour bath, which I think may have been one of the parts originally cut out in the tape version, because this time it seemed very nasty to me. I could be wrong, but I believe that it was not on tape. <br /> <br /> In any case, there is a little twisting ending, and it also contains footage not on the tape. There is also some frontal nudity, which was also removed earlier, but otherwise I did not notice if there were other bits in this extraordinary version, probably yes, but it's been some time since I last saw it. br /> <br /> In any case, if you're a fan of kitsch movies from the 80s, upload a DVD with a new release, because it is a fun little slasher with a good atmosphere and sense. 7 out of 10.
