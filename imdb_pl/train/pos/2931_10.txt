Eddie Murphy Delirious is undoubtedly the funniest thing I've ever seen in my life. When I saw it for the first time about two years ago, I was seamred for several weeks. So far I have seen it 17 times and each time I laugh with my ass. For those who do not know, Eddie Murphy was a great comedian before he became a Hollywood star. In this piece of genius, there is not a single boring place, unlike Eddie Murphy Rawa, which was released in 1987, Which is flat in the middle. If you are not a person who can not tolerate swearing, I would not advise you to see it, because you will probably hear some form of curse every 5-10 seconds. I gave it 10 out of 10 because it shows the best comic genius of them all at its best.
