The cat and mouse take part in the usual pursuits when Jerry dives in a bottle of invisible ink and discovers that it disappears. Instead of taking the opportunity to spy on a mouse changing room or something, he uses his newly-discovered invisibility to torment Tom. And it is quite funny and quite ingenious, although it is a bit of a joke. And the action never leaves the interior of the house, which is usually a feature of shorter T & J pants. Still worth 7/10. <br /> <br /> However, I am not sure how an invisible mouse can cast a shadow on the wall, it defies physics and the very nature of being invisible.
