I heard about Eddie Izzard, but I never saw him in action. I knew he was a transvestite, and when I saw that one evening he was in HBO, I set up this, not knowing how my husband would react. Well, he smashed us. It's better than ever Robin Williams. He has total control over the audience; when he does, "Englebert is dead - no, it is not", routine, the audience does not know what to think until the end. God as James Mason is also an inspired touch, and his version of Python Spanish Inquisition conducted by the Church of England - "Cake or Death"? it is priceless. At the end of the show my jaw ached with laughter. We searched the television charts for many months to be able to see it again and we were lucky to have recorded it the next time. If you have the chance to see this program, cancel everything and record the tape, you will not be disappointed.
