Imagination is a terrible thing to waste ... especially when you have talented actors. Writer / director Jones does not waste time in supporting the viewer with his hero. <br /> <br /> Anyone who shared a flat with a slob will be crying with laughter. Anyone who has arrived when a maid puts a ticket on the windshield will cry. We all wanted to rip a terrible wig off the man's head. These are only fragments of what is available while watching "Cross Eyed", a movie flowing from the depth of my heart, which should be a step forward for Jones and his ironic sense of humor, both at the front and back of the camera.
