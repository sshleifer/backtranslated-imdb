This is one of the best Indian films I've seen lately, instead of nonsense movies about songs and dance or slums. All actors showed the right emotions at the right intensity and the right time. This is a feature of a good movie that makes the viewer come back and examine the subject of what exactly I checked on Harilalu. I always enjoy the subtle style of Akshay Khanna and, interestingly, have a rather complicated relationship with my father Vinod Khann, though not as dramatic as Gandhis, and he wondered how it helped him deal with this character. I was impressed by the direction and two thumbs behind Anil Kapoor for producing such a classic film.
