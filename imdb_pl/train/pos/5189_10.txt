Another masterpiece of Woo! <br /> <br /> This is the best wuxie movie I've ever seen! Woo - RULEZ forever (except for some Hollywood moments ...). John Woo - bigger director of the century. <br /> <br /> Maybe hi is not more intellectual than many Big Directors ... But he is a lyrical and spiritual idol of all freethinkers! <br /> <br /> His films like great poetry! Woo is a movie sheakspeare! Woo is a Biron movie! Woo is Mozart Bloodshet !!!! <br /> <br /> IMHO violent in Woo movies is not the desire of directors, but an instrument of art. The themes of Woo movies are more humanistic than new films.
