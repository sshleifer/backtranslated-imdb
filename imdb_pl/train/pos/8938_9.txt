A great movie version of the best-selling book and popular Broadway about the life of Sadie and Bessie Delana, two African-American sisters who lived over 100 years and told their story of witnesses to a century of American history. Ruby Dee and Diahann Carroll give very good results respectively as Bessie and Sadie. Amy Madigan is also good as Amy Hill Hearth, a white reporter for the New York Times, whose article on sisters published a book, etc. Many flashbacks and even many contemporary scenes are very powerful, if not quite inspirational, like in the book. This is the only true drawback, combined with the fact that certain aspects of the story are not clearly represented, such as the interracial origin of the mothers of the sisters and why their father was so severe. But otherwise a very well made, well-made, powerful movie.
