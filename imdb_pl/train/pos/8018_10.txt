In this movie, Muppet, Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie, Gonzo, Rowlf, Scooter, Camillia, Dr. Teeth, Floyd, Animal, Janice and Zoot are college graduates who decide to bring their successful Manhattan Melodies college musical on Broadway. Unfortunately, no producer will even meet with Muppets. After being refused by too many producers, Scooter suggests that the Muppets decide to go on their own. However, Kermit still believes he can get his Broadway show, but after he finally does it and let everyone know he sold the program, Kermit's amnesia and others do not know where he is. <br /> <br /> Contains a lot of great scenes, including the sequence of live action that introduced Muppet Babies, the wedding sequence filled with Muppetami, including the cast of Sesame Street and Traveling Matt (from Fraggle Rock), Scooter as a movie and stage, where Rizzo and other rats cook breakfast. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that there were no more characters left. Of course, many of them appear at the wedding, but Bunsen, Beaker, Beauregard and Sweetum should have some significant roles, and Lips should have participated in The Electric Mayhem in this film, as in the previous season Muppet Show and The Great Muppet Caper, and Miss Piggys dog Foo Foo should also be with her (after all, Rizzo The Rat, also performed by Steve Whitmire, had a significant part in this film and was not well known at that time).
