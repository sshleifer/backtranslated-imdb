I wanted to see Sarah Buffy on the big screen, so I bought the tickets first and then I checked the reviews on IMDb. I was worried that I would see a bad movie. I had a good time watching the movie. Some of the parts, which of course were to be frightening, were actually quite humorous, almost like in Buffy the Vampire Slayer. <br /> <br /> I do not think it's a bad movie. This is also not a great movie. Just a well-made horror movie. It is not based mainly on special effects, but on camera angles, acting and music. In my opinion, acting was OK. Sarah did a very good job, quite convincing. The other actors were not bad either, I liked Yoko. <br /> <br /> The sets are pretty (and I do not care that the sets are exactly the same as those used in the Japanese original). br /> <br /> Terrifying moments were often predictable. But not always. I saw some horror and did not expect me to be afraid now, but it happened at least twice. Nice. <br /> <br /> There were a few pretty scenes in the movie that were almost original, like traces of rubbish, simple special effects for him ghosts, eyes of a boy, a cat who made strange noises, gurgling about a dead boy and his mother. <br /> <br /> Do not go, if you want to see Sara in another episode of Buffy, because she's very much different to her Buffy work, much more serious. Do not go if you just want to watch movies that collect Oscar nominations. It's a good horror, uncertain enough. I gave him 7.
