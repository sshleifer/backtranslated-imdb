I saw this movie when it first appeared. It was the official choice for the Temecula Valley International Film Festival and I voted for him for the best picture. <br /> <br /> Justine Priestley is as hot as a psychotic but complicated Amanda. This is not your usual psycho movie. A lot of interesting and original slants for this species. A kind of "Fatal Attraction" for a younger band with great blues music mixed with the object of feeling Amanda, who is married to an upcoming blues singer who has less time for her husband when her career begins. <br />
