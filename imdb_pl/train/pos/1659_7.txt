A fragment from the life of one of the first painters who achieved historical fame, "Artemisia" tells the true story of the young Italian's passionate desire for artistic expression and the vicissitudes she encounters. The film contains sumptuous costumes and sets as well as a good cast and acting. However, it is confused in an attempt to portray the esoteric art and time and is not inspired by the artist's passion for being painted on canvas and explored by her involvement with men. A good movie for those interested in Renaissance painting or period films.
