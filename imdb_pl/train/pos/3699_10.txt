"Who Loves The Sun" breaks through a certain subject matter with sufficient wit and grace to make the story not only addictive, but often fun. It's been some time since I found such a touching, totally enjoyable movie. <br /> <br /> The film is magnificent, it attracts attention with beautiful landscapes and peaceful landscapes. Peaceful images contrast greatly with the tension between very human, very defective, and at the same time very nice characters. Due to the excellent cast, the five major players are wonderfully interesting and dynamic. <br /> <br /> I recommend "Who Loves The Sun." This is a really funny movie that takes a gripping look at the wounds we can inflict, and an extremely difficult but equally satisfying process of forgiveness.
