Peter Ustinov plays the offender who is just leaving the prison after the film starts. As soon as he leaves the gate, he immediately begins working on the plan to re-package, stealing, although this time he has quite high views. This is actually one of the weak points of the movie, because apparently he knows nothing about computers (not many of them returned in 1968), But from day to day he becomes a computer genius! Yes, sure. In any case, he invents a program impersonating a computer expert and gaining a job in a large American corporation, so that he could eventually be tossed away with cash. Given that his knowledge of computers is primitive, it is amazing how he implements the genius plan and manages to penetrate into the computer system and its defense. But this is a movie, so I could suspend disbelief. At the end of the movie, he and his new wife (Maggie Smith) are able to escape a million pounds. <br /> <br /> At the very end it gets very, very confusing, and Smith announces she managed to accumulate more than two million thanks to clever investments in the company that Ustinov started (though she did not realize that they are all artificial companies) . This should mean that, ultimately, the supplies she bought were worthless. It seems that they imply (and I can guess that it is bad here) that Ustinov and his new partners quickly invested in stocks before it became known, and thus the stocks would then become worthless. Anyway, the film seems to be a magical ending where nobody is hurt and everyone is happy - and that did not make much sense. It's a pity, because acting and most of writing were great. Karl Malden, Bob Newhart, Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith were just great. <br /> <br /> If it seems to me that I have interpreted the end, let me know because the movie at the end seemed very vague.
