This is the best and most original program for years. The more I watch him, the more I fall in love with him. The cast is great, writing is great. Personally, I like every character. However, there is a favorite character for everyone, because there is a good mix of personalities and environments, just like in real life. I believe that ABC has harmed the writers, actors and potential recipients of this series to cancel so quickly and not to advertise it enough, nor give it a real chance to gain more. There are so few programs that I watch, because most TVs are terrible. This program in my opinion was just there with my favorite Grays Anatomy and Brothers and Sisters. In fact, I think that the same audience for brothers and sisters will love this performance if they even know it. Why always lost shows have so much extra time, and winning shows with great potential are always abandoned immediately. I'm fed up with reality shows, I do not watch any of them. It was very refreshing, to have a new idea for the concert, and then to hire great actors, this series had so much promise. The last episode was the best because everyone really started to get into their parts and make the performance so real. Please watch this program on ABC video and notify ABC that you want to have this program back. PLEASE PLEASE SAVE PETIT ONLINE TO ABC: http://www.PetitionOnline.com/gh1215/petition.html
