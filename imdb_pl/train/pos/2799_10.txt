As an opponent of football, I (on the surface) were reluctant to take my younger brother to watch this movie, although I secretly hoped that it was East East II. The trailers looked good, so I thought I could do it. <br /> <br /> It took about ten minutes, but then I glued myself to the screen, and it had nothing to do with neck contraction caused by sitting too close to the front because of the room full. Acting was fresh and lively, heroes immersive, and jokes really fun. The whole audience laughed loudly every minute. A football fan or not a football fan, sport has become irrelevant to the main principles of love, friendship, family, independence and competition. Add a bit of Sikh culture and you have a pattern for the best British comedy I've seen for a long time, dare I say ... better than East to East. <br /> <br /> This movie poses nicely at a beautiful pace, never taking longer than necessary, or leaving anything unfinished, keeping the viewer entertained and involved mentally. Although it is not a characteristic film turning and turning, there are some pleasant surprises on the road and it is not always what you would expect. <br /> <br /> Saying that, there were elements of predictability, but they were used satirically more than used as a script filler. I suppose that depending on your particular tendency for happy endings, you can either be delighted / disappointed by the ending. Personally, if there was any other result, I would write a heavily written letter to screenwriters. <br /> <br /> As for the actors, I would have to say that Juliet Stevenson (Paula) presented herself best. I never knew that such people exist, but its realism with sometimes bizarre concepts convinced me that they can do it! The award for the most unconvincing (main characters) unfortunately goes to Kiery Knightley (Jules), but do not get me wrong, even she offered a great performance, just someone must be the last of the best and sorry Kiera, this time you are. <br /> <br /> Tip: do not leave before the subtitles. When the lights came back, I realized with horror that maybe I should not have watched the movie. My beloved but forgotten Ice Junkie melted into sweet blue juice. Oh, what am I saying, it was absolutely great and I can not recommend it. I will definitely buy it when it comes out and add it to my collection of 3 movies. I'm a student. I only splash when it's really worth it.
