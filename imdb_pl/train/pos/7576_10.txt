The third and final edition of "Hanzo the Razor" is the most concrete one of them all. "Training" ends even in the first five minutes of the movie. Not for everyone, this film presents the details of Hanzo's investigation into the loan sharks conducted by the order of blind monks. It is also a historical commentary on the proud refusal of old Japan to incorporate Western technology. Where the first Hanzo movie was just a fun and bloody ride with little connection to its story, "Hanzo 3: Who's Got the Gold" manages to combine everything and brings him home. Definitely the perfect finale. Oh yes, Hanzo still has a lot of sex and there is a lot of unnecessary blood and violence (in the end * it * Hanzo the Razor).
