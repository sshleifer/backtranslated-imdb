This spectacular film is one of the most amazing movies I've ever seen. It shows China that I have never seen or imagined, and I believe it shows China in the 1930s in the most REAL light that the film has ever seen. This is absolutely groundbreaking in so many situations, seeing how hard the lives of the heroes were, and yet the story and ending are extremely joyful. In this movie you really see the depth and height of human existence. Actors are perfect so that you feel that you have really entered a different world. <br /> <br /> I just can not recommend this movie enough. It can just change you forever when you see it.
