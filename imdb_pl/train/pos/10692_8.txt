Good, fun, simple story, excellent Nicole Kidman (I almost always like the movies in which she is located). It was a good "vehicle" for someone skilled in comedy and drama, because there are elements of both. Romantic comedy wrapped around two crime novels, great closing lines. Chaplin, very good here, was also good at another good but unpopular romantic comedy ("Truth about Cats & Dogs"). Maybe they are too unlikely. Ebert has not even published reviews. Great "screw" comedies were, of course, totally unlikely ("Bringing up Baby" etc.). If you've seen one unbelievable comedy, have you seen them all? Or maybe people are ready to go from the 1930s. Weird. Birthday Girl is a movie that I enjoyed a few times. Nicole Kidman can be a "deadly app" for home video.
