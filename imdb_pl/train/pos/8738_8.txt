A Bugs Life is a great movie not only for children, but also for adults. The story takes place around ants colony and their fight with evil grasshoppers who come back every year and steal their food (A Mirror of Magnifiscent seven). There is a great computer animation there, and the voices are great too. You will like it !! 8 out of 10
