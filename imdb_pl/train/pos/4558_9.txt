MY LEFT FOOT, in my opinion, is a great biography about one of the most talented authors and painters in the world. The performances were great, the soundtrack was great and the casting was perfect. I thought Christy (Daniel Day-Lewis) was a very talented man, although I could not understand what he was saying most of the time. Also, when he threw his anger, I was a bit scared. Besides, he is so sad that he suffered from cerebral palsy. In conclusion, if you are a die-hard fan of Daniel Day-Lewis or biopick, I highly recommend this great biography about one of the most talented authors and painters in the world. A real feast and a good time await you, so do not miss it.
