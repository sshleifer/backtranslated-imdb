The Good Thing about this film: the concept is interesting and there are some funny scenes. It also makes you think about these little things in life that can have a huge impact on someone else's life without your knowledge. It's a small world, and this little movie shows us. <br /> <br /> The Bad Thing: There are too many characters and it's hard to say who the main character is, but he is still a great movie. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie and many people compare it to Magnolia, which I have not seen. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br /> Not rated --- I would rate PG-13 for short violence, some linguistic and sexual situations.
