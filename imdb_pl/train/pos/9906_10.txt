YES, the story is unreliable and very thin. YES, acting varies from medium to funny. YES, it has been done many times. However, we are dealing with a film that does not avoid these facts and pretends to be nothing more than it is. In fact, there are several original scenes of death, and the tension increases throughout the movie. Also, you're never more than a few minutes from bloody killing. I invite everyone to watch this film with an unbiased eye and see what was supposed to be; a frightening, funny slasher flick with a melody motif that is unmatched.
