As in the case of this film, we follow the unlikely, though always addictive, adventures of the two main heroes. But while C + J avoids sex in a girl's journey back to childhood, this couple relishes their corporality even to the point of discovering homoeroticism. Most of the sex that they get from their unwilling or unwilling partners, and yet it behaves deeply without a computer, everyone smiles. Like C + G, they remain innocent in their hearts, they rebel against foreigners, the bourgeoisie, and restrictions. As someone else commented, I would not like to know these two and it is a small miracle that their journey brings scenes mostly comedic and very little tragedy (and what can not be arranged at their door), and therefore the reason that left me but with a sweet taste in your mouth. I dare say that only the French can escape from such films. And that's part of their genius.
