I saw it recently on the cable channel. The film is great; it's one of the few musicals I've seen that do not shun light and dark. It presents some of the splendor of the era with a lot of misery. Some dance sequences with scenes are so much going on, I did not know where to look. One day I will go and see it on the big screen to see what's going on. But what really raises this level is Oliver Reed's performance as Bill Sykes. Not only is he a mean and dangerous man, but there is something else, some internal demons. It gave me the impression that if you pushed him into the corner, he was capable of everything. It was as if Sykes were on the edge of madness, just waiting for the trigger. I saw Bill Sykes Robert Newton from the movie from 1948 and I thought he was "just" a bad egg, but Oliver Reed's performance intimidated me in his own living room.
