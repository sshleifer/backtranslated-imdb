Great British movie Indy! Fantastic chemistry between the three main characters makes Cheech and Chong funny. It's great to see Phil Daniels on the big screen (even if he turned pages from Quadrophenii!), And Gary Stretch is surprisingly good and good for ladies! I loved the final scene of battling in the direction of Zulu, and now I know what happened to Arthur Brown after he set himself on fire for the Top of the Pops! !!! You do not have to be a biker to enjoy it, and it's straight from my Friday post-pub repeat viewing. <br /> <br /> Give this movie and you will not be disappointed.
