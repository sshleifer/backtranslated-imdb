I really liked this movie. (That's why it surprised me that it received such a low rating from so many users on this site!). I'm not saying it was a cinematic masterpiece, but it was a great way to spend a cold, snowy Saturday night. It's funny, poignant and wonderful stories about the ups and downs of the friendship of women that last in difficult times and about bad things that friends do to each other! (provoke the ladies, ALL WERE THERE!) Bill Paterson shines when Reverand Gerald Marsden and Andie McDowell prove she can be a great actress when the role is right and she focuses on it. (And indeed, there is the best "wedding escape" I've ever seen or dreamed about in this movie ... more courage than anyone I ever knew!) You will laugh and you will cry - ignore all marketing campaigns and how this movie is marketing .... it's a hidden gem that TONNES should have done at the box office. (now I have to look around to buy a copy!)
