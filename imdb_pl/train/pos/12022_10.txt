As a great fan of the original, I avoided the movie like plagues, when bad reviews began to appear eight years ago, but I just finished watching this movie and found it really a nice surprise. <br /> <br /> Okay, if you're looking to retouch the original, you're in for a big disappointment, but if you're looking for something completely different, a bit nervous and political, this is a movie for you. <br /> <br /> Gregory is now thirty-four years old and works as a teacher in her old primary school, where she is being hunted by a fellow teacher and having sexual dreams about one of her pupils. When a student insists on meeting Gregory, there is a series of misfortunes that include torture, breaking and entering, and all kinds of unexpected twists and turns that make me feel raised and moved. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for something original I highly recommend this movie. I'd just like more people to go and see when it's released and see what it really is.
