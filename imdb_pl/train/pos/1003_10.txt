Another masterpiece in Aussie, he delves into the world of the unknown and the supernatural, and he does it very well. He does not resort to great special effects, such as American films, he focuses more on emotional impact. A relatively simple conspiracy that Rebecca Gibney & Co. brings to life. It tells the story of a couple who is buying an old house that allegedly was a home for a very old woman who never went outside and whose husband disappeared mysteriously a hundred years ago. Strange things begin to happen at home, and Jan Adam begins to turn into a man who disappeared, who was actually a mass murderer. Highly recommended. 8/10
