The passing stones definitely belong to the best independent comedy films in history. You must have a sense of humor to fully enjoy this. This movie, for some reason, has not received the loan due. First of all, let's start with a story that everyone loves to search for treasures. When a dead father leaves letters for advising a hidden treasure, he not only joins two families, but begins the adventure with vortices. Mix in a Polish translator, a sleeping mother, a broken head with a team of turrets, a twisted homosexual hypnotist and one drag queen, the money not only makes the world go round, but can change the family into enemies. My favorite character in this movie would have to be a sister / addicted to crack with a turret syndrome, and her sudden outburst will make you cry and imitate for weeks.
