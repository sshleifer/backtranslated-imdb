I loved Sabrina The Teenage Witch and saw every episode. I remember sitting at 18:00 every night and waiting for it to come in Nickelodeon, but when Sabrina left the high school, the performance began to fall. The best series must take place when she made friends with Valerie (I'm not sure which one is). From there, the next series (friends from Dreama) was still really good, but when it left secondary school, it did not seem right. It seemed that all the main characters left, which meant that there is not so much old "spark", but the first series in which Sabrina is in college is still relatively good and possible to watch, but when her aunt leaves and Sabrina is moves to their house is wrong. She is no longer a teenager, so the name of the series is not correct and without Hilda, Zelda and Josh√≥w the performance does not seem right, especially when Sabrina almost marries someone who is not Harvey. Thank God he went through the last five minutes of the last episode to take her. In total, I still love watching old episodes of Sabrina - a teenage witch, but I think the writers have gone too far and should leave her with Sabrina after graduating from high school. Because after this show definitely lost some magic
