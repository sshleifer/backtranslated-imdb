Rated E <br /> <br /> I never owned Nintendo 64, but I played many times. In my opinion, along with Conkers Bad Fur Day, Super Mario 64 is one of the best video games for the Nintendo 64 system. I have played this game many times and every time well. If you have N64 and you do not have this game, you should find it. The original Super Mario Bros games were side scrolling video games, but Super Mario 64 has 3D Mario in a nice 3D environment. The game is quite strange, but there are many things you can do in the game. You play as Super Mario and once again you have to save the Princess and 120 power stars from Bowzer. he can do it in a 3D environment. Super Mario 64 is a very cool and good N64 game and I recommend it. <br /> <br /> 10/10
