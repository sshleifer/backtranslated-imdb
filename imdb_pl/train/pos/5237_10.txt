We all create our own reality, can we? This is the basic question that lies behind this extremely original and masterfully elaborated study of the illusory nature of reality. Connecting Eastern and Buddhist philosophy with visual harassment of M.C. Escher, this fascinating treatise raises quite an intellectual question: "Who are we and what is our place in the universe?" And transforms them into compulsive and fun 100 minutes. The film focuses on Bart, a writer struggling with the script "The sea that thinks". When he sits at the computer, the work begins to develop as a description of his sitting at the computer, writing the script. Soon he got stuck in a spinning puzzle in which everything he writes becomes a reality. Director Gert de Graaff approaches his subject with a wary sense of humor and dazzles the viewer with a series of astounding visual tricks that confront the nature and accuracy of our perception. Ultimately, de Graaff's film challenges viewers on several levels to ask whether what we see, feel or taste is what it seems to be, or our entire understanding of the universe and our place in it is just a trick played by our senses.
