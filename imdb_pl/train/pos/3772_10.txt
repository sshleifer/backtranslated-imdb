Bill and Ted's fake journey is the best movie I've ever seen. Although acting and scenery etc. They are poor, who cares. The plot is brilliant, and the jokes and words they come up with are the best, ideas are great too. I recommend everyone to see this classic. The best thing is, of course, that "melvin" death, I crashed for 10 minutes and missed the next part of the movie. This is much better than the first, which was great as well. Probably the funniest movie of all time !!!!! I think the best parts of the movie are, however, when Bill and Ted scream perfectly and play solo guitar, it was fun. Rock on Bill, Ted and Eddie Van Halen, bring the third movie !!
