The movie project seems to be alpha and omega some of the major problems in this country (USA). We see relationships throughout the university for the film. Appropriately obvious from the student v.s. the teacher is present. But what the movie adds to its value are different relationships: the v.s. woman, white v.s. black and individual v.s. society. But the most important of all and directly in relation to all other relationships is the unit v.s. Himself. <br /> <br /> I was amazed at how the two-sided point of view was given by the director to show racial relations on campus. Most films usually show injustice on the one hand, showing the suffering of the other. This film showed the injustices and suffering of both sides. There was no attempt to show how it was right, although I would say that the heads of the skin turned out to be far more cruel and vengeful (quite obvious at the end). The film also discusses sex and rape. Ironically, this injustice connects both races together. Lawrence Fishburne achieves above-average performance as a prudent Professor Phipps. It breaks the idea of ​​racial favoritism, and instead shows the parallelism of lazy and trodden with hardworking and positive. Other stars that make up this movie are Omar Epps, Ice Cube and Jennifer Connelly. Michael Rapaport gives a perfect picture of a confused youth with an unfair anger who is looking for acceptance. Tyra Banks debuts in the film and proves that supermodels are able to work. <br /> <br /> Higher learning gains its name by showing college as something more than going to classes and getting a greeting card. In fact, I would say that the film is almost satire, showing students how to interact with each other, not a dry book, as a real education at the university. It is a lifelong learning process, not a textual learning process. I think that "higher education" is suitable for important issues in many universities, and even for life in general. 8/10
