One word: suPURRRRb! I do not think that I have seen such a thing for a long time on the network or cable TV. Watching this concert was like taking a breath of fresh air in a TV show filled with reality shows and boring replays. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I had reservations. In the end, the critics were almost unanimous in crying and lowering the ratings of the series. But when it ended half an hour (by the way, thank you, NBC, for running an ad-free program), I have the feeling of instant love, love at first glance, the real love that feels in his guts. Everything in this series screamed EXCELLENCE. <br /> <br /> The graphics in this show were at least as good as Finding Nemo and Shrek. No matter how long the films were developed. <br /> <br /> The cast was wonderful. Partially, I am against John Goodman's voice, but the rest of the team was certainly on par with John. Special distinction: Lisa Kudrow's guest performance. She was at the top of the game, creating a neurotic, plump and sympathetic panda with Jewish passion. (Panda from Brooklyn? Only in this program.) <br /> <br /> The screenplay was funny, with many internal jokes and adults who were sharp but not sticky. Note to all parents: NOT for children. This program has never been advertised as such and is the reason why it is set to 21:00 instead of 20:00. So if you want to complain about the "controversial context", save your breath. Adults deserve a comedy created especially for them, and the father of pride is this. <br /> <br /> Not everything was perfect. I was a little surprised by the figures of Siegfried and Roy. Do I feel the "stereotype" when it comes to them? Yes, they are gay. Yes, they are extravagant. Yes, they speak German accents. But that's yesterday's news. Give us something new, fresh, funny. Placing old jokes in the new series is definitely a bad approach. I understand that the creators of this program wanted to use the "star power" that these guys have. It's OK for me. But do not think about something that everyone knows by heart. I hope that the rest of the concert will still not be playing the same old album. <br /> <br /> In general, the program is definitely Must-See TV. Funny, witty, with a few unexpected turns of action here and there - there was no comedy so good since Seinfeld. I'm definitely waiting for the next episode.
