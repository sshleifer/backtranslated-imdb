This movie is great fun. Actors really make the movie go far. Without giving out the plot, I would describe her as a new favorite cult Princess Bride, who should stand the test of time. In this video you will see a completely different page of Robert DeNiro! (Worth the admission price just for that!) All the elements are from the adventure to romance and well placed comedy. <br /> <br /> People of all ages will enjoy it. (My parents even did it!) Good special effects can be scary for the youngest. A good movie about a date. Perfect for escapism. <br /> <br /> He deserves A. (I hope he works well at the box office)
