Kim Novak is a witch who teases a mortal lover, and James Stewart is her choice. A shimmering comedy of manners from the Broadway stage; filmed by James Wong Howe in Witch Color and made by a good cast. Ernie Kovacs is wonderful as the eternally disheveled writer of Redlitch. I love this movie, although there are not many others. Only Kim makes the winner in my book. Ha! My film No. 5 from 1958.
