I must admit that this is the type of film that I would normally avoid, but I rented it mainly because of the stars. I certainly was not sorry. In fact, as you can see, I rated it five stars. This film is a great combination of sharp direction and excellent acting. <br /> <br /> Andy and Hank Hanson are brothers who decide to commit a crude crime of robbing their parents' jewelry store. The offense is terribly bad - starting with three men from the Hanson family. Through a series of flashbacks, we meet Charles Hanson and come to understand the tense relationship between father and sons. <br /> <br /> The younger brother, Hank is basically fucked up. He always had problems with maintaining his work and almost went in the direction of the wind. Hank is uncertain, cowardly and very influenced by his older brother. Ethan Hawke has the character of Hank "nailed to T" and probably gives his best performance so far. He shows us a man who is basically good-natured, but so influenced by external forces that he is unable to perform any important task. <br /> <br /> Andy - seemingly - seems to be a successful businessman, but soon we will discover that he is addicted to drugs and has betrayed his company to pay for his habit. It is Andy who makes up a plan to rob his parents' store, and Hank gets a weak will to commit an act. Philip Seymour Hoffman - certainly one of the best actors of our time - plays Andy. Hoffman is an actor who has the ability to represent a man who on the surface is a charming businessman liked by friends, but a real slimy ball underneath. It's absolutely perfect for a part of Andy or you can say that thanks to his acting skills, he made Andy an ideal part. <br /> <br /> Albert Finney plays a father common to his generation. Charles Hanson is not a bad or insensitive man, but he has a bad relationship with his sons because he never really understood what is necessary to cultivate a positive bond between his sons and himself. He was always too fast to criticize and admonish. He always made it clear that he favored his younger son over his elder, thus causing a wide emotional gap between him and Andy. When we meet Charles and Andy, the thought that Andy creates a plan to rob his father, becomes less incredible. <br /> <br /> Personally, I can not believe how much Charles Hanson reminded me of my father, and how much Andy and Hank reminded me of my brother and me. Perhaps this is one of the reasons why I liked the movie, as well as the story of a distant, critical father, older older brother, and a younger brother with less success, he got so close to home. Fortunately, my brother and I have never come to a crime against my parents. I think we were made of stricter and more moral things. <br /> <br /> This complex of personalities and activities has been professionally connected by the director, Sidney Lumet. At the age of eighty-three, he still has chops to give viewers engaging characters and hypnotizing action from the edge. 12 Angry Men was his first film made fifty years earlier than Before the Devil Knows You're Dead, but he did not lose any of the magical touch, showing us characters that will be remembered for a long time. <br /> <br /> Events and characters in Before the devil knows that you are dead, they are sharp and unattractive, and this is certainly not a good movie. However, it is two hours of full entertainment, which I completely recommend.
