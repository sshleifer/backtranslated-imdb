I have always believed that David and Bathsheba is a movie originally intended for Tyrone Power in 20th Century Fox, although Gregory Peck describes himself well as King David, a monarch with a wandering eye. <br /> <br /> Many biblical movies have been touched upon in this film, adultery, redemption, sin, punishment and generally what God expects from his followers. <br /> <br /> When you are a king, even a king in the biblically foretold kingdom, which certainly has many perogences that are not available to the rest of us. King David has many wives, including one really malicious at Jayne Meadows, who was the daughter of Saul, David's predecessor. But one evening his eyes see Bathsheba in his garden. It turns out that he is so unhappy married to Uriah Hittite as David for many women. Uriah is one of the captains of David's army. David sends for Bathsheba, and he is the king, she comes because she has her eye too. <br /> <br /> What's happening, romance, pregnancy and a carefully arranged death for Uriah's battle. But everything he sees and knows the Deity has caught all this and not only punishes David and Bathsheba, but the entire Kingdom of Israel is punished by drought, disease and pestilence. <br /> <br /> The day's sexist law calls for Bathsheba to stone death. David shows weakness in his previous actions, but here he goes to the plate and asks that everything be imposed on him. He even puts his hands on the Ark of the Covenant, which was an instantaneous death, as seen in the film. <br /> <br /> My interpretation of this is that God admires courage, even if you are wrong, and he resigns from David and forgives them both. Bathsheba becomes the mother of Solomon, and she and David are the ancestors of several successors in the divided kingdoms of Israel and Judah, until they are both conquered. with Uriah played by Kieron Moore. The only thing that excites Moore is a good battle. I liked the performance of Kieron Moore as a brave and rather stupid horse. <br /> <br /> No one can make a law like Raymond Massey. His Nathan the Prophet is consistent with the character of John Brown, which he played in two films of the same intensity. <br /> <br /> So when His own law called for death, why God spared Bathsheba and kept David on the throne. Maybe it was because he just did not want to train a third guy to work. He already replaced Saul David. <br /> <br /> But I think that the Christian interpretation may be such that it was a clue of the coming New Testament that you can sin and receive mercy if you ask for it atonement. I will leave this to the biblical scholar to present the interpretation. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie and you can come up with a completely new theory.
