The shower keeps itself in many ways. Almost the whole movie takes place in an old bathhouse, and the inhabitants provide humor, pathos and emotional accents. Love and friendship between the owner and his late son is deep and moving. The way in which the older brother is drawn into this tiny world seems unforced and persuasive. The plot is winding, full of surprises and irony, and generally moved by the feeling of what I would have to call neighborhood in the relations and conflicts of performers. It's a movie that I pull out when I want to believe in the world again.
