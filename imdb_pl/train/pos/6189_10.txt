Who would imagine - Hal Hartley creates the cinematic consistency of Syriana, while maintaining its characteristic style. The merger is very funny. <br /> <br /> I have not seen Hal Hartley's movie for about a decade, so I've approached it with some caution. His great productions from the nineties delighted the critics and the audience with a unique style and dialogue. Earlier director films contained colorful characters and offered close observations of life - often in the Long Island region, New York or in New York - which were unconventional and insightful. results from the description of the film as a "spy thriller". To my pleasant surprise, Hartley manages to combine his established style and focus on creating an extremely original drama of international intrigue. It works in many ways than you can imagine. Hartley's film maintains a dialogue and focus on the character that are its trademarks, as well as a unique cinematographic style. <br /> <br /> In addition, given the current situation in the world and the state of war, which is supported by dark elements from all sides. Hartley brought all his skills to something new - a political film worthy of mention in the same breath as Syrian. Indeed, he comes into his own. The cast does a great job, interpreting Hartley's vision and style. Parker fans Posey will see her here in full bloom, still with us and more mature and more beautiful than before.
