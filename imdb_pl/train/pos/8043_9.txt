I've heard people say that this movie is boring, boring. I do not think they will watch the right movie. This is not a prototype action movie, thank God. <br /> <br /> This is the psychological drama about the debutant and his mentor, which is just about killing people. In this way, it works very well, with amazing performances by Berenger and Zane (who does not sleep through the movie like in other roles - it looks like he is playing). <br /> <br /> I was disappointed with the action at the end - many of them did not make much sense and were unsatisfactory considering the accumulation of the rest of the movie. But look at Zane's face when he panics alone, while Berenger does a dirty job.
