I noticed that this movie began to destroy long before it hit the cinemas, and I did not have much hope either. I came to the conclusion that this is another "You Got Served" movie with some nice dance moves and terrible acting. I was in the theater and I decided between Meet the Spartans and I chose it. To my surprise, acting was not bad at all, and the film was quite good. The fact that it has a lower rating than You Got Served is absolutely ridiculous. Instead of listening to the trash posted here, I recommend watching the movie show so that you do not spend too much. I think you will be pleasantly surprised at how much everyone said about it. When it comes to dance movies, it is definitely one of the better movies with a much better game than many others. Go see the movie and judge for yourself. I hope that the rating will increase after it appears on DVD, and more people check the video, instead of evaluating it based on the comments before releasing the movie. <br /> <br /> edit Now the movie is approaching the right assessment. Over 1000 people awarded him a grade 9, a bit too high, but at least it helps to balance the absurd voices 1.
