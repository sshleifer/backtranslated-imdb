I can not believe that people are looking for a story in this film. This is Laural and Hardy. Brighten up already. These two were riots. Their comical genius is as fun today as they were 70 years ago. It is not a dirty word from both lips and they were able to keep the audience in the seams. Their comedy was not refined by any episode. If the whoopee cushion does not let you smile, there is no reason to watch any of these things. It was a simpler time and people were laughing at things that were fun without a storyline. I think I need this simple mind to enjoy these things, so I qualify. Two comedy bands do not count, we're just too sophisticated ... Are not we lucky?
