First of all, I'm not a fangirl Justin Timberlake, who is obsessed with making him look good, in fact I'm not even a big fan of Justin, but I liked the movie. <br /> <br /> I'm working on a movie and when I saw this movie with its huge cast I never heard of, I had to see what it was about. I did not think Justin was playing that bad, it was by far the worst of the group, but it's quite an impressive group, and Cary Elwes and Dylan McDermott are two names that did not even make their first list. The story is simple, the journalist discovers corrupt cops, but I found it well done. The character L L Cool J was clearly contradictory, but to be honest I did not know what he would eventually do. Morgan Freeman is, as always, a wise mentor, who he does so well, and although I love Kevin SPacey, he was just there. HI did not have much substance, but it's Kevin Spacey, she can not do anything wrong. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, I thought Dylan McDermott gave the best results as a deadly cop. Really credible and really character, I was terrified a few times. <br /> <br /> I really expected great cordiality to be honest. Horrible slogans, unwarranted sequences of actions, such things, but it was surprisingly well done and I did not find any of it. Each shot had some sense, it was not trivial, really solid. <br /> <br /> in general, amazing cast, decent story that interested me and enough action to jump me. I do not know why he did not show up in cinemas, it was better than some junk that I saw on the big screen. I would say it is worth seeing.
