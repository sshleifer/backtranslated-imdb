Madhur Bhandarkar strives to address taboo issues and presents the most realistic picture of modern society. One can get the impression that the director comes from his earlier films, such as Satta and Chandni bar. Issues indicated in the latter film are explored and exposed in their entirety here. Casting is amazing and you can see judgments on every scene from many angles. Mostly the movie leaves you much food for thought. When you start guessing things, you end up being mostly close, but you're missing a character in many scenes. In the end, it leaves a lasting impression. <br /> <br /> The actors to watch include Konkana Sen Sharma, Boman Irani and Atul Kulkarni. Dialogues are well written and you feel that you have lived around some of these people. There are also scenes that make you think of more depth. Songs are in the background, saving time, and the voice of Summer in the very significant song "Kitne Ajeeb" leaves you feeling that you are alone in the middle of a modern society!
