BASEketball is a really funny movie. David Zucker manages to make us all laugh again, in a really stupid but often intelligent comedy. <br /> <br /> The two creators of South Park, the main actors in this film, play very well, surprisingly well, but for the first time I see them as actors. The film often reminds me of South Park - one of my favorite performances. <br /> <br /> It's really a good and fun movie, so do not miss it. <br /> <br /> Voting time: 7.5 from out of 10.
