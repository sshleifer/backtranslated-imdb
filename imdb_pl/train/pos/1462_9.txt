In this video, we meet Roger, a wealthy factory manager in China, who manufactures and sells beads and other trinkets at Mardi Gras in New Orleans. Roger says that the girls in the factory love their work and are grateful for the opportunities it offers, but interviews with four of them tell a completely different story. The dreary life of the girls is in sharp contrast to the bizarre excesses of Mardi Gras itself. The creator of the film, David Redmon, should be praised for gaining excellent and rare film material from everyday life in a Chinese factory and for broadcasting an interview with the head of an American company that imports and sells beads. The film is convincingly narrated and clearly serves its purpose as a window to what is behind these ubiquitous "Made in China" labels.
