Albuquerque is a movie that contains all the elements of the class A western except one: a story that really belongs to class B or C. It was acceptable at the time the movie was made, when people were so delighted to see the western in color, but currently it looks just very primitive. Nevertheless, for people who like old westerns, it's funny, the original color and sound are very well preserved on the last released DVD. Gabby Hayes is a good helper, Lon Chaney is always mean and Randolph Scott is a little bit cheer than usual. In a movie called Albuquerque you would expect to see something that will remind you about the city, but the city shown here can be anywhere.
