Report from Toronto Film Festival 2005 Is official; "Takashi Miike" is crazy. <br /> <br /> An annual screening of the new movie "Takashi Miike", "The Big Spook War" or "The Great Yokai War" or "Yôkai daisensô". Call what you want, a fanatical ride. <br /> <br /> Colin Geddes, a fearless programmer, said this movie was originally intended for children in Japan. Think about "Lord of the Rings" or "Neverending Story" for Japan. After the screening, I can understand where they are going with this, but to hell, it's finally "Takashi Miike". He directed the movie "Ichi the Killer" from 1901, when it was shown at the festival in barfach. And no, it was not just a marketing gimmick. <br /> <br /> Summary thread: A young boy with a restless home life is "chosen" and falls into the middle of a great spirit of war, where he meets a group of friendly ghosts who become his companions in his journey. <br /> <br /> It's not for children, not for "too" young people. They certainly see how they are afraid of shit with some of these ghosts (even those friendly) at the exhibition. It does not resemble anything I've seen in the cinema before. Naturally fantasy, very funny (but dark) material. You will not be bored, you can guarantee it. Will it ever hit North America? Doubtful. <br /> <br /> My rating = B
