Barriers seem to be one of those series that have been lost in the mist of time. After its transfer in the early 80s and repetition, it is sunk without a trace. It's a tearful shame. <br /> <br /> At first I watched it when it was broadcast in the southern TV region on Sunday afternoons and was a classic afternoon tea. Although I do not remember much about the program, a few things stuck in my head. The most notable were the unforgettable titles. Funeral flute music accompanying an attempt to escape through the Eastern European border and a subsequent car crash (and this scene left me with unchanging love for the models of Mercedes "fintail" when they used the Merc 200). Although it was not obvious at first, the secrets of the series were these titles. <br /> <br /> The story of a young music student trying to unravel what really happened when he discovered he was adopted had plenty of twists and turns, but Barriers was a surprisingly "adult" drama for children. Benedict Taylor was great as Billy and it's a shame he did not do much more. <br /> <br /> It was a high quality drama, late for the DVD release and I hope that I will have the chance to become acquainted with it in the future. <br /> <br /> A nice childhood memory
