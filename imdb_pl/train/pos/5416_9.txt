I only saw it once. It happened in 1952, I was seven, film 13. <br /> <br /> We were so young ... But I always remembered the strong moments of Gunga sacrifice. <br /> <br /> I realized that the time in which people can be barely represented and used by a foreign nation. In these historical circumstances, in the film, a personal relationship of friendship, a kind of friendship that ignores itself, that which arises between people who share everyday life, who see themselves who know each other, but belong to different worlds, may appear only. Then, at the most critical moments, a troubling question arises: "Who, in the first place, should we be loyal to?" Which people, family, homeland, person you know near you? You do not have time to give an excellent answer, urgency is there, and this is life or death. Gunga-Din gives answers with self-sacrifice. Somewhere, in a confused way, the problem remains unresolved, emotions grow with the rhythm of the film until someone dies, only one life, nothing compared to so many other fictions or realities that we can see today because this death, this unique disappearance of life in which I lived, I shared my unconditional friendship with my child. The viewer whom I was lived for me. That day I lose Gung-Din forever. When I left behind, my later childhood, when I left so many worlds in which I lived. I left it all for good, and these lines are a short visit today, which I did not expect this morning when I woke up.
