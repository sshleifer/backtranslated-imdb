this is a funny movie. it can actually make you feel uncomfortable, because it's not some undead psychopath or sociopath, his daily doctor. how terrible it is. I got some good actors and actresses in this movie, though some were not appreciated like Virginya Keehne as Sarah. Ken Foree, whom you can recognize when you reject zombie and Halloween devils (2007), as our detective on the trail of schizoidal dr. Alan Feinstone (Corbin Benson). A brief short summary is: Dr. Alan Feinstone, a guy who has a sexy wife, a nice home and is a great dentist that everyone loves. Until I catch my wife cheating on him with a pool cleaner. Then he begins to hallucinate that his patients' teeth are rotten and that patients are his wife when he starts going crazy in this thriller. But earlier, a nice guy.
