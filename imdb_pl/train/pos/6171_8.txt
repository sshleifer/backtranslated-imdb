For those of you who have read Rohinton Mistry's highly respected novel, this film will surely impress you because it is an honorable adaptation. With the exception of one small story, the feature debut Sturli Gunnarson is almost a dead record of the book (up to the last line). <br /> <br /> For those who have not read the novel, this movie can be a bit complicated. Certainly not a big movie story. Instead, he has a strong element of realism, but I would not have it in a different way. The best way to describe such a long journey to movie fans would be to say that it is a small, Indian version of "Fiddler on the Roof". Instead of a Jewish / Russian milkman, the hero Gustad Noble is a banker in 1970 in Mumbai during the Muslim-Hindi war with Pakistan. He is forced to deal with many unexpected problems in his life, including a sick daughter, the oldest son of an individualist, a distant friend who engages him in some dirty money and an unhealthy neighborhood. The ending is not happy, nor is it sad, but in reality it's realism. <br /> <br /> Such a long journey is a great little movie, but if you want to see it, it's good luck finding it. Unlike the novel, she received very few exemptions.
