I remember that I liked it more than the Nausica valley of winds in the century in which the tone of history was too serious for me. Laputa, whose title apparently influenced his release in the US, to avoid confusion among the wide Latino audience, has a drawing talent for the debut production of director Conan. In fact, Pazu has thick bones and the immortal life of Conan - who jumped from a thousand stories carrying the girl in his arms and landed on his feet, then he began to run. This makes him the most animated and pleasant character to watch. Nausica fans can be disappointed with flying bugs and retro technology by Laputa - the only exception can be a robot. Unlike the Princess of Mononoke and the Valley of Winds, the theme in Laputa is not directly related to ecology. If there is a topic at all, it is anti-war. The meaning of life in a natural way - it is related to the flying castle, is soon discussed and is not fully respected. In general, I now consider this piece as the point of intersection between a good frame of mind and a horn.
