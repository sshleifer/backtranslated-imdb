This is one of those films that investigate the cultural clash of people born in the East in Western cultures. <br /> <br /> Loving on Tokyo Time is a sad movie about the inability to attract opposites due to large cultural differences. Ken, a rock n'roll fanatic, marries Kyoto and the Japanese, so she can stay in the United States after her visa has expired. The marriage is expected to be temporary, i.e. until Kyoto obtains a legal status. But Ken, who seems lost in any relationship, likes Kyoto and tries hard to make things work out. This, despite the fact that his friend insisted that dumping of Kyoto and getting rid of all obligations towards girls is bad for rock'n'roll, with the exception of inspiring to write songs about broken hearts and the like. <br /> <br /> But Kyoto has a strict traditional Japanese upbringing and does not expect that he will marry Ken for so long. What's more, she misses the house and wants to return to Japan. It's sad that in the end someone Ken thinks he can love and be with all this, except once, when he thinks he's found someone who feels like that, the girl does not expect to stay that long . It's not that she does not like Ken, but she just got used to all her life. He says, "I can not tell him how I feel in English, and Ken can not tell me how he feels in Japanese." It's a pretty sad love story with a techno-nintendo's deadly soundtrack from the 80s. <br /> <br /> I chose Loving on Tokyo Time because it reminded me of one of my favorite movies from the 80s, Tokyo Pop. And for those who liked Loving on Tokyo Time, check out Tokyo Pop (a New York singer goes to Japan and joins the Japanese cover band), with the exception of the happy ending movie. <br /> <br />
