Are these three guys in their tough guys, knocking on a guy tied with a string, or a girl who says, "What's up, dog? on the roadkill, there is something that everyone liked at Knuckleface Jones. This is weird and surrealistic and the yarn does not quite understand ... but it never loses you. When I saw it for the first time, I almost laughed sick. And every night after returning home and watching it again. Forget about Coyote Ugly ... this is a movie that strengthened my sympathy for Piper Perabo. See it ... before it's too late!
