This is a movie that the US does not do. That's why people rent foreign movies. It is a great story about how one person, even if it is delayed, can force a person to find a reason in an empty life. Everyone can learn from Georges. It also shows how people with intellectual disabilities suffer in their lives and show them in a very realistic way (I think so). As a classic in foreign films, this film has a bittersweet ending, but it only makes it a better movie.
