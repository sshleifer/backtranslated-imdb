That's how I think about the concert. <br /> <br /> I started watching the show in replays in 2001. <br /> <br /> I like the performance, but he had too many mistakes. <br /> <br /> I HATE MICHELLE and JOEY CHARACTERS! <br /> <br /> Stealing the plot from old television programs. They even stole The Partirdge Family. Then in the first episode, "The Partridge Family" was mentioned. <br /> <br /> Actors playing different roles in different episodes. MTV Martha Quinn does the most, especially when she was in the first episode. <br /> <br /> The figure Michelle could NOT make a joke, but then she told the child to play a "revenge" on her sister's joke about her. <br /> <br /> The plot lines that appeared and went in the first episode. Joey receives a TV show with Frank and Annette, he never heard of it again. Danny suddenly plays the guitar. 1 episode trains football, 1 episode trains softball / baseball. 1 game and you are huh Danny? <br /> <br /> Jesse and Joey are still getting a job REALLY FAST without experience. Only in the television program. <br /> <br /> I liked D.J. And Stephanie's characters. I would like Jodie Sweetin to learn from Candace Cameron Bure and have a pure, adult life without drugs.
