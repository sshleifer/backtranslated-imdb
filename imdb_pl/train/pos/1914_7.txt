Eight simple rules began as a very fun series. I love John Ritter and his character Paul Hennessey, and the relationship he had with the kids was the best part of the show. <br /> <br /> I've always preferred Kerry to Bridget, Bridget was before, Kerry is pretty special and I can relate to her in many ways, although I'm not sure if I like the direction her character went in later series. <br /> <br /> Early episodes were fun, good simple teen stories about Paul and Cate's children's discipline, but I think the program lost its luster when John Ritter died. I admired the cast and the crew for wanting to continue the series, but when he died, I felt that the program did. For me, the whole point of the program was based on the guide "8 simple rules for dating my teenage daughter", written by a real man with teenage daughters, and the meaning and angle of the performance changed without Hennessey's father. <br /> <br /> Bridget seemed to be more and more annoying, Rory remained the same, and Cate always gave her offspring life lessons that had previously seemed more fun when everything was left to Paul. I think grandfather is funny (especially when watching a great escape), but he feels that C.J is not needed for the show. He is funny in part, but I felt that the plot at the time of his arrival was very similar to other American comedy series. Above all, new ones are not bad, just missing excitement, and does anyone else find it annoying that Cate works at school, and CJ and Grandpa are always there? I always recommend this program to friends because in the beginning it was very strong and worth seeing for Paul and Kerry, but later they were mediocre at best.
