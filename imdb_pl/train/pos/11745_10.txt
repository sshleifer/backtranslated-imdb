if you have the chance to see this movie, see this. it is quite shocking in part and really makes you think about so many important matters, but this is not didactic. In my opinion, this work of art ... beautifully filmed, great music of many styles, typically impressive level of acting, which can be expected from the BBC Drama. Nathalie Press (announced as "Natalie" Press) is convincing in her role as a depressive teenager used by a male classmate. Celia Imrie has such a beautifully calming quality that sometimes gives worrying stability, and the viewer has a sense of comfort knowing that someone is actually "normal", but the real star is Timothy Spall - certainly one of the greatest actors of our time!
