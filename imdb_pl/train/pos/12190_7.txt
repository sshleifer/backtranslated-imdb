It is very difficult to say what happened with "The Lady from Shanghai" and what the film could have been without interference in the studio. The main interest of Orson Welles at the moment was to get money for his theater; funding his own projects led him to seek acting. He made "Lady from Shanghai" for his soon-to-be wife, Rita Hayworth. Harry Cohn was afraid of Rita's image and stopped the release of the film for a year. <br /> <br /> The plot is about Irish sailor Michael O'Hara who falls in love with Else (Hayworth, stunning short blonde hair). Her husband is a well-known criminal attorney, Arthur Bannister (Everett Sloane), who is just as crippled inside as he is outside. He hires O'Hara to work on his yacht, and there O'Hara is drawn deeper and deeper into a network of murders and deceptions. <br /> <br /> "A lady from Shanghai" is moving at a snail's pace, I agree with one of the posters that films are criticized today for taking the time to build a story. Still, this movie is stretched. The stage in the fun house is fantastic - Welles wanted her without music and I believe that the studio has lowered it. Detriment. Photography is stunning, moody, bold and very stylish. <br /> <br /> Welles was a great actor, handsome in his youth, charismatic and having great voice and technique, but in many movies he is almost the same if he does not trust himself or does not spend time developing the character. Instead, it relies on externals, such as accents and false noses. One of the few moments in which he did not do this was "Tomorrow is Forever", where the director gets an excellent, deeply perceptible performance from him. Contrast with "Compulsion", where he shows that he is the master of a purely technical game, as he calls in his performance. Here, Welles is a fourfold duty - as a director, star, co-writer and narrator. Sporting a completely unnecessary accent and an intense look is a quick way to characterize. Nevertheless, he is always convincing. <br /> <br /> Supporting players are great, including Sloan and Glenn Anders. Hayworth, a wonderful and gentle voice (her singing was again called by Anita Ellis) is as usual a complete goddess and one of the great presence on the screen. What a sad life for such a vivid beauty. <br /> <br /> Any film that Orson Welles directed is worth seeing, and "The Lady of Shanghai" is no exception. But that makes the viewer frustrated, just like "The Magnificent Ambersons" - just like any work done by Welles in the studio system. He was a great artist who should be given a slower reign; He was not. He was a strange dichotomy - he needed more freedom, but as some of his later works prove, he needed the structure of the studio. Unfortunately, he could not have both.
