After becoming totally addicted to Six Feet Under, I did not think there would be another program that would be as good as this program. Well, I was wrong! Lost is charming !! I love this program and I can not turn it off. The richness of the characters, the intricacies of the plot, beautiful surroundings are amazing. I am completely and completely addicted. I do not know how the creators do it, but each character touches me very much. I feel their joy, their pain, everything, all the way to the core !!! I do not have a cable, so I rent a series on Netflix. When I put it on, I watch all episodes at once and feel sad when it's over. I can not wait for the next drive to reach my home. It's probably the best TV show I've ever seen !!!
