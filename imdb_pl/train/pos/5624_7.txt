I've never been a fan of Farrah Fawcett ... Until now. She was really amazing in this movie. The emotions that had to go through the resumption of shooting after re-admission do not raise any doubts. It was a very difficult movie to watch, the subject is definitely unpleasant and you feel so helpless, sitting and watching how a woman is abused by what seems like an eternity. Actually, I felt that the whole thing had broken a bit when her friends returned home and did not realize that it was possible. The director seemed very eager to use heights in his shots and loved to use mirrors, I believe he should have paid more attention to the pace in the second half of this song. I am sure that it is a piece of strong theater, this film for me, though it had good qualities, just did not succeed.
