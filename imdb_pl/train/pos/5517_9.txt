Che: Part one was a fascinating experiment that not only told a very interesting story, but also tried to do something else with the "biographical" genre. Part two is the perfect culmination of this experiment. <br /> <br /> This movie offers all the same attributes from the first one, from extraordinary performances (especially from Benicio del Toro) to the brilliant direction of Steven Soderbergh, not forgetting to break with the conventional rules of biopics. what I admire from Soderbergh's experiments ... they always try to do something different and unusual, and they succeed most of the time. <br /> <br /> The last message from this movie is perfect and it contains everything we have. I've been told about the life of Che Guervara. The only failure I found on Che: The second part is that a few parts were a bit insignificant. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I give Che: Part two a very enthusiastic recommendation, because the first is a courageous and fascinating experiment iment, which challenges the viewer and leaves us thinking.
