Does anyone know the exact quote about the "time and love" of George Ede alias, father Fitzpatrick on the move, it had to be you? Did he talk to Charlie and Annna in the church when they were leaving? If not, I will have to rent a movie. It was a great movie. I also loved Serendipity! A great love story for the soul! <br /> <br /> I met my only real love (my soulmate) and although I had the experience to meet him when I least expected it, I was not ready for this kind of emotional relationship. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that we got married, I was not mature enough to give as much as I expected. I got complacent and took his love for granted and endured it for 7 years. <br /> <br /> He finally left with a grudge, but we are still wounded and angry and incredulous about how it turned out. I had some very difficult lessons to learn and now we are separated by 3 years. <br /> <br /> This movie meant a lot because I'm still waiting for my only true love to come to terms with me. I can NOW appreciate this clear feeling in me and the quote of Father Fitzpatrick, who called me truly. <br /> <br /> I know that when he heals enough to trust me again, we will remarry. <br /> <br /> NEVER MAKE COMPLETENESS AND ACCEPT TRUE LOVE TO BE GRANTED! HE WAS THE BEST LIGHTWEIGHT OF MY LIFE. <br /> <br /> Also the music in this movie is EXCEPTIONAL and IMPORTANT! This film is DEEP and spiritually uplifting. TRUE LOVE is worth waiting for, if it is to be, it will, regardless of everything, THIS IS STAYING! Nothing is impossible even when it is the second time! Thanks!
