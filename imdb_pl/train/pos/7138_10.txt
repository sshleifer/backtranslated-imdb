If John Thaw never played "Morse", "Kavanagh" or appeared in "The Sweeney" and other productions, he would be remembered for this wonderfully memorable performance in "Goodnight Mr Tom". <br /> <br /> Greatly supported by a huge performance by his star (young Nick Robinson in his first role) and a discreet cast, this adaptation of the charming novel by Michelle Magorian is a suitable monument to his art. <br /> <br /> When I read this story of an old widow from Norfolk, who had to accommodate a young boy from London before and during Blitz, I found in him quite an obvious time line error, and the makers of this movie should be counted on fixing this error. They must also be applauded for not exaggerating the story, and preventing what could easily be transformed into a muddy mess. <br /> <br /> If you're holding a CD or video library, then you feel good TV movie is an absolute must.
