I had the opportunity to see this film debut at the Film Festival in Appalachian, where he won the award for the best film. This movie is well done, with an excellent cast that works great as a band. My favorite performances were Youssef Kerkour, Justin Lane and Adam Jones. There are also great effects associated with dragonflies and cockroaches, which is why I was surprised that this movie was made with a small budget. Writer-director Adam Jones, who, I think, also won the writing prize, has a great job in the direction of. The audience loved this movie. Cross Eyed will laugh you through the entire movie. Definitely a must see.
