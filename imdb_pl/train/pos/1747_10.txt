This movie was one of the best movies I've seen this year. I did not see any scenes in the movie, but it's still pretty good. This is similar to Anchorman in the humor department, but I think it is a better prepared film. In fact, he is right. If you intend to see a whole lot of T & A, you will be disappointed. Just a well-prepared movie !!!! If you do not have anything to do all day or you need a lot of humor, you'll find that it's a really good movie. I definitely think that Ebert and Roeper are reviewing this movie. I mean, I do not like Ebert in most movies, but this is a movie I agree to. The film has a good enough story that it is really reliable that people like that are there. There is definitely something to say about how they treat virginity in this film. Yes, of course, you make fun of when you find out, but it still suggests you have to wait. Steve did a great job of introducing the person he did in this movie, and yet he's still funny.
