Here is one movie that is really funny at any time that it covers. How can you not be made to understand that this film is the star of the creators of South Park and is directed by David Zucker? When I saw this movie for the first time, I did not realize at once that Coop and Doug were really Matt and Trey, but their talent for playing and writing turned out to be impressive. I was pleasantly surprised when I learned that they were really Matt and Trey. Humor is sometimes primitive, sometimes disgusting, sometimes brilliant, sometimes subtle, sometimes loud, and sometimes stupid, but overall, it is an infernal movie that is undoubtedly underestimated. Well, it's crazy. Completely impossible.
