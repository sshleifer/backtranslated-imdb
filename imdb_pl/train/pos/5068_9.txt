This film is a great movie based on the life of a man called Gray Owl in 1930 in Canada. I found that like "Rudy" and "Awakening" it is also riveting and cordial. He makes himself late in the life of Gray Owl and follows him through his most turbulent and influential period. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of a Canadian Indian who discovers that he is promoting the difficult situation of a beaver imprisoned. It also predicts the decline in the number of natural lands and the excessive use of Earth's resources. This is an outrageous concept in the 1930s and surprisingly well received. He becomes a well-known speaker and the masses are ready to listen. <br /> <br /> Pierce Brosnan's cast seems quite strange, but not outrageous. Anyone who wants to argue must first watch the video to understand it. Brosnan provides a great performance, just like Annie Galipeau. Galipeau is a strong actress whose place next to Brosnan is refreshingly natural compared to forced couples from recent Bond movies. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone interested in a good drama, beautiful scenery or environmental causes. This is a film for families, but children under 10 (depending on their maturity) would have problems with following the storyline.
