I joined IMDb, so people know what a great movie it is! It is not uncommon to see a movie that moves and is visually cinematic, yet modest. You read the conspiracy, so all I want to say is do not watch it because you want to see the clash of cultural mumbling religious identity, because it's a typical misunderstanding that people read in, instead appreciate and realize that it's about father and son on the go, which is getting to know each other more and more through their struggles. Buy it and deliver it before film4 covers it. It was one of the few films nominated for independent and foreign BAFTA awards. The beauty of this is that he manages to appeal to everyone, even if you never watch anything with subtitles or you just get used to the Hollywood formula, just a great story that will allow you to get involved. All I want is to stay longer and see what will happen
