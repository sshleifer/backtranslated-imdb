I have the impression that musicals from the Warners Bros. Depression era will become much more important in the next few years. Yes, we are stagnant (or maybe you've lived under the rock), and the times look grim. But we always have movies as a way to avoid our problems. In the 1930s, filming enjoyed great popularity, even during the darkness of the economy. "Footlight Parade (1933)" was one of those films that attracted the audience. While this musical directed by Lloyd Bacon does not reflect social problems in those days, as "Gold Diggers from 1933" does (1933), it is still a great presentation of talent. We have to wait until the end of the movie for three extravagant Busby Berkely numbers, but boy, is it worth waiting for me? Yes, little Ruby Keeler is a terrible singer and actress, and her knocking is so-so, but Busby's magical "By A Waterfall" kidnaps her, and what seems to be a hundred other choristers, into a stunning water wonderland. Of course, Busby's numbers could never really be performed on the stage (first, they oppose the limits of gravity), and they contrast with the realism of difficult, wise non-musical scenes. And "Footlight" also has James Cagney on one of his few musicals (really, what could this man not do?). It can even take over from the main character, the sailor's and fawn over the Shanghai Lilac sexpot (which is really a Ruby wig in China!). omits other women (that is, to the last drum). Apparently Blondell was the only woman Cagney loved outside of his wife. And you see mutual adoration in every scene.
