Professor Janos Rukh (Boris Karloff) discovers Radium X - a powerful force for use in atomic force. Unfortunately, Rukh was polluted with Radium and begins to glow in the dark - and his touch causes immediate death. Dr. Felix Benet (Bela Lugosi) develops an antidote - but Rukh begins to go mad because of Radium and the antidote and decides to kill everything that he believed hurt him. <br /> <br /> The plot is stupid and the "effects" that make Karloff glow in the dark are funny, but it's still a fun little aggregate. Moves quickly, has a great atmosphere (notice the "home" of Rukh and the film begins on a dark and rainy night), and Karloff and Lugosi (as always) give great performances. There is also a good actor Franic Drake (as a wife of Rukh) and Violet Kemble Cooper (as his mother). So it's OK, but it's just a clipping below all other Karloff / Lugosi movies. The plot is too tight to swallow it. I still liked it. I give him 7.
