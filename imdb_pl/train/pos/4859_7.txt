I read that Jessie Matthews was returned and she refused to cooperate with Fred Astaire at Damsel in Distress. Jessie Matthews at the best age never left the edge of the pond to make American music films. If they joined forces in this film, it would be a one-off event. <br /> <br /> It's a pity, because Damsel in Distress has everything else. Fred Astaire, history and adaptation for display by the author P.G. Wodehouse, Burns & Allen for Gershwin Brothers comedy and song. In response to a question asked by Nice, if you can get it, you can not ask for that much more. <br /> <br /> With the exception of the leading lady. Although Ginger Rogers did some films away from Fred Astaire, Damsel in Distress is the only movie that Astaire did without Rogers when they were a band. Young Joan Fontaine was cast in this opposite Astaire. <br /> <br /> Her heroine has nothing to bite that Ginger Rogers does in these movies. Everything that basically must do is act sweetly and modestly. She does not add anything to music. And if I were to evaluate all dance partners of Fred Astaire, Joan Fontaine will come down. The poor woman is just awful in the number of Things They Look. <br /> <br /> When she later appeared in the musical with Bing Crosby, The Emperor Waltz, it's no coincidence that Fontaine has nothing to do. <br /> <br /> The version I have is colored and in this case I think it really did well. Sielankowa, green, English village of P.G. Wodehouse is really released in this copy of VHS. Especially in this issue, which I mentioned earlier with Astaire and Fontaine, which takes place in the garden. <br /> <br /> Burns & Allen on the other hand, like several old vaudeville soldiers, complements Astaire in a grand style in the Stiff Upper Lip issue. The surreal fun-house sequence is wonderfully exhibited. <br /> <br /> P.G. In the Wodehouse aristocracy you play with Constance Collier on her haughty best and once on Montagu Love as Fontaine's father as a nice guy in the movie. <br /> <br /> The biggest hit in "Damsel in Distress" is A Foggy Day, perhaps the most famous song about the British capital, because London Bridge falls. Made in the simplest and elegant way by Fred Astaire, this is one of those songs that will last as long as London survives, and even after. <br /> <br /> With a view of the young and inexperienced Joan Fontaine, A Damsel in Distress rates like classic, classic score, classic dance, classic comedy. Who could ask for more?
