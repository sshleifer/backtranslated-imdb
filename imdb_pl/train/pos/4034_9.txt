Pinjar is a really good movie, with great acting, good narration, good presentation, moving emotions, etc. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that the quality of films that Bollywood produces is currently quite good and this film is one of evidence. <br /> <br /> No Bollywood movie I can remember had such an impact on me - I literally thought about the movie for many hours - admiring the various emotional situations that human beings are testing. <br /> <br /> The movie is based on the great acting of Urmilli Matondkar, as well as some of Manoj Bajpai. Urmilla plays a girl in North India on the background of the partition, and all the problems seem sweet, if you compare them with the problems she is struggling with. <br /> <br /> A movie that you must see. Technically a better Bollywood product, which in my opinion is comparable to the best films from other countries in the world.
