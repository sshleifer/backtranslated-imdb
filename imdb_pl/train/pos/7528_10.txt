If this movie hits you (like us and others, leaving the theater) as disappointingly slim, it may be due to the fact that the subject itself is slightly disappointing. The film faithfully introduces us to Bettie Page, as she probably was: playful, almost innocent from the rural South, whose career as a "pinup queen of the universe" was simply stupid, natural fun for her. Her possible moral repentance, religious conversion and sudden abandonment of naked and slavery modeling are biographically accurate, but difficult to understand, considering how undisturbed she seemed to be due to her livelihoods. <br /> <br /> There are many reasons to see this film, and not less important are the amazing photographs of W. Mott Hopfel III from B & W noir (in the set with old-fashioned cloths and dissolutions), faithful acting from 1950. under the direction of Mary Harron, the perfect performances of some of our most underrated supporting actors (including Chris Bauer, Lili Taylor, Sarah Paulson, Austin Pendleton, Dallas Roberts and Victor Slezak), not to mention the worthy Oscar and the technically difficult performance of Gretchen Mol. <br /> <br /> Madam. Mol performs several nude scenes, most of them in incredible period lingerie and "specialties" costumes (wonderfully collected by the costume designer John A. Dunn), but surprisingly preserves Bettie Page's uncharted pleasure in her lush body. To observe Mrs. Mola as Mrs. Page, aspiring actress, going through gradual fewer "bad" auditions and student scenes, we will see a really beautiful actress fully controlling her craft. <br /> <br /> The script effectively introduces us to the 1950s America, where the sexual exploitation of children, illegal abductions and rapes and legal suppression of brands of pornography, which today seem ridiculously tame, is a reality. New York from the 1950s is invoked with smooth interactions. 50's Miami comes alive in a super saturated 16mm color. Bettie's real side seems to jump, smile and pose in front of us, yet the effect is strangely light, barely lewd and not at all dangerous. <br /> <br /> How strange that the biggest icon of captivity should not be so much and that this technically perfect biographer should have so little sting.
