Five years after the return of the survivors from Tenko and from the double-edged Marion "Well, this is it". <br /> <br /> It's 1950: the time of the reunion. The gang is here: Marion, Bea, Ulrica, Kate, Dorothy, Christina, Dominica and latecomers Maggie and Alice. The story that develops is beautiful: how perfectly written and preserved, and provocative and moving as the original series. <br /> <br /> All questions left at the end of the series are carefully provided here. From the Marion family to Joss's health center, everything changed in five years, and not everything changed for the better. <br /> <br /> A trip to the Dominica plantation brings many shocks and some really extreme tension in the seat. There is a real sense of tragedy and catastrophe, because once again fate takes over and women fight for their lives. Dominika finally shows his true colors and there are moments of drama in the style of "scream on television". <br /> <br /> A lush filming in Singapore and an opportunity to catch up with a group of women who feel like they've become friends. It's such a shame that it really is the end. I could see it again. Perfection.
