JUST CAUSE is a flawed but decent movie that combines strong performances and creative (though extremely predictable) writing. Sean Connery is a crusader who has dropped the death penalty to save an apparently innocent young black man (Blair Underwood) before the final punishment. To fix the situation, Connery goes to the crime scene, where he has to fight not only over time, but with the interjected sheriff (Laurence Fishbourne). Turns, turns and reversals of roles abound - some surprising, others not - as an aging Crusader attempts to unravel the mystery. The culminating ending is a bit absurd, but JUST CAUSE is worth a look on a slow night.
