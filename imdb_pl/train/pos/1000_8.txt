I liked the movie. Some of the action scenes were very interesting, tense and well made. I particularly liked the opening scene in which the pickup truck was located. A very tense action scene that seemed well made. <br /> <br /> Some transition scenes have been filmed in interesting ways, such as time-lapse photography, unusual colors or interesting angles. Also the movie is fun and consists of several parts. I also liked how the bad guy was presented. I would give the film 8 out of 10.
