It's a great movie that shows what our government will do to other countries if we do not like their government. This is not as bad as Reagan and Bush number one in South America, but the United States still has nothing to do with such countries. These films also prove that the American media are releasing government propaganda. That's what Aristide did in Haiti. The reason why this attempt against Chavez failed was elected Chavez with over 90% of the votes. <br /> <br /> This movie is not just a political document, but it would still be a great drama movie, it's amazing that it's real. <br /> <br /> The second reviewer is lying when he says: "Chavez takes over radio waves", private media are constantly promoting anti-Chavez propaganda.
