This movie is really mixed. On the one hand, the story and the concept of the film are really good, tense and have some interesting twists in them. But on the other hand, everything is said very slowly, without style and without commitment. I still think "Just Cause" for an above-average thriller simply because of the great cast. <br /> <br /> Maybe Sean Connery was wrong in his role. I mean, he's not as trustworthy as the main "hero" and father of the young daughter (by the name of the very young Scarlett Johansson) and husband Kate Capshaw. I feel that he was just too old to make the role really credible. However, Sean Connerey is of course a great actor, and this is the only reason why he is still able to film as well as he does. But of course, he has a very solid cast that consists of actors such as Laurence Fishburne, Blair Underwood, Ned Beatty, Hope Lange, Lynne Thigpen and Ed Harris. All the actors are really good, but some of them are very unused at the same time, which is a real shame and also a missed opportunity. Ed Harris is especially great in his role as a psychopathic serial killer. He really cools and behaves perfectly. Usually he does not play these ruthless, bloody roles in movies, so he really surprises with his role in this film. His performance alone is enough reason to watch this movie. However, due to the fact that history is told without much style and too much formula, none of the characters in the movie really work well because it seems too far away. <br /> <br /> It's really a way to tell stories, it kills the whole movie with its great potential. Arne Glimcher directs the film in a small style and sometimes keeps the pace low. For this reason, we, as viewers, never really engage in the story or any of its characters. <br /> <br /> It's really too bad because "Just Cause" has more than enough potential. Great cast and clever story with unexpected twists in which nothing is as it seems. Cast and story is the only reason why this movie is still an above-average thriller, which will probably still appeal to the fan of this genre. However, it is an eternal shame that the film is missing in the story and style story, because otherwise the film could be a real classic in its genre. <br /> <br /> 7/10
