This is probably Karisma at its best, in addition to Zubeidaa. Nana Patekar also gives it everything without even trying. The story is sometimes very good, but at the end it seems to be pulling, especially when Shahrukh appears in the picture. What I really liked was the performances of leads, the delivery of dialogues, and the story of what it was. It could be better directed and edited. The support case was even great, including Karima's mother-in-law, although she had only one luminous moment, it was great to watch her. <br /> <br /> The sets were also quite good. I really did not like the image of a Canadian family, but when they enter India, it's as real as possible. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would like it!
