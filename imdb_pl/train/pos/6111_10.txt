I first came across "My Tutor Friend" accidentally one or two years ago while surfing on TV. I've never watched any Korean movies before, so MTF was really the first Korean movie I ever watched. And what a great surprise! I was completely amused from beginning to end and had a great time. His comic style is completely different than in comic books from Hong Kong (to which I got used to my whole life, and hence also tired), breathing fresh air into my mundane movie. I thought that there are a lot of scenes and tricks in MTF that are quite funny, funny and original. <br /> <br /> I watched MTF a second time a few days ago and watching it once, a surprising / comical effect on me softened. However, this did not affect my opinion about the film in any way. Instead, during this time something else happened - it moved me - a story about how two young, seemingly "enemies" who are completely incompatible, are dropped together and how they gradually solve their differences and start to look after themselves without realizing feelings remind me of the long gone times of high school. For me, Su Wan and Ji Hoon are actually compatible, because they have something pure and real in them, which distinguishes them from people like, say, sassy girl Ji Hoon. <br /> <br /> The film is divided into two separate parts - the first part is about the "fight" between Su Wan and Ji Hoon, and is more violent and faster. After Ji Hoon gets a pass in his last exam and Su Wan dances (according to Ji Hoon), a provocative dance, everything begins to change. The pace slows down and ... Ji Hoon suddenly realizes that he cares more about Su Wan than he could have imagined. The second part concerns the development of their mutual feelings, leading of course to a happy ending, which is accompanied by the last battle with the gang leader. <br /> <br /> One more comment. I find it a bit unbelievable - the fact that a 21-year-old self-proclaimed "bad boy" would feel embarrassed, almost naked before a girl who is abused and loses "cool", is just a bit ... strange. I think it shows that Ji Hoon is just a clean boy and he really is not what he seems. Btw, Kwong San Woo (Ji Hoon) DO she have a sexy body and a perfect figure! ;-) <br /> <br /> MTF is definitely on my list of the 10 most popular films of all time.
