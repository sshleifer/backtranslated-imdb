I took a leaflet for borrowing this movie, but I must say it was very, very good. On all fronts: script, cast, director, photography and high production values, etc. Proves Eva Longoria Parker has his head and shoulders in rom / com over evil actors, such as Kate Hudson and Jennifer Aniston, who mock and call it acting. Who'da thunk it? <br /> <br /> Parker and Isla Fisher are in this class in themselves and should try to keep projects as good as "Over Her Dead Body". Lake Bell is also perfect and I saw her for the first time. And finally, Paul Rudd can shine in a really good movie, not in smaller movies. <br /> <br /> This type of movie never has its obligations in males. Shame. As other IMDb reviewers have noted, there is nothing wrong with this gem - neither hacking nor acting. <br /> <br /> And his image of contemporary L.A. and California generally makes each scene look bright, beautiful, clean and different in every respect. Never before did the movie make L.A. he looked so good. Oh, what a little talent and a lot of care he can do for the movie. <br /> <br /> I will not reveal the conspiracy, but as a longtime and hard-working atheist, I wanted to suspend disbelief and focus on the supernatural theme in order to enjoy perfect entertainment. It reminds me of the very old Topper movies, which were also so nice. <br /> <br /> This movie reveals popular, but otherwise hackneyed movies, such as "Ghost" for mediocre and overly sentimental festivities that they are already known that the public taste is firmly based on the average. However, some of us keep our praise for really worthy. <br /> <br /> If you liked other undiscovered gems like "Into the Night" with Michelle Pfeiffer, Jeff Goldblum and Clu Gulager, "Blind Date" with Bruce Willis and Kim Basinger, "American Dreamer" with JoBeth Williams, "Chances Are" with Robert Downey Jr., Christopher McDonald and Cybil Sheppard, "Making Mr. Right "with John Malkovich etc. You will like. <br /> <br /> A great job around (even if it's hard to believe that a simple guy can pretend to be gay for over five years). But even this feature device does not diminish the film's overall perfection.
