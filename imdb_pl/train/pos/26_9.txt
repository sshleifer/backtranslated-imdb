When I was a child, I watched it many times and I remember that I often whistle the song "Happy cat". All songs are great and really memorable, unlike many musicals for children, in which songs just got stuck for a reason. The scenes and costumes are sumptuous, and the acting is very well done, which is not surprising considering the cast. Christopher Walken is very similar to a cat and does not need stupid makeup or a cat costume to believe he is a cat turned into a human being. And Jason Connery is as sweet as the shy and awkward son of a miller, Corin, who falls in love with the beautiful and daring princess Vera. It's a really fun, nice full-length movie in which, unlike most fairytales, characters have personality. Some of my favorite parts are when Puss makes Corin pretends to be drowning; at the ball, when everyone starts dancing country, because it's "all anger abroad"; when Walken is in the kitchen, he dances on the table (he is also a pretty good dancer!); and when Vera tells Corin all the things she did when she was young, like pretending she was the miller's daughter. I recommend this film to children and parents who love magic and fairy tales. And actually it's a movie that you can watch together because it does not push adults against the wall.
