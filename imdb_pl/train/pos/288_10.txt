This movie was great! I am a teenager, and my friends and I all love the series, so it just shows that these films draw attention to all the old crowds. I recommend it to everyone. My favorite line in this movie is when Logan Bartholomew says "rosy cheeks" when he talks about his daughter. He is such a great actor as Erin Cottrell. They pair so well and have great chemistry! I really hope that they will be able to work together again. They are so attractive people and they are very good actors. In the end, I found movies that are worth watching. Recently, I found it difficult to find films that are good, show good customs and Christian values. But at the same time, these films are not bad.
