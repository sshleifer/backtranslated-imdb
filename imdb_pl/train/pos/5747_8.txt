If you have any heart and compassion for people, this is a difficult movie to watch, at least in the second half. <br /> <br /> It is in this segment where we see that a nice little child is beaten, and then handicapped (mentally handicapped) the man comes out from the deep end after witnessing this violent act against the child. This is not a pleasant material. <br /> <br /> However, this is a good movie, and acting is good too. History will sit with you for a moment. <br /> <br /> "Dominick" is a mentally disabled guy and Tom Hulce plays it. I think this may be the best role of Hulce in history. He is looked after by a medical student, Eugene, played by Ray Liotta, who in the following year became the star of Kevin Costner's "Field Of Dreams". <br /> <br /> Dominick is a good man who reads "Hulk" comics and loves wrestling. He's the type of "slow" guy you can not help but love and take root to live a happy life. When he goes crazy, for a few good reasons and ... well, look at the whole story. It is worth your time, but be prepared for a real emotional roller coaster and perhaps very upset by some of the things you see.
