I believe that I received this movie when I was a young boy. I remembered watching him as a child, but I could never find a movie. I remembered good ol Rageddy Ann, Andy, Babette, Greedy, King Koo Koo. I was looking for high and low for this film and I still had no luck. But one day, when I moved out of my childhood home, I found him. We joined. I'm 17 now. I'm still watching him. All the time properly. This is one of the funniest and most moving movies I have ever seen and enjoyed at the same time. And personally, I think they should do a sequel. Mmm yes, continuation. Now I even wonder about the tattoo of the bird-captain somewhere in my body!
