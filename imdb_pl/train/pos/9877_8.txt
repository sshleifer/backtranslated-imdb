<br /> <br /> The presentation of Lily Mars is one of the genres of films that unfortunately seem to disappear along with the studio system. Ok, now that you know my prejudices, here are some reasons why this movie stands out. <br /> <br /> 1. Although the basic theme - Lily Mars (Judy Garland) goes to New York, becomes a star and wins the heart of his director (Van Heflin), is a quite popular Hollywood story from this period, writers differ a bit more about it than usual. Although Lily makes a big break when the star ends, she is not successful and has to swallow her pride and return to play a smaller role in the show. <br /> <br /> 2. Judy Garland (enough to say!) <br /> <br /> 3. Supporting cast includes some really great performances. Spring Byington as Lily's mother is really wonderful, just like Fay Bainter (the mother of the director - John Thornway (Van Heflin)). An outstanding performance supporting the actress Connie Gilchrist as Frankie, an actress who once became the protector of the theater. <br /> <br /> It's definitely worth watching. One of those movies that are supposed to make you feel better about the world and your dreams.
