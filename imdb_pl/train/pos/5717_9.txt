Omigosh, this is really the scariest movie I've ever seen. To say that I love horror movies, it would be understated, and I saw a heap (considering the limited availability in New Zealand, that's quite a lot), but I never had to sleep with the light on ... until I saw The Grudge. <br /> <br /> Someone may say that it is the rip off of The Ring (both based on Japanese horror movies), both similar (but different) storylines, but Grudge has its own as a scary movie - seeing in the cinema, I even shouted at some point in the movie. <br /> <br /> Acting is great, especially from supportive characters - KaDee Strickland is fantastic and steals the program, she is such an enthusiastic person. Jason Behr is a real hottie, and William Mapother looks like he was having fun. However, while I'm usually a fan of Clea DuVall, it does not seem to be in this movie. Of the supporting characters, she probably has the most depth and history, but it seems that she is not there. As for Sarah Michelle Gellar, well, she remains the same for all her films and roles, right? The spirits were really scary, the music and sound effects were chilling in the veins (especially the noise produced when the character of KaDee Strickland picked up the phone in his apartment), the end was also cool. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it. 9/10
