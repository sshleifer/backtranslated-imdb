Among standard linear action movies, where acting and logic are checked at the door, this movie is at the top of the class. If the person responsible for the casting set the "good" actors in this movie, it would be worse (except for Richard Dawson, who actually acted well if you can call yourself an "actor"). I love that movie! Running man is most likely God's gift for man (okay, maybe only for men). Definitely the most quoted movie of our time, so I will share with you my favorite line: "It's all part of Brenda's rich pattern of life, and you better get used to it." Ahh, more people are called Brenda because of the quotation of this movie than I can imagine.
