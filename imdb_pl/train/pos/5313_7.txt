As I am not a fan of almost any "Desperate Living" post John Waters, I warmed up to "Pecker". After he came out of the underground, Waters produced trash-lite versions of his earlier works ("Cry Baby", "Polyester", Hairspray "), which for die-hard fans looked and tasted like a diluted liqueur." Pecker "who does not try returning early successes is a light, silent, humble commentary on the whims of celebrities and pretentiousness of the art world. Waters knows this topic well because he has exhibited and sold (at ridiculous prices) some of the most amateur pop art ever created that you can not imagine anyone would be able to give away if it was not decorated with Waters' "name". Edward Furlong is okay because "Pecker" and Waters' non-histrionic style is calm about the subject.
