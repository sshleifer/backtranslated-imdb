This is not a bad movie. It's not fun, but it's interesting and <br /> <br /> fun. He has some fun moments. Cher gives a good performance <br /> <br /> in a role that is very much against her true self. Sam her <br /> <br /> performance is worth a look. If this movie appeared <br /> <br /> today, he would not be nominated, but according to standards from the 1980s. <br /> <br /> he was perfect.
