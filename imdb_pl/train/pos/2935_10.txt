Eddie Murphy Delirious is definitely the funniest thing you'll ever see in your life. You can compare it to any movie, and I admit that you will decide that Delirious is the funniest movie ever! This movie takes about 1 hour. 45 minutes. During all that time, I was barely laughing. You will laugh for many hours after you finish, recreating the shock lines over and over again. Eddie Murphy gave so many funny performances in his career (48 hours, Trading Places, Beverly Hills Police, Raw, Coming To America, The Nutty Professor, Shrek, etc.), but this is definitely THE MOST DIFFERENT moment. I've seen this movie so many times and it's fun every time. He never loses advantage. From that day, every great standing game will be emulated with Delirious. ***** and two thumbs up!
