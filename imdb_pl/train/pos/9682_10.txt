I absolutely loved this movie! It was so good! This film tells the parrot, from Paulie's point of view. Paulie is gifted with a little girl Marie as a gift. Paulie helps Marie learn to speak and become the best friends. But when Paulie orders Marie to fly, she falls down and the bird is sent away. Then the adventure begins. Paulie goes through so much to find her way to Marie. This movie is so sweet, funny, moving, sad and not only. When I first watched the movie, I cried. The courage of birds and the desire to find your Marie all this time was so moving. I must say that the ending is so cute and sad, but you will have to watch it to find out how it works. At the end, the caretaker tries to help him after listening to his story. Will she find her long-lost Marie or not? Find out when you watch this sweet heart-warming movie. It will touch your heart.
