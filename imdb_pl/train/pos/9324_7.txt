I have read some reviews and I am a bit sad that many stories seem transparent. It's easy to do because it's not a book, it's a movie, and there's only so much you can do in a movie - in the US or Canada - or anywhere. <br /> <br /> Colm Feore does, at least to regain "F @ g-Hag" like me, a great job that involves not only playing a gay "friendly neighborhood" but also suffering from illness. I mean, a man can not really get any more pale! Though you may never know it from the belt near ... um, the end. <br /> <br /> If you need a decrepit, there are a few Sking movies that you might like. <br /> <br /> Being a daughter Recovering Alchoholic, brother of drug (David Cubitt) was a trick to me. I'll give him credit, he grew up quickly and believe me it's good. And, as an aspiring writer, mine, I can dig up many of his insights and reviews. But I'm more proud than poetic. <br /> <br /> I can easily like it, but I liked it. A nice story quite well connected - by Canadians, a surprise quelle. I just stepped into the "movie of the week" line, longing for not being so attracted, GREAT appreciated. And it was cleverly presented.
