I think it has the potential to be the best Star Trek series, I say POTENTIAL ... we all know that there is a chance that they will throw the ball and run out of ideas ... BUT I'M HOPING! For those who have not seen him ... SEE THIS! Without this annoying "PRIME DIRECTIVE" hovering over their heads every time they encounter races, it can be fun ... and Scott Bakula was without a doubt a GREAT CHOICE for the captain, and Vulcan Babe is also hot (check the decontamination scene) I gave it FULL 10 ... rejects ALL other series openers. I hope it will last longer than 7 years ...
