Here is the perfect double bill by Barbara Stanwyck on one disc. The first movie - and believe me, that it is the smaller of two - is "To Please A Lady" MGM (1950), in which he collaborates with Clark Gable. This is primarily a stellar vehicle from Gable, which as usual dominates in the film thanks to its presence on the screen. This is where the racing macho driver plays, who gets the bad press of the feminist reporter Stanwyck and the sex struggle begins. Of course, after some time they finally reach each other, and all this becomes predictable and pleasant. A little bit of movement, but Gable and Stanwyck - two icons of the Golden Age - make it possible to watch it! <br /> <br /> But the real meat on this DVD is a second feature - a wonderful and quite unknown little JEOPARDS thriller. Produced by MGM in 1953, this is a great little jewel of a film that has not dated an iota! Here, Stanwyck plays the wife of Barry Sullivan and the mother of their young son Lee Aaker on vacation on a deserted and distant Mexican beach, when suddenly there is a tragedy. Destroyed wooden pier collapses into a Sullivan trap under a heavy pylon and guess what? Yes, the wave is coming. Without seeing the soul and not being able to free him, Stanwyck sets off on a car in search of help. After traveling a certain distance, the only help he can get comes from an unscrupulous escaped convict (Ralph Meeker) who - in return for help - wants something more than money or a change of clothes ("I will do everything to save my husband"). Is she or not? <br /> <br /> Meeker is running away with a photo! It turns into a pretty genius performance! After entering the movie you simply can not take your eyes off him! The actor in Brando's smoldering style, surprisingly never did much of his career in movies. Although he gave excellent performances as a distasteful, disgraced cavalry officer in the prominent western Mann / Stewart "Naked Spur" (1953) and as one of the convicted sacrificial French soldiers in WW1's powerful drama Stanley Kubrick The only real pretext for fame was Mike Hammer in "Kiss Me Deadly" by Mickey Spillane in 1955. His appearance in "Jeopardy" should have worked miracles for him, but he had such a career in films. He died in 1988. <br /> <br /> Because of this edition of Jeopardy, he can proudly take his rightful place as a classic noir. An unforgettable, tight and thrilling thriller thanks to outstanding performances, the cohesive director John Sturges, the acute Monochrome Cinema of Victor Milner and the atmospheric score of Dimitri Tiomkina. Addons are not great shakes, except for the Jeopardy radio version and trailers for both films. <br /> <br /> This record is also part of a box set by Barbara Stanwyck on the occasion of her century. It is hard to believe that this woman will be over 100 years old if she is still around! <br /> <br /> JEOPARDS - winner of MGM!
