A wonderful and unforgettable, stunningly atmospheric and brilliantly preserved by everyone. <br /> <br /> I really can not understand what kind of people are watching this masterpiece and give an advantage of 8 votes (and nine!) <br /> <br /> This, along with Grapes of Wrath, is the biggest movie of John Ford . I would say that Long Voyage Home is next in line, though quite backward. <br /> <br /> Mark: 10. It deserves to be 12.
