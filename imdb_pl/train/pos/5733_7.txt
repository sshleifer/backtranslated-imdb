I will tilt a bit of weight and say that I liked it. However, this cartoon really will appeal only to those who have very absurd tendencies. It is definitely something that most people will not get, as it is an absurd. <br /> <br /> the animation is terrible, but yes, that's it. The main character is vulgar, brutal and stupid. there are no advantages. his wife yells and cries, apparently barely capable of basic communication skills. most of these stories have absolutely no point. <br /> <br /> but again it's about;) <br /> <br /> If you have improprieties, bad language and complete randomness is your business, you will love it. <br /> <br /> It is really short, so I would probably buy instead of buying.
