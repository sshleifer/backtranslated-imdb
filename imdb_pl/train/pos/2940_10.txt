When I first came across Delirious, I heard it only. I listened to the entire comedy performance and never laughed so much in my life. Eddie's ability to paint funny images in our minds and make great imitations is enchanting. When I finally saw him doing this act, I had to have it. Eddie Murphy's performance on Delirious shows his genius! Because it is the new millennium, its activities in 1983 are as fun today as it was then. My parents loved it as teenagers, and I (eighteen years old) love it too. From that point on, I had to watch other Murphy movies, such as Coming To America and Harlem Nights. There will not be another comedian like Eddie.
