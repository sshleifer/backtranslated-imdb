Holly raises the issue of child sexuality, which is spreading around the world (about 2 million children are sold each year) and does it with sensitivity and without manipulation - a high order that the Priority Films team is doing with great success. American actor Ron Livington appears in the film next to the novice Thuy Nguyen, a Vietnamese actress who plays Holly and together bring to the screen what is common to people in the famous K11 Redlight neighborhood in Cambodia. Although it touches on a heavy subject, the movie sticks to moments of laughter and hope when we get to know the protagonists up close, maintaining that the two-hour movie is too difficult to watch. I am glad that such a movie draws the world's attention to this problem. Child prostitution must be stopped and this is a very good first step. It's GREAT and the movie EVERYONE needs to see.
