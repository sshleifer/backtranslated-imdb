WOW! What - movie - !!!!!!!!!!! I'm not a fan of contemporary Italian directors. Usually, I do not like dramas. I'm not a fan of Will Smith, even thinking he's a very good actor ...... but this movie! It's such a great movie with such an original script and such a good direction and so well acting ... wow ... is stunning. This movie caught my attention minute by minute, and I did not even like "Chasing the Happiness" (maybe because I did not like the acting of son Will, who is a very bad actor, while children seem to be all born actors, I saw also yesterday evening on "the day the earth stood still" and confirmed my feeling that Jaden can not work). I do not want to write spoilers, so I'm not talking about history, but I can say that this movie is about love, death and other feelings that I do not like watching in movies ... but this movie is such a great movie. If you have a minimum heart, you will not regret watching it
