I have not seen this movie! At least not entirely. I saw some memorable clips that made me choke to see it all. One sequence remains in my memory to this day. A spaceship (very convincing) orbits around the dark side of the moon. The remote control releases the flash device to photograph the underlying surface. The moon is flashing in visibility. . . . and for a few seconds. Parallel lines, squares, can it be ... then the light fades, and a short flash ... what ... has gone away and it is time for the space ship to return to Earth. Great. I also saw other clips, but I LOVE to get a full movie.
