What a fascinating movie. Even if it was not based on real life, Forbidden Lies was a fascinating portrait of a cheater in her element. And it is the students of film psychology who could learn to get to know compulsive liars. <br /> <br /> The author of "Forbidden Love", Norma, was revealed as a media fraud, but this move really gives her broad possibilities to clear her name. <br /> <br /> But the twists and turns of the author who carries the documents are amazing. What a patient woman! I loved this movie. I did not read the book, but I just heard good reviews and went to see her on a boring rainy afternoon. The journey that this film leads is clever, interesting and totally addictive.
