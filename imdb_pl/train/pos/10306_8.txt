As someone who lives near Buffalo, New York, this movie scored points before I even saw it, because history is based here. There are even some fragments with real TV anchors from Buffalo ... and, once, they do not knock this area down. Alleluia! <br /> <br /> In theological terms, puh-leeze !!! God still has to look and think like people ... and, of course, be a bit on the liberal side. It's a light comedy that should not win any prizes, but it's still fun and it's a nice way to kill 102 minutes. <br /> <br /> There are a few laugh-loud comedy scenes and, hopefully, the audience - from Christians to atheists - something came out of it, except for a few laughs, such as what prayer really belongs to. Recognition for writers that they at least improved theology and gave a good message. <br /> <br /> In general, it's a good movie that should offend very few.
