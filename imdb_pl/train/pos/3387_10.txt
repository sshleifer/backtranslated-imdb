A really amazing movie, the concept as a possible prophetic vision of the future is terrifying. A world of extremely overpopulated, unbearable heat caused by a damaged ozone layer and all our natural resources. In this horrible, degenerate society, we have a great Charlton Heston as a nice film noirish detective trying to probe the truth behind the murder, in contrast to the legend of the film noir of Edward G Robinson who performs a great final performance. One of the pictures that will always remain with me in this film are the masses of people who populate the stairwells and the way Thorne (Heston) has to jump through them every time he uses them. <br /> <br /> The use of music in the film is also worth attention, although it does not contain any score in the usual sense, the theme is good, and further fragments of music, which here in Simonson's apartment, and especially Beethoven's works in the euthanasia clinic, they are outstanding atmospheric.
