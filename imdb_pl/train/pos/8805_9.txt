Patchwork around 911. 11 stories of 11 directors from 11 countries are sometimes humorous, sometimes boring (for example the first one), sometimes the Americans are told "we had more deaths than you, and you supported murderers", sometimes really strange (but very symbolic and interesting). I really liked Claude Lelouch (a personal concert of a couple in New York, showing that our everyday "problems" are not important), Shoei Imamura (weird, definitely against war in general) and Idrissa Ouedraogo (funny, typical African optimism in spite of terrible everyday misery ) and Youssef Chahine (Egyptian intellectual, peaceful, having moral difficulties in accepting American policy towards Arab countries) I am really happy that many Americans liked this film. It shows that we (or they? I'm still Belgian, but I've lived in Texas for 12 years) are still interested in other cultures and I can question the past and current actions of our government, as we should in a democracy.
