Harman and Isings "Old Mill Pond" is a real masterpiece of the art of animation. The excellent skills and craftsmanship that characterize this duo are not more visible than in this cartoon. It is a pity that so many people see only an insult in what is and always had to be, a light entertainment that in no way tried to denigrate black people. If at all it is a tribute to the contagious humor and musicality of the black race. For many years I have not been able to see this sweetness because the "race commissioners" in England have found it too offensive to show it in multiracial Britain. If anyone knows where I can get a copy, I'd love to see this masterpiece again. I think that those who routinely look for messages and intentions that were never intended in those cartoons that are sixty years old should try to brighten up and remember that the world is a completely different place today, but that does not mean that everyone has the right censor what you can see from the past.
