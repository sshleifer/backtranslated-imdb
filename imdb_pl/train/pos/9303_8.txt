While watching this video, you should note that this is not a normal movie. There is no real story, only characters, a bunch of gangster characters that blend in perfect harmony. Dialogue is wonderful, you can just lie down and listen. The film stands out because it is difficult to find the right way to describe it. <br /> <br /> This is why user comments for this video are mixed up. <br /> <br /> I go for one I love this movie and recommend it to everyone who loves one-liners and things that are different from "normal". You really can not put your finger on what is so wonderful about it that it's just a comic world in which gangsters rule. A place of love and danger. A movie that you can see more than once.
