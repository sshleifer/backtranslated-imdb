This film is about development. People are growing and people are disappearing, people are surprised and people are disappointing. It has everything and more. There is hope, frustration, injustice, justice, love and hatred. This is a truly classic drama that has fantastic performances from the entire cast, especially Whoopi Goldberg in her debut role. <br /> <br /> This movie made me feel very human and proud of it. be obligatory every Saturday in all prisons in the world - it affects your compassion. Rating: 10 of 10. <br /> <br /> PS: I admit: I threw a tear of joy during the last scene.
