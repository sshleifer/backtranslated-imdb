Unfortunately it is not yet available on DVD, but it's worth continuing on TCM or VHS. The secretary thinks that her boss is wrongly accused of murder and boldly accepts many dangerous characters, trying to determine the truth. A movie with many twists and dark streets that I will not mention! The sequence of the jazz band, in which our heroine is looking for information about the killer, is one of the most erotic scenes in Hollywood history, although it has a very low budget and was made during World War II in black and white. Despite the low budget - Long Island looks a bit hilly - it is a film with an original style and unique vision. Ella Raines was a wonderful actress discovered by Howard Hawks, who knew a lot about these matters by casting feistiest women - Joanne Dru, Hepburn, Angie Dickinson, Lauren Bacall, and Ann Sheridan - from their time. Robert Siodmak was one of several German, Hungarian and Czech filmmakers - Sirk, Wilder, Zinnemann, Lubitsch, Curtiz, Lang, etc. - who migrated to Hollywood and brought with them a very original fresh vision. Unfortunately, Ella Raines never received such a large part and eventually found herself in badly produced westerns.
