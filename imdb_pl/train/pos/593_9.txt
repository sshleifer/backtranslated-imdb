This game show lasted only one season, but it was intriguing to the public because it required visual skills and a reliable hand. One false move would disqualify a player from winning, although it was clear that the player knew the correct answer. It was always exciting when the player started drawing, wondering whether they would finish the drawing or not be discharged; allowing the other player to easily win the competition. It was a laid back show, but it was clear that the players were often embarrassed by a stupid mistake made unintentionally. The rarely seen game show has not survived one season. Only an experienced game addict will remember this concert because it turned out to be quite unpopular, even though game shows were returning to the TV screen after the game scandals from the 1950s. But it was a unique idea for a game show and one that has never been seen before.
