May 2004, Wonderland is quite new in the UK. A brilliant movie about a brutal true story. If you know LA from the early 80's, you will appreciate how well it is captured. The use of elements that make up its grainy film style is original, enhancing the impression and bringing the viewer closer to the real presence. The use of a disjoint time line in the style of "Pulp Fiction" allows us to examine the uncertainty about what really happened, while the direction and performances of cast cast attention, especially Val Kilmer as John Holmes; Oscar, I would definitely give them away.
