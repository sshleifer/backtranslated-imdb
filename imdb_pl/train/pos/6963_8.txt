A big surprise, probably because I expected it to suck. Opinions were quite disrespectful, although everyone seemed to agree that the concept was gold: the man finds out that his new girlfriend is a super hero, and discovers that when he wants to break up with her, she is a kind of psycho. I still expected it to fall apart, but it never really happened. Sure, it's not as amazing as it might seem, and decides to be short if it's better to expand the movie universe. But I can not blame it. Uma Thurman is great as a bipolar superhero, G-Girl. And after a few years of disliking him, I discovered that Luke Wilson can be absolutely perfect when he is staffed at the club. He gave two of the best comic shows in 2006 (the second in a fairly unreleased Idiocracy). I absolutely broke down on his face when he and Thurman had sex for the first time. This is one of the funniest sex scenes. My only real complaint is that they make the G-Girl a bit too psycho, like almost unbelievably. Maybe with some background I could accept it better. However, I can forgive his faults because I really enjoyed myself. Certainly underestimated.
