It's a great movie. I love it more every time I watch. Most comedies can get pretty bad because you know all the gags, but mysterious men have so much honesty in writing and make-up that they look back - like Ben Stiller tears in the limo hood ornament, or Hank Azaria says goodbye Louise Lasser or Geoffrey Rush flashes his Fuhrer's choreography, or Tom Waits mumbles while watching the news, or Janeane Garofalo refuses to kiss Paul Reubens - it's a pleasure. It's a perfect team. The story develops directly and consistently, the sequences of actions are creative and not very dominant, and all settings are profitable until the end. Seriously, if you've seen it and it's been a while, look again and if you have not done it yet, start. You can not watch it until you see it for the first time. (Wes Studi, William H. Macy, tryouts scene, too many good things!)
