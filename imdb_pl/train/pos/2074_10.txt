Another great channel 4 long before the time. Fascinating acting of Phil Davis and the rest of the cast. Sexy, intelligent and funny. I remember watching it, and even then, asking about it, nobody heard about it. But trying to find someone who can remember is even harder. Perhaps Channel 4 does not do well enough in the drums of enthusiasm. Either that or public opinion is too interested in big-mouth vomit, which is Big Brother. I suspect the other one. Downloading Garth Merengi's Dark Place prompted Channel 4 to release a DVD of this series. Let's hope it's the same with North Square.
