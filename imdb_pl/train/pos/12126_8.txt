In this film from 1934, Bette Davis performs in a cool playful performance of Mildred Rogers. The film seems to be dated to 2003. It is undoubtedly worth seeing for film fans and fans of Bette Davis, but may not have such a big appeal to the average film observer. This was surprising to me when I saw young Mrs. Davis look in this movement. The actors turn to performances that are essentially auditory and the story is meaningful and interesting. Leslie Howard is well-staffed as Philip Carey, a medical student at the club. It is a film with a strong message about who we choose and why. "Of Human Bondage" did not have a strong influence on me mentally or emotionally. After watching the movie, I felt a bit indifferent and separated from the film. I have an intuition that this may be the director's reaction. You will be the judge! <br /> <br />
