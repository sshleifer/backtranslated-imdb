Undying is a very good game that introduces several new elements in a tired first-person species. It tells the story of Patrick Galloway, an occult expert and a powerful warrior who was summoned by a friend to his estate in Ireland to study a strange fantasy. The game takes place in Ireland after the First World War, so do not expect to find weapons, such as carabiners or rocket launchers. All weapons in the game can be considered antiques, but the real fun in the game are her spells and the system on which our hero is two-handed, so he can use both hands simultaneously: he casts spells with his right hand and uses the weapon on the left. So you can shoot and cast spells at the same time, which, as you understand, is very fun and also unique to this game! The graphics are great and can work very well with the average power of P.C .. The level design is also nice and climatic. Mainly the game revolves around the possessions of the Alliance and possessions, but there are many other places that are waiting to be discovered as you progress. Thanks to Clyve Barker's talent, the game has a great story and story (something very rare in the first-person shooter) and I said before the wonderful and very scary atmosphere that the voice game is also good, but not perfect. But the game has two main disadvantages. First of all, it's quite linear, so when your mission speaks, for example, go to this room, all the doors in the house will be blocked except those that lead to your mission room, which can save time, but limits your freedom of exploration. Secondly, the fact that all weapons are antiques can not be liked by most fps players who are accustomed to advanced weapons. When it comes to difficulty, the game is very well balanced. Most of them are moderately difficult, but sometimes it becomes more difficult, but not frustratingly difficult. Overall, immortality is a great game. Definitely one of the best fps.
