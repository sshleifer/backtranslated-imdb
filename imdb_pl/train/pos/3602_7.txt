Although the story of a restless kid who turns to boxing for self-respect and anger management is nothing new, history is crowned here when the heroine is a girl, not a boy. <br /> <br /> Diana has problems at school. It simply can not stop fighting. At home, her father constantly dispels her. Her brother trains boxing at the gym and one day when he picks him up, he decides he wants to train too. <br /> <br /> It would be easy to call this movie "Rocky with girls". But that's not what it's about. The story largely benefits from the fact that the main character is a girl, not a boy. This way you can solve more problems at once. First, the problem with her not accepting because she is not a girl's girlfriend, and then when she comes to the boxing gym, because she is a girl at all. It is also a story about how the goal can change someone's life. How positive things can develop you. I do not want it to sound pretentious, because the film is not pretentious at all, but what I say is true. <br /> <br /> Also Michelle Rodriguez is very good at the forefront. It is a pity that she is now stuck in the "hard girl" typing, because it's not really her role in Girlfight. Sure, she is a boxer woman, but rather sensitive moments that really blind her. <br /> <br /> So maybe it's basically your average story of weaker people with a surprise, but Rodriguez is raising it above the crowd's performance. I rate it 7/10.
