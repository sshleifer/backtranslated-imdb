Bizarre, triple, forgetting history and a low-budget science-fiction couple about the Williams family living in the desert of California. They become witnesses of a series of events that intensify in their level of alienation; apparently they have been caught in a time-space warp in which past, present and future collide. <br /> <br /> This is an excuse for a parade of fun special effects - a permanent show of light and sound, creatures similar to dinosaurs that have each other, a friendly and tiny ET who charms granddaughter and so on. This picture shows some imagination if nothing else. <br /> <br /> Very nice music by Richard Banda, engaging special effects, working, among others, from David Allen, Randall William Cook and Peter Kuran, and, importantly, a nice family are key assets. Generates a sense of childlike amazement; it may be that it is more fun for children (or children in many of us) who are able to discuss defects in the narrative or presentation. <br /> <br /> It was hard to resist; This is a short and sweet (80 minutes) diversion and a decent loan for director John "Buda" Cardos (known as "Kingdom of the Spiders") and executive producer Charles Banda. <br /> <br /> 7/10
