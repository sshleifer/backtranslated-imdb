If you loved Long Way Round, you'll enjoy it almost the same. It is educational, fun, interesting and tense. Charley shares the screen with two interesting teammates, two tired mechanics, two excellent cameramen and too much Russ. Ewan appears a few times, but Charley does it himself. It is funny, addictive and still a puddle of stress and doubt. Great things! <br /> <br /> The series ends with 7 sections. Like LWR, preparation is almost as interesting as the race. Although they cover the secrets of the race well, there may be a bit more explanation about trucks and cars that are only mentioned and rarely even seen the races. However, this is a motorcycle movie and everyone on two wheels will love it. <br /> <br /> The series contains a stunning photo and several interviews with people's mouths. Yikes. There is another extremely catchy theme song like LWR, but this one is not as good as Stereophonics. <br /> <br /> If you live in the US, God knows when it will be released, so buy it on Amazon.uk to watch it on your computer like me. Oh, and be ready to buy another motorcycle.
