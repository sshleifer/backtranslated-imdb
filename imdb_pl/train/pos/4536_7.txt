Written by a writer who wrote a great series of Murder Rooms, describing the adventures of ACD with doctor Josep Bell, I could not wait for it and I was not disappointed. It was a fairly slow movement, with a heavy emphasis on Doyle's frustration for Sherlock Holmes, which was very accurate and perfectly presented. It was an interesting study of the characters and very well done (on digital video, unusual for art from the era). The actress was excellent all the time, especially Tim McInnery and Brian Cox, although the actor who played the ACD, whose name I do not remember, did not impress me. Excellent character study, which has more or less the same number of twists as any normal Sherlock Holmes case. See it if you have a chance
