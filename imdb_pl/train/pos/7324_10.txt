My favorite horror movie. From the long first tracking shot to the finale of the story, it is Carpenter's masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Halloween night of 1963, little Michael Meyers murders his older sister. Before Christmas, 1978, Michael escapes from Smith's Grove sanatorium. Halloween night, Michael returned home to kill again. <br /> <br /> The story is completely simple, Michael sneaks up and kills the guardians. No bells and no whistles, just basics. It is almost a terrifying atmosphere of Carpenter's horror, which generates tension. Like any great horror, events are telegraphy well in advance, but they still seem to be random, never allowing the audience to guess the movie. <br /> <br /> Dark lighting, long stability - photos from cameras and (most importantly) this damned amazing music creates the most claustrophobic and uncomfortable scenes that I have not seen in the movie yet. There are a number of bodies, but compared to the mass of cuts, this is quite small. This and most of the murders are almost bloodless. Fear is not in death, but in ignorance. <br /> <br /> Acting is good. PJ Soles provides many limited-humor films (and one of the best deaths), Nancy Loomis returns in decent performance, and then is young (then) Jamie Leigh-Curtis. Her performance at first glance seems shy and unwavering, but you quickly realize that she is perfect for a character who is shy and self-confident and is not prepared for what she is dealing with. And of course Donald Pleasence is perfectly planted as determined (perhaps a little unstable) Dr. Sam Loomis. Rest in peace, Lord, contentment. <br /> <br /> If the movie has a harmful defect, it would be the passage of time. Since the premiere of this film many years ago, almost countless clones, copies, rip-offs and imitators have appeared and stole (usually badly) the best films until almost everything became known. In combination with changes in audience expectations and appetites, many of the raw power of the movies is diluted. To truly appreciate these days, it must be perceived as something special. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I do not have a reservation with the recommendation of this film to anyone looking for a good, scary time. The highest wishes. <br /> <br /> 10/10
