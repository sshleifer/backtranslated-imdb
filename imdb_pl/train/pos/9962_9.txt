I was a little scared watching this movie because of its prices. But living in Italy, such titles have never met and I love so much that I decided to try. And how I was surprised! This story is different from other dance movies that I've seen recently, with a deeper meaning than just "winning." It is moving, well-written and well-targeted. Raya is a very strong character, I love the fact that she never doubts herself, is so mature and focused, and CONSCIOUS her TALENT (and what Rutina Wesley's talent is, my jaw dropped in the final dance scene). The way in which he realizes his dream and does not allow anything to stop her is truly inspiring. In addition, the fact that it is not a typical super hot rod (see Jessica Alba, Brian Evigan, Jenna Dewan, Zoe Seldana ...) makes it really attractive and true. Seriously, why is this film rated so low? You can understand between the first 5 minutes that it is a good job. Really good. I cried even at the end of the movie. And dance procedures are simply sick.
