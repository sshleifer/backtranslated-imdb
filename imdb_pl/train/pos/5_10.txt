I came in the middle of the movie, so I had no idea about any credit, or even about its title, until I visited it here, where I see that I received a mixed reception from commentators. I am positive about this film, but one really caught my attention when I watched: a beautiful and sensitive result written in the style of Coplandesque Americana. My surprise was great when I discovered that the score was written by John Williams himself. It is true that he wrote sensitive and poignant scores, such as the Schindler's List, but he usually associates his name with such bombastic events as Star Wars. But in my opinion, what Williams wrote for this movie exceeds everything I've heard about his sensitivity, sensitivity and beauty, fully in line with the delicate and charming story of the film. And another of his latest results, Catch Me and You Can, shows even more wit and sophistication. As for Stanley and Iris, I like educational films like How Green is my valley and Konrack, the one with John Voigt and his young Afro-American charges in South Carolina, and Danny deVito's Renaissance man, etc. They tell the necessary intellectual story of spiritual awakening, a story that often can not be said. This one is a great addition to this genre.
