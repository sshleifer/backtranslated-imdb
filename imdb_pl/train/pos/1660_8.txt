I'm a fan of ART, I like everything about art, I like paintings, sculptures etc. This movie shows it, so I like it very much, it shows how a woman wants to paint something about art, especially nude bodies, but she can not do it because of her raw family (father), at the beginning of the film she was nude, but she wanted a man for her paintings, but her family did not allow her to paint naked men, because it is contrary to the moral. Nevertheless, Artemisia could paint her boyfriend and art teacher completely naked. He falls in love with his art teacher and it seems that the art teacher is absolutely in love with her, so at the end he sacrifices his freedom to her, lying. He said he raped her, but that's not true. Artemisia fell in love with him, but if she says she will suffer a lot, because in the process in which Artemisia, her father and art teacher were, someone hurts her artistic hands to tell the truth. I think it's a great film about ART and artistic love. It's worth watching. Valentina Cervi is great as Artemisia, she works very well, I also like her performance in "Portrait of a lady" as Pansy Osmond. 8.5 / 10
