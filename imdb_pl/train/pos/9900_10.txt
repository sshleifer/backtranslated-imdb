it's these movies that make you want you never pick a nerd growing up in school. If you liked this movie, I would suggest that you look at Valentine. I just found out today that the guy who played Marty (Simon) killed himself a little after the movie premiere, which is a shame because he did a good job. I wonder if it's because of the role he played in the movie. It starts when Carol brings him to the toilet to act like they're supposed to do it. When he changed in showers, popular friends Carols sneaked into the bathroom and prepared everything, a camera, electricity, a pole. When Marty opened the curtain with his back, he realized he had been cheated. He tries to cover the shower, but the children open it, grabs Marty and starts getting nasty to him when the camera is rolling. They lifted him up, dipped his head in his toliet when he was rinsed, and electrified him (lightly). When the children are in custody, donated by the trainer, two boys give Marty a pond that will make him quit. Skip breaks one of the glass windows in the gym with a brick so that the teacher will forgive him. As Marty vomits in the bathroom, Skip sneaks into the Science Lab and mixes some things that look like cocaine, but they are not sure what it was. The laboratory blew it up. Five years later, the children who tormented him on that day received invitations for a 5-year school meeting at an old school that was burnt that day, broke out. One by one, people die. I do not understand how drowned the girl who drowned. She could go back upstairs after Marta left. She almost got off the first time.
