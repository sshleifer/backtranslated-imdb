I can not begin to describe how amazing this movie is. Suffice it to say that every time I'm depressed, about how unjust things are or are futile, it's a movie I hire to put me in the right mood. Background music makes you aware of the ease of existence and how simplicity ensures the greatest happiness. The Indian girl who sings is just one example of a character in this movie that does not try, and as a result is happy. Persifina, a launderer at Ruby's (Ashley Judd) is another person - eyes and a smile can make the day the hardest. I watch this movie and dream about better days or having a good conversation with friends and I realize that being alone - Ruby is alone quite often - is not the same as being alone. Recommended for anyone who likes a thoughtful break in the film.
