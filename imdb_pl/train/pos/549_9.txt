It's 1896. Jeff Webster (James Stewart) does not like people. He has only one friend, and he is Ben Tatum (Walter Brennan), an old sympathetic man. They run a herd of cattle with them. the key to wealth. In Skagway, they get in trouble when Sheriff Gannon (John McIntire) takes cattle. Now Jeff has to get him back and cross the Canadian border to Dawson. Now they have a group of other people with them, like the ladies of Ronda Castle (Ruth Roman) and Renee Vallon (Corinne Calvet). Two men enter the golden industry. The fourth collaboration of Anthony Mann and James Stewart, The Far Country (1954), is a really good western. The acting work is outstanding. Walter Brennan is a great helper for Stewart. Ruth Roman is brilliant and delightful Corinne Calvet. Jay C. Flippen is very good as Dawson Marshal Rube Morris. The great Jack Elam and Kathleen Freeman are seen in smaller roles. It's fantastic to watch Jimmy Stewart defeat al. I'm in trouble on his way. There is only a man and his rifle. But he is also defenseless.
