WARNING!!! TONS MARTWYCH GIVEAWAYS !!! DO NOT READ IF YOU DO NOT SEE THIS SERIES! OR YOU CAN, whatever. <br /> <br /> This is a few words to describe a movie that claims to be the last and goes out with another; Liars, codes, maybe even words that can not be spoken. But when Elm Street 6: Freddy's Dead shows everyone who thought that the show would get old, and wanted to stop seeing it, or people who wanted their hero (or Villian) to just stop at his last breath, this movie was this. <br /> <br /> This movie begins with the parody of the Wizard of Oz, and then you see a child named John Doe who is the last child in Springwood, Ohio, leaves and leaves Freddy's territory. A woman who lives in a hospital / place to take children off her feet, meets this boy, and at the same time dreams of a man, a water tower and a promise of mystery floating in her mind, returns to Springwood to discover this terrifying vision and soon learns that that he's Freddy's kid, and we'll soon find out that Freddy can leave Springwood if his daughter can be his host. And then there is fear. This movie seems to get to the heart of everything you wanted to know. <br /> <br /> This movie has a lot of humor and cameos such as Rosanne Barr and Tom Arnold, Alice Cooper, Johnny Depp and a very young Breckin Meyer playing a teenage stoner who sees the psychadelic vision of flowers and "In-a-gadda -da-vida "Iron Butterfly, and then stuck in the parody of super Mario. This movie will either make you hate this movie or, like Krueger, even more. Best of the best.
