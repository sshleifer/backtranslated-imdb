Expecting that we will see another Nunsploitation movie with a malicious mother supervisor abusing and torturing her charges, Flavia turned out to be MUCH more than I expected. <br /> <br /> Actually, it has a feminist plot, although I do not think such a term existed in the era in which the film is set. It certainly was not practiced. Women (and Jews and poor people) are very oppressed and locked up in dark places in society. Throughout history, Sister Flavia (Florinda Bolkan) is a witness to the tyranny of her time, until she simply can no longer sit and actually do something about it, though with catastrophic consequences. <br /> <br /> Pre-financing Flavia has a young sequence near the battlefield. He sees a wounded "evil" Muslim soldier (one of the few still alive) and tries to help him. Before it is possible, her hateful father cut the soldier and waved her head in her face (great dynamics of the family, eh?). Then her father forces her to join the monastery, where she witnesses even greater injustice. Although the scenes are associated with violence, violence and nuns, I would consider it more a historical drama than Nunsploitation. <br /> <br /> Indeed, there are many ingredients for a trashy exploitation track, but acting, working with a camera, plot and music are all too good to keep them at this level. Most of the "monastic" films that I have seen usually have the basic idea: A good girl somehow ends up in a monastery, where the Mother Superior is the highest bitch who likes to whip people and / or make her life a hell. br /> <br /> Flavia spends most of the first part of her film passively questioning all the cruelty that is going on around her. A significant part of her passivity is forgotten when she meets a strong soul (but a bit bizarre - she likes to pee outside like me, but it is much easier for men) Sister Agatha. When a group of Muslims attacks their abbey, Flavia and Agatha do not cower in fear like other nuns. Their attackers in fact act as liberators (cruelty and slavery of the abbey). In fact, he is a Christian, not a Muslim invader who is passionate about the beloved Sister Agata. <br /> <br /> Agatha's death sends Flavia to her violent crusade against those who have oppressed her ... Her father treats her like dirt. Her Muslim lover leaves her at a very bad time. I do not want to reveal too much of the story, but be prepared for shock, devastation and sadness at the end. It's a great movie, so do not be discouraged by its (undeserved) reputation as a trash epic. Plus, how on earth could the film with Florinda Bolkan and Claudio Cassinelli fail? I do not know other works of Maria Casares, but Sister Agatha is a damned character. <br /> <br /> I have read many great reviews of Synapse (USA), but I love my German X- Rated copy of iconic DVD. It's not anamorphic / 16: 9, but in reality it has a bit more information about the image on all edges than Synapse. <br /> <br /> There are also many great, wise or funny lines of dialogue (many from Sister Agata) <br /> <br /> "Why is God a man? Father, Son and Holy Spirit? -Flavia <br /> <br /> "These men are afraid - look at them, sister- I'm afraid their power will be taken away from them!" - Sr. Agatha (concerning Christians fleeing after the arrival of Muslims) <br /> <br /> "Woman, where are you going? Muslims can not do anything to you that Christians did not do! Ha Ha Ha! "-Sr. Agatha (to a group of fleeing Christian women) <br /> <br /> "Lord bless these Muslims - for putting fear in these pompous Christians." -Flavia <br /> <br /> "Is it just a Muslim's view to make your underwear?" -Sr. Agatha <br /> <br /> Final message: "Flavia Gaetani, not yet a Muslim - she is no longer a Christian - has been punished as a fugitive nun. in what is still remembered today as MARTYRDOM OF THE 800 AT OTRANTO "
