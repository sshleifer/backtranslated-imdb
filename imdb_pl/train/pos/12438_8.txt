The film was a long-awaited release, which was somewhat disappointing because of the expectations I prepared. Looking at this again, I must admit that it is quite OK. First of all, it is true to the original story (of course not entirely) and as such aims to preserve the right to the film. The story of modesty as a child is shown and is very faithful to the original. Acting is probably not the best, and the plot is a bit thin, but when you compare it to Vitti, the movie is much better just because it does not try to be a musical. Generally, I would recommend it only to fans of Modesta Blaise or to someone who caught it on the TV.
