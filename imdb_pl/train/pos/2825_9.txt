This movie was a big surprise. Honestly, I did not expect much. The first Hollywood movie of Greta Garbo? So what? Probably something rough and with the usual exaggerated waving of arms and face bending, which often show low-quality, low-quality films. <br /> <br /> Well, I was wrong. Greta Garbo just had to shock people in the studio as much as me because this movie made her a star and deservedly so. She instinctively understood the power of standing in a place or just holding a meaningful expression for a long, prolonged moment, so that its effect would be felt and not only visible. I thought about myself, how did this contemporary actress fall into a squeaky, silent movie? She was only a few years before her time. <br /> <br /> The story is not so interesting, it's just a story of lost and lost love. Only Garbo's life as Leonora, a poor country girl who does good in a big city, then returns to get a man who escaped, gives him life. Co-author Ricardo Cortez is fit, but his character is never really developed and is humiliated throughout the script. At some point, he is forced to wear Garbo's clothes, leave them in the clouds, and then reluctantly returns and gives them back. And let's not even talk about his horrible final scenes with Garbo, and then with his wife. Too ordinary, after that he did not have much career and I understand why. But it is enough as a somewhat mysterious object of Leonora's obsession. <br /> <br /> In this movie there is one completely fantastic line that just says it. "Leonora, you become visible." Yes, it catches the eye. <br /> <br /> If you really want to know what this is all about, not seeing the whole movie, just look at the last 30 seconds - Garbo's look when she's alone in a luxury car says it all. "He must be so happy, he has everything he wants" - yes, Garbo's face says it all. I have to see it again, Garbo is just amazing.
