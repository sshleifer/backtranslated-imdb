I spent years searching for a copy of this film (16mm, dvd, vhs) so I could show it to my children. The film is fun, and Spike and his band members show why they were the best musicians in the industry. They had to be so good to play this crazy one. I like it and recommend it for cinema lovers of all ages. <br /> <br /> The film is about the turn of the century, with a team of maladjusted people who are firefighters and a team of units (when they do not fight fires). There are ordinary running gags, as well as the chaos of Spike Jones and his Orchestra. In addition, the comedic help of Buddy Hackett and Hugh O'Brien.
