Fire And Ice is an animated film embedded in the fantasy world. The film is about a village destroyed by a giant glacier, which is the home of the evil ice master named Nekron. The only survivor from the village is a young man named Larn who decides to avenge those who were killed by the glacier. The ice glacier moves in the land of fire, and the princess from the land called Teegra is kidnapped by evil creatures. Larn sets out to look for her and sets off to search for and kill Nekron. Fire And Ice was directed by Ralph Bakshi, who is one of my favorite adult animators. He brought us such animated masterpieces as the film version of Fritz Kot and a few films he himself wrote, such as the great movie Hard Motion. I did not like Fire And Ice almost as much as other Ralph Bakshi works, but I still thought the movie was pleasant. He had a very nice animation, and the story was fun enough. The only basic complaints I have is that I would like the film to be more recounted because the story it uses is very thin and there is not much in it. I would also like the film to be a bit longer because the working time is less than 80 minutes. Even so, it's fun adventure movies that, unlike Fritz Cat or Heavy Traffic, are suitable for children 8 years and older. It is a pity that there was no more developed history and it took a little longer than it did.
