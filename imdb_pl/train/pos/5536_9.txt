Actually, I really liked this program. Already as a child I was interested in all sports, including horse races. It will always be difficult to create a series based on racing corruption, and at the same time get permission from the race tracks to record movies about this controversial topic. One episode I particularly remember focused around a horse that was about to win a big race that looked a bit different. The syringe was found on the stable floor and everyone thought it was applied, but nothing appeared in the blood tests. Too late, they realized that the horse had not been doped, but the knee cartilage had been removed. Like driving a car without oil and engine stalling, the horse broke down with tragic consequences.
