The person who says that Pat Robertson is angry and his program is bad has nothing to do with what is wrong and right. His definition of evil is the opposite of evil. The Bible itself says that in the last days, people will call good with evil and evil with good! He does not even know that he has fulfilled the Bible prophecy! If you do not know God and do not want to know him now, no problem. He still loves you, but when you finally bow down before Him, and you do it, it will be too late for you. God does not send anyone to hell, not even you! You will go there with your own decision, and your spit will define it! May God have mercy on you and give you experience in Damascus on the road. The 700 Club and Pat Robertson service is one of the reasons I'm still here. On the verge of alcoholism, adultery and probably death, God reached across the television screen and used Pat Robertson to do this, and thank God he did! You have the right to say what you said, but you have no right to curse your words. God, have mercy on you.
