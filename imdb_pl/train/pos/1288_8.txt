Preston Waters is in a bad summer. Apart from the upcoming birthdays, nothing else looks promising. <br /> <br /> First, he must share his own room with his brothers who intend to run a business. They can not do it in their rooms because they do not have enough space. At the birthday party he only gets 6 tokens, while others receive 32, 35, and even 50 dollars. When one of his birthday cards comes early, he only gets a $ 11 check. <br /> <br /> Going to a bank that finds out, I need at least $ 200 to set up an account. Leaving the bank, the rogue steals a check. Chasing after the kid almost ran over him (his bike is definitely ruined) by a criminal named Quigley (played by Miguel Ferrer). Quigley also came from the bank to give the owner $ 1,000,000 for tomorrow. Quigley begins to write a damage check, but he manages to write his name before the police car circulates the area. Fearing, he gives Preston a check, informs him that he would give his father to finish. <br /> <br /> That evening, Preston tells his father that he does not want a new bike, he wants his own room back, his home is better still. His father limits him to his room for the rest of the evening. Moping in his room Preston calculates that things can not be worse, he realizes he forgot about the check because he is still in his shirt pocket. It's empty. <br /> <br /> Using a computer and after careful consideration, he wins $ 1,000,000. The next day, trying to cash him in the bank, he is taken away from the owner who thinks he is the person he should give $ 1,000,000. This is not because a real person named Juice appears a moment later. <br /> <br /> Now all three have to follow Preston. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Preston has a great time buying things including his own home, and even dating with a dressed banker who is really an FBI agent (trying to track down three bad guys). He makes that person called Mr. Macintosh, for whom he works, and even plans an event for him on his birthday. <br /> <br /> But in the end things catch up (money ends, criminals catch him). <br /> <br /> In general, quite a funny movie. Miguel Ferrer plays his role very well. If you liked the "Second Vault", you will love it here. He does all kinds of wicked crazy things. <br /> <br /> Rick Ducommun (stressed head of Ghost in the Machine) plays a great friendly chauffeur in this movie.
