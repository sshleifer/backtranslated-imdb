Unfortunately, this film has long been unavailable (as other posters have noted), but it is one of the most important dramas of the Great Depression, a lyrical and moving drama of love embedded in the slums. There are appearances by Spencer Tracy and Loretta Young, who are the greatest of their careers, and this is a great example of how director Frank Borzage was able to create an almost fairytale aura around elements of poverty, crime and the terrifying social inequity that only proves how his talents were truly romantic and spiritual. This film shows how love survives in poverty and desperate need, and is completely affirming life. This is a true masterpiece of this period and it is a film that deserves a wider understanding.
