An excellent movie with great performances by Zack and Lochley. To their dissatisfaction (and mine) Garibaldi arrived at the station. (With all due respect to Jerry Doyle, but in Seasons 4 and 5, I've lost sympathy for the character.) It does not take him long to criticize Zack (who I like the most in the show) and take over the lead. I'm sure Zack could handle it. The Soulhunter story is fascinating, especially if you believe in the sky, like Zack. Humor nicely completes it. 10/10
