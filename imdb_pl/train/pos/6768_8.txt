One of my favorite programs in the 80's. After the first season, he began to decline when they decided to add Jean Bruce Scott to the cast. Deborah Pratt was wonderful and it was great to see her and the character of Ernest Borgnine walking with them. The last episode in which she appeared was one of my favorites in the second season. Unfortunately, in those days, the Negroes did not last long on television programs. Some of the episodes of the second season, in which everything is fine, but the third season, concerned more human characters than Airwolf and were not shown until the end of the show. When he went to the USA, it was disgusting !!!
