There are so many "Hollywood" movies, which are now not only torture to watch, but also have no effect on someone's life. Of course, movies do not always have a deep sense, but it's nice to know that there are still filmmakers who care about telling "human" stories. I will not reveal the premise of this genius movie, but the script is certainly one of the more complex and unforgettable scenarios I've ever seen in my life, and I'm also a 32-year-old movie lover! Bug takes the top ten on my favorite list, which includes: On the Waterfront, Sunset Boulevard and Black Narcissus, to name a few. This "moving" movie should also become one of your favorites - that is, if you have a heart!
