The series of Noir Dan Andrews Otto Preminger's films is one of the (mostly) unappreciated gems of this genre. Because they lack paranoia, misogyny or hysteria, they may have seemed out of place at the time, but clear imaginations, a complex game of identity, masculinity and representation, the overthrow of traditional psychological principles, the raw, geometric style of everyone seem surprisingly modern and very similar today. to Melville. The bright ironies of this film are so charged, brutal and ironic that a "happy" ending is one of the cruelest in Hollywood history. Great at the level of an entertainment thriller, tight and full of mutual dialogue.
