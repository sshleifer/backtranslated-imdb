this is a real treat for every Bolan fan, some may think it's a bit too far and it's just about ego and Marcus Marcus, but I think it's similar to every other video from the concert, except that Marc Bolan, not just any guy! I especially liked the music video for the children of the revolution with Elton John and Ringo Starr. this clip is worth all the money, I can not believe that they did not release this version as a single. The film is really great, especially for us, danes. Now I was not living in the 70's. but generally danes was completely fired from what was going on around them. the media did not play or show any popular music at that time, including Marc Bolan and T.Rex, they only played a bit of The Doors, only really popular songs. so I know from my dad that by seeing this, he gives him part of his youth, he never experienced. <br /> <br /> I will not do it too long, so ... If you're the least fan of Marc Bolan, you have to see it. it may seem boring to you, or, as said earlier, a bit above. But at least you've seen one of the best musicians in action! <br /> <br /> The only thing that disappoints me a bit is that Ride A White Swan is not on tape. but I'm sorry because Jeepster and Get It On are so great.
