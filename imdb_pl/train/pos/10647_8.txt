I do not understand what fans of the genre did not like in this movie. It was really great fun. The special effects were great. Generally, I agree with IMDB's opinions and electorate, but not this time. I waited for the film to reach home, which in my opinion was another reason why I did not like the movie. I believe that movies with special effects must be visible on the big screen, but again it was not. For me, the film asks you to compare two films that appeared at the same time. Blair Witch and The Mummy. Both films that I thought were terrible. Blair was probably the most overrated horror of all time. Mumia made a lot of money and it was a pure shiver. People liked it for special effects. Films like Mumia and The Haunting are not rich in character development, more like funhouse rides. With this analogy, Mumia was B ticket to the electronic ticket Haunting.
