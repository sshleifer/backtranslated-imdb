"The Shop Around the Corner" is one of the best films by director Ernst Lubitsch. In addition to the talents of James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan, he is filled with a great cast of top actors such as Frank Morgan and Felix Bressart. These are the type of actors that Hollywood no longer employs. In fact, the movie itself is a kind of film that Hollywood no longer does. (The creators of "You've Got Mail" say their movie is a remake, but it's just a lot of high praises.) In any case, if you have a liking for romantic comedies from the 1940s, you'll find "The Shop Around the Corner "is something wonderful. Same with repetition. Enjoy!
