Creature Comforts in America should be released on a different network or at least have a chance to fully launch episodes. Unfortunately, it was not. Considering that the American public (seemingly) focuses on the mosquito, when it comes to humor, which does not consist of vulgar language laced diatribes, or has preoccupation with scatological functions (both sound and smells), such shows will be very few far away. One of the main problems was that no matter how brilliant he was, he was created for a thinner audience who knew what to expect, but was watched by the audience and conference rooms that had no idea what they were watching. Which is sad, but not unexpected. I would like to see at least three consecutive seasons of this program, even if it was produced for direct DVD release. The material and interactions between the creatures were rich in subtext and there were other conversations that only waited to have them below the surface. But thanks to political correctness, such conversations take place only in my mind.
