Red Rock West is one of those powerful thrillers we rarely see. It is well packed, well-preserved and leaves no loose ends or unanswered questions, so typical of this genre. <br /> <br /> Nicolas Cage plays Michael, an unemployed tough guy from Texas, desperate enough to work to Wyoming for potential employment. He is honest about guilt, but always on the dark side of fate. <br /> <br /> After failing to earn a living, Michael falls into the Red Rock bar, where the owner of Wayne (JTWalsh) makes the mistake of the contract killer he summoned from Dallas, he hired to his lovely but fatal wife Suzanne (Lara Flynn) Boyle). <br /> <br /> Wayne gives Michael the necessary details and a down payment for hitting an adulterous Suzie. Not intending to follow him, Michael accepts the money, and then sets off to warn Suzanne of the impending fall. He also sends a letter to the local sheriff, who reveals the plot and shares it. <br /> <br /> Because fate dictates, Michael will not be able to get rid of such an easy situation. Leaving the violent downpour, Suzannes lover vanishes. Of course Michael being Michael takes him to the local hospital, where he was found to have been shot as well. <br /> <br /> The sheriff is called and, fortunately, Wayne is also a local law. Michael manages to escape when he is taken on the last ride, and then he is picked up by the real "Lyle of Dallas" played with murderous joy by the bizarre Dennis Hopper. After discovering they are Marines colleagues, Lyle insists that Michael joins him for a drink elsewhere at the Red Rock bar. There Wayne realizes his mistake, and soon he and Lyle are chasing after Michael, who is willing to fall into the hands of Suzannes. <br /> <br /> With the advent of the pace, we learn that Wayne and Suzanne are really sought-after armed robbers who break theft for millions of dollars. Earning money is now the main theme of films from the series of betrayal, double crosses and murders. <br /> <br /> The film was very well manned. Nicolas Cage was typically short, Dennis Hopper and Lara Flynn Bolye were playing the right roles. The best performance was taken by J.T. Walsh, who was dangerous, not looking like that. Walsh was a great actor who left us too soon. <br /> <br /> The photograph of Marc Reshoskys used a lot of unique angles that added tension and story development. The film was further enhanced by John Dahl's tight director style and the rapid edition of Morris Chestnt's fire.
