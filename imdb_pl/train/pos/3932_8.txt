In the same melody as Americana's percussion along Mohawk, John Ford captures American history in a fictitious but very believable manner. Henry Fonda made three more films in this era with Ford, and all three are at a specific time and place, with an emphasis on the surroundings and cultural environment. In Mohawk America's pioneer is in full bloom with Americans fighting for themselves against Indians and other forces. Here Ford shows us nineteenth-century America; a time when invention and creativity were beginning to flourish, and this nation was really getting great. Among them was a tall, thin, young Illinois lawyer named Abe Lincoln, and this movie fictates his life as a lawyer, announcing the size that he will later reach. <br /> <br /> Fonda is great in this movie, the essence of what is believed to be Lincoln's personality, although no one knows exactly what he was then. Sets and support cast also harmonize well and give a unique balance in Ford's picturesque American dream and its many forms. This is not a film that should be taken literally, but symbolically, showing that Lincoln really warmed up to events in his life that were to create his legacy. We even get a few scenes between him and the young Mary Todd; and it's hard to see how it ended, but that's not the point. I believe that this is just a tribute to the greatness of Lincoln, widely regarded as the greatest American president. His quiet and direct attitude was rare and will be today. Indeed, our government certainly needs more people like him.
