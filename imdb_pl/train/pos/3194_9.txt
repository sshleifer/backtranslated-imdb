There was never something like that, that's for sure. This episodic, seemingly unnecessary trilogy makes sense only as a whole and as such is not a film about Groovin 'Gary, Utah cross-dressing sensation. It's a very deliberate movie about how the filmmaker REACTS in Groovin 'Gary. For Harris, the whole project is clearly an expanded and spectacular flinch of guilt and penance. Trying to atone for his sins - yes, Gary tried to commit suicide after the first document was issued - through correction, commentary and convention, recovering such Hollywood narratives as his best friend and rebellious happy ending (two different, with eloquent adaptation in the Glover version and transforming them into his personal, very personal applications. So, although it's a movie about gender and difference, the structure ensures that it is also a movie about FILMS - but at an almost unprecedented level of complexity. So much happens, telling and repeating this story Harris is in the right place at the right time, three times in a row, and he does not lose the opportunity to do something about it. Extremely moving and as deep as the camp.
