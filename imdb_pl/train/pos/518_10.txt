Also known as "Stairway to Heaven" in the USA. During World War II, a British Peter Carter airplane (David Niven) was shot down in combat, but survived. He meets and falls in love with the charming June (Kim Hunter). But it seems that a mistake has been made in Heaven - he should have died! The French spirit comes for him, but he refuses. She is about to tell the Heaven Tribunal that she should have a life permit. <br /> <br /> Sounds ridiculous, but in reality it's an amazing movie. The script is good, and the actors play roles completely simple and beautifully presented - scenes on Earth are breathtaking Technicolor (I've never seen such a beautiful blue sky), and the scenes in Heaven are black in white! Niven is sometimes a bit stiff, but Hunter is just great (and very beautiful), and Roger Livesey is wonderful as a doctor trying to help Niven. The images are amazing (especially stairs and the last test sequence), and the special effects are really great (considering the age of the film). There is also a very strange sequence when Niven runs into a completely naked young boy grazing sheep! This is an absolutely beautiful, provocative movie - I highly recommend it. This remains unknown in the US, which is a shame.
