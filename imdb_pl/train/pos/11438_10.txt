Ralph and Mumford, unmatched in their own land, are deceived into being the unconscious pawns of Synanomess Botch. Twice Upon a Time is a story about them, heroes they meet and their struggle to fix the situation. With a surprisingly impressive soundtrack and a wonderful voice, acting among the best in the industry, this unusual film hits the market. <br /> <br /> The animation process, similar to the one in the "South Park" style, is much smoother and more three-dimensional. If I did not know that the animation is like that, I would swear it was a traditional pen and ink. If you can watch this movie in Dolby Surround or THX, PLEASE DO! You will not miss anything if you do not, but if you do, you will gain much more thanks to this experience!
