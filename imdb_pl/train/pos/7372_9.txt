"This Is Not A Love Song" is a brilliant example of a pursuit genre that many people consider to be fundamental. Love between the two main heroes can be more than fraternal. I believe Heaton is in love with Spike, but Spike is too naive to see. <br /> <br /> I really feel that it's presented with scenes like sequences back and writing letters. Heaton shows great intimacy towards Spike. With intense facial expressions and how much he cares about writing Spike's name on top of his letters. <br /> <br /> I noticed one thing when I was looking at external reviews, the fact that when the movie was written, the reviewer does not seem to fully understand the film, because they did not even mention that Heaton has sexual feelings about Spike. and. I also have the impression that some reviewers have not recognized him when they use phrases such as: "Who is Heaton? What's he doing with delay like Spike? " This person could, however, hit his head with his attention. Spike shows noticeable signs of having A.D.D, although I do not think that person will realize this because it seems to use the word "retard" as an offensive term. <br /> <br /> I really liked this movie. Although it is not for people with weak hearts. The film is extremely character-based, after shooting to the end there is not much, but a dialogue between the two anti-heroes. Unless you're used to watching such deep, rough movies, stay away.
