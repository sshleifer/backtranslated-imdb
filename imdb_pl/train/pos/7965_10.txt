This movie was amazing ... he made me laugh. this movie should be watched by all people! it's one of my favorite movies and I love it so much that I just had to comment it !!! it is a heart and a great plot that creates a wonderful and heartfelt movie! my favorite character is the shadow. it's because I think it's the most interesting and charming. Once I had a golden retriever like a shadow, I miss him so much !!! he was my best friend and I knew that when he died he would be in a happier place, but I miss him with all my heart !! this movie is the best I love and everyone should! Love your animals no matter what they do, nurture them forever !!!
