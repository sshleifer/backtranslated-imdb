It's a great movie that everyone should see. Game like Dean Koontz's book. <br /> <br /> Bill Paxton's performance was great because he seems to believe in what he says and does. <br /> <br /> I do not know why viewers need to read in a message for religious murder in a movie. It's fiction. The ending is surprising, but fictitious. So what? I think that's what makes this movie so good. SPOILER DO NOT READ FURTHER IF YOU HAVE A VIEWED MOVIE. Throughout the film, the viewer is still shocked by Paxton's illness, the influence on children and the way children deal with this scandalous behavior. And then at the end it turns out to be true. God put him on the mission of getting rid of the demon world. Paxton is not clairvoyant, as other viewers suggest. Of course, he receives information that he could not know otherwise, but the movie shows how God "protects" Adam through a comfortable video quality problem and the total lack of memory of the other FBI agent. The film is not in favor of Christian murder, but only takes away the viewer's very unexpected ride.
