Parker and Stone transplant their pacific humor from an animated masterpiece into a full-length action film with generally good results. Much of the film is Trey and Matt with an amok and a new toy box. The plot is simple: two average guys are inventing a new sport, a mix of uphill basketball and baseball shooting, which becomes national madness. Along the way, they encounter numerous sports film clich√©s and send them along with any other type of popular culture that interests them. It lasts like an extended section of South Park, with a typical machine-gun dialogue, toilet humor and homilies from the heart. <br /> <br /> If this movie has a weakness, it is a relationship with the band that gave us "Airplane" and the series "Naked Gun." This effect is clearly visible by the intense use of lame gags of sight and the presence of a glossy and rather two-dimensional Yasmine Bleeth in the role that Priscilla Presley usually plays. Robert Vaughn plays a bit better, playing the corporate bardard, which was his party piece since "Bullitt", and Ernest Borgnine takes over as much as he can, but I must admit that he is perfect for the role of a madman. /> <br /> For those who have not noticed it yet, Parker and Stone seem to be more comfortable as rock stars than comics. It manifests itself in the sense given to the soundtrack in almost everything that they create. As usual, they give you a good choice, including a compulsory song on your own DVDA, which is not a PC vehicle. <br /> <br /> Particularly noteworthy is Dian Bachar, who deserves some reward for enduring a difficult game of Stan for a raging pair of Carters Parker and Stone. <br /> <br /> In summary, this is a fun comedy that is stopped from full potential by over-reliance on the "Naked Gun / Airplane" formula. Parker and Stone could do something really genius (or absolutely horrible) if they had full control over the future movie. America, either shut these guys or give them power.
