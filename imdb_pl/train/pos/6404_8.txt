When I watched this movie and began to notice that his characters were developing, I felt that it would be a perfect picture. When you feel this feeling and the film really meets these expectations, experience is rare. I had this feeling throughout this movie. Robert DeNiro and Cuba Gooding Junior played riveting and extremely strong parties that were worth an Oscar. The supporting cast was equally strong, creating a winning foundation for the image to evolve. I can say without hesitation, see this movie will not let you down.
