In 1955, the British created a comedy called Simon and Laura, with Peter Finch and a brilliant Kay Kendall. To this day, this is one of the best examples of British comedy, and especially how television sitcoms become so popular. It was and is a perfect example of self-aligning cinema. <br /> <br /> So Soapdish, a movie I never heard about until a few days ago when I caught him on TV late. At the beginning, I was a little uncertain, because comedy is so difficult to do, as you know. <br /> <br /> However, I was pleasantly surprised and delighted when I was able to watch a very clever satire on the subject of daily American television. In fact, it has been some time since I laughed so warmly. So if you like satire, I recommend you to see it. <br /> <br /> Main actors ?? Sally Field, Kevin Kline, Robert Downey and Cathy Moriarty ?? just do a great job by revealing how bizarre and shallow acting is. When I watched this, I thought to myself: how much of this strangeness is moving into real life? I mean, if the actors ever have a real life? As you probably know, for example, Peter Sellers was known for hiding his real person behind a lot of characters, so that nobody really knew a real person. So when I watched Sally Field playing Celeste Talbot in Maggie, I thought again about this earlier British film, in which Kay Kendall plays Laura playing a television sitcom alongside Peter Finch ... <br /> <br /> Is this any wonder some actors have nervous breakdowns? And that feeling crystallized when Celeste finally confronts her daughter (Lori, played by Elizabeth Shue) and in an emotional moment repeats the fictitious lines she used in the previous episode of her daily soap when she confronted her fictional daughter in just that! Are you confused? Well, that's not all, but the dialogue is delightful with originality, comedy, quirkiness, anger, depravity, duplicity, and even ... love. <br /> <br /> History? Well, there are a lot of stories in this movie, all intertwined with each other and all of them meet at the end (of course, but not like in Robert Altman's movie, okay!), And not all of them are finally resolved. Life is not like that anyway, right? The pace is almost crazy, and you really have to watch and listen carefully to catch all the gags and subtle jokes. Spend 97 minutes of your life and watch them; You will not regret time. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is doing well, although I have never taken much to Whoopi Goldberg. Perhaps the funniest are the exchanges between Robert Downey and Cathy Moriarty, and for my money the other one steals so many scenes from others, he gets my vote as an outstanding player. I'm not kidding, she gives the bitch a completely new face ...
