Dark Angel is a futuristic science fiction series set in post-apocalyptic Seattle, focusing on Max (Jessica Alba), a genetically improved young woman who escapes her creators. <br /> <br /> The Universe of the Dark Angel absorbs (not so much as Buffy, but still absorbs) an interesting and credible set of characters. Certainly not for everyone, but those who devote their time will watch one of the most enjoyable series. The Dark Angel is unnoticed by criminals and undervalued, and unfortunately was canceled after two series. It was a great shame because he had the potential to become a great series, although her 42 episodes are only 10 shy from the long science-fiction comedy BBC Red Dwarf. Because it's a Dark Angel, it remains unfinished, so look for it, and if you want more, lobby for Fox to make another series.
