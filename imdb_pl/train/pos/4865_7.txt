I could not wait to get it in my hands when I read about Fred Astaire, who joined forces with George Burns and Gracie Allen in the screenplay of P.G. Wodehouse and Gershwins' music. It's definitely worth seeing, but it lacks coherent quality of Fred and Ginger's films. <br /> <br /> The story would probably be better read in the book Wodehouse, where humor is better. Some acting is quite painful to watch (especially a young boy and a young lady). <br /> <br /> But ...! The funhouse dance is worth more than most movies. I never knew that Gracie Allen can dance, but the boy does it in this movie. Have you ever tried to stand on one of these spinning funhouse disks? Imagine tapdancing on one on high heels! It works great with Astaire and greatly improves the overall image quality. <br /> <br /> A few nice songs, especially fun ones, it's a nice job if you can get it and a stiff upper lip. <br /> <br /> Recommended for Astaire, Burns & Allen fans. I had to go back and watch the funhouse dance as soon as the number of credits fell.
