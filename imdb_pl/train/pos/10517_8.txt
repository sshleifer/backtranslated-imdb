Rich production values ​​and solid performances in this simple adaptation of the satirical classic Jane Austen on the subject of marital play within and between classes in provincial England of the eighteenth century. Northam and Paltrow are a salutary mixture of friends who have to go through jealousy and lies to discover that they love each other. Good humor is a lasting virtue that largely explains the availability of older source material (which has been somewhat toned down in austere skepticism). I liked the look of the film and the way the shots were made, and I thought it did not rely too much on the successes of head shots, like most other 80s and 90s films. Very good results.
