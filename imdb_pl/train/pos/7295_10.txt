I was able to see it at the International Film Festival in New York in November 2005 with my boyfriend. We were both impressed by the complexity of the plot and found it emotionally moving. He was very well directed with strong images. The visual effects were amazing - especially for a short time. It had an original approach to a very real and serious subject: this film tells the story of a young girl who is visited by a demon victim to help her with an offensive father. At the end, surprise surprises me. This leads to a gothic character. I would like to see it as a full feature film. - Carrie
