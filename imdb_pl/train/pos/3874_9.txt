And I absolutely love Isabelle Blais !!! She was so adorable in this film and differed significantly from her role in Quebec-Montreal, where she was more like a human-eater. I think it should have been nominated for Jutra. I mean, Syvlie Moreau was good, but Isabelle was much better, IMO. Pelletier did a great job for the first time, and I noticed that he sneaked into a few of his colleagues from Rock et Belles Oreilles, Guy A. LePage and Andre Ducharme. It was nice to see them, I did not know they would appear. <br /> <br /> I do not think I've seen a romantic comedy from Quebec, which I did not like, and this one is as good as anyone I had the pleasure to watch. And if you are in the States and are wondering how to get a copy of the DVD, www.archambault.ca has provided it to me in less than a week.
