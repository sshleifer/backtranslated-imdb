I accidentally felt this movie on TV and could not leave it ... It's a really great movie that makes people learn American history during the Vietnam War, the time of flower power, the fight against racism ... This illustrates the conflict generations, political views, a race that took place in the 1960s ... I was born in 1980, so I did not know all this before ... In France, US history is not a priority and this film really taught me a lot of facts! By the way, I think all the actors are great; especially Jordana Brewster, Josh Hamilton and Jerry O'Connell. Now I see this movie more than once a day! It is really great .... it's a pity that it only appeared on TV, not in cinemas ... <br /> <br />
