The American film debut of Greta Garbo is an analogy to how our lives can be swept away by fate and our actions, like in a stream, causing us to lose a part of ourselves along the way. <br /> <br /> Greta plays Leonora, a poor peasant in love with Ricardo Cortez, Don Rafael, landowner. Ricardo is also in love with her, but too much under the influence of his dominant mother. Leonora ends up homeless and travels to Paris, where he becomes a famous opera singer and gains the reputation of a loose woman. In fact, part of her attitude is the bitterness abandoned by Raphael. <br /> <br /> He returns home to visit his family and eventually confronts Rafael. It is surprising that no one knows that he is famous for La Brunna, and Garbo plays the role of a diva that she really was and who was rewarded with such cool haughtiness in her later portraits. <br /> <br /> Ricardo Cortez is very reminiscent of Valentino in this part looks and was prepared by MGM on Valentino clone, though he never thought he could be in fact and he was right. He is credible in the unpleasant role of a weak mother's boy and allows him to age realistically, but hilariously at the end of the movie. He fails to win Leonory when he returns home, and later when he follows her, his courage is undermined. <br /> <br /> This movie is beautifully filmed, with brilliant storm sequences, and the collections depicting Spain at this time are authentic looking. There are also great supporting performances Lucien Littlefield, Tully Marshall and Mack Swain. <br /> <br /> Although this is a story of lost love and lost opportunities, I do not think that Leonora and Rafael had been happy together because he needed a more traditional wife and was a professional woman and I do not think he would be happy in a small village . The ending is consistent with life and does not involve any blows. <br /> <br /> See this as the American debut of the Garbo movie and the precursor of future events
