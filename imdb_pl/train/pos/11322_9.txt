This anime shook my socks seriously. When the anime opened, I felt that it was too slow; history has not progressed, and Shirou was quite an impressive man. When he learns more about tracking and you learn more about Saber and the Holy Grail War itself, the story ends and you can see many aspects that move together. It was fantastic. <br /> <br /> In addition, I felt that the way the characters evolved is very real, creating the real way in which real people develop. Nothing stupid, completely obvious; Ilya and Rin's development was interesting, but I think that the way Shirou and Saber grew up in their personalities was simply interesting. Some of the "surprised" people who appeared (Gilgamesh?) Seemed unique from the rest of the cast in one way or another, which means that we did not have the replacement of "Generic Bad-ass A" "Generic Bad Ass B" as soon as A died. <br /> <br /> Anddd, I loved music. The opening music shook and the final motif of the last episode ... He seriously pushed the theme of the last episode even more. Good job, Type-MOON!
