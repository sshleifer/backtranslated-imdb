<br /> <br /> I just bought this movie on DVD and watched it for the first time. I've been a fan of Tolkien's work for about 4 years since I graduated from high school. I did not grow up in this movie ... maybe my mother kept me away from it. This is definitely not for children. It's not that it's bad in a graphical sense, but the topics will suit most 10-year-olds. In general, the animation was excellent, taking into account that it was created in 1978/1979. I thought that history follows the book quite well in a loose sense. But I'm worried that Baszki did not just add another 40 minutes and he did not throw in the Return of the King. That would be the best movie. I was disturbed by his sudden end, and when I heard that the King's Return sucked, I was even more worried. It is a pity that it was not one big animated film. It could get a higher voice from me. It gives me 7th. I can only hope that Peter Jackson will do justice to books with a new live action movie.
