Shrek, anyone? Imagine Shrek in the ice age. Do you remember Shrek's ending? The reason you do it. Now imagine that Shrek is turning into a man, just like a princess. Get? Nice animation, in fact, much more than the work of Pixar and Disney, which in their drawings try to get closer to reality. Strong ones, social comments that children will not understand, good guys win. One more thing: Scrat. By the way, how do everyone know that it's called Scrat? 7/10
