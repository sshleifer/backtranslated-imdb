The cast was good and I thought it was a good performance by Christopher Lloyd, whom I like from previous films. The film was a great family movie, nothing that would make you worry about showing it to younger children, a good story, lots of laughter, joy and pleasure. If you want to entertain children without boredom tears, it matches the bill. Nice for children and not difficult to watch for parents.
