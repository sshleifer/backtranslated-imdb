This is the best baseball picture since Redford hit our Nature. Dennis Quaid and Rachel Griffiths illuminate the screen with a great story and a cast that seemed real enough to draw you into action. <br /> <br /> Laced with dreams - dripping with reality, American Dream re-lights up after 9.11 with a real story about the young debut of Devil Ray, Jimmy Morris. The Australian-born actress Rachel Griffiths plays better in native West Texas than many Texans whom I know; and Dennis Quaid was perfection? planted as a would-be, gonnabe and modest victor with the same psychological baggage as the average spectator in the audience. That's true. Screen chemistry works. If you like baseball warmers, you'll love this movie. The ingredients for Americana and apple pie were there. My popcorn has become the "a la la" mode. <br /> <br /> And hey: buy a CD! Music rock and magnificently moves history! Syncing words and music pushes the story exactly as it should, an area that disappoints me more often. <br /> <br /> Critics: I would give baseball to someone else. But Quaid has something that will teach us everything about character and heart. St. Rita and the nuns were a nice decoration, but they never really found their place in the story to open and close it. A little long. It's worth every minute in the last analysis. 8/10. <br /> <br />
