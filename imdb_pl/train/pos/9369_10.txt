This film is proof that the film noire is a lasting style and extremely worth living. For me, this is the best example of film noire from Chinatown. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, he will never get the recognition he deserves. It has never been properly promoted when it was first released and had to build a fan base through places like Vanguard Cinema and lip referrals. Entertainment rents this movie and delves into its very intricate storyline.
