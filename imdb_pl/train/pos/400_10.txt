When Tsui Hark experiments, nothing and no one can resist him. Legend of Zu is probably 6 hours condensed in 1h40. We do not understand everything, but as in "2001 A Space Odyssey" you do not have to, but we feel the power of the film for every second, every photo. An extraordinary vision of the future of the seventh art and one of the most pioneering, amazing and rejoicing in recent years. VITAL heavy MASTERPIECE! It is absolutely perfect as it is. <br /> <br /> When Tsui Hark experiments, nothing and no one can resist him. Legend of Zu is probably 6 hours condensed in 1h40.
