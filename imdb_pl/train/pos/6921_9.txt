Remember that I am a fan of this genre, but only recently saw this movie. As I've missed all this time, it's a miracle for me. For me, this is a better movie than the praised "High Noon". It's a great western with an excellent game and great history. The DVD is beautiful in black and white with great photos. If you like Westerns or James Stewart, you can not miss this movie.
