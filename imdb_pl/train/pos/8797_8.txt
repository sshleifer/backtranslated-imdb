A great idea: 11 stories about 11 September. 11 directors from different countries with different results. Ken Loach speaks of an immigrant (as usual) is simply brilliant (as usual). The Frenchman also does a very good job, while Burkina Faso's film was a pleasant surprise. However, the movie in Israel was a bit boring, and the Mexican guy, well, he should quit directing and work in a Mexican restaurant. 8/10
