I have not read novels or anything by Kurt Vonnegut, but now I am going to start. It grabs you from the first frame and does not let go until the final credits begin to roll. By taking places you do not expect, the plot is interesting. Stimulation is in place, nothing takes too long, and it fits perfectly into unexpected twists and allows the viewer to process what we've seen. It is well told and thought out. I have never watched a film that I could particularly compare. It is intense and exciting, as well as funny and sad. Acting is great, Nolte absolutely shines, Goodman again proves that he does not have to laugh, and Lee and Arkin are charmed. I can continue, really ... no role is considered less than stellar. Editing and photos are wonderful, and all visuals are great, with some unforgettable and amazing. I intend to follow other films directed by Keith Gordon, as well as the other two, apparently related to this, through the author of the books. There is one scene of sexuality and a lot of disturbing and disturbing content in it. I recommend it to anyone who can appreciate it; it is not pleasant. 8/10
