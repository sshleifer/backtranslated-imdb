Pialat films people in extreme emotional situations, usually with a few violent scenes. In La Gueule, ouverte has a devastating effect on the husband and son of a woman who dies of cancer. In A Nose amours sexual teens experiments lead to violent confrontations with the family. Here we have a rather rotten young woman who abandons her husband to take care of a sexy ex-girlfriend. Her motivation is a bit confused, because Loulou is incapable of reading or discussing anything more demanding than television programs; on the other hand, he has a great body (I wonder why Depardieu never made a sports movie to show this figure - he would be great as a rugby player). <br /> <br /> Casting is impressive. Isabelle Huppert can not give a nondescript, non-concealing performance (she gave a lot); Depardieu plays Loulou with all the dynamism and charm you could wish for - see the scene at the bar where he stabbed a knife, runs away and looks for treatment, then quickly re-launches with Nelly. Guy Marchand, with these coal-black eyes and a worried look, beautifully plays her husband Nelly; it's a great repetition of couples in Coup de Foudre.
