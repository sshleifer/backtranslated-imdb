It is definitely NOT an intellectual film with a deep mission, so I really do not think that there is too much to understand if you are not a Czech. <br /> <br /> It's just a comedy. Humor is simple, quite funny and sometimes a bit morbid. Some actors and heroes are very similar to Samotári (2000) (Jirí Machácek, Ivan Trojan, Vladimír Dlouhý), so the authors are. But it does not matter, the genre is really different and you should not compare these two films in this way. One ruka netleská will not try to give you a lesson, she will try to make you laugh and there is a chance that she will succeed. <br /> <br /> Not bad movie, not brilliant, but I liked it. Some scenes are really worth seeing.
