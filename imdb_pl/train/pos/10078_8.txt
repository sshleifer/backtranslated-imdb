It's a story that could really take place, taking into account the right circumstances. The street artist attracts the attention of the famous opera star and results in friendship. An aging artist finds / buys a male child to convey his art. From there, we follow them through the rigors of their difficult but free lives along the river. Traveling to the city, he performs and has some notoriety. Despite the times and influences, the man is kind and good. <br /> <br /> In general, performances are paramount, especially Xu Zhu, who presents a street performer. The child (Renying Zhou) is beautiful and even strong, and tolerates open prejudices. Both heroes, together with the auxiliary help of a nice opera singer, master Liang (an interesting androgynous Zhao Zhigang), paint a very interesting story about forgiveness, sadness and love. Some have mentioned the distant similarities of the film to BA WANG BIE JI (FREEDOM TO MY CONCUBINE); however, this movie can not easily stand alone, each resemblance is at best distant. <br /> <br /> My only occupation with the KING OF MASKS is the ending. He was weak, clumsy and more or less as subtle as a blacksmith's hammer. The audience was already absorbed in history, what was the need for manipulation? What a pity. To bring a beautiful movie to it, it is enough to submit to such an emotional (and simple) pathos. Honestly, this movie was good, instead of classical, it should be. Besides, KING OF MASKS is still worth your time. I am glad that the Shaw brothers are still producing good films. Highly recommended.
