I consider this movie to be charming. I thought that the characters were developed because, as I looked, I took care of these people. This is an excerpt from the era, which I think occurred during depression. A lonely mother, known as a city loner (she has good reason to be), places an ad in the "Husband" newspaper. Christopher Reeve plays ex-cona who comes to the city in search of work. He sees the ad and goes out to her. He hires him. I really had a few chuckles when their relationship was developing because I could easily find myself in their shoes. Everything was happening. I need a job, so I do not want to upset her. And she needs his help, but she does not want him to get an advantage. They dance around the fact that they really need each other. Things start to warm up until ...... a big bang. I will not spoil it by telling you what is happening. But the solution point is perfectly gorgeous. I believe that history is very credible for the time it takes place. I think it's one of the better stories about "relationship." Maybe the younger generation will not get it, but if you're over 40, I think you'll like it. And if you liked Christopher Reeve in "Somewhere in Time", you'll like him too.
