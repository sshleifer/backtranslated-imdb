One of those brilliant young men who went out and dared to make a film about a romance with teenagers (can I call it that - would make the devil out of his fans) in a micro budget, but full of taste, sensitivity and maturity. Peter Sollett - you deserve greater admiration and respect. Thank you again for showing to the authorities that are in "industry" that stereotypes can be drained in the toilet. One location, a handful of rich characters, low budget, good acting (and it's too amateurs), decent lighting - worshipers of real indie cinema should watch it more and stop watching ... well ... you know what.
