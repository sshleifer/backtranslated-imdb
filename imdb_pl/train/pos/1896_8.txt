Arthur has always been a personal film for me for two reasons. My good friend who worked on the film as an accessory and helped horses during the stable scene recently died. If you look quickly, you'll see Frank Graham at the restaurant scene in the background while Dudley Moore and Jill Eikenberry are talking. Frank was a riding champion and he would miss anyone who knew him. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I knew the real life of Arthur Bach. He was not as rich as Arthur, but he spent 47 years of his life basically as a child. His parents strictly controlled the purse strings, but his rent and media were paid for in the basement of Greenwich Village. He spent a lot of time getting into different spirits and introducing himself, just like Dudley Moore. <br /> <br /> The miracle with Arthur is that whoever would bother him with wealth. But that's the other half of the equation. My friend was the most charming person when you met him. In fact, it was a compulsion to be charming. He could not buy a newspaper or magazine without trying to establish a certain level of relationship with the seller. He spent his life being a great party guest. The term wastrel, which was commonly used in the nineteenth century, would apply to it. <br /> <br /> And this is Dudley Moore, wastrel. Unlike my friend, Moore has John Gielgud who will clean up after him. It's a full-time job, as you can see from Artur's example. My friend also never found Lisa Minnelli, the man of Lisa Minnelli, because he was gay. Arthur Bach's portrait, Moore's still deadly accurate and real to me. <br /> <br /> Arthur, a twentieth century wastrel, is forced to marry another child from the Jill Eikenberry trust fund. Because he will not work for a living, the threat of being cut off is quite real to him. He only has his butler, Hobson, played by John Gielgud and the chauffeur Bitterman, played by Ted Post to pour out his troubles. We should all have such problems. <br /> <br /> John Gielgud in his almost century has certainly worked better than in Arthur on film and in fact Gielgud is more known for his stage performances. However, 1981 was a year of sentiment in the Oscar times. The Academy awarded Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn Oscars for the Golden Pond and Gielgud Award for the best supporting role mainly for lifetime achievement. This man was amazing, almost in his craft almost to the end. <br /> <br /> So for Frank Graham, who worked in the movie and for Jackie Weiss, the real life of Arthur, I dedicate this review.
