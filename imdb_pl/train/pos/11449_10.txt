it's definitely one of the most beautiful portraits of the person I've ever seen on the screen. Andy Goldsworthy is a kind of man who has gone extinct. he looks upon the earth and nature with such admiration and respect that he is primitive in a good sense. its purity, honesty and kindness breathe clearly when you look at how it works in such simple but vibrant moments of art. I was amazed at how he patiently created his works and how patiently he accepted their end. sometimes prematurely, but his Scottish sense of humor superbly covers his disappointments. the film is shot elegantly and contains the same flow that Goldsworthy art has. it combines nature and art in a minimal way, as it is in itself. The score of Fred Frith is so organic that it combines everything together without disturbing the naturalistic sound. this is generally a great job in every respect. there are no limits when it comes to age.
