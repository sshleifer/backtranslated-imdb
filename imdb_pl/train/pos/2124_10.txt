It is a truly classic movie in its history, acting and film presentation. The wonderful actors are full of the movie, Miss Sullivan and Jimmy Stewart are the most important characters. She really admired and enjoyed Jimmy in real life, and she gave him her first acting roles and helped him stay calm while performing on the set. The "chemistry" between them was always visible and so warm and pleasant to watch. She was such a beautiful, young woman and so sweet in her personalities. The story of these two young people, about how they finally meet, is a charming and pure magic entertainment. Heart warming presentations are also provided by other supporting actors in this wonderful story / film. With all my heart, I am sending Miss Sullivan the perfect 10 in this classic Golden Age cinema that has a special charm for all generations. You must see for everyone!
