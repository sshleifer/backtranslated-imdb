I married a Japanese girl 14 years ago. We are still together. <br /> <br /> However, in the 1950s it would never be so easy. <br /> <br /> Life in the army has been mined for years for actions, dramas and comedies to this point. Excavated to death. Mixed relationships gave him a new opportunity to show off. This is an old hat today, but then ...? Marrying an Asian man meant that either someone owed you something or you were a weirdo. It concerned both options together with the third one. Maybe it's love? <br /> <br /> Brando has done his usual good job. Garner did a better job than usual. It's good, but it showed how good it can be. Umecki-chan made her debut here, and although it seems to me that she deserved her statue, she did not really stretch. It was a role that nobody would recognize who was not abroad and the cork was new. <br /> <br /> The real thief of the scene were Red Buttons. Red was the best thing in this movie. Bank on it. And the Japanese lifestyle was also shown in admirable light. <br /> <br /> A classic.
