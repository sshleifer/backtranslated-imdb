I'm probably one of Nancy Drew's biggest fans. I read every book three times and played many games in Nancy. I loved this movie. This provided entertainment throughout the viewing time. I went with about 10 friends and everyone liked it. Behind us sat three women who looked like people between the ages of 30 and 40, and I asked them how they liked them, they said they liked each other! So you see that it will be entertainment for all ages. You must give him a chance. And he also teaches lessons, be yourself, even if everyone around you is exactly the same. Overall, this move was great. I will see it for the second time! So stop doing it. It's a really good movie!
