As part of the celebration of the Earth Day, Disney released the film "Earth". Staying very far from any sharp message of darkness and doom, we are treated as perfect pictures of animals in their habitats, not feeling too much about themselves. <br /> <br /> The stars of the series are a herd of elephants, a family of polar bears and a whale and his calf. The narrative begins at the North Pole and goes south until we reach the tropics, all the time being presented to the inhabitants of the various climatic zones being crossed. <br /> <br /> It is mentioned about global warming when watching Polar bears; Attention is drawn to the shrinking islands of sea ice in recent years. We never see bears catching seals, but a desperate search for a father leads to a dangerous solution. <br /> <br /> Aerial footage of caribou migrating through the tundra is one of the most spectacular photographs of the wild nature of Piła; this and other migrating wild birds are enough to reward the admission price to see them on the big screen. <br /> <br /> One of the disappointments I felt was that the great white sharks were filmed with great speed slow motion. You never have the feeling of one feature of wild animals; their amazing speed. The idea of ​​slowing down the movie to convey a great speed, I think it started with (or at least this is the first, as I remember) TV program "Kung Fu" in the early seventies. <br /> <br /> An interesting side light is that at the end of the subtitles there are demonstrations of the applied cinematographic techniques. In this film there are enough dramatic, humorous and informative moments to make it a solid choice for nature lovers. Perhaps because of some selective editing (saving us, as it was, from the terrifying end of the moment of predatory predator) and the fact that this material was released in 2007 and is available on DVD, it is a solid movie in itself. And you can take your children! <br /> <br /> Three stars.
