I really enjoyed the first episode and I'm waiting for more. A bit soft on the front of the crime (it is almost a reflection, not terribly uncertain or invented), but I think that the romance was wonderfully charming. I will be watching for sure! <br /> <br /> I hope they will play a bigger role for aunts who are great actresses, and this time they were a bit underrated. The actress who plays the assistant / waitress (also from Bewitched, I think), is very sweet and sparkling, and comes off so nicely, and at the same time sweet and sweet instead of stupid and annoying, which is very nice. <br /> <br /> Check it out.
