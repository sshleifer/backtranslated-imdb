I remember seeing it at the Salem cinema (where I went to "Kiddie Matin√©e" almost every Saturday) in Dayton, Ohio, when I was a small boy and never forgot about it. It just amazed me and my friends. I would like there to be a way to see it! I tried to find a compilation of shorts or something like that to no avail. It's only recently that I discovered that it was a Cousteau movie and it even more devastated my mind. How he got it, he's beyond my understanding. The fish is EARLY ON CAT EYELAS, if I remember correctly! If someone could help me find a way to see it, I would be very grateful!
