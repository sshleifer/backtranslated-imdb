Or at least one of the best. I think it is a very cool and very fun game on N64. Bowser copes with ordinary madness (yes, it's a stupid word, but the only thing I think about), Mario has to stop him. This game is very funny and contains a lot of nostalgia. The only bad thing is that the graphics are awful for today's standards, but everything else is quite good (especially the small mini-games that can be unlocked). which I recommend to any Mario fan or fan of platform games. It defeats the average Super Mario Sunshine every day. <br /> <br /> 9/10 or: A
