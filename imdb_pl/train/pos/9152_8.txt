It's a good movie for 99% of the time. I feel that the ending has closed the film with more recognition. <br /> <br /> It's curly in a rather naive way. This is clearly done to create a more chilling movie atmosphere - the feeling of isolation is visible soon thanks to this filming technique. <br /> <br /> Horrific characters are very well preserved and presented especially as "nutcase" "is called Joe. However, healthy (normal) characters are a bit too pathetic for my tastes - I admit, they are supposed to be so pathetic, but it does get a bit of OTT. <br /> <br /> The movie starts slowly (and the naive work with the camera begins with film "B" at the beginning) and very normal, but soon you feel the approaching brutality that is about to happen. This is one of the most "twisted" films with violence. <br /> <br /> After a sudden and incredibly lazy ending, I felt disappointed. I would give film 9 if the ending was consistent with the rest of the movie, but because it is only a seven, with the power of "amazingness" and scenes of biting nails earlier in the film. <Br> <br /> Give him a watch and I apologize for the ending!
