Perhaps the most refined and made from all Indian films - Pakeezah does not fit into any of the traps commonly associated with the Bollywood film (ie. Stickiness, farce, wholesale and unsuccessful imitation of western themes / genres). Pakeezah is autochthonous to Sub-Continent and authentic, almost Madam-like in recital. Characters are well-developed, directional, although sometimes not sophisticated by today's standards, perceptive and convincing. The environment in Urdu at Pakeezah was the masters of understatement and how dialogue communicates the subtleties of the age! Acting (especially "looks" and dynamics between characters) is a delight, although the nuances may be lost by modern viewers or those who are not familiar with the customs and customs of Muslim India. <br /> <br /> Engaged, with a captivating scenario, it is a beautiful musical score, strengthened by a hero showing the outstanding skills of classical Indian dance (kathak). As with most romantic tragedies, the heroine must die, but she will not leave the audience without the sense of the viewer that she was a party to a truly unforgettable cinema experience. Pakeezah is undoubtedly the pinnacle of what Indian cinema has produced and it is unlikely that it will be parallel.
