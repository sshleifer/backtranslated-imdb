Mardi Gras: Made in china is an excellent film that shows how two cultures have a lot in common, but they do not even realize the impact that every society has on itself. David Redmon opens his eyes and lets see how workers in China make beads that cost little or nothing and are sold in America for up to $ 20. When Redmon asks Americans where these beads come from, they had no idea and they seemed stupid. When he told them that they were made in China for less than nothing with terrible pay and unacceptable working conditions, the Americans seemed sad, hurt and a bit of a guilty conscience, but they did not really seem to stop buying beads after learning the truth. When Redmon interrogated workers in China, they did not know that the Americans wore them around their neck and paid so much for these beads. The employees laughed at what was behind the beads and could not believe it. This movie is a great movie that gives us something to think in other countries, in addition to ours. <br /> <br /> M.
