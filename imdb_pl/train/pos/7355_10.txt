In the case of a low-budget project, the film turned out to be a success. The story is interesting and the actors are convincing. Eva Longoria, who is currently on the television program "Dragnet", is more sexy than ever. The locations were perfect for the ganster plot, and the director shows his talent, taking on many roles for his project. Of course, this low-budget movie can use better editing transitions and more special effects for gun scenes, but the music keeps the script moving. Although this movie has many problems, such as continuity, I must say that I would borrow the director's next film. If you're a film student, you can learn a few things from the director's commentary.
