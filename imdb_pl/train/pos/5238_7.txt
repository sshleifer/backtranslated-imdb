I liked Top Gun. I was interested. Predictable plot, decent character development and plot. This is very similar to High Noon in that the city's residents seem weak and are afraid to face the villain. This movie has high quality actors who really did not have the opportunity to share their talents. Also, some actors have not received recognition for their roles. Denver Pyle was a handsome man in his youth. John Dehner, Rod Taylor are outstanding in their roles. Sterling Hayden did everything he could in a bad material. It is hard to imagine him as a gunslinger. Laura, played by Karen Booth, was nauseated. She seemed flattering that two men fought for her. Ugh. Finally, how can people travel without luggage? Especially women.
