I sat with children while watching this movie. We've all found it to be a very funny movie. <br /> <br /> When Billy goes to a new school, a fifth-grade bully starts something with him, and that leads to eating worms. <br /> <br /> The bet is set, and Billy has only enough time to eat 10 worms. From that moment on, the bully and his friends try to come up with nasty ways to cook, fry or bake the worms to try and get Billy sick to lose the bet. <br /> <br /> Billy stays strong and eats his way to become more and more liked by everyone, even friends who are crazy. <br /> <br /> I will not tell you whether to win the bet or not ... you just have to watch it to find out, but I think if you like good family movies, you'll like this one. <br /> <br /> PS I will add that this movie is not only for boys, I have all daughters and they liked it very much.
