This movie draws you so deep into two main characters. I threw it into the laptop without reading the cover (let alone the covers) and was intrigued by two fixed hours. Two missing ships from two different worlds collide. The sexual tension that arises between the secretary and the criminal is almost palpable, even without physical contact. At the end I could not decide what I want more: our hero and heroine, to take off their caper or just consume their passion. RML could have been done without an interesting thread, and the traditional 100 minutes would be a lot. However, I'm upset. After the Netflix series, Blockbuster and the local library, this movie restored my faith in great movie making.
