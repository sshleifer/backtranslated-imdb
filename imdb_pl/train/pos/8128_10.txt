I saw it for the first time as a child living in East London. The Hitler Luftwaffe scars were too obvious, and the landscape of the film resembled our street. I remember nightmares after seeing this. The strange thing is that it is not really dated if it is seen as a part of social history in a fictitious cinema. <br /> <br /> In addition to a globally destructive war, the scale of the machines was very bad, more Nano-technologies now, but overall, perfect and well-made work. It was interesting to see how space travel was perceived. I think that launching a spaceship from a giant gun will almost certainly kill astronauts. However, many were right. Male desire for war, human inhumanity. Means of war as a catalyst for development. <br /> <br />
