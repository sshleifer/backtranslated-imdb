I watched it in movies with my girlfriend at the time and I can say that I did not have the best time, mainly because I did not know about Ned Kelly or his story. <br /> <br /> But since then it has been a biographical film, it is important to at least know what to expect from the character. <br /> <br /> I do not know if the way the events are told is real or if everything is fictitious. But the way Ned Kelly is portrayed as a hero and a warrior for justice really makes me believe that everything is true. I do not think he's portrayed as a criminal or a thief, but that's just my opinion. <br /> <br /> This is a solid Western-style film for everyone. Heath Ledger is great as always, and sexy Naomi Watts impresses the screen. <br /> <br /> Give this movie a chance if it will be broadcast on the cable. Otherwise, I do not think I can recommend it.
