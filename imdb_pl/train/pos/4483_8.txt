Everything a musical comedy should be. Gene Kelly (as Joe Brady) will not miss his step, and Frank Sinatra (as Clarence Doolittle) did not miss any notes. Scenes with them are very good, showing how many talents can add to a somewhat uneven story. "I Fall in Love Too Easily" Sinatra is the best example of him and his future. "Mexican Hat Dance" Kelly with a young Mexican girl is delightful. Kelly must have been nominated for the Best Actor award. And there are bushels of really fun lines, like: "Do you think the jacket is taking drugs?"; "Do you think someone is singing a sailor to sleep?"; and "We have little trouble, we chose a small child". Extremely pleasant movie, just a thing to get rid of dust from the recently completed World War II.
