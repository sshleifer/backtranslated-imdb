The film is about Anton Newcombe. The music and careers of both bands are just a background. It is fair that Newcombe has the last word about the film, which can be found in the "news" section of the brianjonestownmassacre. I would link it here, but IMDb will not allow it. <br /> <br /> Documentaries are limited by what the camera does, as well as by the need to collect a coherent narrative from somewhat accidental occasions when the case has placed the camera lens in a straight line with the appropriate case. At Dig!, The fortune smiled at Dandy Warhols, captured their rise to the status of pop-idol candidates, because they created slick-made pop sweets for mass consumption, in particular "Bohemian Like You", a song that made them world favorites by advertising on mobile phone. <br /> <br /> There is no luck for Brian Jonestown's massacre. The film does not really reflect what made the original BJM composition great, except for a single montage lasting about a minute, showing Newcombe creating / recording several short instrumental parts, undetectable in itself and ending the sequence of reproducing the lush, flickering sounds that had to be to be in the mind and soul of Newcombe before they could enter the world. <br /> <br /> Three comments accompany the film; one by filmmakers, and two by members of bands (BJM is only former members and without Newcombe). Both Warhols and BJM graduates indicate this assembly sequence as the "best" piece in the film and I agree that given the focus on Anton Newcombe's film, this is the only part of the movie that sheds the light on his movie gift and seems too short to give proper balance to this attempted portrait of a "tortured artist". <br /> <br /> An interesting thing in the comments is that unlike the movie, they are recorded in real time - one long shot - which can be more sensational than a document that is shaped mainly through editing. <br /> <br /> Dandies does not fall out in his comments. If the world of rock and roll extends the life experience in high school for its inhabitants - I think it is - Dandie is overpowering, those who listen to rock because his peers do it, while the BJM team comes out half-rejected, half-exiled outsiders (for insiders like Dandies, "losers") who are a real rock spirit. Joel Gion from BJM, who says "LOT," gives me the message of the movie when he says (paraphrasing): "You can not forget that Anton was able to do the only thing he ever said he would like to do. great music. "<br /> <br /> In the meantime, Dandie laughs too easily at every outrageous show during the Newcombe crash (all of BJM's material ends in 1997, before Newcombe gives up heroin). Discounting Courtney Taylor-Taylor's commitment to Newcombe in his vision is summarized as follows: "He is 37 years old and still lives in his car. You can download all of your work on your website. He was so tired that he was cheated by everyone else. Give it all away. He could make mint. You can practically hear him shaking his head in disbelief. <br /> <br /> Film defects can not be blamed by the creators; rather, the difficulties of the documentary form and the loss of cooperation through the subject of the film make this portrait of Newcombe so fragmentary. But that's probably the best we'll get, beyond his music. <br /> <br /> I only rented a drive that has this function. Most of the addons are on the second disk. Not renting it, just like I placed an order to buy a set.
