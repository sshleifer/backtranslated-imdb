Rea, Sutherland, DeMunn and von Sydow (in a small role) are brilliant in their performances. Sutherland is particularly adept at this kind of role, where he must represent a character whose morality is initially uncertain to the public. As is often the case with Sutherland heroes, we must ask: "is he a villian [in this case smaller] or a hero?" <br /> <br /> This is a disturbing story, intelligently told about the incompetence and frightening bureaucracy in the old Union Soviet, which hampered the efforts of extremely competent people. As Sutherland points out, "the measure of bureaucracy is its ability to avoid exceptions." The "meeting of the committee" (between the protagonists of Rei and Sutherland) after the enforcement of perestroika, with its revelations, has a huge emotional impact. You can feel the suffering of devoted people who have worked in this system. <br /> <br /> A handful of dramatic scenes depicting the members of the victims' family adds emotional response to the influence of the story. It is rarely a feature of the movie with this disgusting theme, but it effectively reminds us that the victims had a life and were loved. <br /> <br /> This is a sad but very important movie that deserved its showcase in Canada History TV.
