I love Tudora Chirila and maybe that's why I liked the movie so much. Two days before the film's premiere, I went to see his concert. Before the movie, I saw the trailer and the movie "zmeu" and I thought that everything worked out ... I made a mistake: instead of a good movie I helped a great guy! SENSE film. it was sad .. it was fun .. but above all, it showed LOVE ... I can not even begin to describe the soundtrack ... so I will not be :) I'm not a film critic .. I can "describe it in a few words .. My vague description It's all because art left me without a word .. thank God for the keyboard :) Thank you Tudor Giurgiu, thank you Maria Popistas, thank you Ioana Barbu and THANK YOU TUDOR CHIRILA. Bis! :)
