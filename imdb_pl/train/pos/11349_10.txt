This movie may have a dubious pedigree because it was created for television, but it's one of the best movies I've seen. The film and its actors have won several awards. It is captivating, fascinating and will consume you completely. The story of pursuing the killer in the Iron Curtain of Russia by people who are willing to risk a career to try to save the lives of future victims would be a fascinating tale if it were fiction - but supposedly a real story. I would highly recommend.
