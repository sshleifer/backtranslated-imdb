I'm not sure if it was good or bad, but I've read other comments before watching a short one. I must say that I do not agree with most of the negative comments or problems people have with this. <br /> <br /> For the first time, the director / producer of "Lone Wolf" likes to see things that I can aspire to, not necessarily from professionals, but by people just as wet as me. <br /> <br /> If so, it is also first-hand, as I read, I approve of the effort. A great job in this regard! There have been comments about music. I thought it was quite nice for this piece. Some say that for some time it bit a bit, but I discovered that it created tension without (us) having to be aware and when he pulled the gun and the guitar began to munch the chords, it was as if we knew there was a train on the tracks, but We realize that it is moving. Yes, there is a slip / clip by 180 degrees, but it happens shi *. Has anyone seen how dirty Hugh shirt turns white (late in the rain) in "Australia"? See how much money and people were behind this movie! Give the child a break for God's sake! All in all, I think it was very well done. Only two things I would like to mention are not worth mentioning - do not approach the shiny brass photo frame with the camera, and I would show a splash at the beginning of the pictures to take a picture, so people would not necessarily know what it is. <br /> <br /> My previous experience has taught me that it is not difficult to make a movie, but you just have to learn how to do it, then it's time to do it, then it's better to spend some more time, to come up with all the details you need to do before you call "post-production time!" IMHO, it looks like the director / writer Ryan Jafri has done his homework, and if it really is his first report card, I would give him "A". The rest of you report to the head office to get a bridge.
