I'm going to keep it pretty succinctly not to spoil you. This movie is amazing. From the beginning to the end it is full of real chills. The battle scenes are fantastic, the chase scenes are fascinating and move so fast that at the end of explaining things really felt slow, but it was only because everything that preceded them. Damon is shining and he really turned out to be a very solid actor, bold, so you would not believe him in that role. He is the role. Welcome addition to the series in David Straithrain (I hope I wrote so close to the right) as a clever CIA agent who killed Bourne. It is endless and will really leave you on the edge of your seat most of the way. Some things at the end are simply ridiculous, which negates the grade 10. The ending is open to sequels and I hope they will consider doing more because no one was wrong. An excellent movie in total and a fantastic ending to the incredible trilogy. <br /> <br /> P.S. The trembling camera did not hurt any action, but I still think that we could do without it. The good news is that you really only notice it when people speak, not so much.
