This timeless proverb resounds in this film and in my heart. I've waited so many years to see this eternal history! Maybe I was not ready. It is possible that my sensitivity would not appreciate his power. I greet him in my soul with gratitude. <br /> <br /> My respect and admiration for PAUL MUNI was long. His is now a legendary luminescence. But now I finally discovered the priceless gifts of the great talents of LUISE RAINER. Oh, how many faces can speak the same as hers? Some said that it was due to her silent years, and this could only be her speech, it is sufficiently eloquent when a chance is given. She deserved her Oscar. <br /> <br /> This movie is epic in the most classic proportions. All parts are equal, necessary and perfect. Speakers may leave if they so desire, but they would avoid a story that stays with one for life. <br /> <br /> GOOD EARTH enriches in a way that you do not expect. But all of this will not come out with the joy I've made. But I can only hope that this film will be remembered for many years. <br /> <br /> Do not provoke me with the usual details about the race of the main players. These are the expectations of modern times when we are obsessed with perfection. But I dare to have a million points of newer films to tell the story of PEARL BUCK with such poignant, powerful, persuasive and grace. <br /> <br /> If any contemporary artist would dare to make this masterpiece again, I warn them that he will never come close to the aromatic fragrance that still emanates from the core of the story. Time will not reduce this effort, and progress will not improve its size.
