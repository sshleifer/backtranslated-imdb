Paul Reiser is one of my favorite people in show business. I have read both of his books and think that he is great. Peter Faulk can deliver a blow with the best of them. The combination of both is magical. <br /> <br /> This is a story about a family that really gets to know each other. In the journey, father and son join for the first time in a family crisis. They do everything that fathers and sons have to do in life ... they just do it much later. Situations are very funny, but they have a feeling that they can happen to people in real life (it is not too indecent or cartoon). This is the first time I am watching Paul Reiser and I have fully believed in every emotion presented. Sometimes his eyes look so sad. <br /> <br /> Gret a movie and a great story and story. He has comedy and excitement, but the uplifting message ... Olympia Dukakas does a great job :)
