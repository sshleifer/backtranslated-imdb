Of all film noirs from the 1940s and 1950s, it should be considered one of the strangest and the most pleasant to watch. I say this because of the four main actors: Orson Welles, Rita Hayworth, Everett Sloane and Glenn Anders. <br /> <br /> The first two names are all known, but the last two made this movie so funny to me, especially Anders. His character, "George Grisby", is one of the strangest people I've seen in the film. His voice and some of the things he said must be heard to be believed. Slaone is not far in the "weird" category. Hayworth is not so glamorous with short blond hair, but he's still Hayworth, which means you're a guy. Welles is as fascinating as ever. One tip: if you have a DVD, turn on English subtitles. His character in this movie is Irish and you need subtitles to understand everything he says. <br /> <br /> Welles has directed the movie, which means that you have great viewing angles and great close-ups of your face. You also have a unique ending visually with shooting at the house of mirrors. A great thing! As bizarre as this movie, I still thought that the carnival-like atmosphere at the end of the rehearsal was too great and took away the seriousness of the scene. In addition, there are no complaints. <br /> <br /> It's great entertainment, which is the name of the game.
