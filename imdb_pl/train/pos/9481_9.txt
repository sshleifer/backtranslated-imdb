Xiao Chen Zhi Chun is a great movie, not only in the year in which he was filmed, but also now. It is an artistic film that is not outdated even in the 21st century. The director retained a good narrative skill, thanks to which the story became so smooth! <br /> <br /> The film reminds me of the later French film of the new wave: "Femme d'a cote" by Francois Truffaut on a similar subject.
