"Now in the sunny climate of India, where I spend my time as a soldier in the service of Her Majesty ..." - this is the famous poem written by Rudyard Kipling. This is the literal basis on which the movie "Gunga Din" is based. If you are lucky enough to watch this legendary classic, you will enjoy the movies the way they do them; for pure pleasure. Taken from the screenplay of the well-known novelist and poet, this is the story of a modest Indian Gung Din (Sam Jaffe) who works as a "colonel" during the British occupation of India in the eighteenth century. His greatest wish is to become a soldier. The water boy is part of the British Calvary contingent threatened with death by the known Kali cult called "Raider". Three special soldiers stand out in this company, who are known for their courage and camaraderie. At first he is handsome and debonair, Cary Grant plays Sgt. Archibald Cutter. Next is Victor McLaglen as a courageous sergeant. MacChesney and finally is extravagant Douglas Fairbanks Jr. Thomas Ballantine. The three of them and their comrades of soldiers are surrounded by the treasure of mountain constrictors led by their fanatical leader called "Guru" (Eduardo Ciannelli). Amid the Chaos of War is a brave water boy who hopes to take a place in the army by playing the bugle he found. A solid story for an old black and white film that requires a small fanfare for anyone who wants to enjoy the classic. ****
