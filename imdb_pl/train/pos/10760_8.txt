"9/11", hosted by Robert DeNiro, presents material from outside and inside Twin Towers in New York on September 11, 2001. <br /> <br /> He was never too frightening and bloody, but powerful and moving. "9/11" is a real treat. Anyone who is not moved by this TV program is immune to everything. <br /> <br /> 5/5 stars - <br /> <br />
