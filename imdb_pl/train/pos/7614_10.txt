I have an obsession! The story is amazing, and the series is very addictive, but I love it. I'm in Season 2, drive 5 and I'm telling you that I'm too attached to the character right now. In order for anything bad to happen to them, it would seriously affect my vote for the exhibition. And Michael is now on my list. I'm kidding ... I'm happy that it's Season 3 because I was scared to go to drive 6 thinking it would end. I can not wait to see the rest now. Thanks to the directors / producers / actors Lost ... I like watching TV again. Before Lost, I was looking at every channel that was sad because of my disappointment on TV, but I must say that Lost is my entertainment!
