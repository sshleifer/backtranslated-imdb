"This Man's Navy" is, as other comments have pointed out, a rare and well-eyed look at lighter than navy (LTA) actions. LTA crews were rightly proud of the fact that the convoys they were tracking never lost their ship to an underwater attack. And filming in various NAS locations gives a valuable look at the type of aviation that has long passed. However, the first half of the film concerns Beery, his relationship with the service buddies, as well as meeting characters of Tom Drake and his mother and repairing Drake's leg. Only then the second movie begins. The second film is mainly LTA in action, taking sub surface, the guys are killed and causing a lot of damage. I look quite harsh and realistic, I think. Then we go to Southeast Asia. Did the Navy have LTA there? Never mind, this part is really wild, and the airship is used to bring down jungle planes shot down. And the Japanese are shooting like crazy. The shades of Vietnam, except the escape is oh, so calm. This is the airship we're talking about. In the end, the well-being of World War II has a very unusual part of the war.
