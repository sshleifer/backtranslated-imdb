I saw Dick Tracy when I was very young. I did not know who any of the actors were and I did not know that the film would be different than the way it was shown. I definitely enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Warren Beatty appears as a detective criminal from 1930. Dick Tracy, who chases the biggest heads of the crowd in the city. This time Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino) killed a very powerful man and intends to take over the city together with his girlfriend singer Breathless Mahoney (Madonna), who has an eye on Tracy. It gets worse because a new criminal comes in, and the worst part is that the criminal has no face. He or she is very unknown. In addition, the famous villians are back from the comic book collection. <br /> <br /> I thought that this movie is very colorful and creative. It was fun and fun to watch, especially as a child. Warren Beaty was like James Bond from the thirties, just like Dick Tracy played. <br /> <br /> The cast includes: Charlie Korsmo, Glenn Headly, William Forsythe, Dustin Hoffman, James Caan, Ed O'Ross, Tommy Lee Jones, Mandy Patinkin, Charles Durning. Plus more! <br /> <br /> Dick Tracy is a movie for all ages and is a fun movie for the family. You have my word.
