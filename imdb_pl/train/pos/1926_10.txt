In 1967, I visited the glider on Lake Elsinore and flew the yellow Pratt Read glider. Returning to Germany, the above serious situation concerned television, and one segment concerned glider flights at high altitudes in California in the early 1950s. (The real pilot of life was Bill Ivans, I do not know who played it in the show). Ever since I saw this segment, I have been looking for it and I was wondering if it is available somewhere. (other segments in this serious case concerned the baker's launch station, an instrument for finding avalanche victims, etc.
