A late, excellent Z-class filmmaker who is great at races, Al Adamson really surpassed himself in this incredibly weird sci-fi soft-core of the cruelty of musical comedy that sits in wonderful gloomy and gloomy depths in pure celluloid stupidity and stunning stupidity. In the gloomy totalitarian future of 2047, sex was considered an illegal act of a powerless, idiotic controller, like a big brother with a big brother (funnierly silly Erwin Fuller). However, Cinderella's sweet'n'sexy (Catherine Erhardt's radiant blonde Cutie Pie) remains determined to change everything for the better. With the help of the effeminate Fairy Father (extravagant Jay B. Larson), Cinderella takes part in a festive ball with a specific plan to seduce handsome student Tom Prince (dorky Vaughn Armstrong) and teaching everyone that baby is positive, pleasant and totally acceptable activity . <br /> <br /> Adamson directs this absurd yarn with his usual incompetence, staging incredibly horrible "indecent songs and dance sequences with a completely side lack of skill and talent. The noisy disturbing issue of "We All Need Love" with people in absurd animal costumes awkwardly boasting the forest is a fun terrifying miracle; similar to the nasty routine of "Mechnical Man", in which there are a lot of clumsy, playful robots. Raw, static cinematography of Louis Horvarth, trashy plastic miniatures, Sparky Sugerman's throbbing disco sound, abundant gratuitous nudity (thrilling brunette hottie Sherri Coyle deserves special praise in this special section), brain-tormenting infantile humor (Roscoe Irritating robots law is particularly annoying), and evenly horrible performances (a scandalously repulsive portrait of Renee Harmon depicting a wicked gravestone, Cinderella cop is a great reward) even more impressive with the abundance of cordiality that can be enjoyed in this wonderfully terrible doozy.
