I saw this movie on the Hallmark channel and thought it was wonderful, especially since it was based on a real human being. Pierce Brosnan was very good as a lonely Englishman who adopted the personality of the half-breed Gray Owl. Photography was beautiful. <br /> <br /> This film has forced me to continue researching this character Archie Belaney, known as Gray Owl. I want to read about it as much as I can. At the time, I did not know that Richard Attenborough was directing him. But I'm not surprised. I like all his films, regardless of whether he plays or directs. I gave him the highest rating. However, I would like to see more in the film about why he adopted this personality because he showed only two aunts who brought him up and his room at home. <br /> <br /> You can not go wrong with this movie, if you're like me and enjoy the beautiful story, not hearing the foul language and inventing special effects every few minutes.
