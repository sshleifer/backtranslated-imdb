JAMES STEWART plays an FBI agent who started working with the agency before he was called the FBI, and the story deals with dealing with Ku Klux Klan, prohibition gangsters, German and Japanese spies from World War II, etc. years of history; definitely better than any films created today. <br /> <br /> Particularly interesting for older viewers familiar with Washington. In the scene, about 20 minutes into the movie - where James Stewart finds out from Very Miles that he is expecting his first child - the scene was shot at Herzog's Seafood Restaurant on Washington's former waterfront, the only movie in which this historic location appears. Shortly after taking office, President Kennedy decided that southwestern Washington, in a 99% black neighborhood, was unpleasant and should be demolished. Decree corresponding to his position of the undisputed royal family, the entire area, including the popular restaurant district by the water, but excluding the three historic churches; it was reduced to debris. Black residents displaced from homes were moved as best as they could without federal assistance; similarly, enterprises were simply withdrawn from the operation, few were transferred. Restaurant Row was transformed into a pavement, and Washington did not have a wharf (restaurants, seafood stands, boats, etc.) for about 10 years. As a resident of all life, the scene at the Herzog restaurant was our first reason to see this great movie again.
