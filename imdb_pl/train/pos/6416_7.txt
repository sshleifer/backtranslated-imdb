Men of Honor stars Cuba Gooding Jr., like the real Navy Diver Carl Brashear, who opposed the navy of a man to become the first African Navy diver. Sometimes, at his side, and sometimes at his opponent, there was one man whom Carl Brashear really admired. His name was Master Chief Billy Sunday (Robert DeNiro). Sunday in many ways pushed, worsened and helped Carl to become the man he wanted to be. <br /> <br /> I loved Kuba in this movie. His image here is as liberating and as powerful as Denzel Washington in The Hurricane. Thanks to each scene, we see his passion, motivation and persistence to achieve his dream. We see in him a fight when he sets out to make the father proud. I also loved the way the director created and caused many tensions in some key diving scenes. Brashear's meeting with the submarine during the rescue mission is terrifying and brilliant. <br /> <br /> The only disadvantage I could see would have to be an auxiliary cast. Characters from Kuba and DeNiro are very complicated and exciting to watch. What makes you a little sad when you have to hit your head with such two-dimensional supporting characters. Bad Lieutenant Cmdr. Hanks, Sunday wife (Charlize Theron), an eccentric colonel in a diving school (Hal Holbrook) and interest in Cuba's love are characters who did not have much depth. What could have made these characters more meaningful and more effective is a bit more time for their development. Why was this colonel always in his tower? Why was the Sunday wife so bitter and always drunk? <br /> <br /> Another interesting question must be this. What happened to Carl Brashear's wedding? I mean, if this film chronicles the life of this man, will not his wedding be a major event? Maybe it's just me. However, people of honor are a perfect example of the triumph and faith that embraces the human spirit. This film will inspire and force you to feel the fight with this man. I believe that this was the reason why this powerful story was told. My hat goes to you, Carl Brashear. I really admire your strength. <br /> <br />
