You'd better see this episode from the beginning, because if you start watching it later, you'll be confused about what's happening with Clark's life. <br /> <br /> But this is a twist; Clark is in an alternative reality. Lana is devoted to him. Lex lost most of his legs and was in a wheelchair because of an accident on the bridge when he turned to avoid Clark in the pilot series. Marta is the wife of Lionel. The only constant is his most loyal friend, Chloe, who still believes in who he is. And yes, there are no superpowers. He is in a psychiatric facility for being put in a fantasy world in which he has the power and is ridiculed for believing in it. In addition to Chloe, there is one mysterious figure who believes in Clark: a black man who in alternative reality is also a resident of an institution who believes he is from Mars. <br /> <br /> Clark must remain faithful to everything he believes is a real reality, and he will not be brainwashed by the psychiatrist of the institution, who is actually the fourth escapee of the Phantom Zone. <br /> <br /> This episode is absolutely amazing and shocking. In addition, it provides a new return from the typical "Smallville" episode.
