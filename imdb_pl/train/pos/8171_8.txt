I realize that this review will cause me to be broken by experienced film critics patrolling this site, but I will defend this film. <br /> <br /> A dentist is a really good movie. Acting is not always at the highest level, but the emotions are good and the story is good. Plus, you see Boobs Linda Hoffman. Not that I am an expert in this field, but the direction seems good and the plot makes sense. Corbin is a great, terrible dentist. This is what dentists do to Jaws with sharks ... ish. Of course, he had quite a limited budget, but he dealt with it well and developed characters (those that matter). <br /> <br /> the end.
