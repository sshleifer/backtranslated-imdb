A captivating, captivating story about an American army conqueror who has to prove his innocence to avoid kata. Paul Ryker avoids a friendly fire in a seemingly doomed attempt to convince a military court that he was actually a US spy in a secret mission in Korea. <br /> <br /> In the style of classic court dramas "Sergeant Ryker" is an extremely well-crafted mystery, skilfully guided by an outstanding cast, constant impetus of director Kulik and effective twists and turns. <br /> <br /> This film was originally made as a television movie in 1964, and then enriched by this revision with the participation of many "registered" actors and some action sequences. Dillman, reactivating his role, is in place as a defense lawyer whose attention sometimes goes to the personal situation of the supportive, but somewhat distant wife of Riker, applauded by Vera Miles. The first line of the front is Peter Graves for the prosecutor's office, and Norman Fell and Murray Hamilton in the key supporting roles. <br /> <br /> Paul Ryker's interpretation by Marvin is a balanced image of a simple but devoted man whose normal posture is questioned by the desperate circumstances in which he was placed. Marvin changes perfectly from resigned indifference, from passionate determination, giving a convincing, often intense performance, which is the climax of this otherwise small drama. This spectacle should raise the film to the platform, where it takes place on the best in the history of court dramas. <br /> <br /> However, despite the apparent oblivion, "Sergeant Ryker" still remains a tense and convincing exam, like a book you simply can not put down. Highly recommended.
