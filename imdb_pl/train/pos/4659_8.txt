Without Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith, it could easily be a turkey. But they are brilliant. Ustinov is at its best, and for fans Maggie is great to see her in the early years, matching Ustinov at every step to what is happening in time. For fifties (and I'm in this range), it's always fun to see glimpses and hear the sounds of Swinging Sixties, and although this movie spends a lot of time in offices, it has a lot of nostalgia in the sixties, including red buses, Carnaby Street, song Lulu and the delicious waitress microtube, which England had never seen in public. As I.T. engineer, I know that computer hacking tricks are funny, but they should not be taken seriously. There are also wonderful stereotypes of Italians, French and Germans.
