And the film was also made for television, this movie was good. the acting and the plot were just great. it's one of the few movies I've seen that I felt distorted because after watching it I was afraid the Reaper would come kill me through the computer screen. There were only a few minor issues in this video, but it's easy to think about it. <br /> <br /> Antonio Sabbato Jr. played an excellent role in this film with Janine Turner and Robert Wagner. this movie has so much tension and made me want more because I never thought that a low-budget TV movie could be so powerful. After watching this, I read the novel on which the movie was based (four times) and it was kicked too well. If you ever see this movie on TV, I'd watch it. The effects in this movie were quite well done, to be honest I do not know what a live calming person would look like, but I was impressed with the way the FX team made the film and everything that showed it is that all of these bad ones were created for TV movies there with low budgets should not be so bad. <br /> <br /> look at this. It's really good, no, really!
