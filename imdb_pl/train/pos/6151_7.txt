I will always have a weakness for this Disney movie, another of their partial live animations, the purpose of which was to recreate the success of "Mary Poppins" and never succeeded. When I was in elementary school, from time to time we had a day with a movie, during which the whole school was dropped into the cafeteria, and the film was displayed in an old-fashioned way, many drums and everything. At the time, it seemed like a momentous event when the day came, and "Bedknobs and Broomsticks" is one of the movies I remember in this way. <br /> <br /> And from what I remember, it's quite charming. Angela Lansbury never assigns her name to anything that is not at least competent, and wins here as a witch with a magic bed (a boy who could be misunderstood, right?), Who can take her and a pair of young children on magical adventures in distant places. Come on, what kind of kid would not want such a bed? <br /> <br /> Class: A
