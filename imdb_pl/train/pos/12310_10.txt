Just read the original story written by Pu in the eighteenth century. What is striking is that the film hates the original spirit very much, although the plot has been greatly modified. The language of the film, the rhythm, the special effect come from Hollywood, but there is still the Chinese core. It's amazing how Hark Tsui managed to combine them together. The result is pure beauty.
