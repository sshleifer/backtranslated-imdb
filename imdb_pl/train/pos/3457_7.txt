This is Columbo, directed by Steven Spielberg at an early stage of his career. It's not sensational, but in this movie you can see a small note of the wonderful things that will come to Spielberg. The film is basically in the same style as most of Spierlberg's 70s and TV movies. This means that some characters tend to show quirks and no, I'm not just talking about the Columbo character itself. The kind of idiosyncrasies that are best seen in Spielberg's 1975 movie "Jaws". But apart from a few small clues of the typical early elements of Spielberg, this film can not be called a work - and a great example of the rising star of the director. It's not that bad, of course it's not, but as I said earlier, it's not too sensational either. <br /> <br /> This movie started really well and very promising, but after its great opening, in which as always the murder took place, the movie became more slow and boring to watch. Dull, because it's mainly a Columbo movie from a book that does not have really unforgettable moments in it, it's not boring, because it's a boring movie to watch. <br /> <br /> The murder itself was quite ingenious, and the concept of having a criminal writer murdering his writer showed a great and interesting potential. History, however, did not examine all its possibilities. At least that impression left me this movie. <br /> <br /> Still, the movie was still good to see thanks to the character of Jacek Cassidy, who thinks he is smarter than Columbo, because of his mystery / crime writing experience and trying to give him all kinds of possible tips, leading from each other. But of course Columbo knows better and is his first suspect from the first moment, but as usual he plays the game. <br /> <br /> The film has a good overall style and uses a small camera position and editing. The funny thing is that most of them were mostly consistent with Spielberg's later work, especially with some camera angles. <br /> <br /> A great and well-watched Columbo movie, but do not let Spielberg's name be added too high will increase your expectations. <br /> <br /> 7/10
