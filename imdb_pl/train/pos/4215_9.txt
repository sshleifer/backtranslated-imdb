In this great movie of the 20th century noir, the metropolis is a labyrinth of despair in which scavengers and predators survive, living with each other. Meditating city landscapes reduce miserable humanity in grim expressionist symbolism. <br /> <br /> The prostitute has a torn bag in the subway. It contains a microfilm, and the communist spy ring will try to recover. Two parallel investigations develop when both spies and cops are pursuing valuable information. <br /> <br /> The anti-hero pickpocket Skip McCoy plays with the contemptuous assurance of Richard Widmark. He knows that cops are his moral equal and intellectual lower, so he mocks them: "Go on," he says to Captain Dan Tiger (Murvyn Vye), "pick up the load. Throw me in. . "In this merciless world, clay is just one gang in the streets. Like Candy, a prostitute bribes Lightning Louie to get an advantage, so the police are busy paying pigeons for information. <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe that when Widmark did this movie, he was already at a young age. 39-year-old star, who is approaching the end of the contract with Fox, playing the initial Skip McCoy with the teenager's disrespect. Today, it may not be acceptable for a romantic leader to strike his interest in love with unconsciousness, and then revive it, spilling beer in the face, but through the customs of that period meant hardness - and yet Candy is a fallen woman. br /> <br /> Jean Peters is radiant like Candy. Here, in the midst of the five-year wave of film B's fame, she is beautiful and engages like a whore in a golden heart. He is the victim of this story, the martyr of his beauty just like everything else. He means well, but he's still being manipulated by cynical men - Joey, Skip and Clay. <br /> <br /> The real star of this movie is New York. Haunting city panoramas and subway stations offer a claustrophobic evocation of the city as a living, hostile force. Human figures, like worms in rotting cheese, roam the cities. Elevators, subway reels, sidewalks - even a stupid waiter acts as a channel for the flow of corrupt humanity. People stick to any niche that ensures security: Moe has his dirty, rented room, Skip his dark hut over the Hudson River. When characters move and interact, they are surrounded by bridge architecture or girders or are divided by hanging winches. The city's personality is constantly imposing. The angles and transverse beams of the coastal beams echo the street plan of the scaffolding, and the cabinets with indices on the deck mimic Manhattan's skyline. When Joey's exit from the subway is blocked, it is as if the steel tendons of the city were bustling him. <br /> <br /> The surprising part of this movie is shot in extreme close-ups. The character drives the story as it should, and close-ups are used to enlarge the character. When Skip interrogates Candy, the close-up registers sexual energy between them, reversing the hostility of Skip's words. The beauty of Jean Peters is painted with light, in exquisite close-ups. The device is also used to increase the voltage. The opening sequence, the purse, does not contain any dialogue: drama is based only on zooming in order to achieve a powerful effect. <br /> <br /> Scarecrows and spies on spies, fill the movie. Moe (Thelma Ritter) earns a living as an informer, and her place in the hierarchy is accepted, even by her victims. When Skip notices: "she must eat," she chants the recurring chorus. Like the "new" New Yorkers, they sell lamb chops or lumber, while Underworld smuggles the goods. <br /> <br /> And yet the pigeon doves are better than Joey and his communist friends. Joey's feet on Moe's bed symbolize the transgression of the most basic moral code. Joey is too pale. Maybe he will not trade with Joey, even to save his life: "... even in our poor company you have to draw a line somewhere." <br /> <br /> "Pick-Up" was created in the depths of the cold war. Richard Nixon was just elected Republican vice presidential candidate after he invented his name with the false Alger His - a false communist microfilm and everything. McCarthy's show trials were commonplace. We see the cops in the movie against the "traitors who gave Stalin the A bomb". <br /> <br /> New York can be seen as a giant vessel in which human tricks cheat, squeak and murder. Containers are the leitmotif in the whole film. Maybe he wears a box with trademarks, and a candy bag, a container with microfilm, is the driving force behind the plot. Skip holds his only possessions in a sunken crate, symbolizing his secret street wisdom. The coffins of destitute, shifting on a barge on Hudson, are containers with one more cargo moved around a merciless metropolis. <br /> <br /> The film is a masterpiece of composition. Candy is shown above the skull. Skip on the wobbly ladder of the hut, signifying its moral advantage. When the gun is placed on the table, the extreme perspective makes it look more than Candy - violence begins to eclipse compassion. Lovers are outshined by the shadow of a stash hook, reminding us that their love is neither pure nor absolute, but addicted to the vagaries of the sinister city. Enyard, a communist, is a shadow on the wall or a disembodied cigarette smoke. It is like a lonely cat among rubbish - the predatory ghost of the night. Photos from cameras under taxis, news kiosks and hospital bed bars are constantly reinforcing the awareness that we are all imprisoned in the metropolis. We are a civilization mulch.
