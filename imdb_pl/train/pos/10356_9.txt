In August 1980, the disappearance of baby Azaria Chamberlain and the trial of her parents, Linda and Michael, for the alleged murder of a child caused a clamor in the then very angry nation. Media and society have already tried and condemned the accused couple and sought for blood. Then there was a gross miscarriage of justice. <br /> <br /> Michael and Lindy Chamberlain claimed that while camping near Ayers Rock in central Australia, the dingoes took their ten-week-old daughter from their tent as they prepared to eat in the barbecue area. Nobody believed them. Lindy was accused of murdering his child, and Michael as an accessory after the fact. The whole country was full of whispers about ritual killing. Chamberlain's trial ended before it began. <br /> <br /> Lindy never proved her innocence, so she was found guilty. There was never enough evidence to convict her, but the jury was under pressure from the public and the media. How can we, as a nation, even judge? Where are we from, how would we suppose that we know? Unless there was absolute proof and there was no reasonable doubt, Chamberlains should have been acquitted. <br /> <br /> The film by Fred Schepisi unambiguously and wholeheartedly supports John Bryson's argument that Chamberlains were completely innocent of their charges. That in fact the dingo took Azaria's child to this memorable night at Ayers Rock. <br /> <br /> Schepisi perfectly captured the mood of the nation thirsty for blood, hell bent over "revealing the truth." It shows Australia in a rather inappropriate light as people who were obsessed with watching Chamberlains! His script, written together with Robert Caswell, stirs up emotions and will certainly see the audience grieved and angry at the travesty of justice that has taken place. <br /> <br /> Outstanding Meryl Streep gives an amazing performance as a woman accused of the most terrible acts. It revives the most convincing little Australian who was ready to face the allegations and straighten the world. Even her accent is almost, but not quite, on the spot. Very good effort of the master of this trade. Neill himself is as good as Streep as the first faithful, but then he disappoints Michael, who does not understand why their world is falling apart and begins to question his Christianity. His, like Streep, is a show of great emotional strength that will move you deeply. The entire cast of support is also excellent, and some of the best Australian actors and actresses play a role. <br /> <br /> From a technical point of view, the film is also brilliant, and the photography director Ian Baker captures this wonderful country with glamor (especially Rock). Editor Jill Bilcock keeps the film going all the time and is emotionally charged, while Bruce Smeaton provides a meaningful result. <br /> <br /> For all Australians it is a mandatory, shocking look in the mirror, if so, for what we, as a country, have made a family that just wanted justice and the truth to know. As Michael Chamberlain said: "I do not think anyone really understands what innocence means .... For innocent people. "<br /> <br /> Saturday, May 20, 1995 - Video <br /> <br /> Even when watching returns, Fred Schepisi's account of a parody of justice that met Chamberlains who lost their child Azaria in Ayres rock in 1980, it is still emotionally strong and sincerely moving. <br /> <br /> Schepisi and Robert Caswell have the ability to move John Bryson's novel to the screen, telling with simplicity the frightening story of Michael and Linda Chamberlain's unsuccessful vacation, whose newly born daughter Azaria was taken from her family tent by the dingo just moments after postpone. > <br /> Among the media speculations and a malicious public report, Lindy was charged with murdering her child, and Michael was charged with help after the fact. What happened after was only an attempt at the media, and when the Australians determined that she would be sent back, Lindy was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment with hard work, even though the accusation could not provide any motive and little more than circumstantial evidence. br /> <br /> Meryl Streep is in top form as an accused woman who fights Australia to prove her innocence. It's really amazing, and the only thing that fails, is a real Australian blue accent, but it's best with sound. One wonders why the best Australian actress has not been cast in the role, but the power of the stars is probably the answer. Next to Meryl is equally impressive Sam Neill, outstanding as a husband who sees his world falling apart before his eyes, while he feels powerless to do something about it. A strong Aussie cast provides attractive support. <br /> <br /> Editing with Jill Bilcock is very up-to-date, Ian Baker's pictures from rock and other raw locations are visually brilliant, and Bruce Smeaton's music is perfect for this part. Really a must for all conscientious Australians. <br /> <br /> Sunday, June 15, 1996 - Video
