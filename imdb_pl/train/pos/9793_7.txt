I give this film 7 out of 10, because the villains were interesting in their roles, and the unknown batwoman creates an interesting game "guess who". The film, however, requires more Robin. He appeared in the film at the beginning and sporadically for the rest. I always thought that the new animated series does not do justice to Robin's shapely new character, let alone Knightwing. This movie simply continues this bad tradition. The film devotes too much time to Bruce Wayne and his romance, which would not be so bad in one movie if the romance was not so incredible. It's still a good movie if you're a fan of Batman and I recommend watching it.
