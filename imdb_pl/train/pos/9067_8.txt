After forcing me to sit in real stinks (Racing Stripes, Shark Boy and Lava Girl) - I really enjoyed watching "Fried Worms". For the first time, I have not guessed the end! It was fun and funny, and despite the title, it did not resort to trashy humor. My boys (6 and 10 years) also LOVED - oh, and my 45-year-old "boy" had a smile on his face all the time. This is a family film that is not only tolerated by parents. A relationship with a younger brother is so close to real life. "He does not stop singing to upset me !!" Also, the way a new child tries to make friends and how these friendships actually form is appropriate for children's behavior. Of course, the parents have to be a bit silly - but my favorite scenes were related to my father's getting used to a new job. Have fun!
