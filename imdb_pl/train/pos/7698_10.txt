But this is a great movie about martial arts. Liu Chia Liang is second to none as a battle choreographer, only Sammo Hung is doing well. It can be seen immediately after his proud exhibition of technology - than flashy camera angles, etc. - during fights. The direction is strictly controlled, so as not only to excite the viewer with speed and movement, but also to impress her with a precisely displayed skill. This film also uses Liu's participation in front of the camera. Liu's performance on the banquet stage, with which the film opens, is one of the most important points in the history of kung fu. Liu is supported by the beautiful and talented Hui Ying Hung (about the fame of My Young Auntie) and "Hsiao Hou", whose acrobatics are breathtaking, and better than any number of wires. but with character and moral development along the way and the most appropriate resolution. Humor in this is also the best. If you only watch one kung fu movie, it would be a good choice - it has everything.
