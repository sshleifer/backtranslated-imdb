Talk about your dream cast - only two of the greatest actors who have appeared anywhere - Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith - together - in "Hot Millions", a funny, bizarre comedy starring Karl Malden, Robert Morley and Bob Newhart. Ustinov is a criminal who receives the resume of a talented computer programmer (Morley) and takes a position in a company run by Malden - for embezzlement. This is not smooth sailing; he caught the attention of a competitor in a company played by Newhart, and his neighbor, Maggie Smith (who knows him in a place of residence under another name), becomes his secretary for a short period. She can not keep her job and in the film she is seen in various professions - all this ends with her dismissal. When Newhart makes her progress, she invites Ustinov to her curry flat as a cover, but the two quickly decide that they are made for each other. Of course, he does not know that Ustinov is a crook. <br /> <br /> This is such a good movie - you can not but admire Ustinov and Smith and be fascinated by Ustinov's machinations, his genius and the way he slips out of trouble. But there is an ending that will show you who really has brains. Do not miss this movie that takes place in London in the 1960s. It's worth it if you only hear the groaning of Maggie Smith: "I was fired."
