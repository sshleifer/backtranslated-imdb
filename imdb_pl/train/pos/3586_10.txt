I saw it for the first time after the premiere over ten years ago. I saw it again today and it still had a big impact on me. She Fought Alone tells about a girl, Caitlin (played by Tiffani Thiessen), who was raped by Jace (played by David Lipper), a classmate who likes to hurt girls. Caitlin is in a popular high school clique, but when she reveals that she is raped, the clique turns against her, led by Ethan (played by Brian Austin Green). <br /> <br /> This film chronicles Caitlin's fight against the entire city, including high school, which basically allows athletes to identify the social environment, allowing them to escape everything they want. <br /> <br /> Thiessen and Green are the best performers and there is real chemistry between the two throughout the movie. All the actors of this film, inspired by the actual events, did a great job. She Fought Alone really captures the essence of what it's like to be in high school (at least in 1995) and have self-esteem and reputation. Recommended. 10/10
