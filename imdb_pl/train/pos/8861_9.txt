Andy says: "Nobody is hurt, everyone wins". Before he says that, we know that the opposite is true: everyone is wounded, no one wins. This is a new thread in American films, or maybe an old thread that has finally been restored. Think of "Eastern Promises", "There Will Be Blood", "No Country for Old Men". These films are dark, serious, extremely well made and do not care about happy endings. I love them. "Before the devil knows you are dead" fits the general description, but creates your own atmosphere. Kelly Masterson's debut scenario is as close as a Hollywood movie that will ever come to a Greek tragedy. Paying tribute to another veteran, director Stanley Donen, Sidney Lumet expertly and soberly turns this grim story into a great, old-school drama form. Initial shots, though dog-obese, his wife, have the appearance of a Dutch master. However, the drug dealer's flat looks more like the Mondrians series. Great performances around. Only the figure of Albert Finney Charles feels a bit exaggerated, eyes wide open and agape almost all the time. But then he has trouble deep, deeper than any trouble that most of us will ever know. To get compensation, Marisa Tomei is super hot. But of course you do not have to tell me that. Why her character Gina would like to be with a guy like Andy, we've never been told, but that's fine. In the end, the action is a character. The unique and magical touch of Carter Burwell's music makes this great movie a masterpiece. Do not miss it.
