Writers Perry and Randy Howze created a very interesting little story in "Chances Are". <br /> <br /> Using the idea of ​​a reincarnated man who returns home to his ex-wife many years later, the story takes unexpected, wonderful turns. <br /> <br /> Twenty-four years Robert Downey, Jr. provides a great performance, assisted by Cybil Shepherd as a widow and Ryan O'Neal as a good friend. <br /> <br /> This trio has the right chemistry for this caper, playing a graceful style. I watched the movie several times on TV and thought it was the most enjoyable one each time.
