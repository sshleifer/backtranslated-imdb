No news. No symbolism. No dark trends. Just a great melange of music, nostalgia and fun, which is made up of people who had a great time. It's a refreshing antidote to some of the pretentious garbage being thrown away by college. Of course, anything with the unrivaled Judi Dench is worth a look. And Cleo Laine's brilliant jazz song is a bonus. This lady is in the same league as the late Ella. It's happening on my movie shelf to be pulled out whenever I feel a need for a warm experience and a hearty chuckle. Just a great movie!
