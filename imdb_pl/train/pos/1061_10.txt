all the activities performed in the first season were really amazing. The first look at Max and Zach has Geneva Locke and Chris Lazar, or how I like to call them a minis. Minis are doing the best acting job I've ever seen. main actors and actresses, such as Jessica Alba Michael Weatherly, etc. make you forget that you are watching a fictitious movie t.v. show that they make this concert come alive. all in all it's the best concert I've ever watched
