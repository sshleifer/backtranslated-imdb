Will Smith is one of the best actors of all time. I do not know how he does it. I'm still reading books, but if there's a movie with Will Smith, I'll watch it. It has a rare gift of pulling you to the movie and holding you there. This movie is one of the best movies I've seen. I watched him on Saturday and I still can not get him out of my head. AMAZING and sad at the same time. Thank you again, Will. You need to watch this video from beginning to end to understand each part of the movie. You can not miss anything. Make sure you have a lot of Kleenex and your man / woman sitting next to you so that you can hug. WELL It's worth the price you pay for watching .. do not wait for it to appear on TV.
