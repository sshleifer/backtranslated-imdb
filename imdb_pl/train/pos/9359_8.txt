The touch of this movie was amazing. Adam Sandler's performance was very inspiring. As he played a very lost and fragile figure, he used his skill to the very end and really worked in that role. His character was really interesting. I see that I'm reading the script for this movie and I'm not half interested in the part that Sandler did to me. For someone who plays predominantly comedy roles, he played an important role in what seemed to be his own idiosyncrasies and contributions. I especially liked the scene in which the characters Adam and Don rode a motorized scooter around the city. I got to know the moment because it seemed that Don was a witness to one thing that Adam is doing to get away from it all. With his video games, music and many other things that he does not want to think about the past, riding a scooter with headphones on it seemed like an escape from thoughts. This movie is definitely worth a look.
