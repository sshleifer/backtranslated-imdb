Dr. Feinstone is a dentist. He has a beautiful wife and a huge house with a pool. Suddenly, he discovers that his wife works with the pool's caretaker - he realizes that everything is clean, there is a breakdown. He begins to torture his patients ... Corbin Bernsen is brilliant as a mad dentist - he is completely credible. Surprisingly, there are not many gore, but the scenes of dental torture are quite nasty and grotesque. I would highly recommend.
