Few movies can be watched almost 60 years later, but they are still as engaging as this one. Technological progress does not date this classic love story. The applied special effects are remarkable in the film from 1946. Acting is great. David Niven, Kim Hunter, and especially Roger Livesey, do a great job. The use of black and white / color enhances the creative character of the film. For 20 years it has not been seen on television, so few people are aware of its existence. This is my favorite movie of all time. Expectation and hope for the DVD release of this movie for so many years is in itself "A Matter of Life and Death".
