I saw this movie for the first time when I was browsing through the channels of my parents DirecTV. He was on the Sundance channel and it was just beginning. I love music, especially the late 1960s, and that's the sound of BJM (The Dandys are okay). Everything about Brian Jonestown's massacre intrigued me from the music, personality of Anton and Joel, to illegal drug use. It was fun because when I watched the first party scene, when everyone was making lines, my parents passed by and decided to watch (the look on their faces was priceless). In any case, this is definitely one of my favorite movies, because he introduced me to The Brian Jonestown Massacre, which is now my favorite band of all time. <br /> <br /> just look ... seriously
