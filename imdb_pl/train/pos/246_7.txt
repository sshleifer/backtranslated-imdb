How could I give up the opportunity to see Orlando Bloom and Heath Ledger together? Well, I could not, so I rented this movie mess. <br /> <br /> I have never heard of Ned Kelly and I was surprised by what I learned about the legend of this young man. I was also surprised at how average the movie was. Perhaps the fact that he was very, very late and at the end of the 4-hour film marathon, and perhaps because it is really a bit slow, I find this story difficult to follow. Not because history is complicated, but because it is slow. Even with a slow history Ledger and Bloom managed to create interesting, dimensional figures. <br /> <br /> Although I can not recommend it, it's a great story of Australian history (considering how young this country is, it is very rare and should be appreciated), and the movie has some good action sequences. <br /> <br /> 6/10 see it for historical value .... (yes, true ... and this is the only reason to see it ...;))
