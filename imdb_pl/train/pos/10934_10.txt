After reviewing this intense martial arts film for the first time in nearly 18 years, I must say that he has not lost anything of his mysticism or any of his amazing martial arts, as I remembered from his youth. The story of a dying martial instructor sending his "unfinished" student to find 5 former members of his Clan of Poisons, so they do not look for a fortune which the master's friend hides. Fearing that his last student does not have enough training, he instructs him to make friends with one of the five "venoms" to defeat the other four. <br /> <br /> I can not say enough about choreography or working with a camera. A great movie in itself and quite possibly one of the best martial arts films. CLASSIC!!
