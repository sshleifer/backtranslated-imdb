Although I bought a DVD after its first release and watched it several times, I never wrote a review. <br /> <br /> I loved her when I saw her for the first time and I still love her. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it seems that he never earned enough to motivate anyone to continue. I have to assume that QT still controls the rights, but after Kill Bill, if he makes a film as true to comics and books as My Name is Modesty, with another hard female guide, anyone who does not know this character will see it as a profession. <br /> <br /> Peter O'Donnell wrote his stories to focus more on the psychic suspense than on the action thriller. <br /> <br /> Dragging the will between Modesty and Miklos is very true to the source material and is tight, tense and fascinating for anyone who does not have to have gore and explosions. Alexandra did a great job by playing how O'Donnell's character would take control of the situation. <br /> <br /> I find this especially before the curve, after much needed rebands of Batman and James Bond. After two gloomy previous efforts, though not so well known to the public, this is really a humble character reboot and it's really sad that there will probably be more videos about her.
