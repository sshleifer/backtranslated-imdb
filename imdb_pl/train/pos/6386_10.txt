Disney, the name of the movie, which once meant everything innocent and appropriate for all ages, finally began to realize that in order to survive, it must become more diverse. Such diversity has been very evident in the last few years. Films such as "Tarzan" and "The Emperor's New Groove" have made an attempt to move away from the traditional, song-driven routine of Disney's past to new, unknown territory. "Atlantis" is the boldest step, but we must remember: this is STILL Disney. The first major film from the Disney animation studio is a great achievement for them - in fact, it is so serious that it hits the territory of PG. Perhaps because many families were scared to see it last summer. <br /> <br /> But despite the more mature subject matter, it is still a movie that Disney wanted to draw in families, not only mature audiences, so the plot had to be simple enough for children to understand it, but interesting enough, to take her from the kingdom of "Little Mermaid" and others <br /> <br /> So what we get is actually a potentially detailed plot, unfortunately suffering a condensation blow to a 96-minute movie. Ultimately, this is an action movie about Atlantis, not about the exposure that precedes it, so we are persecuted for the first half hour with many sequences bombing the screen as possible without losing consistency. Suspend your disbelief about how fast heroes move from point A to point B, you probably will not find an animated movie that would come out of Hollywood! If you want epic levels of detail in the storyline, turn to James Cameron "Titanic". Both films present the boat in some way. <br /> <br /> And let's talk about love, right? As with many films, the main man (one Milo Thatch, an inept archaeologist) and the main woman (Kida, clichéd princess princess) are in love with each other. But what I found was not as banal as I expected. After the end of the film, once the touch / feeling / kissing of the characters was much more subdued. There are many points in the film in which the attraction is attracted, but it simply is not in "say" The Little Mermaid (good thing). <br /> <br /> You may have understood that it is rather a cliché movie. Correct. You have your main character and heroine, supported by over half a dozen crew members who set out on a journey, and all have their moments during the movie. Numerous other characters appear, take a few minutes and then disappear. You do not need a genius to do math? A 96-minute movie with an accent on action and visuals, with a considerable cast, has very little time to expand the heroes to a large extent. What is it about? Cliches and many of them. Each character emulates something that has been done a thousand times before. You have an inept scientist, an attractive princess, a colonel with square jaws, a rich eccentric, a maniac sagata, a Russian femme fatale ?? I need to go on. <br /> <br /> I do not know why it came to anyone? I decided that this movie is quite funny. Okay, this is going to be a serious movie, but do you really expect Disney to give up every feature of its history? At least the writers have tried to come up with a consistently witty dialogue, and sometimes it's even a bit inspired. <br /> <br /> But in the end, these wonderful, stunning visualizations create the icing on this cake. CGI animation is really amazing in some places and does not obscure the characters, which was a disadvantage that allowed the recent "Titan A.E." down. Speaking of characters, Disney employed an external comic book artist to create projects, bringing an anime style to the movie. In fact, the visual presentation of the whole movie owes much to the anime, much more than any previous Disney trip. This caused a conflict with fans of the Japanese anime "Nadia" for the general similarity of the film to the aforementioned series of cartoons. Not seeing this anime, I can not comment. <br /> <br /> There is sound with the picture. Gary Rydstrom heads the sound band and what a soundtrack! From the first opening, the sound stage is alive and is a treat. James Newton Howard treats us as a dynamic musical score that compliments the film in every way, never sounds out of place and always helps to build up tension or suppress it. <br /> <br /> Maybe I missed the sense of what the creators intended. For me, the movie shows that it is an adventure ride, though with a more serious tone than any previous Disney movie. If you do not like the stereotypical attitude with the tongue, then perhaps the effort put into the visuals will be delighted. Heck, at least mythology is much more correct than one would say about other Disney efforts (* cough * Hercules * cough *). <br /> <br /> This is positive, 10 out of 10 reviews, from someone who has been kidnapped by this movie. I always suspend my disbelief with every animated movie? in the end, the laws of the real world are often broken in the medium of cartoons. Sit comfortably, enjoy the ride and maybe everyone will find something for themselves in this film.
