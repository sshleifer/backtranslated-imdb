This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. My parents come from rural India and I have seen the lives of peasants to some extent. People are really poor and have financial and social problems. <br /> <br /> The film reflects exactly the same. Full appreciation for the director and actor. They did a great job. I'm just wondering how films like Lagaan and Paheli can go to Oscar, not Doghi. I do not understand the criteria for choosing movies. Whether money that makes a difference or having big names in a movie makes a difference. <br /> <br /> I hope that in the future we will see more such films.
