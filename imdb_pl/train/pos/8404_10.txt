A simple but good-natured movie about riding in a circle with a simple but good-natured high school graduate who dreams of having the coolest custom van in the world to be his "ballroom". <br /> <br /> Bobby, our hero, spends all his savings on buying the vehicle of his dreams. Joining Bobby together, sharing his love of quick start-ups with girls, he took in a local pizzeria, but he learns of great responsibility, danger and heartache, being the owner of such a mechanical miracle. <br /> <br /> Van is my guilty pleasure. He captures the mood in the mid-70s and has a rather unintentional humor to put him in the category "so bad that it's good".
