First of all, let me say that although I know what I mean about star wars, I'm not a fanatic. I do not know how many chromosomes the Wampy rat has or the extended TK427 family. I know that: Star Wars, all movies (less with episode 2), did something magical. It's hard to say what button Lucas found and boldly pressed, but it works. Star Wars is more than a movie. this is an idea. <br /> <br /> How can you ask? I'll explain. Star Wars affect the most universal stereotypes, good and evil. it does so clearly, so deeply that literally every person in any environment can understand this. Episode VI is doing well, ending the epic struggle between the son and his used and manipulated father, but also, with the addition of prequels, reveals even more memories back. suddenly it's Darth Vader in the front, and viewers realize that this is Anakin's story, not just Luke. but even before 1-3 there was an incredible depth. it was as if the capsule had fallen from heaven to Lucas' knees, describing the historical history of the distant galaxy. <br /> <br /> Star wars are definitely something far above the norm and I must admit, whenever I see them, especially this one, I feel very small. I feel as if I have been pushed into a world where good and evil are so clearly defined. I feel a tingling sensation when I see them, the feeling that something has somehow touched me, more than any physical thing could hope.
