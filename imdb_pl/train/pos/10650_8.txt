I rented this movie last weekend, launched a surround sound system and received a great sound with special effects. This movie is a great movie rental, which is of particular importance to scare my fianc√©, but I noticed that some look surprisingly computer generated. I did not go to the cinema and I did not see it, but it's a terrible late night, I do not want to go to the cinema. I would recommend it!
