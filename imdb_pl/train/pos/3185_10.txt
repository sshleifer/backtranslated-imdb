an engaging story ........ voted ten against all middle-aged people for my age and sex ... not so much comedy (compared to a film that is almost wet), but fun enough. he is not a fan of musicals, so it's probably a bit too much for me, but they give you time to grab a drink or soda without losing anything important. Maybe the 1950s version when Harry met Sally? Ah, no, no, but if it's in your top ten, like mine, you'll love this movie. it really leaves a warm, indistinct feeling, reminding you of what romance can and should be and what to shoot for. my summary describes it best in very few words ..... quite charming
