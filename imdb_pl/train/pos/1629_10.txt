This movie is so cheap, endearing !!! With Ron Liebmann (Major Vaughn) providing the most entertaining diatribes on screen in film history. I have 2 copies of this video on video ... on one, Ralph Macchio gets caught crashing in the background in Major Vaugn, while he is talking in "Hash." Of course, they forgot to edit this error in the film, but it shows how funny this movie is, when the actors themselves can not keep a straight face !!!
