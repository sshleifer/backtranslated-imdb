Terry Gilliam went back to the future (he did it already in "Brazil") to tell this story about a virus that destroys the human race. <br /> <br /> The script is completely crazy with a few easy tricks but it's quite fun and Gilliam proves that he has imagination (futuristic scenes are just great). As for the cast, Bruce Willis and beautiful Madeleine Stowe (whatever happened to her) are just right, but Brad Pitt is so annoying when he plays roles that are out of his reach, he's so forced and everything is not credible. He should just play good-looking young men. <br /> <br /> * My rating: 7/10
