I think that Gray Garden is a fascinating movie, incredibly intimate <br /> <br /> look at too eccentric people who basically have the right idea: forget about <br /> <br /> society and live in a house without a house without ogrzewanie i ogromta <br /> <br /> breeding cats and racquets, conviction of their own interests rather <br /> <br /> ground down, all the time talking on the camera. <br /> <br /> Big Edie and Little Edie are two madness that Mazles Bros. <br /> <br /> they chose to document. They look like characters from Fellini's <br /> <br /> movie, only strangers if it makes sense. Old Edie is <br /> <br /> almost completely confined to the bed, a pile of papers, clothes and dirty dishes is growing <br /> <br />. Little Edie is even more interesting. She is hanging around the house, she always has a head like a baboushka, <br /> <br />, completely covering her hair. <br /> <br /> we never see her hair throughout the movie, nor do we have the <br /> <br /> hint that she still has a lot. At the age of fifty-eight, she is still <br /> <br /> beautiful and full of life. <br /> <br /> At Gray Gardens, we feel that both women <br /> Br /> life have become much less than they used to be. Little <br /> <br /> Edie is probably the saddest of them. While her mother in her previous years <br /> <br /> got married, she started a family, she lived luxuriously and <br /> <br /> she even recorded several recordings (a scene in which she sings at the age of 77) /> <br /> with the recording of "Tea for Two", which she made decades ago, is <br /> <br /> one of the best scenes in the film), Edie left her promising career as <br /> <br / > a model to care for her sick mother. At the age of 58, she still wanted to find a charming prince. If anything Little Edie is still a little girl, <br /> <br /> full of dreams of glamor and fame, and home and romantic <br /> <br /> bliss that has not yet been fulfilled. <Br> <br /> The most important elements of the film are the moments of opening, where little <br /> <br /> Edie explains her outfit to the camera, the sequence of "tea for two" <br /> <br /> birthday party, climax argument, scene with food items <br /> <br /> and the attic scene. The whole is amazing <br /> <br /> sincere and unpretentious. And it is even more twisted <br /> <br /> because everything is real. <br /> <br /> I suggest to see Gray Gardens back with Kennethem <br /> <br /> Short anger Puce Moment. DVD Criterion costs $ 35.00, but it's worth every penny <br /> <br />.
