It's the kind of movie that will stay with you for a long time. Soha Ali and Abhay Deol look very beautiful. Soha is very much like your mother, Sharmila Tagore. Abhay is a born actor and will grow very much in the near future. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie is very different from most movies. In a sense, you are unhappy, but if you really think about it in real terms, you realize that the only meaningful ending was the ending shown in the movie. Otherwise it would be a great injustice for everyone. <br /> <br /> The film is about a professional witness who meets a girl waiting for a wedding in court. Her boyfriend does not appear, and the witness helps her. Slowly, slowly, over time, she falls in love with her. It is not clear if he has similar feelings for him or not. Watch the video for detailed information. <br /> <br /> The film really belongs to Abhay. I am looking forward to seeing more movies from him. Soha is pretty, but she does not speak much in the film. Her eyes, her innocence, made the majority speak.
