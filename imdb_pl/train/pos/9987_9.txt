I was very moved by this story and because I'm going through something similar with my parents, I really got together. It is easy to forget that someone who loses his body was once full of life and passion. And then there are mistakes that they have made and with which they must live. I loved the performance of Ellen Burstyn and who is Christine Horne? She is fantastic! A real find. This is probably the most erotic scene I've ever seen in a movie, but nothing has been shown - it was just beautifully done. Overall, the look and style of the film was a stunning, real emotional journey. Cole Hauser is very good in this photo, humanizes the human spirally down. I liked the way the filmmaker approached this woman's life, never sentimental, never too big - it is enough to draw us in, but not enough to collapse.
