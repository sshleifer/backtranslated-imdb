I managed to record it from my satellite, but I would like to get the original version in a format that we can use here in the States. Eddie is really great at this San Francisco show. I do not remember being so laughed in routine situations. My wife and I enjoyed the tape and his work on Glorious. I would just like to be able to buy a copy and help Eddie financially through my purchase. We need more of his shows.
