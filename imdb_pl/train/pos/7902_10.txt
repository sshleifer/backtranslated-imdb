The film is unique in its gay iconography and extends it beyond aesthetic music to music and cast. Throughout the movie there is a childlike miracle, seen through the eyes of the main character. Her carefree approach to the world around us is comical and beautiful. In a sense, it's a movie for girls. Watch if you want a relaxing movie in the middle of the night. Buy it if you like different world media and love connected (?).
