In my humble opinion, this film did not receive the recognition it deserved. Robert Redford lives near me in Provo, Utah, at Sundance. I like his work the most and it was my favorite. I am sorry that more people did not appreciate it. My grandmother was an avid reader and she read the book for many years before she appeared on the big screen. She gave it to me to read after watching the movie together. The film and the book hit my emotional place and for a few days after watching the movie I was tearful. Sometimes love is not enough for our loved ones not to be hurt. We see this in our family relationships, but our love and our families and their stories last for generations. The photos were perfect and breathtaking - I was delighted with its beauty and how well they recalled the words of the author of the book, Norman Maclean: "But when I'm alone in the canyon's twilight, the whole existence seems to disappear to be with my soul and memories, and the sounds of Great Black Feet, the rhythm with four numbers and the hope that the fish will rise, eventually all things merge into one and the river flows. The river has been cut by a great flood in the world and runs over the rocks from the basement of time, on some rocks there are timeless drops rain, words are under the rocks, and some words belong to them. . "These words, taken from the book and spoken at the end of the film (authored by Robert Redford, who he recounts as Norman Maclean), are in my opinion essentially Scripture. Any possible defects of the film may be eclipsed by the beauty and grace of stories and photos. It was beautiful!
