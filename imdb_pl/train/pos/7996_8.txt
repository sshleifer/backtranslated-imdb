A frightening, ugly, nasty thriller about action, with a bodyguard who is determined to find (and destroy!) The girl's killers he was supposed to protect. This film is almost an anachronism in today's politically correct atmosphere. Director Scott does not want to apologize for his inborn immorality behind the dramatic structure of the film. Scott either does not know or does not care about 30 years of social progress. I really do not think we'll see a more brutal movie in the near future, so better go and see this movie. Despite the constant gloom, I think that the film is a powerful example of cinema in the most sinister, exploitative and effective. Scott has a hard to sell thing, but I think I'm a buyer. The remarkable technical aspects of this film are too effective for me to ignore. Scott's directorial choices are simply amazing, and Denzel Washington is doing a great job. Sensitive souls have to stay away from it, but I have recommended them to these viewers looking for a great, action-packed movie.
