IQ is a wonderfully original romantic comedy that depicts the greatest and deepest-minded scientific minds of the twentieth century as Cupid's helpers. The combination of heart and mind is the main theme of this light but well-thought-out movie. You do not really know how to react, because part of the time you see how great scientists do stupid things to cultivate budding love, but other times you hear them discuss the deepest riddles of the space / time of our time. The end result is a funny movie with surprises. Walter Matthau is the perfect Einstein, Meg Ryan creates a bizarre, scattered mathematician, and Tim Robbins brings to life the contradictions of a poorly educated working man who is fascinated by science. Together they create a farce journey through love and learning, mind and heart.
