I must admit that I am not a big fan of "family" movies nowadays. Most of them, IMHO, are sentimental nonsense. But the one like TOY STORY, the previous Pixar movie, is great fun. The two main heroes were maybe a little too bland (especially compared to two guides in ANTZ, but otherwise the movie is better), but the rest of the movie made up for it. The animation looked great, humor, though wide, was invariably good (I especially liked Hopper's poem "If I had not promised Mother on deathbed that I would not kill you, I would have killed you!") And the actors making voices, with the exception of two leads, were great (Denis Leary makes an animated film, what a concept). And like everyone else, I loved the results! I hope the video has new ones.
