Most Hollywood movies do not reflect the full range of teenagers' experiences. This video shows exactly how to do it right. It combines elements of humor, suffering, rebellion, etc. in a way that is complex and sympathetic. The ending may be a bit brighter, but the fact that the director does not write everything in advance before he concludes, means that this movie assumes a more intelligent viewer.
