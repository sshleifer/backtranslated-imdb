I must say that I was surprised by the quality of the film. It was much better than I expected. The scenario and action are quite good. The director also did a good job. Although some of the scenes look a bit awkward, this is a generally decent movie. The idea was definitely ingenious and the truth did not reveal itself to the end. The atmosphere of the psychiatric hospital was quite good. The plot was clear, consistent and thoughtful. Some people may find it a bit boring, because the plot is very focused and devotes its time to the development of characters and history. The moral of this story is a decent movie for the genre and it is amazingly good.
