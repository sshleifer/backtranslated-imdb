I saw this movie in cinemas when I was about 6 or 7 years old. I loved it, and recently I have my own version of VHS. <br /> <br /> My 4 and 6-year-olds love this movie and occasionally ask to see it. <br /> <br /> Again I liked it. Although I must admit that it is not so good on a small TV. <br /> <br /> I do not have older children, so I do not know what they'll think about it. <br /> <br /> The songs are very cute. My daughter is always singing. <br /> <br /> I hope it will help.
