"Moonstruck" is one of the best films ever. I am the owner of this movie on DVD! The film is about a widow from New York (Cher) who falls in love with his boyfriend's evil brother (Danny Aiello) (Nicholas Cage), who works in a bakery. I am happy that Cher won the Oscar for this film. Nicholas Cage and Danny Aiello are also great. The direction of Norman Jewison (who directed "Fiddler on the Roof") is fantastic. "Moonstruck" is an excellent movie that everyone can see and laugh. Must see! <br /> <br /> 10/10 stars!
