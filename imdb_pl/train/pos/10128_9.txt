Here is ... the first episode of EVER Friends, where we present Control Freak Monica Gellar (Courtney Cox), Newly divorced Ross Gellar (David Schimmer), Hippy Pheobe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow), unknown actor and man (Matt Le Blanc and very sarcastic Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry) This is how the scene begins until we present the 6th and last friend of Spoiled kid Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston). <br /> <br /> The episode is better than most people deserve recognition, like any new sitcom The first episode is not always fantastic.The act in this episode is not great, because the cast can not identify and appear in their new characters (except for Kudrow and Perry who shines). Matt Le Blanc- Man his acting was very scary, because by that time he was becoming more confident, but I think he tries to be funny, but he will fail at best. <br /> <br /> David Schimmer - Why does he pronounce KA? The word RDE can not speak normally, but it has become one of the funniest characters in later seasons, but it is not sure. and I can not sympathize with him Jennifer Aniston- He looks hot and does a good job as Rachel Green, but we see real Rachel later in the first season, Courtney Cox- She looks pretty anorexic in this episode, her anxiety looks completely different now (healthier), the actress is a bit sketchy, but everyone is in this 20-minute pilot! Lisa Kudrow and Matthew Perry - I do these two things together because their comical timing and quality of the game were great, and for Lisa it was one of her first roles, and she is as natural as Pheobe (Pheebs) and Matthew Perry is just Matthew Perry the game is basically! The quality of the episode improves later, eg. Sets, look dark and scary in this episode and make them seem unfriendly, the acting is OK, the characters gain confidence with each new stage and I am proud that it's a pilot! I hope that we will see how Friends connect! because they will always be there for us!
