Maxx is a deep psychological introspection, slightly camouflaged as a strange story of a superhero. Julie Winters is an "independent social worker" in an unnamed, dirty city, driving with crime, and she and everyone she knows have many problems to solve. Maxx is her friend and client, a street tramp who thinks she is a costume superhero - or is it the other way round? <br /> <br /> Maxx can not be omitted in the case of graphics, history itself or excellent voice work - especially the deliciously polite, nasty evil voice of the main criminal Barry Stigler, Mr. Gone. <br /> <br /> If you have a chance to see it, do not miss it.
