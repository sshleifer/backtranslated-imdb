The origin of this film is a mystery to me because I only know how much IMDB did before borrowing it. I assume that before "Starship Troopers" "Killshot" was one of the countless pilots who never got to the network, cables or otherwise. The new title "Kill Shot" is comically thrown in the first sequence, the first of many quick tips that have never been intended for the cinema. Quick cuts, cheesy music "Melrose Place" and short 2-second honest shots of the main actors let you know what you are getting into. <br /> <br /> And I do not mind everything. I rented this movie, seeing the repacking that puts Casper Van Diena and Denise Richards on the cover of the volleyball net, thinking it would be fun to see them in the film, in addition to sciFi travesty Starship Troopers (excellent book, in my opinion, not so hot movie - but it's another review). After looking at IMDB, my roommate and I assumed that the pilot was involved after the apparent success of his own career Troopers and Richards (see references to Bond-Girl and Wild Things here). They turned on the sex scene with a smaller character to achieve the desired status of R - desired in the sections of renting movies in suspense. In any case, they should have left it unrated, if you try to sell it in the suspens / softcore porn section. <br /> <br /> In total, it's fun. I hate it, however, to ruin the fun of telling you that it's a TV remote. It was the greatest success when watching - when you're expecting a movie and watching a TV show, the differences between them make them clearer than usual. <br /> <br /> Would I rent it again? No. Would I watch this TV program? Well, why not - it's better than Baywatch. And their modest attempts to hit all demographic data would take place in the mid-1990s. Black guy token (which is gay to avoid taboo between racial dating), Asian token (Japanese, I assume that from Koji) more proficient in science and computers than talking to women, beautiful, intelligent Latin medical student who has everything for her, except her family's bank account - this program would probably be okay. <br /> <br /> But as a movie it just spoiled me. <br /> <br /> 10, considering what it was and what had to happen. He did it for a very pleasant evening and that's all I demand from renting.
