Everyone with a young boy at home who does not watch black and white movies should put it on their TV set. When the child passes by, wondering what's going on all of it on the screen, screaming and shooting, tell him that it's a photo for adults and that it's not big enough to be seen. It will keep him there for a few minutes; director George Stevens and his team will keep it to the end. <br /> <br /> I think my father did this to me, and I'm better at it. This classic adventure yarn, set in India during the British occupation, consists of three army sergeants, who found themselves in the face of the breakup of the relationship, preparing to marry his beloved. Help comes in the form of a cruel rebellion, Thuggie, whose soldiers unite against. <br /> <br /> "Gunga Din" was one of the best films that came out of the best Hollywood of 1939. Even more than most of the great films from this Golden Year, it's fun in a very direct and accessible way. The theme is immediate nirvana. During filming in California, working with a camera (the only thing in "Gunga Din" that even earned an Oscar nomination) has a wind-blown magnificence that is very similar to Paradise from a century ago. Battle scenes are shot in a very realistic way, not very aggressive, but very sloppy when people are falling and shooting and running in all corners of each cage in a way that seems real and not exposed like some Cecil B. DeMille biblical festival of slaughter. br /> <br /> The script not only creates action scenes, but also develops relations of three sergeants with great humor. The main focus is on Sgt. Cutter, chasing high stories about gold treasures. He is a rare actor for Cary Grant, and his lightness is suitable for a film that is never taken seriously, even when it develops tense tension. <br /> <br /> Anchoring the trio is Sgt. MacChesney (Victor McLaglen), who dreams of his elephant Annie and tries to protect Cutter from his own schemes. He's so funny in his own way, leaving the sergeant behind. Ballantine (Douglas Fairbanks Jr., showing the nice creation of Errol Flynnish) as a person of love interest and sufficiently grounded to know that he has to quit boyfriends and grow up. <br /> <br /> If "Gunga Din" was a Lifetime movie, it was about Joan Fontaine's efforts to save his man from two lost friends and hijinks with a crushing skull. But because it's a movie for guys, the accent here is how the three must stay together and save Ballantine from a fate worse than death, not just a marriage, but how Cutter gets indignant a few times, tea too. > <br /> Political political correctness is difficult in this film, not so much for the sake of sex as the idea of ​​British soldiers who save poor Indians from cruel bandits. It reeks of colonial apology. Fortunately, the film was made in a time when producers did not feel the need to express obvious liberalism at the heart of the film, that these three sergeants, full of daring and false racial pride, must be saved with the rest of the army by the humble bhisti that only one of the three had time, when he was looking for their approval. In the end, despite all his shaky glory, the true sacrifice of the film is associated with the title character, played so miserably by Sam Jaffe. <br /> <br /> When the movie was filmed, film mogul Jack Warner said: You want to send a message, use Western Union. Even so, it seems that the news flew quickly and furiously in "Gunga Din". I'm watching the movie now and I wonder if the audience was going to wonder what Gunga Din really did when he led Cutter to the golden temple. Did he really take revenge on his British rulers? Would he be justified, especially considering the cold treatment of MacChesney? When Colonel Weed gives this praise, Rudyard Kipling's poem, on which the film is loosely based, was in the direction of madness of imperialism, of ruling over someone who turned out to be a "better man than me" in the end? What they did with the wonderful speech of Guru, communicated perfectly in English: "You swore that as soldiers you would swear an oath that you might die for faith which is your country in England. Well, I can die for my country and my faith as willingly as you ... India, goodbye. "<br /> <br /> Of course, the same character also instructs his violent followers:" Kill for the love of killing! Kill for the love of Kali! Kill! Kill! Kill! "Which means we can hate him and root him out for the British, and write down questions about what it all means for later. <br /> <br /> What" Gunga Din "means to me, above all, is the fastest, most reliable 90-minute video ride. Cutter never found his golden temple, but he is one for all of us watching "Gung Din".
