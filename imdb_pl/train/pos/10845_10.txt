> Unlike most of the reviews I have read, I did not feel that this happened after any other rock movie ("Spinal Tap", etc.). The story was more unique, although I feel that most people want to see "sex, drugs and rock and roll" that the band referred to. <br /> <br />> As an American I knew several actors - Spall, Connelly and Rea. Surprised by the fact that "Brian" / Bruce Robinson was in the classic "Romeo and Juliet" Zifferedi (<sp?). I'm guessing I'll have to rent another one. <br /> <br />> "THE FLAME STILL BURNS" - My wife, who comes from Mexico, did not follow English / British very well, missed some jokes (which I explained obediently), but she cried her eyes at concert scene. He loves this song so much. <br /> <br />> It's funny that Amazon.com has a soundtrack for $ 30 + usd when I bought a DVD in a container at Wal-Mart for $ 5.50. The price did not last, for the first time I saw it on TV late at night and since then I've died because of it.
