Of the three modifications of this thread, I like them all, I have all three on VHS and I also have a copy of it on DVD. The scripts are varied enough to make all three fun and you can watch them again. In addition, have three other films been rewritten three times with such stars? Of course, the main stars in this movie are great, but the supporting actors are also great. I particularly like William Tracy as Pepi. He was such a thief scene that I was looking for other movies in which he is. He appeared in many, but most of them are not available. Like other comments, I also say - buy this one.
