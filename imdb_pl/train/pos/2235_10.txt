I really liked this movie because it is a true story set in the Amazon, part of the world that has always intrigued me. I believe that the short form of the book was published in the Reader's Digest shortly after the actual event happened. <br /> <br /> Because I am a "baby boomer", the character and actress are my peers, and for that reason I referred to the film. I also believe that the film is valuable in teaching survival skills if the viewer notices that the character follows the streams leading to the river and the coastal settlements, where he can get help, as well as other survival techniques. The most important was her will to survive and maintain a positive attitude. In conclusion, I hope viewers have learned something from this, in addition to seeing it for entertainment. <br /> <br /> I would like the film to be released in VHS and DVD soon, if I wanted to add it to my video collection. It should also be displayed more often on satellite channels.
