Although it is certainly politically incorrect to be entertained by a drunkard, there is such a charm to the portrait of Dudley Moore's sympathetic abundance, Arthur Bach, that it is impossible not to feel this unique and wonderful character. How can you not play with this infectious laughter and chuckle and total stupidity. Although I'm not a fan of Lisa Minnelli, she was really great like Linda Marolla and I could not imagine anyone else in that role. Sir John Gielgud was the heart of the movie and deserved an Oscar. The rest of the cast is also excellent and a great melody of "Arthur's Theme", wow. It really was one of the best comedies of the 80's. Great movies improve with each watching and this is the case with "Arthur".
