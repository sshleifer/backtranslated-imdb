Wow! A Danish movie with this kind of content? I mean, actors, history, pictures, efx - everything was where it should be. <br /> <br /> And the Danish EFX house producing these VFX - Wow! This is like the second or third time that Danish FX produces visual effects in this quality. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER AHEAD * The return of the ghostly children in the submarine was pretty good, but in general I did not feel the great chill I would have expected after the ghost movie. * KONIEC SPOILERA * <br /> <br /> But it is still a Danish movie, from which I can be proud as a Dane. <br /> <br /> The only "bad" in this was that he was not a Danish director, but a Swedish director ...
