Hunky Geordie Robson Green is Owen Springer, a young doctor who moves to Manchester to be close to her father. On the way, she falls in love with Anna, a woman at the age of 20, who is the wife of his new boss Richard Crane. Despite warnings from new colleagues, Owen decides to get Anna for himself, even going to Anna's sabotage and Richard's marriage deception. It's a romantic drama with lots of funny tones and a quick joke. The actors are great: Green with "The Prince Prince" and "Touching Evil" smolders on the screen as a devious but affectionate Owen; Fame Annis "Dune" is alive and fits well with Green; Kitchen with "To Play The King" is the right threat for Richard, whose comic errors and snobbering underline his masterful, hatred for Owen. This is an excellent love triangle and despite the weaknesses and errors of our three heroes, you go out better to get to know them and observe them.
