This is one of the best films ever. This is a realistic representation of the village ranch life, which was a large part of American history. The setting is in 1906 Wyoming, where life has not changed much since the previous century. The film keeps your interest without additional Hollywood myths. The whole family can see this movie and be intrigued by what life was like in America, when it was mainly a rural country. Thanks to this film, you will avoid the present and witness the everyday life of 100 years ago. In beautiful, picturesque surroundings you will see hard physical work that was necessary for survival, as well as constant concerns and fears about elements and market pressure that will affect success or failure. See this movie and experience life as it was throughout most of our nation's history. This movie is worth your time. My only question is why are there no more such films?
