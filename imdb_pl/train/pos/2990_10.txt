I think Ebert gave Stella four to four stars, but otherwise I have never read a positive review of this sadly incomprehensible drama about class division, love and sacrifice (three themes that have the greatest romantic stories or films in common). <br /> <br /> Here the main topic is the division of classes. Stella is a story from the era of depression in America. That said, it was translated into a screen, and then in such a memorable way that this remake (if you ask Stanwyck's fan or two) was not exactly appreciated. Fans of the original never gave it a chance. What's more, this version of Stella was created in the nineties, not exactly in times of great financial trouble in America (when she was depressed). <br /> <br /> It's time to remove the pink glasses, in the midst of a new era of recession and poverty in America, and see that this powerful story still sounds true, is as current and timely as ever, in its updated format. <br /> <br /> Yes, class division is the main topic here. Stella is one of the poor, lonely, with big dreams, but with little hope of realizing these dreams. He works at the bar, he does not have much money, he lives in a poor apartment. You get drift. In the morning, I do not really want to get out of bed. On her wall, she has pictures of movie stars she loves. <br /> <br /> The man sees her dancing in the bar. He is rich, educated, from one of the upper classes, who has nothing to do with Stella. His main concern is what the college of ivy college will attend, how to pay rent, how to be "happy". They have an affair. They like each other. Stella ends in pregnancy. Stella tells the guy a message. His answer? "And what about abortion?" He answers: "I just wanted a room full of balloons." He supplies balloons and proposition, but he sees that he has no heart in him and he has too much pride to accept them. He sends it to packing. <br /> <br /> Her daughter is finally torn between two lifestyles - the love she has for her mother and the benefits, happiness and love her rich dad gives her. Stella, lonely and unloved, and not wanting her daughter to become as unhappy as she once, makes her final victim. He abandons the only love and happiness she has ever known to ensure happiness for her daughter and possibly live vicariously and with hope, knowing that at least her daughter has found something for which she can live. <br /> <br /> Now, for the movie. Everything is fine. Beautiful score, ingenious photos, great set design (contrast between two lifestyles, messy apt and decorated residences), wonderful and cordial performances of the entire cast, especially with Bette Midler, in particular, Oscar. <br /> It's a movie that is much more meaningful and well made than you believed.
