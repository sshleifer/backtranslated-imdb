This is an excellent film about the characters of adult swimming classes, their problems, relationships and interactions with each other. He should have achieved wider distribution because it is much better than similar films from major studios at the same time. <br /> <br /> Swimming instructor is almost an Olympian, limited to teaching adult basic lessons, and often the goal of horndogging from his students. He tries, more or less, to counter them, with different results. <br /> <br /> Student characters are mainstream in the US; teachers, policemen, students and retirees who for some reason did not learn to swim. The film tells about their relationships, including about friends, relatives and romantic conquests during the classes. Several side plots provide fun feed, including a divorce teacher, several high school students who make documentaries, and a girl who is only in class to meet guys. <br /> <br /> This is a good date movie, or just to watch when you're in the mood for a romantic drama with real-life overtones.
