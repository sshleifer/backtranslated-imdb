The plot is really frightening, really depressive atmosphere, unusual for low-budget production, or at least for German production. A bit of Indian spirituality, mystic thriller and slasher movie mixed together. The development of the story and characters is great, sets very close to reality, without any studio atmosphere. It could be perfect, but unfortunately some things were a bit disappointing, which inevitably must be typical for low-budget movies: <br /> <br /> 1.) Sometimes the cast does not exceed the average. Almost every actor looks like a layman. Some of them do well or very well, but some act like actors in shitty German shows! But I was very, very disappointed with Mathieu Carri√®re! His acting (in many of his older films his acting was fine) here was below average! But that could be the reason why he is taking part in shitty German soap or television series on private channels today. <br /> <br /> 2.) The windows are sometimes at the level of a soap opera. <br /> <br /> 3.) Bad sound sometimes very difficult to understand what characters say. I saw it on a DVD and I was happy to be able to rewind it and listen again. Caused by the set (large rooms like in a hospital or esoteric group), and sometimes strange dialects of actors! <br /> <br /> But all in all it's an interesting movie, it's worth watching, far beyond commercial movies that are often scarier.
