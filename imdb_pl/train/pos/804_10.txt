No, it's different! <br /> <br /> Because every Star Wars fan had to have an opinion about I, II and III and because this opinion was biased, because we missed the atmosphere and the heroes of the original trilogy, I'll give you good points of the "Return of the Jedi" and some of the bad ones prequel points. Of course, I loved music, special effects, two robots, but that was too much discussed elsewhere. <br /> <br /> What we get in the original trilogy and in this particular movie: - A strong environmental problem - Anti-militaristic items - Fascinating insights about the Jedi and Force Order - Cute creatures - Harrison Ford's smile - Dead scene: towards the end, when Vader looks at his son and the Emperor alternately. A thunderbolt of deadly screws was reflected in his black helmet. And when he catches and betrays his Master to save Luke, risking his own life! Oh, boy! <br /> <br /> What's wrong with the INMHO prequest: - the whole element of the "human factor" that the original cast was able to move forward is somehow lost - Power seems to be more about superpowers and Salta, and no wisdom - Too many Jedis at once and too many Light Sabers on the screen - Lack of experience from several actors too often threatens the consistency of the story <br /> <br /> By the way, if you enjoy the theory of Power, as explained by Obi Web (Obi Wen, I mean) and Yoda, you should read some books about Buddhism and forms that took on ancient Japan. <br /> <br /> The magic of Star Wars, IMHO lies mainly in the uninterrupted spiritual heritage from master to his pupil, from father to son, though difficult. "De mon âme à ton âme" (from my soul to yours), as Bejard would write to the deceased Zen master T. Deshimaru.
