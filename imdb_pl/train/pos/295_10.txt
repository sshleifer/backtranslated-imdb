Bogdonovich (usually) unconventional classic is a film that does not resemble any other. A movie that is a fairy tale but has a solid foundation in reality due to the use of authentic places in Manhattan and "real" geography, perhaps the best filming in New York. John Ritter reminds us that with good directors (Bogdanovich, Blake Edwards, Billy Bob) can be brilliant and the whole band is a group you really would like to spend time with. One of the few romantic comedies of the last 20 years, which does not seem to be a rip off of something else, is the most important point of Bogdanovich's career after his "success" when his best work was really done ("saint jack", "in the end ...", " sounds ".
