This fantastic crime story is an early prototype of what soon became a very popular film genre. I was pleased to see William Powell in a crime story about charisma and charm, without the stupid character of his character Nick Charles (from the series "Thin Man"). Although the story itself is good, I think that what really makes the movie is fun is the fantastic direction of Michael Curtiz. From a visual point of view, this is a richly textured film in which Curtiz shows incredible control over the medium; from the split screen images, through the weird camera angles and the ingenious retrospections, Curtiz shows that he was one of the best Hollywood directors. I highly recommend it if you are a fan of this type of film.
