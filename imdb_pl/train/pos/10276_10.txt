The opening of the Bach Toccata movie is a sound allusion to what is happening in this intense drama. All the composing devices that Bach has perfected to keep the listener (and performer) intrigued and entertaining, refer to this film. There is no mutual affection between the two leading heroes, and the main woman in the last scene, which I consider to be justified, claiming that she was raped, even though her victim felt that she had been warned that she was cad. Mamet convincingly explores the emotional chasm and differences between the sexes, but I feel that he has no idea how to really compliment each other with a healthy sense of humor. If Mamet developed a healthy humorous way of interacting between the sexes, I wonder how this work will end? Because it exists, it is very gloomy and mean.
