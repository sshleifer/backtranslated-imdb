Together with Patrick McGoohan and Robert Culp, Jack Cassidy was the cult villain Columbo. The first "proper" episode of Columbo, following the two independent pilots, "Murder By The Book", is not far from the classic status. <br /> <br /> Jack Cassidy plays Ken Franklin, half of the partnership to write murderous secrets. His partner Jim is talented, while Ken has no talent other than gabu gift and the ability to promote books. As soon as Jim decides he does not need Ken's marketing skills anymore, Ken hatches a conspiracy to kill Jim. Apart from the fact that this is not a new plot, it is in fact the implementation of the plot of the murder originally intended for one of their books. <br /> <br /> Columbo does not have to think for a long time that Ken is a murderer, although unfortunately he must go on with another murder (Ken's romance and then kill the key witness) before Columbo has enough evidence to get conviction. <br /> <br /> Nothing wrong with "Murder through the book", but not quite at the highest level. I would simply give "Publish Or Perish" an advantage over this: both episodes include Jack Cassidy and the publishing world, but "Publish Or Perish" is a fraction more tight and unpredictable. But it's still a great episode.
