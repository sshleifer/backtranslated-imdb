I was lucky that I was extra in this great film and I loved every minute of filming. I went to the premiere in London and we talked great with Phil, Peter, Martin and Jon, just like my wife. Then a few weeks later, I went to the cinema with members of our cycling club. What a brilliant movie, it deserves to be there with all the great movies for motorcyclists. Now we have a DVD Sue, my wife can not reach it nor the children. Get a little club from the club that I think I'm a movie star, well, you can only dream. I think they are just jealous. The only downside to the first part of the pictures was the weather, rain, rain and more rain, but hey we were in Wales. I hope it will be a continuation, so let Jon send me. Danny Beck
