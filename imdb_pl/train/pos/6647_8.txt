Gandhi, my father, is like watching a book, chapter by chapter, reading it (with your own eyes) and learning more about Harilalu Gandhi and the same Kasturbie Gandhi. So little is known about them, and this film describes them exceptionally. The title, however, is misleading, as is the film about Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and his son, as well as about Harilal and his mother. And Akshaye Khanna and Shefali Chayya fully reflect their roles. <br /> <br /> Such movies are like leap years. They come after such a long time. <br/> <br /> Gandhi My Father is also an internal struggle that is sometimes more difficult than any fight for freedom ever made. <br /> <br /> Watch out if you like high-quality cinema.
