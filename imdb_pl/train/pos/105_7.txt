I have to start with Ed Furlong. You must. God bless this kid. Five bucks say that the character he plays in this movie is what he really is in real life. It has one or two lines that made me almost unbearable because of the subtle humor in the script. You know all the trials that this guy has gone through in recent years, and it does not even seem like Furlong was working. Maybe that was why his performance was good. Same with Madsen. You keep thinking, "I bet that this guy is really like that in real life." Does Madsen have to even act? Simply natural. Vosloo apparently went from a typical mummy. I think the biggest surprise of this movie was Jordana Spiro's performance. Her reactions are in place in this film. I fought if it was hot, but I realized that I would like to see her more. <br /> <br /> Not a big fan of shoot 'em out / hostage movies. But I'm a movie fan with lots of twists and turns to try and guess. Not only your ordinary robbers take over the bank, they kill the hostages, and good guys win in the final type of the movie. Action turns up ... and they are coming. <br /> <br /> Cafe scenes work best with handheld cameras to show how it really is. It does not shine a little. Think of how Bourne Ultimatum in the style of "lite" on some scenes in a cafe. <br /> <br /> And for those fanatics, Bo Bice - actor Curtis Wayne (who plays Karl) will make you do a double trick. These guys are twins. <br /> <br /> When I looked, I wondered why some of the actors had foreign accents and what they were doing in this small town. In the end, it made sense that these people smuggled things into other countries / states so that they could have these accents. But more reveal additional features of how some producers wanted to make this film for an international audience with some of the stars we might not know about. And some of them are hot. Moncia Dean? I have to say more.
