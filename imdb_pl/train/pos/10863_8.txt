First of all, I must say that I made a mistake by watching election films out of turn. I'm saying unfortunately, because after seeing Elections 2, the elections first seem to be a disappointment. Both films are gangster epics of a similar form. And although Election is a nice piece of cinema ... it just is not as good as its sequel. <br /> <br /> In the first installment of the election, we are shown to two competitors as chairman; Big D and Lok. After a few discussion scenes among "Uncle", who should have the title of Chairman, they (almost unanimously) decide that Lok Lok (Simon Yam) will direct the Triads. Suffice it to say that this is not very successful for the Big D competitor (Tony Leung Ka Fai) and trying to influence the takeover, Big D kidnaps two uncles to move the election council to their side. This has disastrous consequences and directs the triads to war. Lok is determined to become chairman, but he will not become official until he regains the "Baton Dragon Head", the material representation of the President's power. The current chairman, Whistle (Chung Wang) hid the baton somewhere in mainland China, and the race is to see who can regain it first. <br /> <br /> A significant part of the film is devoted to the recovery of Baton. When both aspiring leaders look for him, they must avoid policemen and opposing parties, which leads to one of the outstanding scenes in the election, in which a subordinate named Jet (Nick Cheung), machete and many bad guys take part. The presence of Nick Cheung attracts attention, at least ... I wonder if it affected the director Johhn It in any way during the second choice, because it provides more character to Jet in the sequel. <br /> <br /> While Nick Cheung gives the scene stealing performance, I can not help but get carried away by the rest of the film's actors. Choices have a great cast with well thought-out performances that are both subtle and striking. Simon Yam is his usually glorious "me", and the film also benefits heavyweight HK actors such as Louis Koo, Tony Leung Ka Fai and the underrated Suet Lam. There is no weak link in acting and you can easily believe that they are watching real gangsters. <br /> <br /> Although the performances are great, one of the most impressive things in Election is Johnnie To's eye for the camera. There are some really striking shots in the movie and it's obvious that it definitely knows how to frame your shots because the viewer has to do with a series of innovative and pretty brilliant camera and angle settings. All this makes the choices above all a great-looking movie. <br /> <br /> My problems with the movie are mainly due to the sheer amount of characters involved in the election. It's a bit difficult to keep track of because the movie is full of characters that are not an integral part of the story. While the sequel decides to focus more on the two candidates, the first election offers the electoral process as a whole with a myriad of uncles, subordinates and policemen crowding in the story. Perhaps the movie would work better if more time was spent on the internal functioning of the Triad or if Director Johnnie It would bring the necessary elements and explain them more. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line - In summary, this is a wonderfully brutal movie with a great cast, great direction and a calm pace that is striking. It's a bit more complicated than it should be.
