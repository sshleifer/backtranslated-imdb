Winchester '73 was a film that moved Mann from B's films to the big league, thus saving James' confused tangled post-war career, throwing him as a conflict hero (although since the inheritance of the project after Fritz Lang, perhaps Lang deserves it for that). Both men would go to much darker places - Mann with the incredibly dreary Devil's Doorway MGM left behind in the shelf until the success of Broken Arrow convinced them to release it? but the movie about a man hunting for his own brother, when the title rifle is passed from person to path, before he goes to one of the beloved mountain shootings of the director, is even more powerful meat than one would expect from the studio system. A great dialogue, an impressive supporting cast? Dan Duryea, Will Geer, Millard Mitchell, Stephen McNally, Shelley Winters, Charles Drake, Tim McIntire, Jay C. Flippen, Tony Curtis, Rock Hudson? and the outstanding visual sense of Manna raises the bar with it.
