One day I heard a few friends say that "Scarface sucks ... some idiot tried to set up another Godfather in the early 80's". Now I usually listen to idiots / I watch CNN, so I decided to stay away from it. Then my friend gave me a DVD and said "This is # 1 with pelicans", confused that I tried. THIS IS THE BEST FILM EVER MADE. This is more realistic than all this nonsense about the races of stolen cars that are too expensive for someone in the area you can afford (* cough2Fast2Furiouscough *). But what is better than Al Pacino wielding m203? I give it ***** with ****, perfect for fans of Al or GTA: Vice City.
