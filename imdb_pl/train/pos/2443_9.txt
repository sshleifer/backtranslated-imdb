This film may not put the Catholic church in the best light, but it tells a story based on real events. Unfortunately, not everything in life, including religion, is nice and pink. Sometimes people and groups do things that seem right at the time, but in retrospect they do not look as good as they used to be. "A Love Divided" tells the story of the family, yes, it contains a religion, but the story really relates to the family and the ability of this family to stay together no matter what they are thrown at them. This movie is also based on real events that do not say that this story, scene by scene, is real, but if you looked at the press articles from this period, you could see that none of the churches could handle the incident in a way that he was helpful to the family. Both churches are guilty here, the Catholic Church for imposing such a regulation on the family and, above all, does not react to the violence associated with it, and the Protestant church for telling her mother that she should obey her husband and his priest and do not fight. In this case, they both released this family. I believe that the film is doing well, showing this fight both in the church and in the family. In no way does the shape and form leave the Catholic church, on the contrary, it shows how one event can change the course of the idea of ​​this religion and how one person can have a much greater range than just himself.
