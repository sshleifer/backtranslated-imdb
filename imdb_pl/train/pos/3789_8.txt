Bravo for the Czechs, their once-powerful film industry seems to wake up from post-communist sleep. <br /> <br /> The Loners is a comedy made with all the elements you can expect in modern Hollywood production minus junk that seems to have been attached to the genre in the last few years. Excellent soundtrack, excellent visual edition, beautiful Prague landscape, just to name a few. <br /> <br /> The story consists of several sub-stories, which often combine and overlap, and is in fact a collage of fates, fates, desires ... They follow a group of people from urban youth to the thirties through different situations from everyday life and spending free time to careers and obsessions. And this is hilarious. The film is actually the point where the entire theater in which I was (about 100 people in a small art gallery) laughed non-stop for about 40-50 seconds. How often do you experience this with contemporary Hollywood productions? <br /> <br /> Although the entire main cast is excellent (especially the upcoming Macedonia star Labina Mitevska as an immigrant facing too well-known difficulties), I must distinguish Jiri Machacka for his immensely adoring portrait of Jakub, constantly stoned bohemia, whose brain is severely affected by things that smoke, landing in many funny situations. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: I do not miss it! It has a lot to offer.
