First of all, it's the funniest movie I've ever seen. It contains a perfectly fitted slapstick, sexual humor and a cleverly thought-out stop. But it goes deeper. Souler Opposite is an original love story (something that we do not see so often) that gave me hope that there is love, that two people who love can work through their adversities; and that such a comedy life (something that I think we should all have) can be accepted by people who really have meaning. Chris Meloni gives such a convincing performance as Barry Singer that he should win an oscar. The film is well written and I hope that we will see more videos from everyone involved in the future.
