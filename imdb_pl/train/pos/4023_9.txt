It is an extremely well made film. Acting, screenplay and working with the camera are paramount. Music is also good, although it is mostly at the beginning of the movie, when things are still quite joyful. The cast does not really have superstars, although a few faces will be known. The whole cast perfectly handles the script. <br /> <br /> But it is difficult to watch because there is no good ending of a situation like that presented. It is now fashionable to blame the British for putting Indians and Muslims in front of them and then cruelly separating them into two countries. It is a merit of this view, but it is also true that no one has forced Indians and Muslims in the region to treat each other as they did in the times of division. It seems more likely that the British simply saw tensions between religions and were clever enough to use them for their own purposes. <br /> <br /> As a result, the situation is very cruel and inhumane, and it is very unpleasant to remember and see on the screen. But it is never painted as a black and white box. On both sides is meanness and nobility, as well as hope for a change in the younger generation. <br /> <br /> In a sense, there is a redemption when Puro has to make a difficult choice between the man who ruined her life, but also really loved her and her family who drove her away, and then she came to look for her. But at the moment there is no option for her without much pain. <br /> <br /> This movie carries the message that both Muslims and Indians have their own serious shortcomings, and that both can be distinguished and caring people. The reality of division makes this realization even more annoying, because there will never be true reconciliation on the Indo-Pakistani border. In this sense, it is similar to "Mr. and Mrs. Iyer". <br /> <br /> In the end, we are glad that we saw this film, although the resolution was painful. If the United Kingdom and the United States could deal with their own history of racism with such sincerity, it would certainly be better for them.
