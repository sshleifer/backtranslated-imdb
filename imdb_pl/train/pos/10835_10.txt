I love that movie. This is one of those movies that you can watch again and again, and still addictive. Congratulations!! I believe that everyone involved in creating the movie and the script should be proud of themselves. It's so amazing, you feel that you are watching a real band. I would like to see more such films. I'm glad they did not choose the famous Hollywood stars for this movie, because it probably would not work. And even if Billy Connolly is quite well known, he really got stuck in this role and I could not imagine anyone else playing it. Once again, I'd like to congratulate you, I really believe that this movie deserves the Comedy Award of Peter Sellers for Bill Nighy. And when you get to the last stage ..... what can I say !!!!
