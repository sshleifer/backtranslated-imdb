Simply put, this is the best movie that will come out of Michigan from ... well, always! Evil dead eats your heart, Hate to the minute is one of the strangest and the best cinema that has been seen by this reviewer for a long time. I recommend this movie to anyone who needs a journey with a head or a good suitcase!
