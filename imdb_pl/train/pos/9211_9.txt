Action, horror, science-fiction, director of exploitation Fred Olen Ray shows that he has talent as a director. The character actor William Smith is one of the best hard / bad guys in the industry. He treats the viewer with the best acting performance of his career. When it comes to Randy Travis, he gives his best impression of Lee Van Cleef. He is not bad in the movie. Smith and Travis make a movie. As for the rest of the cast, none of them stand out. Ray did a great job, staging this movie, Smith and Travis were good, I gave this B western on a scale of one to ten (ten is the best) seven.
