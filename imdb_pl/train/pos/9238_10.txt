Although others commented that this movie is just an edited version of two programs: "Fire in Space" and "Living Legend", if you watch the original programs, you'll find that the dialogue with this video edition has been edited. I found this video version much better because scenes and lines were added to it. I would say that if you want to see the program in the original version, see the video versions on VHS. They have more to offer to fans than the original episodes now offered on DVD. Another good movie is Conquest for the Earth, which had more scenes from Galactica 1980 than transmissions. Overall, I rate this as 10, because it gives you more joy than what the network wanted to show in the range of time that they gave the producers.
