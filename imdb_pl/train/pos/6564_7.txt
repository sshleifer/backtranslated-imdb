Jake Speed ​​(1986) was a funny parody of Indiana Jones and other adventure movies that were popular in the eighties. Wayne Crawford plays the role of Jake Speed, an adventurer who always fights bad performers wherever he goes. Together with his assistant Desmond Floyd (Dennis Christopher), the ball trots, looking for some action (and some decent plots). The duo meets a young woman named Margaret (Karen Kopins), whose sister was kidnapped by an evil white slave trader (John Hurt). Can he find and convince Jake and Desmond to help save her siblings? <br /> <br /> A juicy and tacky movie that does not pretend to be something it is not. I must give this recommendation. If you like movies that like to have fun, and for those who do not accept everything at a good price. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
