I had an uncle who committed suicide after serving in Vietnam because of the psychological problems he experienced on his return. When one evening I saw part of this movie on the pay-for-view channel, I was intrigued. I wanted to know what my uncle had gone through and felt his preparation for Vietnam. I left and rented this movie and I have to say it is the most moving film I've ever seen. I bought a DVD immediately after borrowing it. How emotionally it draws you in many different directions is something I have never experienced with any other film. When it comes to thematic films from Vietnam, I think it is the best movie, although Pluto is close to a second. Besides, I think it's also the best performance of Colin Farrell as an actor. I like it in most of my movies, but it was amazing in it. I gave it 10 points because it is one of my five favorite movies.
