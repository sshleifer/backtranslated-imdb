It's a bit crazy, but I recorded with TCM both the German version of "Anna Christie" MGM and English ... but first I had to see it, because I heard that many people thought it was better than the English version. <br /> <br /> Not seeing the other, I can not compare them, but in any case it's a great early talkie, with a simple Garbo performance. It looks very beautiful in this film, its face shines, especially when the cameraman William Daniels makes her great close-ups. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere of the film seems different than the usual MGM materials made at that time looks very similar to the French or German expressionist movies from the thirties, and the director was a great French director, M. Jacques Feyder, who directed Garbo in 1929 in "The Kiss". <br /> <br /> Theo Shall is perfect and gives an absolutely credible performance as Anna's beloved, hard, hard, sailor, who is only a child in the body of a man. Hans Junkermann also gives a very good performance, as does the father of an alcoholic Anna and Salka Viertel, as a good old cheap floozy. <br /> <br /> All in all because it's the only movie where you can listen to Garbo in a foreign language ... because all the other films she did in Sweden or Germany were during the Silent Era. <br /> <br /> Serious Flick.
