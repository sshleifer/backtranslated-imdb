I try not to take IMDb assessments to heart, but I was surprised when I saw grade 5.4 for one of my favorite childhoods. It does not impress me at the age of 17, but as a family movie it's a sweet and good movie. Children will definitely like it and do not mind their faults, and adults can guess the actor behind each character and admire the subliminal messages from the movie. None of the films was advertised in any way, in fact it has great news that gave it sweetness. I admit, however, that the story is on the thin side, and some scenes, such as Screweyes' death (which still scares me), can be a bit scary. But the animation is well above average with nice colors and good character animation. The music of James Horner is very beautiful, and the song is unforgettable, catchy and funny. I really liked the characters, Louie is probably the most profound of them, but the dinosaurs were at least addictive. Martin Short's clown was both amusing and assertive when he told Screweyes "I quit!". he had me at the seams. My favorite is Screweyes, an effective villain who is clever and I suppose he is intelligent. However, if anything, I wish the film stay in this part, when it explains how he lost his eye and why he is afraid of crows, because in this way he could be more developed in depth. The script, though it does not deserve an Oscar, has its own fun and warming parts, and should provide entertainment for children and adults. The voice acting for me was what created the movie. John Goodman, Martin Short, Rhea Perlman, Felicity Kendall and Yeardley Smith have given solid performances, but Kenneth Mars deserves special mention because he was absolutely wonderful as Screweyes and almost unrecognizable. All in all a good movie. I do not get the grade, to be honest I do not. Of course, this movie is not perfect and is not as good as a dinosaur movie, such as Land Before Time, but it's fun. 7.5 / 10 Bethany Cox
