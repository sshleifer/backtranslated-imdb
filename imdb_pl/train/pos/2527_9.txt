That's what I call the movie "pre Sci Fi; Sci Fi. " This is no better than Lugosi / Karloff in this incredibly good "mood" movie. These two real artists are at their best, just like the plot. <br /> <br /> Karloff performs an amazing job as a scientist who sees himself caught in vanity, pride and scientific competition. I came up with the idea of ​​watching a man who melts in the three aforementioned concepts. I was saddened and at the same time fascinated by the two stars, just like themselves. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of movie that begs for a remake. This time Harrison Ford in the part of Karloff, and maybe Kieffer Sutherland in the role of Bela Lagosi. It is possible that it will be done almost as well. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best that Hollywood EVER has produced. As I said ... there is nothing better. No way.
