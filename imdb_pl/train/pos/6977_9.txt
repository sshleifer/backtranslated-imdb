I'm really addicted to Caprica because it's a really good prequel series for Battlestar Galactica. It really has a slow pace, but it will certainly accelerate after the appearance of new episodes. <br /> <br /> I've heard great things about future episodes and guest stars in the first season. <br /> <br /> This Sci Fi drama will appeal to our fans who love the mix of both genres. <br /> <br /> Eric Stoltz performs an amazing job as well as Polly Walker as Clarice Willow !! <br /> <br /> Completely worth checking !! <br /> <br /> Catch Caprica on Fridays at 21:00 20:00 in SYFY
