Dream Quest was a surprisingly good movie. There were a few noticeable nonsense, but you can expect that in a film that was made in such a short time. I did not feel like moving forward during the movie and thought it was quite fun. Sometimes it gets stupid, but I generally recommend it. They probably used up all the glow in nearby stores, and some costume designs were pretty good.
