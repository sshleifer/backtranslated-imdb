Although we know how this story ends, it is a thrilling movie for a fly that plays almost like a political thriller. During the calm before the storm, we meet Hugo Chavez as a charismatic, larger-than-life man who has an inseparable connection with the mestizos who constitute 80% of the population, but were previously excluded from the political process of Venezuela and its oil wealth. He seems to be as devoted to them as he is to him. He travels around the country at a fever speed, reaching the campesinos, addressing huge crowds, hugging and kissing ordinary people, accepting letters on scraps of paper and listening to pleas for help. People are excited that one of their members has reached the highest office in the country. There is an electric sense of hope and optimism that change for the better comes to the festering barrios. <br /> <br /> But not everyone is happy with the situation. Elite castillian elite, pure-blood, which is a small minority, but previously controlled all wealth, is full of bitterness and resentment. One of the most involuntarily funny moments in the film is the situation in which Ann Coulter lookalike, at a meeting of residents in an exclusive closed community, complains about the mestizos, "they have no idea of ​​fighting or sacrifice." A few minutes later, the speaker says that "beware of your servants - they may be followers of Chavez." Duh! Of course they are. <br /> <br /> In the nighttime interview with the film crew himself, Chavez reveals something about his soul by telling the story of his grandfather. He may be a sensitive, poetic man, though with an unkind, even clownish sense of humor (as we saw when he spoke to the UN and called Bush the devil.) <br /> <br /> Then the storm begins to accumulate Force, when the organizers of the attack call for mass protest and cynically manipulate their supporters to change their route at the last minute and march to the presidential palace, knowing that it is surrounded by Chavez supporters, and violence is inevitable. <br /> <br /> Another element of the plot is put in place when the snipers on the roofs start shooting at Chavez supporters, some of whom are firing. The local equivalent of Fox News shows this fire and claims that Chavez's supporters massacre the protesters. Then the camera moves away and reveals that there are no protesters - the street is empty! The protesters chose a different path. Needless to say, the film material from the empty street was edited by the furiously anti-television television stations of Chavez (which broadcast a continuous outbreak of propaganda calling Chavez mentally ill and sexually overwhelmed by Fidel Castro). Immediately after the coup, we see the ringleaders and their media propaganda masters openly boast on television about how they manipulated the situation with reckless disregard for the lives of supporters and opponents. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers are still in the center of this chaos, the rapidly changing situation when a military coup surrounds the palace and threatens its bombardment. Chavez eventually surrenders to avoid bloodshed, but refuses to resign and is taken to the island at sea, where the plane waits for him - where? United States? How can other members of the government avoid arrest and defeat this heavily armed conspiracy of right-wing generals and very wealthy businessmen who are closely associated with the Bush administration? Watch the movie and find out! <br /> <br /> If your only knowledge about Hugo Chavez and Venezuela comes from the American media, you do not know anything. He is not an "unassigned tyrant" and does not "rule the decree" - he is extremely popular, he was elected and re-elected several times with over 60% of the vote (something George Bush Junior never achieved) and devotion inspires ordinary Venezuelans, which ultimately is the cause of the failure of the attack. <br /> <br /> This is an extraordinary film about an extraordinary man in an extraordinary situation. Skills of filmmakers consist in the fact that they are not striking and allow stories to grow through the voices of Venezuelans on every level, from the barrio to the presidential palace, stormy scenes, chaos and confusion, from which emerges a coherent whole that is tense, riveting and moving around. It can not be missed!
