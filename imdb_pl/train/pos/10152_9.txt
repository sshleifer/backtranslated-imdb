I could not wait to see it since I first saw her in my work. In the end, I found it yesterday 2/13/02 on the Lifetime Movie channel. <br /> <br /> Jim Larson's comments that it is a "sweet funny story about two people passing through paths" were dead. Writers probably should not receive bonuses, all other SROs for making a movie. <br /> <br /> Anyone who appreciates a romantic film SHOULD SEE. <br /> <br /> The presence of Natasha's screen is so warm and her smile was so electric, not to mention her beauty, that everything she finds is on my favorite list. Her television and printed interviews I have seen are equally refreshing and worth exploring. <br /> <br /> May God bless her, her family and future undertakings. <br /> <br /> This movie does not seem to be available on DVD or video, but I would be the first to buy it and I think others would have done it too.
