Romantic comedy is not the right way to describe "How to Lose Friends and Alienate People". The romance underlying the story is largely superseded by the much more interesting story "rags to wealth." Although the middle line of the story is a bit hastily conveyed, it makes sense in several screenshots; getting rid of "trivialities", focusing on those key relationships that create "office policy" and use these almost unimportant scenes, used only for comic effects. Nevertheless, it works so well, especially with Pegg in the front seat. The film is very clever, playing well on the trans-Atlantic relationship of Pegg, which shares with its stars, and combines well the cross between a society with a high and low standard of living. journey. Different characters in the film are well presented, and casting is definitely a plus. Both the relations between the "trading places" between Pegg and Huston and the relationship "love, hatred" between Pegg and Dunst work so well in history that for a lack of a better word is adorable. Even Fox, whose main advantage is of course sex appeal, shocked what turns out to be quite a dark figure and plays the role of "bimbo". This is one of those films in which every little detail captures the tribute of great work. From transsexual strippers to an amazing soundtrack - all of this goes well with what you can call a clever comedy.
