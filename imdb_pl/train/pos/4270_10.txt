Ko tamo peva is the best comedy of all time. Believe me, I've seen a lot of movies and comedy, but tell me that makes you smile every time you watch it. But the truth is that the humor in this comedy is unique. And the whole former republic of Yugoslavia knows it perfectly !!! So I think the rest of the audience (for example: in Europe) can not enjoy it that way. Because the inscriptions break the hole. But they should at least try it !!!! Yes, it's ironic! This is the best movie in the history of Serbia, and the world does not understand it! :-) If you have a chance to see it, do not blast it OK!
