I can honestly say that I never expected that this movie would be good. I do not like family movies. I'm not a fan of Shahid Kapoor. The director's last film (MPKDH was completely stupid.) The music was very boring and bland, but Amrita Rao became my favorite after Main Hoon Na. There was also Seema Biswas, Alok Nath and Anupam Kher, who are very few pluses. /> <br /> I finally saw the film and was very impressed, bring us young lovers of MPK with a pinch of HAHK and we have a winner.The outline of the story is similar to HAHK, light at the beginning and to the serious mode at the end. I did not like HAHK that the characters were too eccentric, it was perfection, Shahid Kapoor surprised me with a good performance, it is a significant improvement, and most importantly it fits the role. Amrita Rao is the best. it's her best performance, her presence on the screen is so electrifying, you'll surely love her performance Sameer Soni, Amrutha Prakash, An upam Kher, Alok Nath and Seema Biswas are well-mannered, and one actor does not feel out of place. <br /> <br /> The songs were quite disappointing, but they will sound better when you watch them. Mujhe Haq Hai and Do Anjaane Ajnabi are nice ballads. Milan Abhi Aada Adhura Hai is also nice to watch. The songs are not colorful and dance, and more like ballads. The exception is Hamari Shaadi Mein, who is reminded of HSSH and HAHK. So what was the film's disadvantage? The film gets quite slow and the ending is quite stretched. But the movie is still going at a good pace, which makes it an ideal family movie.
