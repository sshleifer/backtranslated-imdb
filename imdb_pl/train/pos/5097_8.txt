This is a very rare movie and probably the least known of Shirley Temple, because it is not in any of her collections. The reason for this is probably that there is no happy ending, unlike all other movies. the musical, although it matches one song, "The world owes me my life". The film was made in 1934 and originally in black and white, the version I have is colorful and on VHS, I would say that they have done a great job as the color looks realistic, other than I would say that Laurel and Hardy's colorful films are horrible. The film is good for its age, and history has not happened at all, I'm surprised that no one has tried. Sometimes the movie is a bit talkative, because some scenes with Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard seem really dragged, in some scenes they seem fifteen minutes to say what they could say in the fifth. do not get discouraged because this movie has really good moments in it, especially when {Jerry} Cooper kills a necklace and hides it in Shirley's bear. The tension and slow building of his actions (while his daughter is singing to the audience in another room) is very well focused. Grams and Caroles are nervous facial expressions, when they are controlled, they are also very good. In all of this is a good movie from the early 30's, accept it for its age.
