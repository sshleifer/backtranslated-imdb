- Jim Blandings (Cary Grant), tired of the rat race and the cramped living conditions in New York, finds real estate in the country for his wife and children. He hopes to find a simple life. But building a home does not turn out to be easy. As headaches and bills begin to accumulate, they also laugh. Will Mr. Blanding ever get his dream home? <br /> <br /> - What makes this film so special is the three main actors - Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas. Each of the three is able to transfer the film themselves, so when you combine their talents, almost every scene is unique. Grant has always been my favorite in this role. She is so good at playing her husband. Loy is always a joy to watch. The Thin Man films she made with William Powell are almost perfect. And Douglas has become my favorite in the last two or three years. Douglas also appeared in The Old Dark House, my favorite. <br /> <br /> - The movie is definitely a product of its time. I imagine that you can build a two-story house with three bedrooms and four bathrooms for USD 15,000 a year. Throw in the knowledge that your two children are attending a private school, and you have a maid and it becomes almost fanciful. <br /> <br /> - However, for everyone who bought or built a house, many situations and the problems in which Blanding found themselves are easy to today. And that's where comedy appears. How many people have done some stupid things that the couple are doing in this movie to end up at the expense of more money than expected? - The biggest complaint I have about Mr. Blandings is the whole thread "love in a wife with best friend". It really is not necessary for the plot and it feels out of place and very uncomfortable, as shown.
