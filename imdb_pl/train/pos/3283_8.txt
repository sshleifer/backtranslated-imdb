As a lover of surrealism (in art and film), I was happy to discover this movie on IFC. It's definitely a guardian. Most other reviews tell the general story (not all correct), so I will not worry about it. The most important thing is the concept of alternative worlds, which is caused by Any's upcoming illness and the way she manages to connect with someone else after she is so "lonely" and finally with her family, which I think is still at least a bit embarrassed. You can call it a horror movie only because it has horrifying scenes, but it's fantasy (with a bit of "maturation" just because Ana is a teenager who "hates boys"). I heartily recommend to those who value the imagination.
