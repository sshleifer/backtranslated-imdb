Stars Vertigo Stewart (in the last queue as a romantic leader) and Novak raise this, another "Christmas movie" by Stewart, for above-average entertainment. The chemistry between the two stars makes the experience quite moving, and further revelations can be obtained from the film if the spells are perceived as a metaphor of private pain that hinders many people's relationships. To sum up, a nice game with legendary stars, 7/10.
