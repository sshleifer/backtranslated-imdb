It seems more than strange that such a complete dreck as "Dukes of Hazzard" and "The Hills Have Eyes" (new version) can find DVD distributors, while older - and much better works like this movie - can not be found . With all the ongoing debate about the morality (or lack thereof) of hostilities and interest in espionage (let us consider a lot of production by Jacek Ryan, Bourne, XXX and "Mission: Impossible", it seems like an obvious choice for it. It seems to be a cinema movie from 1968, because it's a 1968 movie. But if you take style into account, it's still a production that has something valuable to say and has loads of threads to keep the audience entertained. If nothing else, SOMEBODY please consider downloading the soundtrack I do not know if people in the industry are bothering to read what we, fans, have to say about their products, but if you're reading these and other comments, take a look at some CD's, be it compilation with other Morricone music. We pay for your sumptuous homes with our hard-earned dollars spent on tickets, DVDs and CDs - give us what we want! if you read this sz and you have not seen this movie, I have lobbied for its release so that you can see what those of us who saw him are saying. You will not be disappointed.
