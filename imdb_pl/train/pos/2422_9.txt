Yes, it's a low budget. Yes, it's one of Candy's earliest films, but maybe it's his funniest! John Candy was not so far away from his SCTV days in "Going Berserk" and it shows. If you do not collapse when Candy tries to help a guy with his food, being tied to a runaway cohort while having sex with his girlfriend when they share the apartment door (what?), Or the way Euguene Levy (creator of Kong) Fu Yu) talking to mum on the phone, or just countless expressions that only Candy can provide, better check your pulse! If you like John Candy from "Only the Lonely", it may not be a movie that I would advise you to see, but if you like John Candy's SCTV days, this movie is a must!
