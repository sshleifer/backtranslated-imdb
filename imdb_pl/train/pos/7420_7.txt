Although Kris Kristofferson is good at this role, who would not want to see Elvis Pressly instead? With drug addiction and the fall of the highest celebrity can scare away Elvis's agent to be out of the movie, it was a mistake. That would be the perfect movie for Elvis. Although the soundtrack is far from magnificent, Paul Williams and Barbra Streisand do a decent job in creating the original soundtrack for this "period" of the song / musical. A little love story, it is more a drama about the fall of grace and the gift of redemption. Like most tragedies, the hero of the story was death. In addition, Gary Busey is once again perfect in not so perfect a role.
