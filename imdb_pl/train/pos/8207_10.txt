A sudden impact is a story about two aspects. Harry is the target of the crowd who wants to kill him, and Harry is very happy that he can return the favor and show them how to do it. This little war puts Harry in suspension, where he does not care, but he goes on a small holiday. Now the second part of the story. Someone kills some punks, and Harry gets caught up in a situation where he meets Jennifer spencer, a woman with a secret that a small tourist town wants to be silent. The police chief is not a subtle man and warns Harry not to get involved or cause trouble. It's Harry Callahan Trouble that follows him. The crowd keeps track of him in this city, and the hell opens when Harry goes to war. Meanwhile, the guard hits again and the gang who discovered it is ready for it. Jennifer Spencer is captured and Harry comes to her aid during the climax of the film. Sudden Impact is not the biggest Dirty Harry, but at the time he gives us Harry, who is a very anti-hero ready for war only to pursue Justice. Again not the best, not the worst, but the one with the most memorable line. Go forward. Make your day.
