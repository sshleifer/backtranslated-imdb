First of all, this movie has not been published in cinemas (TESTED POORLY THEY SAY), I say that they realized that the story of flashy cops, politicians and devoted journalists has been made to death, just send it to DVD and cable TV> and take the money and run. <br /> <br /> Speaking of this, I usually like this type of movie, especially with this named cast. Morgan Freeman, Justin Timberlake, Kevin Spacey, <br /> <br /> LLCool J, Cary Elways, John Heard and the district, Piper Perabo and Roslyn Sanchez. <br /> <br /> The story and the story have been taken to death, BUT the above cast brings life to this brutal movie and is actually observable. <br /> <br /> Justin Timberlake is good as a dedicated young reporter for the discarded newspaper edited by Morgan Freeman, Others are either cursed cops and politicians, or quite decent men. Two ladies are friends of LL COOL J & JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE and they do what is required. This is quite violent, a lot of homicides, etc., not for children. In any case, this is not a great movie, BUT for what it is and cast. Definitely good, <br /> <br /> Ratings *** (out of 4) 86 points (out of 100) IMDb 8 (currently 10)
