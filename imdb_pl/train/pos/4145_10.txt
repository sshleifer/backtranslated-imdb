This is not the Master Theater. You should not do this, expecting it. It's pure FUN of a girl with the most fantastic cast of female leads. Just like someone else said here, it's a Baby Mama movie that was supposed to be. And the only downside I see in this movie is that there was no Tiny Fey in it - except that he plays the wisest and brightest girls in the world. The film is pure stupidity on the surface, but if you really look, you will know that it has a lot of messages and deep meaning for all of us who want to be able to come back and do it again in life knowing what we know now. CLEAN FUN and I recommend it to anyone who is looking for 84 minutes of a great escape.
