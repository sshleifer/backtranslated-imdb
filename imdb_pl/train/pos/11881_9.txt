Every big gangster movie has a shortage of human drama. Do not expect an emotional story of guilt, revenge and despair on the part of "Scarface". It is a tale of wild greed, corruption and power. The darker side of the legendary "American Dream." <br /> <br /> Anyone who complains about the "cheesy" of this movie does not make sense. Superficial characters, shoddy music and outdated fashions further fuel criticism of this diabolical life. Nothing in the lives of these characters matters, at least at any human level. In fact, the film practically borders on satire, ironically taking into account all the gangster rappers who have been positively inspired by Tony Montana's lifestyle. <br /> <br /> This is not the strongest directorial effort of Brian DePalmy, sometimes it is perfect and well served (especially an unforgettable finale), but often falls on the careless and misleading. Fortunately, he is supported by Oliver Stone's very strong script (probably a good therapy for him, taking into account the habit of coke he was dealing with at the time). The themes are consistent, focusing primarily on the life of Tony Montana and the evolution of his character when he is absorbed in greed and power. Dialogue is also perfect, comfortably seen between humor and drama. There are many distinctive lines that have since entered the popular culture in one form or another. <br /> <br /> The cast makes it the way it is, but it's actually a Pacino movie. One of his earlier, less subtle appearances (something much more common than he is now) is a world completely separated from Michael Corleone and Frank Serpico. Nevertheless, it is just as sensitive as ever, in a very funny (and intentionally exaggerated) form. It's hard to imagine another Tony Montana after watching this movie, probably in one of the most imitated performances in history. Pfeiffer stood out as boring and uncomfortable at first watching, but I realized how he plays the part of a bored little wife. Not an exceptional effort, but unjustly judged badly. Supporting players are also very good, especially Paul Shenar as kind Alejandro Sosa. <br /> <br /> Powerful, sometimes humorous, sometimes shocking and constantly controversial. "Scarface" is one of the eighties films (whatever that may mean for you). An indispensable and accessible gangster movie and a symbol of pop culture. 9/10
