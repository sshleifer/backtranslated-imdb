It has been one of my favorite films for a long time. Recently, I was happy to see it on DVD, which is a relief to watching old, grainy VHS versions. <br /> <br /> I have not seen him for years and I watched him today when I was surprised at how well the movie stands by. This is one of those rare, perfect storm comedies in which great writing (a truly fun line on a really fun line) is combined with excellent direction and excellent performances at the same time. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore was nominated for an Oscar for Arthur, but lost (although John Gielgud won for the best supporting actor). If Moore's performance in Arthur does not score an Oscar for Best Actor, it is proof that no comedian would ever win the title (another example is Gene Wilder in the "Young Frankenstein"). <br /> <br /> Steve Gordon turns the film beautifully maintaining the loyalty of each character and cordial tone of history. Simply IMHO is a rare gem. It is sad that Steve Gordon died just a year after the release of Arthur. <br /> <br /> Regarding the DVD, which is available from 1/2007, it is so. Although video quality is a jump from old VHS copies, there is still no panoramic version available. <br /> <br /> There are a few add-ons on the DVD that are nice, but it's just not enough. One example is the Director's comment stating how much he would like some of the removed scenes and scenes to be included (because they were hysterical), but he had to make difficult choices for final editing. A DVD, which is an ideal format for placing such material, should certainly also offer it. <br /> <br /> This original "Arthur" is a classic comedy that is one of the books.
