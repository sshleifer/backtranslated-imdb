There are several such comedies in which almost every line and every character are getting closer to perfection. It's very funny !! And there's enough satire there. Sally Field is a leader among truly outstanding actors and performs a good, if not perfect, work with his daily television diva. Sometimes her acting is a little too wide, but 90% of the time is rebellion! In the same league is Kevin Kline, Robert Downey Jr. and Whoopy Goldberg (who unfortunately have too little to do here). Downey Jr. may not be totally convinced as a comedian and does not have the right sense of time, but he is struggling with his part, which, to be honest, is the most ungrateful. But the shining star here is Cathy Moriarty as Celeste, a real bitch, if you ever had one with a nasty secret (you'll see in an absolutely stunning final!). Unfortunately, Elisabeth Shue never seems quite comfortable on her part. I usually like Ms Shue, but here she acts like a fish out of water and sometimes it seems that she is in a different movie. But this is not something harmful and is mostly at least sufficient. Otherwise, full of unforgettable lines and situations, it's a comedy to watch on TV or anywhere.
