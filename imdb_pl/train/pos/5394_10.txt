I was totally hypnotized by this series from the moment when Tom Long went into the shot - the whole "bad boy", it was just addictive. <br /> <br /> The story has drawn, what will happen next - did Joey finally get the girl, after 5 years in prison and all the time thinking about her lost love, crossing paths with her, stating that she has a son ... Although he is a brutal bad guy, you still want him to find happiness. <br /> <br /> Really captivating two people - please bring it to the video!
