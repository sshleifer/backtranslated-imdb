The case of Scorpio's tail is a very stylish giallo directed by Sergio Martino, who seems to be the master of giallo, the second after Dario Argento. <br /> <br /> Ernesto Gastaldi wrote this wonderful, quirky, rather complex, but ultimately very satisfying and funny murder mystery. This also makes sense in the end, a big plus, because this is not always the case with these giallo, because they tend to stretch credibility with endless red herrings and final solutions. Here, the less you know about the plot, the better. <br /> <br /> The current trademarks of pure giallo are beautiful cinematography, catchy music, wonderful women (Anita Strindberg is a goddess), brutal murders, black kittens in black gloves and explicit sex scenes to name a few. <br /> <br /> In most cases, this is a decent behavior, Goerge Hilton his usually satisfying himself and others doing quite well. Martino steers with a steady hand, keeps things tight and climatic with some great sets. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of giallo, this is what you have to see. If you like generally written and thrilled thrillers, this is highly recommended.
