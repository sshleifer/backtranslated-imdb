David Duchovny and Michelle Forbes play a young journalist couple who want to go to California, but they can not afford it, so they "ride together" with another young couple (Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis) to save on expenses. to stop at various places of murders along the way, places where serial killers did their thing, because Brian (Duchovny) is a writer, and Carrie (Forbes) is his photographer. They do not know that Pitt (Earley) and Lewis are a serial killer and a girl who just agrees with what he says. I do not care about Pitt as a rule, but he gives justice to mental roles. The frightening thing is that it does them so well; like he did before, no, not a killer, but with the same attitude. In any case, when the journey continues, Carrie guesses that others are out of money, but Earley seems to always spend money in some way ... never think he leaves someone here and there to do it, but Lewis fulfills her role of the one in which she stands out, not very clear waif who has a good heart, but does not understand that he does not have to endure him by Earley when he does something that he does not like. As things become more and more unacceptable, Carrie insists that the other couple will be released into the gas station and, unfortunately, at the moment is inside and sees an information bulletin that tells her exactly who they were driving with, then in a quick clip everything goes down. This is not the best movie in the world, but it's not bad ... I watched what was to be "unrated", but I wonder how much was cut from the reviewed version, because it seemed to me quite tame, Really ... no it makes it a family tariff or something like that, unless it's the Manson family. 7 out of 10.
