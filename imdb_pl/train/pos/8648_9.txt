California is a movie about lost ideals. Journey on the darkest way. The road of no return. The story is about a couple who decided to find a better life in California. The man (so far David Duchovny in his best role) wants to write a book about the famous crimes that happened in America, and his girlfriend - photographer - will take pictures. So they set off along the trail of famous murders, not knowing what awaits them along the way. To share travel costs, they decide to find another pair and place an ad. But the couple who responds to this is not just ANY couple. This is one of the strangest couples in history. The girl is a naive, frail creature who dreams a lot and loves cacti. The man is exactly the opposite. A cruel, ruthless killer. We learn this at the beginning of the film and follow him on a journey to California (not from C as usual, but from K, probably symbolizing the word killer), during his journey of betrayal, murder and finally defeat. All the leaders, Duchovny, Pitt, Lewis and Forbes give really good performances and you have to take into account that when the movie was filmed, even one of them was not a star. Photography is amazing, with the dark covering the largest parts of the film, and the music suits the dark character of the film. All in all, it's a really good movie. Do not miss it. Think again before you take a stranger in the car to share the gas!
