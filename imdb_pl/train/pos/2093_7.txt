It's a little too long (2 hours, 20 minutes), but it contained many of the famous novels by Pearl Buck. In other words, a lot of land to cover. <br /> <br /> It was a soap opera at times, but it also had some visually dramatic moments, ending with a locust attack at the end of the movie. It was amazing. Given that this movie is about 70 years old, the crew with special effects of this film did a spectacular job. <br /> <br /> Paul Muni and Luise Rainer have been award-winning actors in their day and do not disappoint here, both give powerful performances. The only problem is credibility, because all Asians play in Caucasions, and some, like Walter Connolly, just do not look real. I would like to see the transformation of this movie with actors from all over Asia, not for computer reasons, but simply to make the story look and sound more believable.
