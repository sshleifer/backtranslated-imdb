Originally, I watched this movie on Amazon about 6 or 7 years ago, and it exploded. I believe that I have called it "unfortunate" and "turkey". Okay, well, he's still a turkey by most standards. There is almost no production value, what a small plot has almost no meaning, and the action is at the level of the third-class game. Having said that, it really has grown up over me for years as a kind of camp classic. In fact, all the films of director Todd Sheets had such an effect. In this respect they are almost like Ed Wood: watch them over and over and choose small lines, continuity errors (the same zombie, two different locations!) And other disadvantages. <br /> <br /> say this: Sheets are a very nice guy and although it's one of his first productions, he's not so great, he's improved. And I must add that the only really decent actor / actress in the movie is Kasey Rousch, although I may be biased because I went to school with her.
