In "Love Crimes" by Lizzie Borden (1992) Sean Young plays steadfast D.A. in Atlanta. He is a loner who is too deeply involved in the case of a man (Patrick Bergin) who poses as a famous fashion photographer and seduces women, makes them compromising photos, and then leaves them. <br /> <br /> Naturally, this hard loner decides to enter a false shutter life, posing for his victim, wanting to bring him to justice. They meet, they love each other, and then he knows that he is on his knees, he gets spanked. (Note: The spanking scene only appears in the "priceless" version of this video, the R-rated version skips it and some other scenes that would make the story more clear.) This psychological thriller includes several scenes of nudity and disturbing images such as Bergin chasing one of his victims in the room, brandishing a horse on her. <br /> <br /> As a thriller, "Love Crimes" is at its best when Sean Young plays his cat and speaks with Bergin, trying to catch him in the act. It is a pity that the film does not end, it just stops. It is true. Director Lizzie Borden could have a story to tell, but after 92 minutes, the subtitles start spinning, and we stay with the enigmatic "what happened?" Daze. <br /> <br /> The development of Young's plan takes place in an engaging style, but the lack of a consistent ending will be unacceptable to some viewers. <br /> <br /> Dan (daneldorado @ yahoo.com)
