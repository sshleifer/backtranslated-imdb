I love it! Fred MacMurray is wonderful as Skid Johnson, a somewhat conceited, proud and at the same time very sensitive saxophonist who is in love with Maggie (Carole Lombard) who is always there for him. They meet in Panama after Maggie leaves the ship and end up at the bar with Anthony Quinn. Tony gets hit on the nose after Maggie's insults, thinking she's a loose woman - all because she has publicly removed her hat. Big fight and Maggie ends in Panama. Romance. Carole and Artur are wonderful. Maggie is always there for him whenever she needs her. He encourages him to go to NY, where (take a good look at the movie and find out). They have these wonderful scenes together, where he sings in his arms when he plays the saxophone. I definitely recommend it.
