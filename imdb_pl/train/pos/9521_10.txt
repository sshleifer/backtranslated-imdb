I think this movie is brilliant. There are many reasons why they are one of them: 1) good acting of Tom and Tyler 2) genius scene of machine guns, which was a piece of glare 3) I thought the ending was a good twist, because I never expected that in the end all merits for Sam Mendes.as, and also for these three points, the film form of the film is also good. I am a film student at a college and studied this film in great detail and it was one of the best films I've seen for many years. I would like to thank everyone involved in the creation of this film. I would like to say that the best scene in the movie is the scene of machine guns in which John Rooney is killed, it's just pure brilliance in making the scene in silence, until John Rooney says "I'm glad that you" is much I think so better because the viewer creates his own sound there and this sound is completely different for every viewer simply brilliant. <br /> <br /> thank you for reading this comment written by Ross Kirk at the age of 16
