This picture appeared in 1975 and was the second of the three parts of the life cycle of Sheriff Buford Pusser. Because Svenson takes over the role of sheriff Buford Pusser, and Luke Askew plays the role of Mobster Pinky Dobson. The last time we saw Sheriff Pusser, who lay in a hospital bed after him and his wife, who died in an ambush on Sunday morning. After recovering Pusser, he follows people who killed his wife. Is Pusser able to complete the revenge for which he is going, or whether the mafia tries to lead him out before he succeeds. The only thing that bothers me in this picture is a real true story. How could you leave the city with this kind of crime, but still not do anything about it. Since there was no real actress with the name in this picture, I can not give her 10 weaselstars, but I can give 8
