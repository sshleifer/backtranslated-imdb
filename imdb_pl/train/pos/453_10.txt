I always tell people that "Enchanted April" is an adult film without any curses, no sex and no violence. One would think that this is "the best movie for chickens", but I bet there is one or two enlightened men who love him too. However, do not invite children. This movie is very low. <br /> <br /> Seeing "Enchanted April" is a very healing experience. The soundtrack and magnificent scenery, along with gentle manners of the ladies, bring to mind the peace and beauty of the Pre-Raphaelite image. <br /> <br /> So that no one would think that yours is really watching only one type of film paraphrases the line I heard in "Saturday Night Live" once and say that my two favorite movies are "The Deer Hunter" and "Enchanted" april ".
