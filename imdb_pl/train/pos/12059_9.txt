I love stories about ghosts in general, but I COULD really LOVE the cool, atmospheric and elegantly terrifying British ghost stories. This qualifies in every respect. A naive young lawyer ("attorney" in Britspeak) is sent to a small village by the sea to settle in the estate of an elderly, deceased woman. It is 1920, a time when many middle class Britons are going to the seaside for "health" holidays. Well, guess, there's nothing "healthy" in Crythin Gifford, a terrifying place in the mighty, thoughtful Victorian mansion of an elderly woman who is on the outskirts of a foggy swamp. When a lawyer saves the life of a little girl (none of the locals will help the threatened tot - you will find out why later in the movie), accidentally involves the anger of an evil ghost, a woman in black. It is not a transparent, airy spectrum, but a solid black silhouette of malice and evil. The viewer sees her only a few times, but you feel her hostility in every cage. When the camera sneaks into a lawyer, when you are reading legal documents, at any moment you expect to see a woman in black. When the attorney goes out to the generator shed to turn on the electricity for the terrifying old house, the camera writhes on it and you think it will appear there too. Waiting for the appearance of a woman in black is extremely tense. We have already seen many elements of this story (a closed room to which no one enters, a fog, a naive outsider who ignores local warnings), but the director somehow manages to combine them into a completely new and seemingly irresistible plot. Follow him with a friend so that someone can catch you waiting for a woman in black. . .
