"Amazing Mr. Williams "plays Melvyn Douglas, who in 1939. He made five films, one of which is Ninotchka with Garbo. His collaborator was Joan Blondell (Maxine), who also made five films this year, three of which they did together! Douglas is Lieutenant Williams, and he and his companions have a dead body and they must find out what really happened. Viewers recognize his collaborators - actors (Clarence Kolb, Donald MacBride, Don Beddoe) have always played positions of power ... senators, presidents of banks, policemen. This motherfucker has the talent for comedy - the police always throw themselves at each other, and even Williams and his girlfriend are fighting verbally. A few funny gags - Williams takes even the man he arrested for a date with his girlfriend. There are lots of cool things here, so avoid a slow start and wait for fun things later. You do not want to give out any spoilers, so you have to catch him in Turner's classic films. Director Alexander Hall made mainly comedies and apparently he was engaged to Lucy at some point.
