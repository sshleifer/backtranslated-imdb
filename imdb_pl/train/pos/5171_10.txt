If I could come back, even as an adult, and experience the days of my summer spent in the camp ... I would be there so soon. The camps I went to were not even that great. They were in Texas, where the mosquitoes actually take people, but we had horses and we fished. The cinematography was amazing, the characters funny and credible, especially Perkins, Pollack and Arkin. Sam Raimi's character and sub-pranks were invaluable. So who ever thought that this movie is bad ... I have a deep pity, because they can not suspend their disbelief long enough to imagine camp life as an adult or never went as children. The idea was that these people had the opportunity to step back and become juveniles again, so they did it at every opportunity. I would like to be able to. It was fun, intelligent, beautifully written, well-manned and the artistry takes me back, so I want to watch it over and over, even in the scenery. Like Dances with Wolves and LadyHawk ... good films, but wasteland becomes just as characters as actors. Rent it, see it, buy it and watch it again and again ... it never gets old. ; 0)
