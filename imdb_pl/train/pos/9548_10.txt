It is a great thriller from Turkey that can make sense. A great job from the Gokbakar brothers. <br /> <br /> First of all, I want to point to the game on the screen. Generally, screening in most of the films from Turkey is not enough, but GEN has the best pictures that could be said "perfect". And also the transition parts are really perfect. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, "Gen" has a great theme that affects everyone. Especially a woman who wants to be a psychiatrist in a sanatorium has a mother who is just madness. The basic causes and psychological consequences are given in Gen. The only thing you have to do is combine all the tips. <br /> <br /> There is an impressive part of the aggression played by Doga Rutkay and Sahan Gokbakar. This performance may be more realistic than "Irr√©versible (Monica Bellucci)". <br /> <br /> The last thing I want to say is "Watch this movie, you'll be confused"
