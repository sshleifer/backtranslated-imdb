Family problems abound in real life and that's what the movie is about. Love can keep members together through trials and trials, and that's what the movie is about. One man, father, is mature and bravery to keep the family in the face of adversity. Children grow up, and the only thing is that they realize firsthand that no matter how old they are and their parents, parents still love their children and are ready to give them a pillow when they fall. ALL actors playing their characters had great performances. Yes, I dropped a tear knowing that I had similar experiences as a young adult and later as a parent. This real life is what every young adult and parent will do well, although some will not realize it until they are also parents. Must see for those who care about their families.
