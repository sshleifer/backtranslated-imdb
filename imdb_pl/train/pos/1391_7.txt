Considering that it was made at a low budget, TIME LASTS COMPLETED the best way to use the budget thanks to the surprisingly good work with special effects. <br /> <br /> The story is about a family that is about to move into their solar system - they've powered the house in an isolated part of the Mojave desert in southwestern California, just to destroy it - they think motorbike vandals. But their youngest daughter (Natasha Ryan) began to see the mysterious things - the green pyramid, strange humanoid figures, etc. Only recently the light of the explosion of three-dimensional stars caused unusual auroras in the desert sky. In this way, the family, led by Jim Davis and Dorothy Malone, face the strange alien forces that have placed them in a space-time warp. <br /> <br /> Mixing elements from 2001: SPACE OF ODYSSEY and CLOSED THIRD PARTY MEETINGS, TIME-LASTED MEETING, despite obvious flaws and uneven operation, remain interesting due to the excellent special effects of David Allen. The desert setting is very suitable for close encounters of this movie; and although the film can not be compared to both Kubrick's and Spielberg's films, THE FINISHING TIME DAY is much better than many other 2001 knockouts. CLOSE MEETINGS. I praise the director of John "Buda" Cardos, whose thriller of the 1977 KINGDOM OF THE SPIDERS prepared an interesting forerunner of ARACHNOPHOBIA, at least for a rehearsal - and on this basis I give TIME ENDED ON DAY 7 by 10.
