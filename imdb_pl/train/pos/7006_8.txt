The haunted secret Ben Thomas (Will Smith) seeks redemption, radically changing the lives of seven people he does not know. When his plan is established, nothing will stop him. At least he thinks so. But Ben did not plan to fall in love with one of these people and she would turn him over. Will Smith returns with director Gabriele Muccino after the inspirational film "The Pursuit of Happiness". "Seven Pounds" is another experience changing the movie life, which not only reminds you of their previous collaboration, but is full of tears, but finally inspires you with joy. Will Smith is also a producer with several others. These films are very realistic, which presents the life of an ordinary person and his struggles in life. Seven pounds could take some time to achieve your real momentum, but after half an hour of film the film is ready to rule your heart. This movie also has some twists and turns that allow viewers to guess. Director Gabriele Muccino is once again the winner with his emotional but inspiring message. It makes all the characters of the movie very real, that people will actually find themselves somewhere in the movie. Together with the director Will Smith is another winner, with his great acting skills. Once again, the duet of the director and actor acts like a charm. The film also has other talented actors who did a good job. Rosario Dawson, beauty with the brain, you can call it. It looks beautiful and feels very good. Barry Pepper gives great support for the film, and Woody Harrelson does the same, although Woody did not have much time on the screen (it would be good if he had more). You will not forget this movie easily. Watch this movie and change your life. Top-class cinema!
