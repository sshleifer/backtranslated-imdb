Now it's more similar! The first movie contained a bit fluffy dialogue and a bit weaker acting, but it seems that the band behind it, collected their stuff for the sequel and released a solid, very pleasant, funny and creative comedy that will keep everyone on the edge of their seats all through way. <br /> <br /> Seriously, it's just full of great things, full of creativity, and less parody in movies from the 80's at the same time. Scenes in hell are great, just like the ones in Heaven. I really do not miss a crazy whim that promises you'll never see such a movie. Even the final film by Hammy is not as bad as the first, generally delighting and enjoying the amazing stereotype of family movie happiness. And even Keanu Reeves, although he's about 30 years old, is not so bad here. <br /> <br /> Sounds like a good deal to me.
