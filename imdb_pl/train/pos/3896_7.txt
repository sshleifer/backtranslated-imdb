Some people loved the "Aristocrats", and others hated it, often stepping into the middle. Reactions to Eddie Izzard will not be so extreme - if you deal with a transvestite comedian (who says he likes girls) and have a vocabulary that, let's say, just use the word "f" that his program would be a long sound if it was presented in network television. Many Izzard fans are so devoted that they do not see any flaws in his performances. On the other hand, it seemed to me that this show was sometimes flatter than Izzard's breast, but also more often than not funny and, in some cases, absolutely funny. Has a way to combine references from procedures at the beginning of the show to its subsequent procedures. He is not a story-teller. He is not the creator of jokes. He is not a crazy fanatic like Robin Williams. He plays with ideas, some of which work, and some of them - for example, the routine in the cable car in San Francisco and Alcatraz - are completely unpleasant. However, he has a way to go gracefully with the flop and expand the ones that come together. I gave this performance on 7 and I can convince him to raise it to 8. But 10? No way.
