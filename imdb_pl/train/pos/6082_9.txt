I've always liked the classic versions of Shakespeare Kenneth Branagh, because he always does a very good job, but in this movie, the one who picks up the whole movie is nothing but "the always-great actor" Laurence Fishburne. He certainly made some weak choices in the movies, even though he is a great actor, but in this we were really given the real Othello: passion, intensity of jealousy, when it grows with the well-presented Fishburne paranoia, and finally, we have a black Othello! <br /> <br /> I do not think they can choose a better Othello. Who else could give him this mixture of compassion / antipathy, love / hatred and, without forgetting, those fiery eyes ...? Branagh is always good, but not at the top, Desdemona Ir√©ne Jacob is quite good, but a bit grim, while Laurence Fishburne really raises her and makes it a very interesting and enjoyable movie. Watch it.
