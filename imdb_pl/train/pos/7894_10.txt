It's a great program that will make you cry, this group of people really love each other in real life and shows it again and again. Write to me and talk. I was in Australia and they are really talking that way. <br /> <br /> I want you to enjoy Five Mile Creek and give these wonderful stories of good and evil and friendship with your children. I have all 40 episodes on DVD-R that I've collected in the last 5 years. See my tribute to Five Mile Creek at www.mikeandvicki.com and listen to extended thematic music. Let's talk about them. <br /> <br /> These people are so cool!
