Let's start with this positive review - I'm glad that they did not decide to get Tony out of a shot and make a retrospective season, as some people gossiped. In fact, the creator and author of this episode, David Chase, did the opposite. Actually, we do not know if Tony will live or will die. He is in a coma, and his chances of recovery are very small. This episode seemed to move very slowly, and the coma triggered a dream in which Tony was involved in a false identity, and the evil Asian monks striking him from the outside were absolutely strange. After 45 minutes, it got a little tired that everyone was grieving, but that should not be a reason to shut this episode. It was a strange and unpredictable episode, but it was still well-written and intense. Edie Falco gave amazing results determining career in this episode, because a conflicted wife who had to face her husband could die. I also found out that the interesting AJ fell out of school and swore revenge on Junior, which AJ probably will not have the ball. Silvio is now the boss actor, which opens many doors to problems in later episodes. In this episode there were also many great observations and I think that Vito "Polak-Palacz" may meet with his fall, if he will be greedy SOB <br /> <br /> It was not a great episode and disappointed just because although Tony it kills people, we like it as an audience and we feel that it is our hero of the series. It was a necessary episode for this series, even though it was a bit of a snoring that made us conclude. Acknowledgment for the performance of Edie Falco and David Chase and writers for creating this completely original and unpredictable twists. This is the only season of "The Sopranos" in which I have no idea where it will go. I can not wait for the episode next week. My rating: 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> The best episode line: (Paulie to AJ): "Let's go, Van Helsing!"
