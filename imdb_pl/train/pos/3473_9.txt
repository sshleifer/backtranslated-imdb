I admit that I had some concerns when I first saw the announcement of this film. Did the VH-1 tread here on the hollow ground? I mean, Harris and Quinn do not really look or even sound like John or Paul. But I must admit that this movie really surprised me. This is far from the expected exploitation movie. Instead, it is a study of the form, bland, capricious and ultimately bittersweet look at friendship and the ultimate lesson that we all learn: capturing what we once had and what has passed us is difficult, if not impossible.
