I loved this movie all my life. It's also a smart story with lots of classic allusions. e.g. The ship, which was lost several decades earlier, was called Bellerophonem. Well, in classical mythology it was the man who killed the Chimera, a legendary beast made of two or more other creatures. In FP Walter Pidgeon is undoubtedly a chimera - he and his monster Id. <br /> <br /> I like movies where writers have clearly attributed a bit of intelligence to their viewers, unlike most modern hits that spend $ 150 million on special effects, but about $ 1.50 for the screenplay. / Regards
