Warner Bros' excellent effort with Errol Flynn in one of his best performances on screen. He is often mentioned as the best, and I really can not fully judge until I see his "Dawn Patrol". However, his work in "They Died With Their Boots On" requires minting. I'm a big Flynn fan (he's my favorite actor after James Mason - it also helps him being an Australian) and I think he's just a great, great screen presence, and a great actor. He is the main character of "Gentleman Jim" as a legendary boxer with fanciful leg work, but he is also supported by a literate, warm and funny script and the direction of Raoul Walsh. Every Walsh movie I've seen never loses the rhythm of his tempo, he was a born filmmaker. Walsh beautifully manages the ring scenes, as is the case with lighter moments and this moving, great final scene between Ward Bord and Flynn. Add great production values ​​to it ("Gay Nineties" never looked better!) And it was a wonderful cast, and it's a perfect entertainment. Alan Hale usually played Flynn's midfielder, but here is his father and it works. Alexis Smith is interested in Flynn's love. The couple fall in love with each other.
