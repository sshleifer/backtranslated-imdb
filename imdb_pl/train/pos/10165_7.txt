Actually, my vote is 7.5. Anyway, the movie was good, it has funny parts that deserve to be seen, do not get me wrong, it's not the funniest movie in the world, and it's not even original because it's an idea that we've seen before in other movies but this one has his own taste, my friend told me that it's a movie for boys ... I think not really, but who cares? There is another movie that shows us almost the same topic, Chris Rock appears in it, the name is Down to Earth, men, this is a very funny movie, see both if you want and I know that you will agree that Mr. Rock won with with your movie. I would like the heroes of the heroes to get Ashton Kutcher, but the film is good.
