I love Ashley Judd and I think all her movies are great. Ruby <br /> <br /> in Paradise is one of her best. It's a very understated movie that you really need to watch to appreciate. The story of a woman who tries to do it herself and refuses to give in to temptations that would make her life easier. Some of her films, such as Kiss The Girls and Time to Kill, were probably better at movie box offices and movie rentals. They were very good movies <br /> <br />, but take some time to really look at Ruby and I think you'll agree that this is one of Ashley's best. <br /> <br />
