I do not know why the critics destroyed this movie. I almost disagree with them. <br /> <br /> The movie could have been a little more frightening - I do not usually go to horror movies! I even had to get up mentally to see it during the day. I did not have to worry! ;) (The cinema was full of children too, heh !;) ... Liam was great as always. I also liked Catharine Zeta Jones (Theo) and Lili Taylor (Eleanor-Nell) <br /> <br /> The house was very Gothic and beautiful in a terrible way. The special and sound effects were amazing. I also loved music, especially gentle melodies for Eleanor and her journey to save the children, how she grew out of her stasis and life, and finally gained power, peace and freedom.
