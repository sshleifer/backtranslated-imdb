A classic, very influential low-budget thriller that spawned the icon of horror and began the career of both director Carpenter and star Curtis. <br /> <br /> A seemingly unstoppable killer escapes from a psychiatric institution and returns to his hometown, where he begins to persecute a local babysitter in Halloween. <br /> <br /> Halloween is a movie that never fails in its reputation for a masterpiece of horror! The horrifying story of Carpenter and the clever direction give this film such a poignantly good life that you have to see it! Direction often consists of such simple elements, shadows, dark streets, creaking doors that even the everyday surroundings of a small town are really terrifying. Carpenter tolerates well the tension and shocks that make them the most surprising, which in itself is a feat that few horror filmmakers will ever manage! In addition, he is wise enough to give us really nice young characters and a very scary villain, so that the tension would be even stronger. The highest ratings also apply to Carpenter's simple but terrifyingly disturbing musical result. In a sense, Halloween is a great example of a perfect horror movie! <br /> <br /> The cast is great. Young Jamie Lee Curtis makes a very nice phrase as a lovely babysitter, Laurie Strode, she's good enough to appear in many other horror movies before she enters bigger movies. Great Donald Pleasants is doing great as a Myer doctor who desperately wants to catch him again. Supporting casts Loomis, Soles, Castle and others are also good. <br /> <br /> Just like its villain, Halloween is an unstoppable force that never fails and thrills. It MUST be for all fans of the genre! <br /> <br /> **** with ****
