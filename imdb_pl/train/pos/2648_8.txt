Really the story of two conceited brothers and their falls by grace (through addiction to drugs) and later redemption. One brother, the self-proclaimed genius played by James Franco, is a typical sensitive but intelligent child-child. The second brother is a hard-working future doctor who becomes less judgmental because he falls victim to addiction, struggling with stress related to meeting family expectations for both children. Not as heavy as fabulous drugs, actually quite a realistic sketch of family dynamics, which is caused by drug problems. I recommend it to anyone interested in such character studies and I praise James Franco for his efforts in what was of course the work of love.
