A violent and rebellious twenty-five-year-old sailor, Antwone Fisher (Derek Luke), is sent for three sessions with a naval psychiatrist, Dr. Jerome Davenport (Denzel Washington), after another explosion and aggression to a senior navy. Reluctant at the beginning of treatment, he gains confidence in dr. Davenport and reveals his childhood, revealing painful injuries generated in his foster home. In the meantime, he meets Cheryl Smolley (Joy Briant) and falls in love. By solving his personal problems, Antwone becomes a new man. This real family drama is a moving and positive story of a man who finds a friend and is sent back to a normal life. Denzel Washington's direction is excellent, making a sensitive, attractive and with good taste a tale of violence against children. In the hands of another director it can be a very hard story. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Voltando a Viver" ("Return to Life")
