I am the parent of a child with special needs and I really enjoyed this movie! It was nice, warm and funny. I learned a long time ago to see humor in things. I especially thought that it was cute, like all other characters, worried about Frankie and who would look after him after his grandmother's death. Before the editing of the film, I participated in the screening of the film with other parents and siblings of children with special needs. Everyone liked the movie that inspired great discussions. We talked about how our children laugh at us and talked about how we worry about them. The screenwriter talked about how he works with autistic children and other children with special needs as a volunteer for several years. She leaned the figure on a real person. Our family is endowed with a sense of humor that has led us to very stressful times. I give the film two thumbs up !!!
