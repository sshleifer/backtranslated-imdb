Oh, this is such a great musical. They are a bit wrong - Frank Sinatra is very misunderstood as the Jewish Nathan Detroit, although it becomes obvious only in "Sue Me", which is clearly a Jewish song. Unfortunately, the creators of the film decided to cut one of the best songs from the program "Marry the Man Today" and replace it with a worse showcase Sinatra. Given these two drawbacks, the movie is great. Jean Simmons shines like Sarah Brown. Marlon Brando can not sing worth of beans, but he does it anyway. Stubby Kaye returns wonderfully to her role on Broadway (it was written for him). Damon Runyon's language, pace and humor are quite good. This is on my "see all" list.
