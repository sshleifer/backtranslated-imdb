One of the biggest hits of 1926, Brown of Harvard, is an exciting comedy / drama in which there are regattas and football scenes that gave William Haines the role he needs to become the main star. He is patented by Haines all the time: a brash intelligent aleck who takes nothing seriously until he is rejected by all the wise and becomes a man / hero and wins the girl. Nobody worked like Haines. A great comic actor (Little Annie Rooney of Mary Pickford, Show People with Marion Davies), Haines has been able to swing from comedy to tragedy with a change in facial expression. He is absolutely happy in this film because he was in Tell It to the Marines (with Lon Chaney) and West Point (with Joan Crawford), where he repeats the formula. Mary Brian is good as a girl, Jack Pickford is very good as a sickly roommate, Ralph Bushman is a rival. Edward Connelly, Mary Alden, David Torrence, Guinn Williams and Grady Sutton cooperate with each other. This film is now known for the homoerotic relationship between Haines and Pickford and the film debut of John Wayne as the player of Yale (but I have never noticed him). Haines was the fifth cash star from this image to 1932. It is a pity that he was largely forgotten and that most of his films seem to be lost. He was one of the most attractive and talented actors of his time.
