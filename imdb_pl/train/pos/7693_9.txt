"GOOD TIME", in my opinion, is a CBS hit! Despite the fact that I have never seen each episode, I still like it. It's hard to say which one is my favorite. Besides, I really like the theme song. If you asked me, though I like everyone, it would be nice if everyone stayed in the program for the entire duration. Everyone always gave a good performance, the spectacle was spectacular, the costumes were well designed, and the writing was always very strong. In summary, although it can now be viewed on TV Land, I definitely recommend catching it in case it disappears from the air for good.
