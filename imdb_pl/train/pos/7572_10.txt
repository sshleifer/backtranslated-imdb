I just can not believe that these games can become much better, but it happens. Unfortunately, I had to rent a Dreamcast to play it, but even though I beat him, I can not wait to buy it on PS2. This is the only series of games that I need to have, even if I beat them many times. I hope they never stop doing this type of game, even if the series has to end. <br /> <br />
