The film is not easy to watch - it is over three and a half hours and consists only of conversations. However, it is such an incredibly convincing and ruthless observation of human character that in my humble opinion it is one of the greatest films of all time. <br /> <br /> The movie is depressing, cynical and cruel. (If you want something uplifting, see the fantastic Céline and Julie Go Boating by Jacques Rivette, which was created at the same time). He shows that the idealism of the late 1960s was nothing but a society that he tried to change. <br /> <br /> It's about a supposedly liberated ménage-à-trois between Alexander (played by Jean-Pierre Leaud), Marie (Bernadette Lafont) and Veronica (Francoise Lebrun). However, Alexandre turns out to be as chauvinistic and jealous as any other man. Women are exposed to voluntary submission and define their femininity through a masculine look. <br /> <br /> The film is an extremely icy tip of the highly revolutionary French New Wave. This movement was one of the most important movements in the history of the film and exerted a huge influence on cinema as we know it. Jean-Pierre Leaud was one of the key actors of the New Wave who performed (among others) in the influential Les Quatres Cent Coups (1959) by Francois Truffaut as a rebellious teenager. Director Jean Eustache is not as well known as other directors from New Wave, but he should be. <br /> <br /> There is no improvisation (as opposed to similar films by John Cassavetes from the USA) and dialogue comes true conversations. The film is in harmony with Eustache's personal experience. For example, Francoise Lebrun was Eustache's former lover. Eustache himself committed suicide in 1981, and the real person on which Marie was based also did so. Anger and bitterness end in Veronica's shocking monologue conveyed directly to the public, breaking the cool nature of the rest of the film. This hypnotic, personal and honest film statement remains one of the most revealing films about human nature.
