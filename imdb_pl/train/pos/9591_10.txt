An excellent document. Personally, I remember growing up in New York in the early 80's. This video is for anyone who was not present during this period. This shows one thing that was felt by the class of African-American gay homosexuals, and the love and camadrie you see are real. People are real and unfortunately few are still alive when they write. The balls are still kept, but not as much as they were in the eighties. This time has passed forever. This is a good movie "homo thug". When Queens were really proud of being extroverted. Saying goodbye to Storyville is another era gone, but the hail history is very documented!
