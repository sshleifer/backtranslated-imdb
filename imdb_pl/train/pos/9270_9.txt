I must say that before you read this review, this is by no means a statement against Iranian people ... if you really want to read something about it, I hope you see that I am generally against politicians ... but if you want to be offended ... I can not help you! <br /> <br /> Not in Iran, because this movie is banned there (see IMDb trivia for this movie). It's a pity because the movie is great. If not for "Grbavica", this film would win at the International Film Festival in Berlin. <br /> <br /> Right (it was second or second place if you prefer). Why? Because it is a movie about oppression. It is not even that it is a complete problem for women. The point is that the government is trying to stop people. Analogy so clear that the government felt the need to ban the film. But by banning it, nothing is solved and / or can they make this movie disappear! <br /> <br /> Another reviewer had a great summary line: "Comedy about the tragedy", which sums it up pretty well!
