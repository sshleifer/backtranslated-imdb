Essentially, a movie can be one of the most mesmerizing titles of one of the two Scotts (Ridley and Tony). Let's say that the movie deserves its hype as one of the most stylish actors / thrillers ever created. <br /> <br /> When it comes to dissatisfied tragic heroes, Denzel Washington and Tony Scotts really create the perfect duo. Both this movie and Deja Vu are better thrillers you can expect. Washington really felt very comfortable in the shaky cameras and all the scenes in the film. You could easily link the emotions of his character, so he enjoyed all the killings on the road. It's a success that they created a super-dark city with Mexico with a lot of shit. One could easily see the degree of corruption shown in Man On Fire. I do not know what the Mexicans will think when they see it ...... <br /> <br /> Well, let's face it. He is one of the best Death Wish genres, but he also suffers from a huge amount of violence. It's a bit annoying that they justify the guard's actions, making the movie very realistic and allowing Denzel Washington to play the tragic hero of the "lost sheep" character. In the end, even the kidnapper was kidnapped in his own pool, like in a documentary. I checked IMDb if the movie was based on real events for this purpose ...... So this is to be considered if it turns out that the theme of the movie is a bit fake. <br /> <br /> In the end, I hope you would not take this movie for real. <br /> <br /> 8/10 za reżyserię / montaż / film / Denzel Washington.
