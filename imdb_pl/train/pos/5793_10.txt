Michael Jackson's moonwalker is a real adventure film for the whole family! <br /> <br /> Before the real story starts, we get a Bad Tour (Man In The Mirror) performance that starts a great movie. Then we have a kind of Michael collage, just like Moonwalker appeared in 1988. After a few music videos (Speed ​​Demon, Leave Me Alone, etc.) The story begins. <br /> <br /> The plot is basically that Michael and his three friends (children) are being chased by a bad guy from the story "Mr. Big, "because they discovered his evil plans to get children around the world into drugs. During the chase we see fantastic segments, fx. Michaels' movie for Smooth Criminal, which is absolutely fantastic with its dance sequences, etc. But then one of the children is kidnapped by Mr. Big, and Michael will save her before he gets a drug addict. /> During the film, we see special effects not only amazing in those days, but also impressive today. For example, see Michael referring to a robot / spacecraft to protect his friends! It's so cool! <br /> <br /> The film ends with the show Come Together (later published in the double album by HIStory Michaels), and you leave the movie with a magical feeling. Incredible! <br /> <br /> I recommend this for every family who wants to spend a nice evening with candy and popcorn in front of the TV. And now some parents can get up and say, "But Michael Jackson is the child's perpetrator!" Yes, he is, but let's go, we all know it's not true! Wait and see ...
