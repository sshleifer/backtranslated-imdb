This film is a semi-documentary ... and it's pretty interesting .... <br /> <br /> It's a good movie ... based on a true story about how several Norwegian sabotages managed to stop the production of heavy water in Rukjan in Norway and the release of the rest of the heavy water to Germany. <br /> <br /> This movie is not perfect and could have been a bit better ... the best part of the movie is that some saboteurs play alone !!! <br /> <br /> If you are interested in the history of World War II and the movie, this is a movie worth watching !!
