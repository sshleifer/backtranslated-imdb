I voted 8 for this movie because of minor childish defects. Besides, this movie is one of my favorites! It's funny, at least. Scenes of filming are, however, ridiculous and I think that Gackt (who wrote the book) takes a bit too much of the "obsession with the matrix". It looks like their enemies are just standing there ... waiting for a shot. However, this film is touching and always makes me cry. He has a lot of GREAT humor in it, so I'm also laughing. Gackt is a great actor, I have to say ... it shows so much emotion. It was Hyde's first performance and everything was fine. The role suits him. Wang Lee Hom is absolutely great. The whole cast is what I would say, perfect for this movie. DO NOT MISS OUT! You regret it!
