This is an excellent movie and it is a treasure that can be caught only in sporadic film shows, because it is not available on video / DVD. The way the movie starts with the arrival of two lovers and ends with their departure (although in the meantime quite a lot happens, and they do not stay in one place), it gives a feeling of being closed and feeling that everything is fine with the world. If you have the chance to see this movie, do it. I can not wait to see it again and I wish it could be launched.
