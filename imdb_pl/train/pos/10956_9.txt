For those who think that it is only nocturnal humor and immaturity, you are in fact mindless. While the program contains part of the night jokes, it also contains a lot of satirical materials and makes you happy with social problems, racial barriers, stereotypes, stereotypes, etc. You just have to read some of its materials a bit to get them. <br /> <br /> I also love the fact that not everything is a punch line. For those who expect a joke like Friends (I LOVE friends fyi), you will not find it here. Instead, Sarah uses situations and other ways to achieve humor that is more realistic. We do not go around this world and we have no witty words for everything that has been said in most comedies. Instead, the Sarah Silverman program makes it more realistic in this sense. <br /> <br /> So do not take this for a mindless humor, because it is so much more.
