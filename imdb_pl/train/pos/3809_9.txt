Have you heard the story of the reluctant heroes who were hired by the king to kill the dragon? Oh, do you have? Was it set in a world entirely composed of small islands hovering above the clouds, and did the heroes have to perform dangerous jumps from one island to another during their journey? Has the water flowed up and the remains of big cities are levitating on the horizon? I did not think so. <br /> <br /> I came across this movie by accident and I'm really happy that I did it! This is one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. Like in Pixar movies, it is animated computer art that can only be possible in today's world. Animators have invested in almost everything that appears on the screen, and this attention to detail is stunning (a scene in which mushrooms in the foreground emit green smoke, while the figures walk unconsciously in the background is one of my favorites). The monsters are also fully realized and wonderfully watched in action. <br /> <br /> Although the plot may not be completely unique, the movie has enough charm to make sure you watch it. Our heroes are friendly and interesting, providing the audience with their almost impossible task to reach the end of the world and destroy the dragon who would otherwise devour everything in its path. Of course, Hector is the most well-known figure. A small blue creature with a crazy smile and a tendency to speak a mixture of nonsense and English, Hector provides a comedy relief in a way that Jar Jar Binks could only dream of. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I recommend watching Dragon Hunters if you have the opportunity. Watch amazing animation, breathtaking scenes of battles and insight into a world that does not look like anything you've seen on a movie or TV screen. At least it's a great way to spend an hour and a half - regardless of whether you're nine or twenty-nine (and I'm really)!
