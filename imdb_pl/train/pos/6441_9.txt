Just like in heaven {SPOILER WARNING) <br /> <br /> It was a great human drama that stimulated my emotions and my imagination. <br /> <br /> This is a parable that returns to the life and death of Christ. Daniel is an outstanding talented musician who is physically and mentally exhausted by his career and has to give it up. When he joins the church choir as a cantor, he transforms the lives of choristers, just as Jesus did in the first century Palestine society. They laugh, start to speak openly and sincerely to each other, their faults are revealed, they accept each other, they love each other, they become an important community. There is a mentally disabled young man among them (? Tore), this is their inclusiveness. <br /> <br /> Pastor, Stig enjoyed authority by imposing strangling morality on the congregation, which is gradually rejected by the choristers. When Stig dismisses Daniel, a rebellion occurs and Stig is crushed. Stig represents the Jewish authorities in the time of Jesus, whose insistence on obedience to Jewish law was a clear contrast to the new life with the "golden rule" brought by Jesus. <br /> <br /> In one dramatic scene, someone declares: "The Church has invented sin." There is a contrast between moral and living life throughout the film (being). <br /> <br /> According to the story of Christ, Daniel is killed by Conny when he beats him, leaving him to drown in the river. The next scene, we can not believe it, when the body of Daniel (resurrected!) Is dragged into his room (grave) into a white sheet (shroud!), By three women (three women watched at the foot of the cross) in the gospel). <br /> <br /> Daniel is very close to Lena, a beautiful, beautiful young woman who was betrayed by a man she loved and who is now dissolute (Jesus established a close relationship with Maria Magdalena - Lena - who was probably a high class courtesan / prostitute). Through Lena, Daniel learns to love, something he longed for, and now he finds fulfillment. <br /> <br /> Solo sung by Gabriella, composed by Daniel, consists of a full life, in contrast to the moral correctness that leads to anxiety about sin and what is good and what is bad. <br /> <br /> The final scene shows that the choir singing / humming in harmony, like a mantra, attracts a wide audience, illustrating the harmony and interconnectedness that is our true human destiny.
