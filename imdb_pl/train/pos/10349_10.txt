This is one of those movies that made me feel strongly in need of making movies. In general, I'm a fan of movies based on decent real stories. And this one is GREAT! In addition to Meryl's performance, which has gained recognition and praise, the greatest asset of the film is the story on which it is based. An engaging story about a couple who suffers from social and legal torture, after undergoing enormous emotional pain in connection with the unexpected and brutal death of her young child, is really a fairy tale opening eyes that reveals the inhuman side of other people and reveals a very sophisticated barbarism and consistent with the law of society. It is interesting how people who consider themselves kind and intelligent (for example, the emotional ladies of the jury in the film) are in fact nothing more than selfish assholes who, for dogmatic beliefs and prejudices, will shut down the brain for all contemplation and contemplation even in the light of all facts indicating very clearly their opinions. The second face of the so-called "civilized" society, which the film reveals, is the apathy of other people's pain (needless to say that it is very general, even if this specific story takes place in Australia) that goes so far as true cruelty. He has to check if you're willing to take something serious and maybe thinking.
