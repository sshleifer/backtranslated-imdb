This is. In fact, it's somewhere in my 20 best films of all time. I think number 15. In any case, I'm usually not one of the plots, but I think that the plot works better in anime and RPG games (for example, Final Fantasy 7), not in movies. But this one has everything. Live drawings of planets, stars, an extremely well written script. Although it is not really for children, they can still be seen, they do not contain graphic blood, guts and silicone. But I do not think they understand that.
