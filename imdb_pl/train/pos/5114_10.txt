While Urban Cowboy did not release the same testosterone found on the rodeo, he provided an accurate picture of that day and age in urban Texas. I also think that to really criticize this film, one would have to live in the right time and place where he was created. There was good music, cool times and, yes, a few "rough and fallen" in expensive homes honky tonk. The relationship Bud and Sissy, like "two ships passing at night", was well thought out. When Pam torn up the note Sissy wrote to Bud, she repeated the tragedy of many real life affairs. The whole story was well thought out. I thought the cast and crew did a great job. I thought the game on the screen was well written and directed. Scott Glenn should have received an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.
