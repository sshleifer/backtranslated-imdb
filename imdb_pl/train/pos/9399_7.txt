This is the movie I saw for the first time and which I saw several times over the years. It's always nice. <br /> <br /> One thing is that comedy does not take sides: it evenly distorts workers and capitalists. Only Sid seems out of the classic fight, despite being responsible for it. <br /> <br /> Spoiler warning: do not read on, if you have not seen the movie <br /> <br /> This is a fantasy, although presented fairly reliably. Ask yourself: could anyone support most of your weight in one fabric weave? He would break almost any support. <br /> <br /> Also Sid, trapped in the alley, uses garbage that coincides like a knight's shield. Sweet symbolism. <br /> <br /> One day I will get it on DVD.
