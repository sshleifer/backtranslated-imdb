The long-non-existent prison, closed for over 20 years, is reopened, and Ethan Sharpe (the late actor of the great figure Lane Smith), when the guard is there, is placed as a guard. When the prisoners are forced to repair the place, they were ordered to break into the old execution room. This releases a fierce spirit that sows the ruthless devastation of both guards and prisoners; Burke (Viggo Mortensen, showing the true balance in his early role) is embodied as the hero. <br /> <br /> I know it makes no sense praising the film for its atmosphere (it was filmed in an abandoned prison in Rawlins, Wyoming), but it is raising this horror to a higher level. He has a great feeling, set at the very beginning. Director Renny Harlin made a fourth directing effort here; he got the "Nightmare on Elm Street 4" concert from him and successfully began an impressive career in major action movies, thrills and horror films. <br /> <br /> It may have characters from the magazine, but it has a strong cast reviving them: Chelsea Field as a young woman struggling for prison reform, Lincoln Kilpatrick as a tired veteran Cresus, Tom Everett as anxious Rabbitt, Ivan Kane as outgoing Lasagna , Tommy "Tiny" Lister as Tina's soft speaker, and Arlen Dean Snyder as Captain Horton. It is also worth mentioning the early recognition of Kane Hodder (as a vengeful ghost), who helped him * to land at the concert of Jason Voorhees in the series "Friday the 13th". <br /> <br /> Decent special effects, mood lighting thanks to courtesy of Mac Ahlberg's cinematographer, terrifying music by Richard Banda and Christopher Stone, great visuals, incredibly dark location and a brilliant and intense presentation that makes it quite fun . It's horrible, gruesome and good fun for horror fans. <br /> <br /> 8/10
