I read a few mixed reviews, and a few of them even demolished the movie. I became interested in this project because it was directed by Tony Scott and I became very interested in his work after Man On Fire had such a huge impact on me. Before I start my review, let me say it first ... it's great to see that this movie could be told in a boring and ordinary way, but writers and Scott have chosen a different approach. <br /> <br /> Plot: <br /> <br /> Put simply, it's not boring. Most Hollywood movies give you "tried and true" threads that they know will connect with people, often providing recipients with film acceptance and increasing the likelihood of profit. This plot was one of the most interesting ones I've seen for some time. For comparison, recently I watched "The Weather Man" and "Lord of War" and although I say that these films are perfect, and I liked them both, both threads in these films are boring and told exactly how this could be done expect. They do not risk in any way and are extremely predictable after watching a large number of American films. The story of Domino is both interesting and told in a way that makes you think, "Oh, man, they are now screwed up." And I feel that many of the latest movies are missing. In my opinion, it has a lot of depth and gives me a lot of questions to watch. In general, I was so interested in the film. <br /> <br /> Characters: <br /> <br /> I felt that the characters are accurate. Knightley did a wonderful job of presenting a beautiful woman who was not inside and wanted to be seen as she was. It was obvious that she wanted to prove herself and took everything she had to achieve. <br /> <br /> Choco was also very credible, he used Spanish in inappropriate situations, his reactions to the lack of Domino feeling, as well as his jealousy in the team ... they all called me, which made me feel that his character was much more realistic. <br /> <br /> Rourke's character was the least interesting to me, but he still called me. He looked like an ordinary guy trying to make ends meet. I hope that it was the filmmakers who tried to achieve it because I just came out of it. He did a very good job showing Ed in an average Joe who made mistakes but still tries to live. <br /> <br /> Claremont / Ladies: I believe that they have provided a much-needed heart for history. They were not just people who got the money to buy Bentley, they were real people who had a real problem and were looking for others to achieve this goal. You can empathize with them, because for them this child's illness was not a different solution. These figures were supposed to show real people who are less fortunate who fell into this mess because they needed help. <br /> <br /> Gangsters: They made the story look sinister in a way that only crowd can do. And I really liked this part. They also told the story with small complexities that made the story much more interesting. <br /> <br /> Christopher Walken / 90210 guys: <br /> <br /> They provided a comical relief in a very serious film. From the uncomfortable statements of Walken to constant references to 90,210 guys who are be-beens. Their involvement in the movie only made it much more pleasant. <br /> <br /> Cinematography .... yes .... cinematography. This is where the movie lost many potential fans. But in my opinion I thought it was a genius, in my opinion the use of the camera to translate the mood of the current situation was extremely effective. I thought it was a method that was actually implemented, but I could always use improvements just like everything else. Well done and congratulations to Scott, the editor, the author of the photos and the director of photography, taking real chances with this film. Not only did they go far, they went much further. The use of colors, both extremely light and extremely dark, provided the "look" of a film with an ominous and dirty appearance that accurately represents the life of the crowd, bounty hunters and less fortunate in a way that shows that their lives are not like peach or " clean "like everyone else. If you notice, in times of less stress or conflict, there were very few camera tricks, if at all. This shows that Scott and his team tried to achieve something with this look and did not just do it the hell. I realize that most of the people who watched this movie did not expect it, and that means many of them were excluded in this movie, but I think it was great that Scott took this approach. Hollywood movies have become predictable and bland. Most of them are shot in the same way with the same twists and turns. And I'm glad Scott tried to create something else. <br /> <br /> It is true that this film is not for everyone, but the statement that it is rubbish and has nothing to offer, does not make sense. I really enjoyed this movie and I'm happy that I spent my money on it. I recommend it to everyone, but I'm sure it will hit only a few. I have to agree with the earlier poster when he said that many of those who do not want to see themselves outside the "MTV sphere" will not appreciate this movie, but I think many people will do it. We should all be happy that Scott and what. I took a chance and tried to provide something different and special. With that in mind, I think he has succeeded enormously.
