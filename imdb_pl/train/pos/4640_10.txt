This is one of the best films I've seen in the last two years (I saw the premiere in Tel Aviv in Israel in the summer of 2006, Exactly when the last war began ...) This problem in communication between people who cause wars are interested I have long since and it does not matter who - boys and girls, hetero and gays, Jews and Arabs ... I've seen the Bubble three times, and it's still surprising and exciting - every character reminds me of one of the many people I know, and the difference between them, like between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem ... The last time I saw it - with my friend who is a Christian Arab and it was on Israel's independence day (the most symbolic I could have been! How ironic) and ... in the end he cried !!! - if he was touched and he was not embarrassed - everyone would be touched by the Bubble!
