In 1955, five years after the release of the film, James Stewart and Anthony Mann together produced six more films, four of which are westerns. Their relationship was obvious from the very beginning, and what was intended as something more than a universal programmer became both a cult and a classic. Buffs from this period will be incensed by the fact that the first ten names on loans were more than well-known - not counting Ray Teal or "Anthony" Curtis, later Tony. Perhaps ten years later, the "psychological" western was firmly rooted, but in 1950 it was rare to throw Ahab in a mix with Cain and Abel, not to mention a few other issues, and still provided a conventional western surface and full recognition to all concerned. One to be added to the DVD collection.
