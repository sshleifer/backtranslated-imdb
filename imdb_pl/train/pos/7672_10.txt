I must admit that Holly was not on my watch list at the Edinburgh film festival. However, after the artistic director of the festival specially recommended this film to the audience of over 200 people before the screening of the next film, I decided to watch it. Wow! <br /> <br /> This movie deals with the very difficult issue of child prostitution and does so without compromise. I found myself crying many times during the movie and laughing at others. Speaking of the emotional roller coaster. <br /> <br /> The main actor (Thuy Nguyen) is a Vietnamese debutant (he was only 14 years old at the time of filming) and he had to face this extremely complex and difficult role. It reminded me of Keisha Castle-Hughes from Whale Rider, but the role here is much more demanding because she has to play the child prostitute. There is a chance that he will win many awards. <br /> <br /> The main story is about a girl who was sold to prostitution by her family and kept as a sex slave in a brothel in Cambodia. He meets an American (played by Ron Livingston in a strong drama role that we are not used to), who, after spending time with her, decides to help her. At the time, however, it is sold again and is looking for it in Cambodia. History revolves, and the public is never able to predict what will happen next. <br /> <br /> The actress was strong all over the world thanks to a very interesting international cast. Udo Kier (very convincing as a sex visitor), Virgine Ledoyen (touching as a social worker) and Chris Penn (one of his last films). The Asian cast was also excellent. <br /> <br /> Although the film deals with this difficult subject, it focuses successfully on telling an interesting, powerful story. It was filmed in Cambodia (some scenes in real public homes), which contributes to the feeling that you almost watch a documentary. It looks like DP has used a lot of hand-held camera and close-ups and generally made you feel like you're in history. <br /> <br /> After the screening, I listened to the other members of the audience when they were leaving, and it seemed that everyone was stunned. This is not an easy movie to watch and greet the filmmakers for not creating the Hollywood Film. <br /> <br /> This is by far the best movie I've seen at the Edinburgh film festival. Opinion shared by my husband and a few other friends.
