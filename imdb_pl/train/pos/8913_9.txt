This is my favorite classic. The film was made west of Philadelphia, at the age of 13, in 1957, and released next year. Then in 1970 I found myself in the same county as the PA novice. I've always liked to visit different places where scenes were shot. I knew the owner of Downingtown Diner well and he had a road sign in front that told all passing drivers that it was a "house of the bluff". The theater scene was held in Phoenixville, near Valley Forge Park and still shows movies!
