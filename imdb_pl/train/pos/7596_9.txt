The first episode gave a good impression of what you can expect from the series! Secrets waiting for a solution and a lot of good drama! I love the fact that they gradually reveal stories about the heroes! Explanation enough to be excited! Of course, this program has some drawbacks! In the first two series are characters that for some reason do not appear in the third season! Many characters have a decent sent, but some of them just are not there! Like Rose and her husband! Where the hell are they? What happened to them? Maybe they will come back in later episodes! But it's a bit inconsistent! By saying "lost" it manages to be an exciting episode (especially in the first two seasons)! This is a very difficult thing! I noticed that in the third season we focus more on character development than on the mysterious aspects of the series! This is not a bad thing! It even saves some episodes from boredom! One of the elements that can be considered the strength of this show are great characters! You will love these characters! Good or bad! But in the end I will want to see some secrets to solve and close! The danger of canceling "Lost" due to a drop in ratings is close! And that would be devastating!
