Carol, a young girl in the center of the story, is transferred to a foreign country, Spain, at the height of the civil war in the late 1930s. Everything is new to this girl, in strangeness. War and her father are her constant worries, while she must immerse herself in a provincial culture that is years behind what she has in New York. <br /> <br /> Imanol Uribe directs this movie by numbers. The Carol family is, of course, divided, while mother Carol is the wife of someone who is a pilot of the air force with a leftist faction, the rest of the family's sympathy concerns Franco and the fascists who won the conflict. <br /> <br /> History adds nothing to what has already been said, much better, but it's an easy movie to watch. A splendid landscape of northern Spain has been shown. Do not expect too many actions, because most of the events are happening around Carol and the young guys with whom he befriends. <br /> <br /> Clara Lago plays Carol with sincerity and innocence. Maria Barranco is the mother of Carol, Aurora, who went to America. Rosa Maria Sarda is Maruja, a teacher who befriends Carol. Carmelo Gomez, plays Alfonso, the man Aurora left after leaving for America. This actor, who usually has major roles in most Spanish films, has nothing to do, because it remains a puzzle throughout the film.
