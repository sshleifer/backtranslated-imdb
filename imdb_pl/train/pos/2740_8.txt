The huge black and white night-time cinematography and its many highlights this supposedly real relationship with the 1950s murder in Kansas, where the whole family was erased by two men. was written by Truman Capote, so at the end of the movie you get a very liberal statement against the death penalty, which is ridiculous, knowing the facts of the case. Robert Blake and Scott Wilson play two atheist losers who have twisted views of life and who unnecessarily murder this nice family. <br /> <br /> Despite the annoying slope at the end, this is a fascinating story from the very beginning, and the photos make it even more fascinating. The famous photographer Conrad Hall did a fantastic job. I would like more contemporary films to be made in black and white. See it on DVD. <br /> <br /> Blake, Wilson, John Forsythe, Jeff Corey and the entire cast are great here. My third review of this film took place at the beginning of April 2005, shortly after Blake was found innocent in his murder trial in real life. After that, it's impossible not to look at Blake and the film differently.
