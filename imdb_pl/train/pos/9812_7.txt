"Big farewell" introduces us to the first adventure with the holodek, in this case Captain Picard posing as a private detective Dixon Hill. This episode creates a certain type of standard pattern, repeated several times in TNG, as well as in DS 9 and Voyager. After entering the holodeck, something goes wrong and the characters have to deal with the program in different circumstances than the game (represented by the failure of the holodeck security program). <br /> <br /> This concept is used to extend the Star Trek's capabilities and to include the genre mix type. Picard's stories about Dixon Hill are examples of a 1940's crime story, and their representation on the screen is called Film Noir, often with a stereotypical anti-hero (see, for example, Marlowe Chandler's stories or the classic Polanski Chinatown all the time). Star Trek never focuses on history (it's mainly a simple "how to do it" scenario), but it allows actors to take a different approach to their characters. These "Holodeck" games are widely used for recreation and reflect the private interests of crew members. Therefore, the technical aspect is always neglected, and from this point of view the stories are never sound (but has Star Trek ever had a technical, scientific point of view, that is, beyond certain utopian concepts?). <br /> <br /> "Big farewell" shows relaxed Patrick Stewart, McFadden, who almost never looked better in the episode of Star Trek (at least in the beginning), and Data also has some great scenes (although it's hard for me to believe that pulling plug lamp from the wall would really surprise him because he did research in this period and his habits). Wesley continues to transform the peaceful Trekkies into potential murderers (why did not they take him to holodeck and not let the gangsters finish him off?), But in all this is fun ...
