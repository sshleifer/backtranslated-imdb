This is one of the best movies I've seen for years! I'm not a fan of Gwyneth Paltrow, but she's great as Emma Woodhouse. Alan Cumming is great as Reverand Elton, and sister Emma Thompson, Sophie, is hysterical like Miss Bates. And check out the wonderful Jeremy Northam as Mr. Knightley; What a gentleman! Whoever said you needed sex and violence in the movie to make it look good had never seen Emma. I think it separates it from many others - it is class. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a movie that you can watch with the whole family or are looking for a romance for yourself, look no further. Emma is this movie. With beautiful scenery, great costumes and an outstanding cast (did I mention the wonderful Jeremy Northam?) Emma is perfect!
