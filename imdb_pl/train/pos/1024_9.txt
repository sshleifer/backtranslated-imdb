I was not always a fan, but the show grew up on me. It was only after season 5 that I began to see the richness of the show. In the end, they led Daniel Jackson to look for a wife and finally, most of him, ruling the System, were killed by competing Lords, SG-1 or others. <br /> <br /> Towards Season 5, the SG-1 Stargate Gate was getting stale. Along with the new writers and close attention of producer Peter Deleuise, the series became more and more solid. <br /> <br /> The characters have become out of date. Colonel Jack O'Neill was a stereotypical hero with emotional baggage. After his son Charlie died in a gunfight with O'Neill's gun, he decided to end his life by going to Abydos to face Go'ould RA. The character offers a small increase for every actor and actor whom Richard Dean Anderson decided to play straight, raising emotional barriers to protect himself. allowing only your close friends. <br /> <br /> Amanda Tapping joined the cast as Captain Samantha Carter. She was a feminist on the edge, ready to fight any man who doubted her ability to do work. Although this character had a small area to grow, Tapping did a great job focusing on Carter's strengths. She took some time to get a basic understanding of some of the things Carter says so she can intelligently introduce the character. <br /> <br /> Christopher Judge joined the cast by playing alien Teal'c. Teal'c was an alien called Jaffa. A baby of him (he may be a creature similar to a snake) will nest in Jaffa until he reaches the point where he will be put in a different form of life. Jaffa will die. Teal'c was the First Prime Minister of the Apophis army. Knowing that Apophis was not a god like him, he could pretend, he realized the genocide that their armies sowed in the galaxy. Finally, with enough, he and Jack O'Neill freed their team along with several innocent people. After arriving on Earth, he realized that Earth was the planet he was looking for and that would help him fight Go'ould. Christopher Judge did quite a lot with a limited character. Teal'c is a wise warrior whom many learned from his teacher, Master Bra'tac. The performance would not be complete without the Master Bra'tac played by Tony Amandola. He is also a rock. In the end, he became the adviser to the SG-1 majority, especially Daniel Jackson. <br /> <br /> Don S. Davil was there from the beginning playing general Major George Hammand. Davis did an amazing job with Hammond, making him nice and normal. He does his job, he has a wife, sons and daughters, and grandchildren. You can really say that it is the anchor of the base. I would just die for this man. If this is not allowed by his superiors, to provide soldiers support teams outside the world. He will go alone. He does not leave anyone behind. <br /> <br /> I saved dr. Daniel Jackson at the end, because this figure, I think, evolved the most in the ten or eleven years she was in. Choosing Shanks, I do not think the producer would know how strong Shanks are, and now, when people talk about Jackson, they do not talk about Spader, they talk about Shanks. In the early years, Jackson's character came out as a marauder. That's why I probably was not a fan. As the season progressed, the figure grew stronger. It gave him confidence. Finally, from season 10, Jackson's character matures to the point that he became a devoting hero. He continues to monitor the ethics of groups. He still keeps information that can move any mission forward. Acheaology, History, Culture and Exploration are part of its essence. He is determined. Although he is a man of peace, he has matured to the point that using his weapon may be the only way to resolve the dispute. <br /> <br /> Other characters include: Vala Mal Doran (Claudia Black) and Colonel Cameron Mitchell (Ben Browder), the new SG-1 leader. Both actors come from a show called Farscape and why they were put together, each guessing the body. I see a slight difference between Mitchell and Crichton (Farscape). Black's character is just outside the wall. She is definitely different from her soldier like the character Arin Soon.
