I am a nice old guy, old enough to remember the taste of Oreos and Coke, as it was 50-55 years ago, when every taste for the child was fresh. I would like to put somehow aside somehow, this is some magic suspended cupboard, so I could taste these things today. This magical cabinet could even customize the food fabric to explain how I drifted, physically and otherwise, the kind of dynamic chemistry of expectation. For more than half a century, they would have to adapt a little, because you see that I would know that I put them aside. Eating now would be celebrating yourself and the past, stories and meaning that almost made the upcoming years an expected reward. <br /> <br /> I did not have enough sense to do it with the original Coke. And I could not come up with one of those magical psychic cabinets? Not then. But I did something almost as good. In the seventies, I tuned in to Roman Polanski. Was he a strange and exotic pleasure? you know, films smuggled from the Soviet bloc. Movies so sensitive to beauty that you cry for weeks. The films that make you want to live with Polish women, first, and then decide that they will be the last to win them. <br /> <br /> Here's what I did. I took what I knew, it would be my favorite film by Polanski and put it aside. I did not watch it. I deferred until I thought I would be big enough to deserve it. For years I have tested myself, my ability to surround beauty and to designate it without taking over it. Probably there are few Poles who worked to earn it at Chopin. Working to deserve femininity when I see it. Trying to get the inside out of the edge. <br /> <br /> I have recently achieved a sort of assurance that the time has come to get it out. I already knew that the time had passed when it would work optimally, because I already saw and understood "9. gate. " <br /> <br /> If you do not know, it's about a man who innocently rents a room in which the previous tenant (which is called history) jumped out the window to die later after visiting this man (played by Polanski). What is happening is that time is turning and becoming this woman. We are deceived, believing that it is just crazy. But the way we follow him is not. He only has flashes that the world is normal, and the people around him are not part of the Sabbath distorting his reality. <br /> <br /> History does not matter. What counts is how Polanksi shapes this thing, both in the way in which the eye lives, which only creates the edges, and in the inhabitation of the body, which consists only of the mixed body. They never meet each other. There is a dissonance that can haunt me for the next 30 years. Is it an idea on and inside and outside without any edges? in general, except for the redhead wig. <br /> <br /> I do not know anyone else who could do it, this sketch that remains a sketch, that horror that remains natural. <br /> <br /> To understand the genius of this, you must know one of the greatest films in history; "Rear window." The genius of this film is the post-noir concept that the camera shapes the world; that the viewer creates a story. What Roman does is take this film to the other side. The "Back Window" was about watching the anchor on the screen (Jimmy Stewart), and everything else is fiction, woven the way we watched. Here a filmmaker resides on the screen. We know it. We know that everything we see is true because it is a narrator. We know that it is true that bodies change their identity, at this time they change, that causality is artistic. We know that the narrator will kill us. We know that the narrator will leave us in a constant horror, on the edge he assigns, but he never shows us and lets us imagine. <br /> <br /> Ted's rating - 4 out of 3: Anyone with kinomania should experience this.
