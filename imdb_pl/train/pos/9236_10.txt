Let's think about people, make a bad mouth for the original, because the time has come for the original Battlestar series to be a masterpiece, even with all the stars, plots and art. Lorne Greene was great because Adam and Richard Hatch were perfect, because Apollo and Dirk Benedict were as funny as Starbuck, but I dare say it's not as pretty as Katee as Starbuck. <br /> <br /> I loved the episode with Pegasus and Greetings from Earth was good John Calicos was great as Baltar, War of the Gods, the best was Experiment on Terra, I thought it was a tribute in a way that Heaven Can Wait, then you had Women from Battlestar, do not compare them to let's say Tricii, who is exceptionally beautiful as Number Six, but the beauty of Jane Seymour can not be compared to. Not to mention Loerrt Spang, because Cassiopea was fantastic. She had the beauty that the rainbow would be embarrassed. I loved the original as well as the new one. <br /> <br /> Can you imagine that John Calicos was number six? :) <br /> <br /> Thank you for listening.
