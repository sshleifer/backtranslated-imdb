A group of American students and their guardian decides to visit the ugliest part of Ireland to study ancient religious practices. Despite repeated warning about the dangers of perversion from the beaten path (by the local terrifying Irishman, natcha), they do it and end with their interiors on the outside courtesy of the family of inbred cannibals (descendants of the infamous clan Sawney Bean, who according to the stupid plot of the film raised the sticks from Scotland and settled on Emerald Isle. <br /> <br /> If you think porn stars and a low budget horror movie automatically equals the tons of nakedness and horrors acting, then again: Evil Breed is bristling with adult stars, but in fact, there is almost as much nudity as you would expect, considering "talent", and acting, though far from an Oscar, is not that bad at all (except for Ginger Lynn Allen, who we know he can do Wonderful "French", but the Irishman is poor. <br /> <br /> Bad breed opens in perfect m style with a brutal slaughter of several love campers: after a short sex under canvas, a silicone hottie is pulled out of the tent and torn in half; the guy has cut off his arms and legs and is roasted on the spit. It's a very bloody beginning and bodes well for the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, after this promising beginning, things begin to go seriously down: we meet the main characters, an annoying group of twenty-something just begging to become cannibals, and they lose a lot of time in the form of terrible false fears, many blarney on the subject of murderous druids from local Irish freak Gary (Simon Peacock), and the worst of all, a bit sub-Scream, postmodern conversation about horror conventions (how clever!). <br /> <br /> Then, just as it looks like the film will never be better, director Christian Viel decides to be serious: the guy gets a stabbed knife and there is a sex scene in the cabin with a charming blonde Gillian Leigh (NIE) a porn star, but I'm sure there's a career there if she wants it). After this event, things improve quickly as cannibals get into the meat-eating equipment, and the film transforms into a real bathhouse: Gary has a machete stuck in the ass (on time!) And is strangled by the intestines; Ginger Lynn kick-boxy mutant; Jenna Jameson is torn, gutted, and her silicone breast implant is being bitten by a confused cannibal; the guy is cut off by a cheese wire; and Taylor Hayes is seen as bloodied, bruised and naked with a dead fetus between her legs (apparently she was captured and used as a breeding herd). <br /> <br /> All this is so scandalously bloody that makes sitting less interesting things worth it and earns Evil Breed the final 7/10 rating. <br /> <br /> Note. Very difficult production and meddling in the studio meant that Christian Viel finally abandoned the project. The photo sessions were completed and the blood was cut tight for release in the USA. The good news is that although the movie does not go as well as it could be and is cursed with a horrible ending, it seems that the British DVD (the version I watched) remained relatively intact when it comes to splattering (only 13s out of the movie) .
