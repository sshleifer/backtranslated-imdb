"Ranma Â½" is my favorite anime Rumiko Takahashi. A woman really knows how to play a good story, which is not only a comedy, but also anime action. The main character of this story is Ranma Saotome, and a teenage teenager who is also an expert in martial arts Ranma is engaged to Akane because of the arrangement of both fathers who are great friends and train together for many years. <br /> <br /> Akane is younger and the most aggressive sister of Tendo: Kasumi is the oldest and is very sweet, and Nabiki is a means and loves to win money no matter what. <br /> <br /> Ranma and Akane fight all the time, especially because they both have a very bad temper, and when they discover that Ranma becomes a girl when she is sprayed with cold water, as well as his father becomes a panda, he starts there are many new characters and situations, they also reveal the cause of the transformation: during the fight Ranma and his father fell into a cursed river, but not only they had such a lot ... <br /> <br /> If you watched 'Ranma 1/2 '' and you liked it, I would recommend you '' Inuyasha '' and '' Maison Ikkoku '', two other good pieces at the hands of Rumiko.
