The peaceful rancher Robert Sterling loses the fight at a distance with his ruthless neighbors, until the notorious Outlaw Robert Preston appears off the beaten track to level the chances. Soon he begins to go too far, feeding a growing sense of anxiety in pounds sterling, especially when his son begins to adore a devious criminal. <br /> <br /> Sundowners is a tight, hard and surprisingly small picture with a perfect performance of Preston. Here he appears as a bad version of Shane, that is, until the true nature of the rancher and the outlaw's relationship are revealed. Most movie guides and video boxes spoil the surprise! <br /> <br /> The cast ends with Chill Wills, Jack Elam and John Drew Barrymore's debut, who became more known for his offspring than for acting.
