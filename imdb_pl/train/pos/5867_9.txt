Jacknife is a masterpiece of the 80s. It's a movie that breathes through an amazing acting game and a very interesting director's touch. At Jacknife, both European and American cinema enthusiasts can find something to relate to. The script is very attractive and full of beautiful characters. Ed Harris publishes one of the biggest performances on a regular basis. He plays the alcohol hero, making us feel his broken heart in every line, in every move. Robert De Niro makes us once again consider him one of the greatest actors of all time in one of the simplest, but also the most realistic performances in his career. Jacknife never gets bored, because it shows heroes without the typical typical elements of Hollywood. After the war, nobody is a hero. Everyone is a loser, and this movie is about this simple truth. Nobody can repair their songs after the war, just like the heroes of this movie. Jacknife deals with the diseases of the soul created by war. Just a great movie.
