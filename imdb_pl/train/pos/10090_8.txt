I was prepared for a turbulent talk from a soap opera, but I was happy to find a quick script, the main moral, excellent portraits of all actors, especially Peter Finch, amazing special effects, tension and beautiful pictures - there is even a shot of the majestic Buddha stone recently destroyed by the Taliban. Not to mention Elizabeth Taylor, who was the most beautiful and lovable before she gave in to the hysterics that frightened her later work. All supporting players end the game and I wonder who trained all these elephants. <br /> <br /> Speaking of the sequence of stone-Buddha, you can really see that it's Vivien Leigh in long shots. Its shape and the way it moves differs from Taylor's shape. The only thing that interferes with this sequence are poorly executed process shots, in which the background moves much too fast for horses on a walk. <br /> <br /> If you want to make a movie that's beautiful and never boring, spend a few hours with Elephant Walk.
