Rudyard Kipling once wrote that God gave all people the ability to love the whole world, but given that the human heart is very small, every person has a special place that he loves more than others. It seems to me that this could have been the motto of some of the most outstanding contemporary directors who decided to adhere to eternal love for this special place and to present situations in the lives of residents and guests. The result is a wonderful collection of short films, Paris je t'aime, in which our guides, Van Sant, Coixet, Cuaron, Payne and others take us on a breathtaking walk around the Paris districts, human feelings, longings and expectations. /> <br /> Always a different quarter, always a moving story about ordinary people looking for love, whether in a parking lot, an art studio, or a metro station. And Paris je t'aime tells of a huge range of love - love for a partner, child, parent, those who have meant the world but no longer has it, a love that needs anew, a happy love for this stranger, when yours eyes meet, or love, which simply is not supposed to be ... today, but tomorrow - who knows? <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, this movie is not only about love, but about life itself, joy, pain, loneliness, confusion, daily ups and downs. And the most important feature is that it is not soppy at all, but rather warm and full of hope. <br /> <br /> I give this film 9, because its last part suggests how some stories can continue to develop, but not all, and that's what's missing, and by "further development" I do not mean a specific reference to the future of the heroes. As for everything else, I can only say - captivating. It makes you want to leave everything behind you, escape to Paris and live with these little romances.
