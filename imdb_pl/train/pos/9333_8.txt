Living in Ontario all my life, in the same city where Marlene Moore grew up, I heard stories about her from my parents, grandparents and family members. When I found out that they were filming a film about her and that the beginning would be shot on my street, and her house would be close to mine, I was excited. <br /> <br /> If you're reading the book Rock and Bye Baby, about Marlene Moore, who has a completely different picture of her, she was found uncomfortably beautiful by people who really had the chance to get to know her, except for her own family who she often abused her as a child, with the exception of one of her brothers. In addition, if you live in my area and are intelligent enough to listen to people around you who knew her from school, you will learn that she was really hurt before she even set foot in the institution, she was always defensive and what seemed like a reluctance to learn in the school environment, it was embarrassing that she could not. <br /> <br /> Marlena did not deserve the life she received, with the lack of help she desperately needed. It was the government and the people around her who helped her death, not trying to understand her needs and why she did what she did. I still feel angry that she was put in prison for self-defense from a man who tried to rape her. As her brother once said: "They did not know what to do with her, so they locked her and it killed her." I believe it with all my heart. <br /> <br /> Rest in Marleno's room, you deserve it so much.
