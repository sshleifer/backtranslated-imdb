The "Kr√≥l Lew" series is an easy achievement in the Disney animation. The original Lion King is the greatest masterpiece in the goal animation. Lion King II: Simba's Pride to BY FAR the best continuation to the movie that Disney or other studio created for the animated film. He deserved a cinematic edition. The same can be said about this film. He has an original cast, Elton John's songs, a funny story, an exciting action and moving moments of the character. Everything you expect from this series. Not so much a new history as supplementing and expanding knowledge about Timon and Pumba and their place in this story. What impressed me the most was the care for animation. Often for Disney movies on the quality of video and television animation. But here they seamlessly combine the new animation with the material from the original movie. Scenes never seem out of place. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella are in full swing as Timon and Pumbaa. Matthew Broderick, Robert Guillame and Moira Kelly are again playing the roles of Simba, Rafiki and Nali respectively. We even visit Whoopi Goldberg and Cheech Marin as hyenas. There are many great laughs in this film. So if you love the Lion King, you need this movie. Without it, the story is not complete.
