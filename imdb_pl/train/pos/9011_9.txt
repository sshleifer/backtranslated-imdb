I found this movie quite by accident, but I'm glad I did it. Kenneth Branagh's performance approached the theft of the film from Helena Bonham Carter, but their strong chemistry together created a much more enjoyable movie. This film reminded of the excellent films Branagh did with Emma Thompson. Carter's star as a disabled young woman who wants to finish herself was just as good as I've seen it for a long time. Presenting a disabled person is difficult to bear, but in fact only her eyes show her pain in her life situation, making her so credible. If this movie appeared after the current wave of movies with beautiful women "disgusting" roles (Charlize Theron, Halle Berry), I was sure Carter would be very interested in Oscar. If you come across this movie on the cable late at night, just like me, trust me, it's worth losing your sleep.
