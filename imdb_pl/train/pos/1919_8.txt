I did not read the book that was based / inspired. This is part (the other are the film roles) last work of John Ritter (RIP), who hopes it is fun. And this is. Almost every time it is present. Most casts, both supportive and regular, enjoy themselves, and the material seems to be great. Game of Paul Hennessy, father of three teenagers: Rory, a typical guy of his age, Kerry, a depressive middle-aged child who fights for cause and consciousness, and Bridget, a fashion-loving, popular ditz. Sagal returns to being a woman in sit-com, and her character is far from Peggy Bundy. The performance changed a little after the departure of the Third Company and for a moment it seemed that they had not made a decision whether they wanted to laugh or be moving and respectful. You may wonder how and why it lasted so long after this: it can still be quite good, some add-ons were happy (if you like David Spade, most of it is that he's doing his schtick) and he had something to say. My personal favorite episode is last season. Humor is a nice mix of "stupid" jokes (mainly related to high school students), stupidity, dark comedy and raw material. This involved sex and other adult themes, but never in a graphic way. The language is gentle and sometimes moderately strong. I recommend it to every fan of those who created it. 8/10
