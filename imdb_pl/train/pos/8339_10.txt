I.Q., in my opinion, is a sweet, charming and funny romantic comedy about finding the right person for you. If you ask me, James (Stephen Fry) was a really dumb guy. For me, Ed (Tim Robbins) was more suited to Catherine (Meg Ryan) than James. In any case, everyone involved in this movie has done absolutely amazing work. In conclusion, I strongly recommend this sweet, charming and funny romantic comedy about finding the right person for any Tim Robbins or fan of Meg Ryan who has not seen it. You have a lot of laughter, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick it with a friend and watch it.
