Sopranos were probably the best show on the air of the 90s. It's sad that it's over, it was the best HBO concert, if not on TV, not everything was written for you all the time, you had to think, it was brilliant. the cast was excellent. Tony (James Gandolphini) is a great actor and plays his character well, just like everyone else. Each of the characters had defects that made them so real and allowed viewers to connect with them, and that's why it took so long. The last episode was good, I'm not sure how to take it, many different things can be interpreted by the final id, like thinking that Tony did not die, but the meadow came in and sat with them, and the darkness was just uncertainty. Tony will have to go to the hearing and deal with the fact that I hope he is not dead, I feel that way ... Long live Sopranos and Tony Soprano .......
