Personally, I think Sayonara was the biggest movie he ever did. He touched every emotion from anger to romance to end the tragedy. And Brando should win for the best actor. In any case, the movie is amazing, the man is attractive to BOTH MEN and WOMEN, and now you have no reason not to watch it! Do it and fall in love.
