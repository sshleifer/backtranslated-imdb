This is one of the most popular movies. Parker Posey's character is oversized, and the librarian's motif will not be lost to anyone who has ever worked in the world of books and stacks. <br /> <br /> If you are a student of the library, RENT TO. Then buy a poster and hang it on the wall. The soundtrack is also worth recommending. I showed this film to more library friends than any other - everyone falls in love with it.
