Ian Kershaw distanced himself from this project because of inaccuracies about Hitler's life and yes, it is dramatized but necessary. Robert Carlyle plays Hitler in later years, during this documentary, which deals with Hitler from childhood until he became the Chancellor of Germany, including the Long Knife Night. This TV movie (also a two-part mini series) shows how a number of factors allowed Hitler to come to power, such as a financial catastrophe of 1930. <br /> <br /> The cycle tracks Hitler and little more, except for the life of Fritz Gerlich and Ernst Hanfstaengl . Overall, valuable and full of interesting actors, but I feel that he should have been more focused due to stronger photos; the majority of actors are portrayed in half-body shots, which (for me) create a theatrical and not a cinematic scene. The pace is sometimes drowsy, and the movie suffers from it, lasting about 2.5 hours.
