"Telefilms" tend to fall into the trap of a low budget and a hurried schedule of photos, which is why this movie always has a tendency to undermine the trend. <br /> <br /> George C. Scott epitomizes Ebenezer Scrooge perfectly, fully with all his cold tendencies and still makes him a nice character. The production value of this film was exceptional, never relying on the effects of special boffo or sound stage settings, but based on the depth and transparency of photos on the spot and strong backgrounds. A movie that certainly stands alone.
