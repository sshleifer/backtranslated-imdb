A real healthy American story about teenagers who are interested in launching their own rocket in a rural hard coal mining town in West Virginia after the launch of Sputnik in 1957. <br /> <br /> Through the process, torments and perseverance above faith, they are finally able to achieve their goals. <br /> <br /> Jake Gyllenhaal, as the leader of the group, is excellent in the title role. Laura Linney, a motivating teacher, is pretty good, but her southern accent is on top. <br /> <br /> There is an excellent performance supporting Chris Cooper, a miner who wants his son to follow his footsteps, but gradually appears at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie so unusual in our time is that there are no scenes to jump from the bed and no profanity. It is the epitome of American history that is well done. <br /> <br /> In addition to the point of view of science, we have misunderstandings between father and son, football scholarships as a way to escape from coal mining and a loving family spirit. <br /> <br /> Why are these photos not recognized more often in the reward times?
