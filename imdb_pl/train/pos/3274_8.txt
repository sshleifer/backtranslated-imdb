This is one of the three films of the 80s, which I think that at that time were unfortunately overlooked and unfortunately still overlooked. One of the others was Clownhouse directed by Victor Salvy, the movie was terribly overlooked because of legal / sexual problems of Salvy. Another would be Cameron's wardrobe, which seems a bit unappreciated - not great, but not as bad as the reviews I've seen. Paper House is worth your time and I think it's one of those very quiet movies that just stuck in your brain for much longer than you think. I mean, 10 years after I saw him, I still pause him while something I could see six months ago went into the ether.
