Bacall is good here - especially considering that it's only her second movie. This is often overshadowed because it fits between two great successes: "Have and not have" (1944) and "Great Sleep" (1945), both of which connected her with Humphrey Bogart. It's true that it does not fit into other movies, but I think without her fault. It seems to me that some mistake was made in presenting her as a British lady from the top shelf. No accent. I think all the strange accents were distracting - Boyer was definitely not a Spaniard. It was difficult to maintain the simplicity of which country they came from. <br /> <br /> I really liked black and white cinematography. The mood is accustomed to great impact - I especially liked the fog scene. Lighting also works well in intrigue and tension. <br /> <br /> Bacall is simply great. Boyer just does not fit the romantic role of the lead for me - so he and Bacall were a little strange together. Not great chemistry - certainly not the magic of God and Bacalla. But I still liked the photo. There is high voltage and it moves well enough. I must say that the murder of a small girl turned out to be quite bold during this period. <br /> <br /> Katina Paxinou and Peter Lorre stand out as support. Paxinou as a hotel babysitter is absolutely nefarious and evil in her image. Her one scene, in which he laughs maniacally, as Mr. Muckerji leaves after revealing her as a child's murderer, is quite disturbing. Lorre is doing quite well in his slimy, serpent Conter portrait - a poor coward to the end. Wanda Bendrix is ​​also good at presenting Else's child - especially considering that it was her first photo and was just 16 years old (though she seems much younger). It turns out that she later married Auie Murphy, who turned out to be a short-lived, turbulent marriage.
