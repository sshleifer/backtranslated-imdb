Until I saw this special in HBO, I never heard about Eddie Izzard. I'm glad I have it now! He is one of the funniest comedians I have ever seen! Rare comedian is immersed so completely in his craft than Eddie. I could not stop laughing throughout the performance. If you like to laugh, you MUST see this unique!
