It's an excellent movie for women-bodybuilders and action fans! I think that Sue Price did a great job in this film series (Nemesis 2,3,4) and turned out to be a great fighter. It has a very impressive appearance and the will to iron to resist the powerful Nebula (Nemesis 2). Although it is not a film of great value and Sue Price's acting skills, which were not the best in my life, the film itself was something amazing, an invaluable jewel for fans of the female bodybuilders' action! Well, some parts of Nemesis 2 were copied by other well-known sci-fi movies like Terminator or Predator, but that's not the point. The point is that A.Puyn in this film cast a very talented bodybuilder who devoted all his energy and talent to the body to show us what he can do. I really liked this movie and watched with the same enthusiasm Nemesis 3 (rather boring sequel) and Nemesis 4 (much more interesting sequel than 3). It is a pity that he has not shown on DVD yet :-(
