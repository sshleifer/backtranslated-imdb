This is one of my favorite comedies in history. Not wanting to tolerate the hero's uninspired lifestyle, but taking what's worth it and not trivializing alcoholism is just great fun. He talks about the unbelievable story of an eternally drunk, irresponsible 40 cavalier named Arthur who is to inherit a huge fortune, but only if he marries Susan, the chosen one, because the family thinks he can do something about it. Arthur suggests, but then unwisely falls on Linda, the waitress and petty thief. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore is perfect as Arthur, the most endearing drunk, whose pranks are laughter for a minute. Yes, Moore IS Arthur, and I agree with those who can not imagine any other actor in this role. Ladies from this song are also well portrayed. Liza Minnelli shines like Linda, and her chemistry on the screen with Moore is great. Jill Clayburgh plays Susan, a wealthy and more appropriate woman chosen for Arthur. <br /> <br /> However, this movie is literally created by Sir John Gielguda, who presents the sarcastic, but moral butler Arthur, Hobson. It is obvious that these two had a great mutual feeling during Hobobon's long-term employment. Hobson is the best friend and supplier of uninvited comments and advice from Arthur. The most interesting relationship in this film is not Arthur's romance at all, but his unusual relationship with this witty and of course the relentless servant. You remember this butler long after you have given the end points.
