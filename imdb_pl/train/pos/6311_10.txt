This movie is very funny and has a great compilation of actors like William H. Macy, who always played such roles, perhaps his most representative, Fargo; and George Clooney, who is a very good actor showing his comedy work in the Cohen brothers movie "Oh brother, where are you?" which is one of my favorite films ever! But it was difficult to find "Welcome to Collinwood" here in Mexico. My city has no good places where you can buy good movies. I tried to buy it in Blockbuster, but they do not know it under the original name, so maybe it will be easier to find if I have the name they gave him in Mexico, does anyone know? Because I can remember! Your health. BEHIND.
