This is one of the best comedies in history! Writing this parody of soap is brilliant and cast, just look at the names of the cast and you will understand why it is so great. If you're a fan of Kevin Kline, he (as always) makes a fantastic performance, and Robert Downey Jr. is perfect. If you do not laugh while watching this movie, you have no sense of humor.
