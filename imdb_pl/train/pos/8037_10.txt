"One shot, one killing, no exceptions." You need to check if you're in marines or snipers. two big thumbs! Great overall story, great camera work, good drama, action, details and more. Quite close to the real one. But this is not a movie to break up and choose editing errors. it is to sit down and have a good 99 minutes. The plot has a bit of depth, but this movie is not meant to make you think. it's about enjoying the lifestyle and acting of a sniper. Sniper 2 and 3 are pretty good, but the first is still the best overall movie. Tom Berenger does a great job of playing his character and showing the hidden side of the sniper's life. plain to deal with all death. Must see for sniper fans.
