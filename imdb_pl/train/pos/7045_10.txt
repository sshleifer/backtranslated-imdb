This movie definitely turns me on. These witty jokes and even sporadic stereotypical and insulting views of people from Eastern Europe have stuck to me for most of the film. His plot is clever and 100% original and will make you guess the entire movie. The only person who made the most impression on me was Hilary Duff. It is simple and obvious that she made a leap of faith by going beyond the "chick-flick" genre she was used to. Her accent is excellent, and her performance was surprisingly sharp and well made. This is the best performance I've ever seen from Hilary and I've seen most of her films. Her character, Yonica Babyyeah, is described as "The Britney Spears of Eastern Europe," which is evident in some of her manners and the song "I want to blow you up ... ... up." She is sorry for her too, because her performance really captures you, Yonica is a very complex and confused figure. Joan Cusack made me laugh all through the movie with her sometimes humor, but also with facial expressions and so on. John Cusack's witty dialogue will make you giggle all the time. I highly recommend this movie.
