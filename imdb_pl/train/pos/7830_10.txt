In "Die Nibelungen: Siegfried" Siegfried was betrayed. Now Kriemhild is looking for revenge. Marries Hagen, and through a series of events he finally engages in a very drastic (but tailored) action at the end. <br /> <br /> One of the things in today's movie is that we can look at some portraits. Attila the Hun (called Etzel in the film) is shown as a strange person from the east, probably an allusion to the Soviet Union. Of course, it is not Fritz Lang's fault that Hitler used "Nibelungenlied" for the German national pride in the Third Reich, but you can see what the FÃ¼hrer liked in this story. Nevertheless, it is an absolutely great movie.
