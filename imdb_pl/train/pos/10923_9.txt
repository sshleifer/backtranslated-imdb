This movie is really good. The story, which works like a puzzle, forces the viewer to think and guess what will happen next. Such a trick brings a lot of surprises and makes the viewer really waiting to solve the riddle. The battle scenes are very good. There are many different styles of fighting (although one of the styles was a bit unreal for me, but this is just my opinion) to watch and a fascinating show. The only thing that can be annoying is the appearance of the actors. A little too effeminate (at least for me). Hong Kong has always been good in kung fu movies, especially in the '70s and' 80s, so 'Five Venom' (or other versions) is a great choice.
