This movie is good for what it is and unpretentious; I would not, however, double-check him: I am the general partner of Peter Cushing and that's why I watched him. The best advantage of this movie is BREVITY and EFFECTIVENESS. Compared with other similar films, it does NOT go on forever, because each of the four (plus one) segments lasts less than 30 minutes, and the last below 10. Good vibrations are amazing. In the first segment, the writer of horrors suffering from the "writing block" moves to a secluded old house, seeking inspiration. He finds it too much when he begins to visualize one of his fictional madmen. Print a graph similar to PREMATURE BURIAL. Good use from the point of view of the point of view: does the writer become mentally ill ... or (like ending shows) his wife-trophy wants the lover to play with his husband's phobias to drive him mad and secure his goods. . Will an intriguing bimbo survive to enjoy the fruit of your genius plan? <br /> <br /> In the second segment, two long-lost friends meet in the same isolated old house, but they can not help visiting the bizarre horror museum with the wax statue of the long-forgotten love of their youth who once separated them. From the Gothic guardian of the museum, they learn that the portrayed woman is an ax murderer who has a dead ax ... was she? <br /> <br /> The third segment was less interesting to me. <br /> <br /> the fourth shows an actor of horrors - who thinks he is the best of deeply sunk low-budget films C. Looking for a costume that would authenticate his fictional vampire, he gets a real offer. In this segment, the reliability of the first two is also lacking. <br /> <br /> The operation is fair and the 2 initial segments are its main part. A good movie, made with a grain of salt. Not the best Cushing or Lee ... but it's worth watching.
