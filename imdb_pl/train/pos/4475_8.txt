The United States continued to fight the Second World War (the film was released between VE and VJ day). Any studio worth of salt or created war films in which intrepid American soldiers beat enemies, or generally Americans sang and danced. Technicolor Musicals were what America was developing in depressing days when everything was rationed. Most of the musicals of that day were just a collection of musical numbers combined with the best available story, which was filled to fill the time to the next music number! I have the impression that people who reviewed the film were born after 1970. Depressing, how quickly we forget. <br /> <br /> This movie may have been called "The Search for Jose Iturbi", but now everyone is wondering why. Let me explain. From 1929 - his arrival in America - until his death in 1980, Iturbi was one of the best pianists who awarded the concert stage. He agreed to do some movies in 1942, but Hollywood was behind him for almost a decade. Not only an outstanding pianist, but also a successful conductor, Iturbi has been a very popular word for over 40 years. <br /> <br /> The scene in which Iturbi and 17 other pianists play one of Liszt's Rhapsody was planned at the beginning - and did anyone ever notice that all other pianists were children? Joe Pasternak, who produced this film and many other MGM musicals, included Iturbi with America's interesting youth in classical music. Grayson wants to audition with Iturbi in the film, which was no different from real life at the time. Everyone wanted Iturbi then. The joke among the soldiers was that "GI" meant "Get Iturbi" (he gave a lot of concerts in military bases). <br /> <br /> Gene Kelly was a great dancer, and Frank Sinatra was a great singer, but at the time the movie was filmed, Sinatra was only 30 years old and she was contracted by Columbia Records for only four years. Kelly was already well known as a dancer, but Iturbi was a global sensation for over 20 years. <br /> <br /> And as for the lack of plot, the Americans did not need a plot. They were tired of war, they were ill for fear of their loved ones and they were worried about the future. They needed happiness and hope and the certainty that everything would go well in the end. They needed music, smiles, joy and romance. This movie and other similar films provided what was needed. <br /> <br /> Enough lectures. Apart from the mouse, the best scene in the movie occurs between Sinatra and Iturbi, and each of them "unconsciously" completes the music of the other. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in Jose Iturbi, a Spaniard who has conquered America more than De Soto, Cortez and De Leon put together, please visit my website www.joseiturbi.com, where you can find a storyline, fragments film reviews of the "day" and photos of this and some other MGM musicals from the 1940s, as well as the biography and discography of Iturbi. <br /> <br /> Trout
