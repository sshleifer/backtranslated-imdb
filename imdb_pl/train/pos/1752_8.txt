SPOILERS Sex what? This is one of the most basic parts of human life. However, are we taking it too seriously? People always want more, even those who receive them every day, and if you're unlucky, there are potential consequences of changing life (creation). Ironically, people say that we all begin to have sex at a younger and younger age (despite the fact that Victorians get married and have children at an early age), so it must be getting harder and harder for those who reach the point of view as virgins. In Steve Carell's first big screen, he plays a man who has reached 40 without managing it. Treating us to countless events and extreme events related to sex, not to mention vulgarisms rather than the episode "Eurotrash", the general plot of the film and its principle does not sound funny. It is a pleasant surprise that for all inappropriate, unsuccessful jokes, there is an unbelievably large number of those who end up in the brand and leave the audience in hysterics. <br /> <br /> Andy Stitzer (Carell) is a nice guy with a good job and pleasant temperament. At the same time, however, he treats life too seriously and after being invited to play poker as a fifth member, Andy's friends discover his secret. At the age of 40, Andy is still a virgin. Now, for many reasons, but above all, pity, three men (Paul Rudd, Seth Rogen and Romany Malco) offer advice to Andy with one goal. To throw him out of misery and get him. <br /> <br /> One of the few good things about Anchorman, it was only a matter of time before Steve Carell got the advantage of having. Impressive in "The 40 Year Old Virgin" does not disappoint. Showing a hopeless, shy virgin to perfection, Carell is a revelation as she gradually becomes more and more confident when the advice starts to help. <br /> <br /> Carell is not alone in his performance. Rudd, Rogen, Malco and Catherine Keener as love interest are wonderful. Rudd is a personal favorite, like the love of a sick David, who disintegrates many times and shares with Rogen the best scene, while both argue about homosexuality. <br /> <br /> The biggest surprise in this movie is not the way many jokes hit the nail on the head, but in reality it's a clever way of shifting the message on the head. Of course, designed for conservative America, the whole tone of the film evolves from a simple story of sexual conquest to safe sex and abstinence. The Virgin does not need sex to make his life complete, he needs only self-confidence and true love. A decent message to deliver and a significant improvement compared to what you expect at the beginning of the movie. <br /> <br /> It is strange to see a primitive comedy that is always fun and well-preserved, but low and here's "40 Year Old Virgin" is just that. Put in a message of good importance and you are well on your way to the highest-class comedy. Surprising joy.
