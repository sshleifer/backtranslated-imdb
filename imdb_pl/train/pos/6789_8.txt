Legend of Dragoon is one of those little-known games that people like or hate. Some say it is too similar to other games, namely the Final Fantasy series - which is understandable because it was originally intended to be the equivalent of Final Fantasy in Sony. Honestly, I can not comment on the similarities beyond that because I'm not too familiar with FF games. <br /> <br /> I think my favorite aspect of the game is the combat system. Not only do you have the ability to change into a more powerful dragon form, but each time you attack, you must pay attention to complete the attack by pressing the buttons at the right time. What's more, sometimes enemies will attack you in the middle of the sequence, which means you have to press different buttons to avoid being hurt. Even using certain objects to attack requires a little mashing. If you do not want to attack, you can always guard, which not only reduces the damage dealt in half, but also increases your health points without using healing potions. <br /> <br /> FMV are quite well done, with the same quality as Final Fantasy 8. However, graphics during the game are not fully compatible with this standard. They are nice, but they could be - and to be honest, they should be - better. The translation also leaves a lot to be desired. It not only raises interesting questions about the relationship between characters, but there are also some grammatical errors that simply should not be allowed. <br /> <br /> Another thing that I found interesting was that you lose the main characters on the part of one dies, and the other basically becomes useless to the team and goes away. While the death of one character often does not make sense, it makes you realize early on that the heroes, while the heroes, are just as mortal as the next person. People who replace lost characters simply gain all their stats, so the transition game is quite fluid. Perhaps my only complaint about heroes is the love interest of the main character, Shana. She is the epitome of a helpless woman who needs help, pathetic to the extent that she drives the player out of frustration. Although you can use it on your team, it is extremely weak - I do not even know what her dragon powers look like, because I did not like her so much that I never used her. Rose, on the contrary, is probably my favorite female character in any game. She is not a wimp, and some of her dragon magic are extremely useful. Meru is also quite strong, and sometimes he is an annoying talkative brat. <br /> <br /> The designers of the characters were, like most, willing to make the female characters look nice or whatever, and did not think about the actual suitability of the outfits. Seriously, no armor and exposure of most of your skin is helpful in fighting monsters. But I will give them props because they have women serving as knights in different countries. <br /> <br /> I can not comment much on the story, because to be honest I did not pay much attention to it where I had to go to the next one. I'm not sure if it says anything about the story or my style of play. <br /> <br /> In all, it is a very nice game. It has its drawbacks, but for me it struck the right balance between thinking and pressing buttons and killing monsters.
