This cool Marvel superhero game pays tribute to staying true to the comics. Spiderman of all Marvel superhero games that are so weak with poor graphics and gameplay improves in both departments. It also includes the voice of Stan Lee, the creator of the Spiderman comics. <br /> <br /> As you might expect, Spiderman does everything a spider can do. It does more than centrifuging the network. In fact, he uses them as weapons and shields. When he does not use the network in battle, he strikes and kicks. Spidey has his hands full, fighting Venom, Rhino, Mysterio, Scorpion and Dr. Octopus, to name a few. Search for Captain America in an episode. <br /> <br /> Most levels are a challenge, but some require patience to overcome. The only complaint regarding this game is that it is so short and can be completed in less than three hours. If you are a true Marvel superhero fan, this game is for you, but do not expect a long game. Better luck in "Spiderman 2". My rating: 9 out of 10.
