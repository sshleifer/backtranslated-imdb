This is the beginning of the new and interesting Star Trek series. It has a "mundane" character with darker and less "plaggy" scenography. <br /> <br /> Characters need more time to grow, but they have potential. One thing that is quite disappointing (in the case of all Star Trek series really) is that they present such a gloomy picture of equality of men and women in the future when they present a very positive picture of everything else. (Earth has stopped the war, famine, etc.). There are two female characters here, Commander T'Pol, who is a volcano and a Hoshi communication officer who is a human. Hoshi is pretty bad, and T'Pol is "vulcan babe". <br /> <br /> Some of the crew's attitudes are a bit too American (as opposed to the more international character of the TNG crew), but it creates an interesting dynamics. <br /> <br /> Very good pilot in a very good series.
