This amazing short film explores the potential of animation in a world of funny or frightening, but always powerful images. Cats drive and drink from a water elephant, a circus with a bird that swallowed up the sky, and pigs eating their own fried meat - this is just the beginning. Unusual scenes and images flow together without obvious causation in a way that requires re-viewing. In addition, the DVD contains an amazing commentary by the director who, taking into account an extremely slow dialog box, only improves the viewing experience. The commentary gives some interpretation of the scenes, but also provides priceless quotes on the creation of Cat Soup, according to the following words: "Well, the artists asked what we should do in this scene, but I did not know myself, so it's hard to say why it turned out that happened "(incidentally, this is a bad paraphrase). In addition, the sound throughout the film is very high quality, very precise and very moody. In total, the absolute minimum of viewership should look like this: <br /> <br /> First watching: Watch the DVD without comment. Second watching: Watch the DVD With a comment. Third viewing: Rewatch without comment. <br /> <br /> However, after watching it three times, you will not stop here ...
