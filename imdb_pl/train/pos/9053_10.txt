1.) This movie was amazing! I watched it when I was in the city next to the one in which he grew up! I went and saw the buildings in which this story took place. Overall, I loved this movie, One of the best Jake Gyllenhaal !! My favorite parts are also science fairs and all the time with my father. They seemed so sad. Homer wanted to follow his dream, and his father seemed not to care in one way or another. This line is real. "Sometimes One Dream is bright enough to illuminate the sky." 2.) The way the film was made was impeccable, everything was so reliable that it could have been recorded in the 1950s. The dress was accurate and their slang was over. I definitely recommend this movie!
