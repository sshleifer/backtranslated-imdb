I am amazed that we can see even one ridiculous criticizing this old movie. Usually, we do not get good opera films, and here's the real grand interpretation of the opera. Understandably, visualizations are not great. It is outdated. But as an opera you can not fault him; and I'm an opera lover. I can not even detect one lip synchronization; if we did not know that Tebaldi is in audio, nothing would convince me that it was not Sophia Loren. She is doing EVERYTHING with talent! Her dark makeup is fine; and brought this role to a great life! The rest of the cast is great, like the great ballet troupe. Most of the actors are excellent; Loren is really wonderful. Her rival Amneris is also great. Whoever did not care about this work from 1953 is shamefully negligent. Verdi would love it! Of course, Renata Tebaldi as Aida is the engine behind the scenes. I love this old movie!
