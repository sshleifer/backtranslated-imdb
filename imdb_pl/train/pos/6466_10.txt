I really enjoyed the movie, as did the audience I saw him in Los Angeles. After the film, many people cried and said how much the film touched them. I can see why it was a huge hit in his homeland, Sweden. The film is mastered, and every character is well drawn so that at the end you really know these people and take care of them. Music is very natural, and the main song in the film is very painful but inspirational. I definitely recommend this movie for everyone, even for people who usually do not go to movies with subtitles. I definitely deserved an Oscar nomination because of the deep threads of the film, which were reflected without pretensions in the small towns' community with everyday people. It is a film that unites us in this divided world and shows us the potential of the human spirit. YOU MUST SEE!
