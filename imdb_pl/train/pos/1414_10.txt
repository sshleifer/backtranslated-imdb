First of all, the release date is 2009, and not 2007 for this full-length documentary film. It should be more correctly called: "Earth, 2009". Second, let me refer to the complaints of some reviewers who saw the TV series "Planet Earth" from 2006. <br /> <br /> I have not seen this TV series, but I found out here that this movie is a full length version of the 2006 television series. I rate each film based on its own merits, not its source. I assess the results myself, and the results of "Earth, 2009" are really excellent. I reject this trivial complaint of some reviewers: that it is simply an extended version of the 2006 TV series "Planet Earth". So what? It does not really matter. <br /> <br /> As a film lover and the one who watched dozens of documentary films of nature in my life, I was surprised and very impressed by "Earth, 2009". It is a debut film from the new Disney Disney department and follows in the footsteps of Walt Disney pioneer and Oscar-winning documentaries from the 1950s and 1960s. <br /> <br /> Photos, movie editing, music score, sound and narration are all excellent. There were several other natural films that also stood out in these categories. What really describes "Earth 2009" is its scope. It literally covers the entire planet, covering all seven continents. <br /> <br /> After my first visit it was obvious that this documentary requires a lot of effort and the amount of time and talent to create. <br /> <br /> Three amazing production companies were required to make this amazing documentary. <br /> <br /> "Earth, 2009" convincingly tells the stories of four species about their great migrations, which last for a year seasons beginning in January and ending in December, from the North Pole to the South Pole. <br /> <br /> In this video two new special high-tech cameras were used: one camera has a computer-controlled rotary engine with 360 degrees of lens, and the other is an HD camcorder with an amazing speed of 1000 frames per second. This film technique really added drama and beauty to some scenes from the movie "Earth, 2009", especially the cheetah chase and big white sharks popping out of the water to catch sea lions and a bird's eye view of the highest waterfall in the world. There are many incredibly beautiful photos in this documentary. <br /> <br /> Through the film, music and narration, drama, sadness, humor and great beauty appear in this documentary. Thanks to the great music performed by the world-famous Berliner Philharmoniker, the excellent creative and technical cinematography and the narrative of James Earl Jones, I consider "Earth, 2009" to be the best nature documentary ever made. <br /> <br /> Five years of hard work, patience, talent and dedication have really paid off here. This film should be required for viewing in all schools around the world. I am anticipating the Academy Award for the best documentary, including awards. Really, amazing, amazing, joyful and great documentary. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it
