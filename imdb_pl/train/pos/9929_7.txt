I doubt that the majority of this movie is based on a true story. At the beginning he speaks on the basis of a real story. I bet the only truth was that he was an ex-model bounty hunter, probably named Domino. <br /> <br /> In any case, it starts with a conversation with Lucy Liu who works for the FBI. Domino is interrogated about what he knows about the theft of $ 10 million. Through flashbacks, we see Domino as a child, then as a model and how she became interested in being a bounty hunter. He basically talks to two other bounty hunters, Ed and Choco. They let her join the group. It's hard, it can use any weapon and it will use its good look if necessary. <br /> <br /> They are involved in the scam taken by Clarmont, bailman. Along the way, the group begins a reality show in which Ian Zering and Brian Austin Green are involved. They are, in a way, hosts, and they must have been desperate to appear. <br /> <br /> I thought this story was fun and had some laughter. Editing did not bother me. There is a lot of violence, mainly with weapons and blood. It could have been a bit shorter. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERSION: Good enough to watch.
