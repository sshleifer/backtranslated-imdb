George Lopez is a funny man, even without a show. The first episodes I saw were too often kidding at the expense of his mother. As I've seen it, there were more and more varieties. Nobody in the cast is really safe now from their joke. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that this year's progress has been getting better, because George is more and more in the role of a family sitcom. At the beginning he was not, but he becomes more and more a groove. This makes both him and the shows become more fun. They also added several characters to George, who also played this year. His wife's father is becoming more and more involved in the story. <br /> <br /> His mother is still there, but not as centrally as in previous seasons. I think it's wise to say that George has a comic sense, and the lack of good ABC series, George Lopez, has a good chance of being in ABC long after George W. Bush.
