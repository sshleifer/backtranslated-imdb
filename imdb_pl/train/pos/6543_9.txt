I read the entire Nancy Drew as a preteen and collect books as adults. I loved the effect applied at the end (and a little at the beginning) of the film, in which linear drawings in the style of books evolved into scenes from the movie. It was a neat way to show the connection between the situations in the film and the books. For example, scenes with a oriental antiques dealer were very much like many scenarios that I remember from books. I thought Ned was perfectly manned, and Emma Roberts was a great interpretation of Nancy Drew from the 21st century. (Like the picture of Betty Crocker, she keeps up with the times!)
