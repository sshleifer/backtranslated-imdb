I love this movie because I grew up around harness racing. Pat Boone's pouting reminds me of my father, who is attracted by trotters, because unlike racial jockeys, men with normal height and weight can be drivers. <br /> <br /> Yes, Home 1944 in Indiana is a better movie, but it's also a completely different movie. April Love is light and easy to watch, it's a good movie. (Disappointing that Pat Boone's religious / moral views prevented him from kissing the girl! A fair change compared to today's standard fare). better reflect the stress and struggle with what makes the final achievement more satisfying, but requires more emotional investment.
