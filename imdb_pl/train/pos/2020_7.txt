CONTAINS SPOILERS! <br /> <br /> I saw the advertisement on the video. Then my sister discovered that we had a book, so I read it. I rented a video the same day that I finished the book. it was very memorable, as was the book. The staff was brilliant. Tara Fitzgerald was perfect because Helen and Rupert Graves were hateful like Arthur. Costumes, music and settings are stunningly beautiful. <br /> <br /> ATTENTION! SEE TO, <br /> <br /> The disadvantage is a few sex scenes that have been added and some violence. That's why the movie has a score of 15. There are a few other things that have been thrown in. After the first part, I felt that accuracy had dropped. Although the book is better than this, I'm happy to see it and recommend it to people who have read the book, are fans of Bronte or I like costume dramas (I'm all in 3!), As long as you're fast in sex scenes. The book is rather underestimated. It seems that Anne Brontes' books are not read as widely known or known as Jane Erye or Wuthering Heights, which have hit television and film on several occasions. Another thing. When I read the book, I was surprised at how much religion was there, but here they put it all out! <br /> <br /> 7
