"Life hits us in the face ........ we must try to remain beautiful" <br /> <br /> Debut film of one of the best Belgian artists (sings songs), Tom Barman. The long-awaited film and - happy joy for the Flemish cinema - really worth seeing and a promising job! We are brought to life by the 8 main heroes who live on Friday and night. The title says a lot about how we spend time with them: we swim the way we do at the party on Friday evening, where they "meet". <br /> <br /> His rhythmic style is very "thought out". Perfect use of music. Sometimes it has an advantage over the pictures and then you feel its power. Gainsbourg! QOTSA! The party scene (20 minutes ???) is a thrilling visual experience of the way it's filmed. It keeps you really while it's set up in a small place with lots of people having a big party ..... so hard to shoot. <br /> <br /> Thank you, ménér Barman, for making this bold movie into the bad times of the Flemish cinema in just a few years. You made my day!
