I was 15 years old when the movie premiered on television. Being brought up in Texas, I understood the boredom and monotony of teenage life. This movie touched my sensitive teenage heart and I have remembered it affectionately for the last 12 years. I recently saw it on the 2nd, 3rd and 4th time thanks to the LOVE channel. I'm still crying because the movie reaches out and touches my inner, lost teenager.
