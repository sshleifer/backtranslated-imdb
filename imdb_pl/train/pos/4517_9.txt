In this topic, it's so easy to take cheap photos. You know, a guy with hairy legs is trying to look like Marilyn Monroe. Not here - Adrian Pasdar does a great job, making Gerald TRUE a man, someone you care a lot about, and as a result you feel his difficult situation, trying to live like Gerald and Geraldine. Not only this, but as Geraldine looks HOT! And the chemistry between him and Julie Walters is electric. They are two characters who love each other, and it comes even when they look at each other through the breakfast table. Even a potentially cheesy corporate acquisition line is credible and at the end you are cheering! At least yes!
