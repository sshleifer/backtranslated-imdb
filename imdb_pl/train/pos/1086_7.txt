This movie is a bit unusual because it has a very narrow story, and the film itself is performed in a very slow and peaceful pace. Although it makes it completely different than the average Grant film, it is still very popular and entertaining. It's a bit like somebody saying, "let's follow Cary and watch him get annoyed by all the problems that arise when you have a home anew." Considering how funny the actor in the movie is and the great support of Myrna Loy and Melvin Douglas, the movie works very well. While the film has a rather modest grudge, it makes full use of the material. It's a great movie for fans of Cary Grant or for the whole family.
