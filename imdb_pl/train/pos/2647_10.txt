This film can be interpreted on many different levels. Do not listen to other comments fighting in the movie and saying that this is a story re-played or w / e and that it's only about drugs. He has very overt superficial metaphors about drugs; but the rest of the movie (and why I think it was personally made) is not about it at all. It's really a mock psychology and social conditioning. It shows a fraction of a second that the main character's brother is watching these sick films online. Why? My interpretation is that it is about showing that all the horrors we are exposed to make it easier for us to be mechanical in our professions, instead of seeing people as people. As for the logic scene, it also reaches people who have been in federal, empowered 1% intelligent classes who are confused and frustrated because life is not as predictable and mathematical and logical as it seems at the macroscopic level. You must apply the principle of Heisenberg's uncertainty (along with all other laws and rules of uncertainty) not only to physics, but to life and leave room for changing your plans and adjusting along the way. One of the best movies I've ever seen. It can go well above your head; it's not for you, for those people who have problems dealing with life that does not work like a math problem. When critically analyzing a video or writing a critical review, try first not to read the back cover (written by marketers and parapsychologists)
