It's a colorful slass movie. That's all. <br /> <br /> It has a mysterious element that SCREAM has become so popular in Slasher films, but I never care about such things. Finding out who the bad guy is is not so interesting, given the tips that are misleading anyway. <br /> <br /> The scenes of death were ingenious and gorey, bringing back memories from the horrors of the 80s, such as friday 13. <br /> <br /> Another nice thing about this movie is that it's hard to identify the surviving girl, unlike SCREAM and IKWYDLS, where it was obvious. <br /> <br /> People who do not like deleted movies will not like this movie. As easy as this. I really liked it and plan to watch it again, waiting for more of the same. <br /> <br /> - MB
