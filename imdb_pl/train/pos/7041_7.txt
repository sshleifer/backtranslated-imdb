WAR, INC. (2008) ** 1/2 John Cusack, Marisa Tomei, Hilary Duff, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Dan Aykroyd, Sergej Trifunovic, Lyubomir Neikov, Ned Bellamy, (Voice: Montel Williams) <br /> <br /> Hit -and-miss-21st Century "STRANGELOVE" <br /> <br /> John Cusack ?? who wrote the script with Mark Leyner and Jeremy Pikser? he appears as a blase murderer named Brand Hauser, who is burnt, but decides to go through one last task by icing the Middle East oil minister named Omar Sharif (yes, do not Omar Sharif, but you get that tone of misunderstanding to laugh) taken over by the former US vice president (Aykroyd, old "Cusack" Grosse Pointe Blank), bringing the return of Dick Cheney here), pulling Brand into action under the guise of a trade show producer in the mythical Turaqistan (read: Iraq / Afghanistan) for the American private corporation Tamerlane (read : Halliburton). <br /> <br /> During the meeting, Brand is momentarily clear when he meets an intrepid journalist Natalie Hegalhuzen (Tomei) and eventually falls in love with her. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Tamerlane sponsors the unbelievable relationship of the Eastern European sensation of teenagers Yonica Babyyeah (a surprisingly decent Duff apologizing to his fame with tongue in cheek) and the idiotic son of the country's leader. > <br /> Below is a bold attempt at the 21st century black comedy "DR. STRANGELOVE ", but because of the intense and purposeful goals unfortunately more miss than hits in this wide attempt to laugh amid political message (unjust war to be ordered by American capitalism, check it out!) <br /> <br /> While Cusack riffs on his Martin Blank from the above-mentioned "Pointe", adds some nice touches of his man in black (takes pictures Tabasco sauce to take the rest of the casting catching up (except sister Joan, who is a riot as a high-ranking adjutant for Hauser and has one of the funniest laughs: "My mass communication skills are finally paying off"). Cusack visited the Iraq war at the beginning of this year in the 180-degree "Grace Is Gone" and here he allows his political views to bear on his sleeve, although the admirable overall tempo and rhythm of the film are not largely due to the first director Joshua Seftel a, who made his debut here (and this is noticeable), with the exception of Hauser's well-directed fight with the idiotic surroundings of fiancÃ©e Babyyeah. /> <br /> Nice attempt, but wrong failure; maybe next time Cusack will not try so hard and let the war idiocy speaks for itself, instead of lifting it himself.
