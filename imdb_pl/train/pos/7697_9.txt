This is another great movie that I was lucky to see for the first time on the big screen (thanks to Rick Baker and others). In the late 80's I was relatively new to this genre and only really new in the big three of JC, SH and YB. I was not sure what to expect when I paid hard earned money to see it in the "Triple Classics Account" in the old Scala. I did not have to worry, this movie did not give me peace. If you're a fan of Hong Kong Action / Kung Fu movies and have not seen this movie, do it NOW!
