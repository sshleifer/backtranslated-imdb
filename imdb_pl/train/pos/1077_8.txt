It's a comedy like it used to be, and compare it with two remakes, THE MONEY PIT and ARE WE DONE YET? <br /> <br /> I was 15 when I first saw it and even at such a young age I could laugh. Now, of course, knowing the frustrations of adults, I see many things I have longed for as a young man. <br /> <br /> The three main actors ... Cary Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas ... worked together perfectly, but the core of the film lies in the frustrations encountered in achieving the dream. It is never as easy and free from invisible complications as it seems. <br /> <br /> In summary, this is a classic comedy that still stands above attempts to remake it.
