I saw it centuries ago when I was younger and never remembered the title until one day I was watching John Candy's films on IMDb and noticed the entry "Once Upon a Crime ...". Something rang, and I clicked, and after reading the summary of the story, it brought back many memories. <br /> <br /> I discovered that it was getting pretty good, even though it is not a "great" comedy. However, this is rather pleasant and is a good riff in Hitchcock's false identity and global emotions. <br /> <br /> The film has a large cast of characters, including an American couple who finds a female dog during holidays in Europe and decides to return her for the prize - only to find her dead body upon arrival. From there, the conspiracy becomes crazier and more stupid, and the police begin to run after the police think they are assassins. <br /> <br /> Something like "Mad Mad Mad Mad World" and a lighter Hitchcock feature directed by Eugene Levy and he managed to get some good friends - such as John Candy - into it. The film is mainly engaging due to its cast, and the ending has a funny little phrase that is not completely unpredictable, but it is also unexpected.
