The "opening of the night" by John Cassavetes is fantastic and fascinating; fantastic because it plays with the deepest fears we have in our imagination, fascinating because it never surprises us. Due to the very long period of two hours and twenty minutes, anyone who values ​​characters will not be able to take their eyes off the screen. <br /> <br /> The story of an unstable actress Myrtle Gordon (Gena Rowlands) trying to get together to play with the demons; "Opening Night" is not only a woman on the verge of collapse, but also the complexity of life of theater actors and the world of theater. All Cassavetes characters are experienced people who know about the world of theater; so half of the movie takes place on stage, where performers do their work or behind the scenes, where producers and writers and directors do their work. <br /> <br /> Cassavetes is so harsh about his characters that this rudeness turns to the audience, but to the audience in the cinema. Because in the theater of the movie there is another audience who does not know what is really happening and laughs because they think that everything is performance. And it is indeed; it's just that the audience in the theater does not see "behind the scenes" like we do. They do not experience Geny Rowlands's enthusiasm before he goes to this stage, but most importantly; they do not know the reasons why she behaves like her. <br /> <br /> I always thought it would be difficult to make friends with an actor. Myrtle (Rowland) says she's an actress and that's the only thing she can do; and I imagine that if I had a friend who was a professional performer it would be really difficult to say when he is telling the truth, because I would know he is an actor and can pretend anything at any moment. Many things that Myrtle does during the terrible experiences the movie experiences? We suspect that it is real; the rest of the heroes are also suspicious. <br /> <br /> There is a writer, Sarah (Joan Blondell), who can not understand why Myrtle does not understand the character she wrote for her. There is a director, Manny (Ben Gazzara), who can not accept the fact that his best actress might lose him; producer David (Paul Stewart) who does not know where to stand, and Maurice (myrtle colleague) who can not cope with the love they have for themselves. <br /> <br /> When she witnessed the death of a teenager, a fan; everything is connected and influences Myrtle, but no one knows if her delusions are real. They say nothing because they do not want to upset her, but the film enters the subconscious state, which only Myrtle accepts. Sometimes we can say that everyone had it. In these moments, Cassavetes' brilliant script depicts a terrifying brutal honesty in the words that the characters speak behind the scenes; and not just what everyone says, but also what she says to them. <br /> <br /> Here are people who are not afraid to speak and constantly change what they think, just like the Cassavetes cinema. In this aspect, performances are more important here than in "Shadows" because characters are involved in a wider picture; a bigger story that comes out of trivial. <br /> <br /> But in a different aspect, the real way of creating cinema, this movie does not differ from the "Shadows". There's a beautiful thing about the way Al Ruban's camera shoots a character. When someone speaks, the camera does not focus on him, he shoots at the person who is listening; so that we can see how he or she reacts to the things said by the other. Sometimes they do not care, sometimes they are happy, sometimes devastated. <br /> <br /> Improvisation can still be one of those great performances. At the end, an unexpected scene appears, in which Cassavetes and Rowlands begin to speak, without interruption. We do not have to wonder if it was improvised or not. We just have to look; and watching them both exchange life experiences and see how words really live in a conversation, which means a lot more than what it shows? It is not more natural.
