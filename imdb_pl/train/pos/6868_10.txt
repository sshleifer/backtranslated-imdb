I saw it in Detroit in what must have been its original course. I literally stumbled into the aisle of the theater. It was so funny. I have not seen this since then, but I would like to. Where did you get a copy from? Anyone who talks about being outdated or outdated is only a group of posers for my money. Each skit is either maliciously, erotically, or perversely fun. Each! It is not weak. For example, an opening sequence that parodies in 2001. It contains go-go-gorilla dancers with sagging breasts. Felinni would have filmed it if he was a wicked wit ... If you come to this movie with an open mind and carefree mocking heart, you rebound it on your list.
