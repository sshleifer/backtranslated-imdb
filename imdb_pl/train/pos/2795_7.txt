I love to play football and I thought that this movie was great because it contained a lot of football. It was a good movie from Hollywood / Bollywood and I'm happy that he won 17 awards. Parminder Nagra and Kiera Knightley were good, like Archie Punjabi. Jonathon Rheyes Meyers was great in the coach game. Jazz (Parminder Nagra) loves to play football, but her parents want her to learn how to cook and she wants to get married. When Jazz secretly starts playing in the football team, he meets Juliet (Kiera Knightlety) and Joe (Jonathon Rhyes Meyers), who is her coach. When her parents find out about strikes, but her dad lets her play a big match at the wedding of her sister Pinky (Archie Punjabi). In the end, her parents realize how much she loves football and allows her to go abroad.
