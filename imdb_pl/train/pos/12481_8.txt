OK, so I do not watch too many horror movies - and the reason is movies like "Dark Remains". I caught it on the (surprisingly filled with) functions of the DVD and it scared me terribly. In fact, the only addition that was missing from the DVD was a pair of new trousers. <br /> <br /> However, the next day I was talking about this to someone when I realized that I really only saw about 10% of it. For the rest of the time I watched the pizza on my coffee table - upset that my girlfriend would catch me if I really covered my eyes. Several times I dared to watch the screen. I jumped so hard that I decided not to look up. <br /> <br /> Filming is solid, and the situation of the heroes was really attractive. The simplicity of the movie is what really captures my button - it's just a forest, a cabin and an unused prison - and a lot of darkness. The most surprising for me was that although it was not a multi-million production, the makeup effects really looked the way it was! It is also obvious that it is a movie created by someone with a great love for making movies. Sound design and music really used my surround system like never before in many Hollywood movies. I noticed on-line that this movie won LA Shriekfest - it's really a big achievement and I think the festival saw a clear talent of filmmakers - and probably much more of that film than I could. <br /> <br /> Turn on the sound, turn off the lights, and if you want to keep your girlfriend - order a pizza.
