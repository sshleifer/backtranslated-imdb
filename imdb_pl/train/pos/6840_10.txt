the fact that the film is predictable is not a problem. this movie is like a beautiful picture. the museum scene is like a nice music video. The scene of sex apres is too well-known scene in our adult life. but the movie will not interest me without keitha Gordon. Keith Gordon is perhaps one of the most underrated actors of our time. Almost everything I know about acting came from the study of his eyes mainly. he had the most convincing face. his character has features that look at the guy, sensitivity and dedication. Keith Gordon is great. By the way, I would like him to shave his beard now, because his mouth, jaw and Adam's apple were his most beautiful set next to his eyes.
