But vice versa, I'm sorry, I understand how you can get involved in the movie because it relates to the topic (and you have). This movie is horrible, the main character would give charlie brownies for his money, which he just mumbles, which is always laughing, most of the scenes just feel uncomfortable with the characters more often than not staring at others with the look ... Now your line then I will react. The best British comedy? Please, buddy, have a strong word with a bad bad self ... at the end of the day ... the sun goes down ... and this movie is awful. I mean, well done for the people involved ... they made a movie ... maybe motorbike enthusiasts can be involved, but people who still live here on the ground with a real sense of humor will struggle with it more than smile The Christmas gift they bought ... was too harsh? excuse me...
