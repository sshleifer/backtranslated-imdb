Kate Beckinsale is an excellent manipulative, yet irresistibly charming Emma in a television adaptation of Jane Austen's novel. When I read this novel, I sometimes doubted whether the hero really deserved to be called the protagonist of this story: to be honest, she is so terribly hypocritical and plotting that someone tempts her not to like her seriously. The interpretation of Kate Beckinsale, however, saves Emma, ​​so to speak: it is presented with all the innocence and generosity of her character in full view, and you can not help but surrender and like her (not to say love) despite her less friendly features. Kate Beckinsale is the main, but not the only reason why this series is so amazing; Raymond Coulthard is perfect as Mr. Frank Churchill, fully expressing the personal magnetism of this character (which is all the more evident that this role is not very well supported by Ewan McGregor in Emma's adaptation on the 1996 screen), and Mark Strong, Samantha Morton, Bernard Hepton and Olivia Williams should be in their roles. This production is, in short, a great achievement and one of them can be seen many times with more and more pleasure.
