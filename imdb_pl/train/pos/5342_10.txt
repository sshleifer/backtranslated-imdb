I was deeply moved by this film in many respects. First of all, I just want to say that Clara Lago was the most precious thing! Such a pretty little girl. Her acting was also great. Faithful life and very human. Although I do not like the part where she had to smoke; I hope it was just a false prop. Anyway, it was absolutely wonderful and the story was so moving. I immersed myself in history and its character. <br /> <br /> It's quite interesting how I really discovered this movie. I was in a hit, and I just noticed her pretty smile on the cover when I passed by. Fortunately, I looked down where the movie was! I thought to myself: "Awe, look at her!" I picked it up and saw that this movie was described as such wonderful things as "Little Jewel". I read the plot on the back, and then I thought I might check IMDb first and then come back and lend it later. I'm glad I did not do it because I would miss it. After searching for a movie with my friend, I knew that I regret not having borrowed the movie, so I went back to the place where I found it, and I did it. <br /> <br /> I was on my sideboard for a week because the school started for me this week and I really did not have time to watch it, but today it was a great opportunity. I put it on and glued it to a beautiful cinematography, a delightful score and a moving story from beginning to end. I was so fascinated and I must say that some parts almost led me to tears. <br /> <br /> I would also like to make a special mention for the young boy in this film, Juan Jose Ballesty. He was unusual. Also an actor who played father Carol, whose name unfortunately is not listed on the site. His voice was so loving and gentle that I really felt his love for Carol. Although his appearance is not visible, I really felt the presence of his character. <br /> <br /> This is a really great movie. If you are a person moved by light but emotional films, this is definitely for you.
