I saw this movie for the first time. It was different. <br /> <br /> I am a Christian (a believer in the Bible). I do not fit into the crowd of right-wing believers. I gave up this atmosphere. <br /> <br /> For me, when they tried to take over our government, they do what Judas tried to do. I call this Judge Syndrome. <br /> <br /> Judas did not understand this, even though Jesus said that his kingdom is not of this world. <br /> <br /> This movie certainly showed it. <br /> <br /> I also liked that Jesus enjoyed the simple pleasure of playing games and jokes with his students. <br /> <br /> He was also a very great Jesus. <br /> <br /> This is a preview movie. <br /> <br /> Very satisfying.
