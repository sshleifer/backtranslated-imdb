The film begins with a less hyper-kinetic, more pastiche-like Dead or Alive: strange underground activities are performed while the policemen discover the bodies. But when a policeman is killed, one Tatsuhito comes into play ... and when he discovers that his brother Shihito is also involved, everything becomes quite bloody. <br /> <br /> Earlier work of Miike's, the Shinjuku Triad Society is still filled with its usual in ultra-ultra-violent and sadistic sex acts, though it is not one of its more eclectic or extravagant works. Rather, it is a fairly well-made piece of fictional fiction, when Tatsuhito breaks through the underworld, a maze that leads him to the leader of a gay Triad who sells illegally acquired body organs from Taiwan and keeps a brothel of young boys (one in particular a character who kills a policeman at the beginning). Brother Tatsuhito engages in this society, so Tatsuhito himself is forced to become a dirty cop and use a similarly brutal and sadistic tactic to penetrate this seedy kingdom. <br /> <br /> What is particularly interesting in this little job is the relationship of Tatsuhito with his nemesis, Wang. Tatsuhito is Japanese born in China, later he moved back to Japan and separated him. Wang is a Chinese who felt alienated in China, so he killed his father and developed a criminal wing in Japan. Wang is also a surprisingly Shakespearean character, which is quite strange, and the more that you really regret him before the final battle with Tatsuhito comes to an end. And Tatsuhito himself is a similarly tragic figure when he is forced to deal with the inability to control his brother. Although it would be rude to say that Miike's films are successful mainly because of their shock value, it is true that sometimes it is easy to lose awareness of how well Miike can create bitter, passionate characters. <br /> <br /> - -PolarisDiB
