This movie is great! This movie is beautiful! Finally, the film, which presents Muslims as PEOPLE, here there are no stereotypes. This film is driven by history, by the actor, and above all by his theme, cultural affirmation and discovery. They may seem like stereotypes, but they are not, at least not in this film. The view of the Grand Mosque in Mecca is absolutely amazing, and the audience sees a fragment of the Muslim world that is rarely shown in the West. Here people are caring, supportive, devout, tolerant and devoted to each other. What a welcome and delayed departure from the usual negative portraits of the Arabs. A great movie.
