At the beginning I was not sure if I wanted to watch this movie when it appeared in my guide, so I checked it on IMDb and thought the cover looks pretty cool, so I thought I would try this movie like Elephant. <br /> <br /> Once I've passed the fact that I do not like the heroine Alice played by Busy Phillips, I realized what a good job this movie does to make a relationship between Alicia and Deanna. Alicia is so mean to Deanna played by Erika Christensen almost throughout the movie, but in the end we find out that although they are polar opposites, they have one thing in common besides being present at the shooting. They share loneliness and to what extent they reveal themselves as the film progresses. <br /> <br /> I just have to say how much I liked this movie and I was happy to see all the positive comments about it. I could not even go through the Elephant because it seemed to be using the Columbine tragedy. This film, on the other hand, was attractive and realistic. The busy actor Phillips is off CHAIN ​​!!! That's a good thing and I would love to see her progress in more mature roles.
