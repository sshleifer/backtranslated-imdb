Of these Pokemon movies (which are the best for me in the least): Pokemon The First Movie, Pokemon 4Ever, Pokemon Heroes, Pokemon 200 and Pokemon: Entei and the Unknown, probably the most concerned with the environment, probably the most beautiful and calming. Regardless of whether these are good points for you or not, "Pokemon 4Ever" still enjoys many. <br /> <br /> In addition to the above three points, this Pokemon movie contains good humor and good CGI (as well as Anime). The theme of the film in time is represented in a good way, and Team Rocket (comical relief / ugly ugly) ends with good gags and ends up being more main heroes than helpers. <br /> <br /> The defects are, as always, rather unnecessary violence and action, and evil is quite uninteresting, even more than a few bad Pokemon movies. <br /> <br /> A strange pokemon is hunted by a pokemon hunter in the forest. The young boy tries to save the pokemon and takes him somewhere ... <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Ash, Brock and Misty enter a large forest ... <br /> <br /> Curious? See the rest ... <br /> <br /> Good for all Pokemon fans and fans of "American" anime, enjoy "Pokemon 4Ever"! :-)
