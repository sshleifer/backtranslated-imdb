I do not agree with anyone who does not like this movie. <br /> <br /> I used to love this movie when I was little and I still do it. It's sweet, funny and it warms up your heart. And it proves that love and friendship can never be destroyed. <br /> <br /> And even if she did not have much history, she was still perfect. I gave her 10 and two thumbs up. <br /> <br /> Oh yes and this proves that your deepest desires and dreams can come true. (Łza, łza) <br /> <br /> I love this movie, personally, if someone says it sucks, than say "Shame." Because it was a delightful little movie and I'm glad that at least some people liked it.
