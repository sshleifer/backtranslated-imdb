I was impressed by this film. It contained the basic elements of depression, grief, loneliness, despair, hope, dreams and companionship. It was not just a genius musician who hit the bottom, but it was about a man caught in grief trying to radically find consolation in his music. Finds a companion who has his own problems. Claire and Des were able to give each other friendship and love, but more importantly, the ending of events that shaped their lives to the worst. <br /> <br /> Des is an unlikely form of today's rock star standards. But he has a musical genius. He also has an event in his past that caused him to stay in place while the things around him are literally destroyed. He focuses on creating his whale music, in fact he becomes obsessed with it. <br /> <br /> Claire is a street kid who needs a place to stay. He finds hidden talents while in Des. He also finds a mutual friend who accepts her. He learns to trust him for a time. <br /> <br /> These two find love with each other. Not passion of mind, passionate sex, but love, in which friendship and understanding mean more. For the two people who have been hurt, they find trust together.
