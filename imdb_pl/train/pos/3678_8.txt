it's a very nice movie and I definitely recommend it to everyone. but there are 2 minus points: - the level of the story has a large spectrum. some of the scenes are very great and some are just boring. - many stories are not self-sufficient (if you compare to coffee and cigarettes, where every story has a point, message, punch line or whatever you want to call it), but good, most of the story is really good, some are great and it is generally one of the best films This year for sure! <br /> <br /> annoying that I have to fill at least 10 lines, I have no more to say and I do not want to start analyzing individual sequences ... <br /> <br /> Well, I think that's the point!
