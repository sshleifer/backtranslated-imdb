I just finished watching "California" at Showtime for the fourth time since I saw it for the first time in July 2001. One might think that thanks to the recent wave of serial films, the "California" murderers would have been worth some of their earlier films, but no. Maybe if this movie was released between 1996 and 1999, maybe it would be more successful. In my opinion, California is significantly different from the majority of serial killers released in the late 90s. It has almost a completely different atmosphere than most of today's serial killer movies, such as "Seven" or "The Bone Collector". Many serial killer movies showed the killer, but this person is always behind the mask or we never see them enough to learn about them. "California" is a film that in reality tries to break this barrier and to properly understand the criminal's mind. He tries to answer questions like "why do they do what they do? Is it because of something that happened in their past? Does it make them feel better or more powerful? "Here are some of the things that California is trying to answer, but it also leaves room for us to try to identify things ourselves. Brad Pitt makes an eternal impression as Early Graice. When we first meet at the beginning of the movie, we see that he is clearly one of the worried. When we see it for the first time, it's late at night. The early one is probably drunk. Then we see him lifting the stone, throwing him off the bridge, and then he lands on the windshield of the passing car. Pitt is sharp in this movie. It's always good to see him when he plays psychos or really bad people. It's funny that later it will lead him to play real loon like in "12 Monkeys" and that he will be on the other end of the spectrum in David Fincher's "Seven".
