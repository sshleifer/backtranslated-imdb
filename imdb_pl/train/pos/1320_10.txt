At the beginning of the mid-seventies, Clifford Irving proposed writing the final biography of Howard Hughes, claiming that he spent months preparing for the book, engaged in interviews with a lone millionaire. When all this turned out to be false, Irving was accused of perjury and spent several years behind bars (although he always admitted that his arrangements were accurate). Move to 20001, a few months before September 11, a book called "Forbidden Love" (released in the US as "Honor Lost: Love and Death in Modern Day Jordan") by a previously unknown author named Norma Khouri, a Jordanian woman who reported death by the merciful killing of her best friend Dalia, due to the fact that Dalia, from pious Muslim descent, was dating a Christian. This, like Irving's biography about Hughes, was revealed as a potential mystification. Australian filmmaker Anna Broinowski tries to delve into the swamp, which was an attempt by Khouri to cleanse herself of lies. In 104 minutes, the film reveals that Norma Khouri is telling the truth, or is he just a compulsive liar with his own program / vendetta? Photos from interviews with those who know her (including her ex-husband, her publisher and others) tell about her side of history. It is a nice, well-made documentary that can point many fingers at as many potential guilty. It's not rated, but it contains the ubiquitous bad language and the play of the horrifying scene of murder, played a few times (but nothing as graphical and disturbing as what you would see in recent epic porn torture such as Saw: Part 84). This is not a good choice for children.
