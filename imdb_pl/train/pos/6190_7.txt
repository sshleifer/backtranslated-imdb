Fay Grim is a continuation of the story that began a decade earlier with Henry Fool Hartley. I have not seen the previous movie and I do not know if it's good or not. I can only recognize the current film as a merit. <br /> <br /> For most people, Hal Hartley's movie style is something you like or do not like. His combination of action, drama, absurdity and dry, ironic humor really resonates with me, and Fay Grim is no exception. It has a keenly written intelligent parody in which I and many other viewers from the Melbourne International Film Festival laughed out loud. In the first half of the movie he was adamant and delivered with deadly simplicity. It is a style of humor sadly missing in cinemas and a welcome relief for mindless teen comedies, which Hollywood releases like pancakes. <br /> <br /> In the second half of the movie, humor begins to dilute when the film turns into an international spy / conspiracy thriller. It is not clear whether it was Hartley's intention or his ideas were over, but I think that a little editing or re-writing to shorten fifteen minutes from the movie would keep the original momentum of the movie. <br /> <br /> The performances were generally good, especially Parker Posey and Jeff Goldblum, who had the most time on the screen. Saffron Burrows, James Urbaniak, Carl Montgomery and Elina LÃ¶wensohn played good supporting roles. The visualizations of the film were pretty (embedded in New York, Paris, Berlin and Istanbul), and the music (also Hartley) was good without being intrusive. The film is well written and I liked it very much. If you like Hartley's earlier work, you'll probably like it.
