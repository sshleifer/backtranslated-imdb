Slaughter High is a boy named Marta. He was harassed and elected in high school. A group of kids played with him a few mischief, and these tricks were REALLY bad. The last joke ended tragically. <br /> <br /> pointed to 5 years later. A group of children meet again for a meeting. One of them set him in an old high school. The school is now deserted and must break in. For some reason, the janitor is still there, but he orders them to go on and have fun because they give him a beer. <br /> <br /> They start partying and looking at their old cabinets, and they see something from Marty. One girl is sorry about Marty, but another guy calms her down. <br /> <br /> When the killings start, it's great. Every killing is creative and bloody. We see a character in the mask of a jester, hunting for them at school. It looks like Marty has returned to revenge. After killing the first person, they learn that they are locked up in school. They are starting to look for a way out. <br /> <br /> There are many illogical things in this movie. First of all, I do not know anyone who has a 5-year meeting. Second, when the first kid dies, the girl gets blood on her. Everyone escapes in a panic, but she runs into the bathroom and finds a bathtub. Friend Hrr has just been killed and she decides to take a bath !? More importantly, why is the bathtub in the school bathroom? In any case, the bathtub does not seem to really work ... and it dies a terrible death is a movie from the 80s. he's a bastard of horror. WHO THOUGHT, has some illogical parts. I do not, for example. This movie has a really big death. The end .... is a phrase. I recently saw Haute Tension, I can compare it. The only way they are alike is that there is a turn that in a sense disappointed me ... THEN just after turning, a great, if not the best, killing comes in the movie. /> After the last murder, the killer looks at the screen and does something crazy, and that was the perfect way to end the movie. "Wow ..."
