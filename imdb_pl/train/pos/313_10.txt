I'm Black American and I loved this soap opera. I watched it in Spanish on Telemundo, almost 5-7 years ago. History was a real story about a black slave whose romance with the white commander led her to her leadership and sincere, capricious lifestyle. <br /> <br /> Many of us could learn a lot from XICA. She took what she had, nothing and saw her possibilities. Many say they sold - but tried to secure their future and the future of their future children. <br /> <br /> It was such a great soap opera that I thought it would be released on DVD, but it was not released. This soap opera was EVER's best soap opera. We have to publish it on DVD or re-issue it on television. He's now playing at Azteca America, which is only available in Mexico or the US with a paid cable. We need it again for Telemundo.
