Okay, I'll confess - I'm a fool and from time to time I really love a stupid comedy. Although I've seen more of Kurosawa, Bergman and Truffaut's films than almost everyone in the world, I still have the weakness for a stupid comedy that does not try to be sophisticated, but it's just fun. Some of the films that immediately come to mind are MONTY PYTHON and SAINT GRAIL, UHF, START THE REVOLUTION WITHOUT ME, FAT BREAKING, and Bill and Ted's films. Everyone lacks an appeal to snobs, but only zombies or a professional film critic may not like them. <br /> <br /> BOGUS JOURNEY BILLA and TEDA is not as great as the original Bill and Ted movie, it's still great fun. In addition, unlike the original, it seems to improve after repeated viewing. I remember that I did not love the movie for the first time when I saw it - perhaps because another movie set such a high standard of laughter. But every time I see it, I am amazed with all the wonderful moments - especially those that involve the Grim Reaper. By the way, this reaper is more or less the same as Bergman in THE SEVENTH SEAL, how can you get it !! In addition to many laughter, this movie contains great music - in a way that it is better than the first movie. Hymn Kiss at the end is great, but the rest of hard rock melodies - provided that you are not an old killer, such as De Nomolos. Great viewing for children and adults.
