<br /> <br /> I've seen this movie many times. At least a dozen. But unfortunately not recently. However, etched in my memory will never leave me the scene in which Mickey Rooney - "Killer Mears" knows that he is going to be lost and approaches the moment of truth, dances, cries and laughs, he ranges from hesteria to euphoria and manages a gambit of emotions. I have never seen such a wonderful performance by any actor living or dead, past or present. That's when I know for certain that Mickey Rooney, yes, "Andy Hardy" was and is an actor of great genius. However I kept it, my opinion for myself over the years of thinking, I certainly have to be alone in this point of view. About 15 years after I saw this movie on TV for the last time, I had the opportunity to read the old section of questions and answers in the Los Angeles Times. The question was put to Lawrence Olivier, and the question was: "Mr. Olivier. You are considered one of the greatest actors of all time, who do you then think of as one of the greatest actors?" His answer was: "Peter Finch and Mickey Rooney" I was stunned but not surprised . I immediately returned to his "Killer Mears". I felt very good seeing this great skill in it, and now, having my view supported by another job that I admire .. Later, of course, was "Bill" and many other great moments with Mikey Rooney. This movie "The Last Mile" should be watched by all actors. Honestly, I do not remember much about this movie after all these years, but Mr. Rooney will never leave me. If somebody remembers this movie just like me? I would like to hear from you. For this photo engraved in the heart I gave him only in the face of his performance.
