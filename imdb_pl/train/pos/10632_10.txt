It's a movie for entertainment; I did not think that the world would make a social commentary from one small film. Personally, I think this film is fun, bold and unforgettable. It's a fantasy, unlike a speedway girl who becomes a princess. This film was done very well, I could add, in the 70s, the time of the best experiments in the film with the possibility of mentioning a person's sexuality. This film is not about a homosexual person or not, but it is about love in all its strange forms. This movie shows some of the realities of being gay in the '70s in Hollywood or California. Nice boys take care of older, not so pretty men. Women who had to stay locked in the emotional closet or risk a career. Baths were an integral part of the gay community. <br /> <br /> THEN the fantasy begins! Let's connect a lesbian and gay and add alcohol and what do we have? Well, this movie, which in ANY way was better than this grim redo "The Next Big Thing". Maybe someone should ask the whole team to watch the movie, and then try to do it better. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie when I saw it in the '70s and it still makes me smile on my lips. I heartily advise anyone who wants a funny, affectionate movie - curl up with popcorn and have fun. Some people have to brighten up !!! And this is a movie that you should do! <br /> <br />
