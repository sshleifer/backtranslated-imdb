Australia's first mainstream movie hits the screen with a bang. And a jab. And a piece. And a shout or two. And a lot of blood, horror, red herrings and lots of laughter. <br /> <br /> In fact there are many first Cut around you - this is the first Dave Warner script to be produced, although it has several other options either or in the negotiations; it's the first big movie from the director and former Hoodoo Guru Kimble Rendall; is also the first film for producer Martin Fabinyi. And for a group of guys who dip fingers into this genre for the first time, they certainly know their stuff. <br /> <br /> Cut tells the story of several Australian film students who hear about the slass movie, Hot Blooded, which was never completed because its director, Hilary (Kylie Minogue), was killed by an actor playing psycho killer in the film . <br /> <br /> In spite of his lecturer (who was the director's assistant on the night of Hilary's death), warning them that every time someone tries to restart Hot Blooded production, someone dies, director Raffy (Jessica Napier) and producer Hester (Sarah Kants) decide to finish the movie. They gathered the team and they managed to get the original star, Vanessa Turnbill (Molly Ringwald), to return to Australia - in fact to the original location - to finish Hot Blooded ?? 14 years after the shooting. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is a movie filmed, many bloody consequences? long with lots of laughter, a few good horrors and a rock soundtrack in Aussie. Cut shows that Australia can make a good, massive horror movie market as well as Hollywood. <br /> <br /> This is a great feature, with excellent special effects, a tense plot and an assassin - Scarman - this is a welcome addition to the ranks of Michael, Jason and Freddy.
