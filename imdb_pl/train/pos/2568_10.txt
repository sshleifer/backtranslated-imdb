In this sequel to the comedy classic K-9 from 1989, Detective Dooley [James Belushi] and his dog Jerry Lee are back in the fight against crime, but this time they joined forces with another detective [Christine Tucci] and her partner Doberman named Zues who did not He agrees with Jerry Lee very well. Dooley also does not get along with his new partner. It all changes with the development of the film. The film is intense because he is a guy who really wants to kill Dooley for the way he treated him in the past. There are some dramatic scenes related to the death of Dooley's wife, which does not really seem to be related to the tone of the movie, because the rest of the movie is action sequences, dog-bought jokes, fart jokes and jokes about dogs biting bad guys in a certain area. I know it looks like a very low mood, but some of them are very funny. I did not see this movie on jokes, I saw it for two reasons. The first reason is that I am a big fan of James Belushi, and the second is action sequences. James Belushi is more fun than in K-9, and the action sequences are also better. It would be nice to see more characters from K-9 to come back, but it's still a nice movie. If you're a fan of James Belushi, you'll love this movie.
