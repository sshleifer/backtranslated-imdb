This program is three little girls. (D.J, Stephanie and Michelle) Their mother is killed by a drunk driver, so their father Danny invites his brother-in-law (Jesse) and his old friend (Joey). So the whole program is about life. Girls go through life's troubles and have life lessons. They develop crushing, boys and many more. The entire program is basically compatible with the flow. You do not have to hold grudges, you just have to let it go. I think that this program is really good and pleasant to watch. I grew up watching this program and I'm still watching it. I am glad that they are still broadcasting this program on television. I watch it almost every day. I rate this as 10/10.
