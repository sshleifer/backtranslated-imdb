It so happened that I borrowed this movie from a friend who did not know anything about it, and it turned out to be an excellent documentary about traveling on an ancient ship across vast areas of the ocean. Thor Heyerdahl developed the theory that the ancient Inca in Peru managed to cross thousands of miles across the ocean to Polynesia, based on certain relics that are found in both places, certain types of ancient sea-going vessels that we know were available, ocean currents and and the knowledge that the Incas really traveled in an undefined quantity at sea. <br /> <br /> To test his hypothesis, Heyerdahl and his crew build the ship as close as possible, which the ancient Inca had at their disposal, using only balsa wood and other materials available at that time, and set out from Lima, the capital of Peru, to try to reach the Polynesian islands, some 5,000 miles away. <br /> <br /> His theory, like ancient history, is impossible to prove with 100% certainty, but the range of their journey provides strong support that he is right. A film is really little more than a narrative of material made during a 100-day expedition, but it is a very detailed description of what it was like, as well as the trials and sufferings they faced. I often wish that Oscar-winning documentary films would be easier to find, and the one from over 50 years ago is still as interesting and informative as I am sure when it was released for the first time.
