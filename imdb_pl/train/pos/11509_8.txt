The real shame is that this separate TV series inspired by the excellent television images "The Night Stalker" and "The Night Strangler" lasted only one season and twenty episodes, because at best this program often offered a winning and very funny mixture of sharp cynical humor ( captivating verbal sparrings of Carl Kolchak with eternally irritating and long-suffering editor Tony Vincenzo were always a feast for watching and listening), clever writing, clever supernatural threats (you must love unusual and original creatures in "Spanish murders of moss", "The Sentry" and "Horror in the Heights ", and you can not go wrong with such" incredible terrifying favorites like zombies, vampires, werewolves and witches ", colorful characters, spontaneous actor with lots of cool guests (legendary Flicker icon William Smith got a rare s the chance to overcome the heroic advantage in the "Energy Eater", while other episodes featured great character veterans such as Keenan Wynn, John Fiedler, John Dehner, Severn Darden and William Daniels in juicy roles), effective moments of real uncertainty (in particular the climax of "Spanish murders in moss" was really shocking), and most of all the only Darren McGavin in peak, lively form as a bold, aggressive and excitable but basically decent, honest reporter of the Chicago, Illinois, Carl Kolchak newspaper. <br /> <br /> Kolczak was the quintessence of the Everyman hero from the '70s, a cunning and smart guy with a strong nose for a tasty scoop and an unfortunate talent for doing all sorts of troubles. What's more, from time to time the clumsy Kolczak was nothing superhuman; he usually stumbled or stumbled, escaping from a deadly threat, but he possessed some inner strength and courage that allowed him to save mankind time and again from all kinds of deadly enemies from another world. Kolchak was surrounded by a handful of sympathetic supporting characters: Simon Oakland was excellent as the chronic sinister boss of Carl, Tony Vincenzo, and Jack Grinnage as the nosy Ron Updyke, created for the perfect comic film, Ruth McDevitt was simply delightful as the sweet Miss Emily Cowles, and Carol Ann Susi was also great fun as the eager debutant Monique Marmelstein (who unfortunately disappeared after appearing only in three episodes). It's true that the show suffered from colorless makeup and special effects (the titular lycanthrope in "The Werewolf" unfortunately resembles a Yorkshire terrier!), And the last episodes boasted with ridiculously silly monsters (headless motorcyclist in "Chopper", Cathy Lee Crosby as Helen of Troy in the "Youth Assassin"), but even minor performances are bought back by the malicious, malicious sardonic mark of the program and the boundless life of McGavin and the gripping presence.
