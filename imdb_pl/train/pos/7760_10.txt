Director Douglas Sirk again gets all his dysfunctional family films in this grandfather. This lush, shoddy saga is a masterpiece, beautifully combining all the elements of Sirk soaps and strategically placing them in one film. "Written on the Wind" very clearly influenced the 1980s television series "Dallas" and "Dynasty", because it is basically a full-length version of these late-night soaps. <br /> <br /> Lauren Bacall, wonderful and subtle, plays Lucy Moore, a secretary from New York who marries the oil baron Kyle Hadley (Robert Stack). Without the knowledge of both of them, Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) is also in love with a quiet but sexy secretary. Everyone goes back to Kyle's family home in Texas, where we meet his white whore sister Marylee (Dorothy Malone in the Oscar winner). Yipee! Sparks start to fly - from romances to fights with cats, this is a camping trip. Not only Mitch has to fight the feelings he has for his wife's best friend, but Marylee tries to sleep with everyone because she can not have her true love, which is Mitch. Kyle finds out he is powerless, but Lucy ends up pregnant. <br /> <br /> This is pure soap and pure melodramatic entertainment. How can you not love it? This film signals one of the most popular Universal films and one of the best works of director Sirek. Some dialogues are absolutely sizzling, and visual metaphors are thrown in each direction - the subject of the wind is great. The cast is great, although Bacall is completely unused, despite receiving the highest rate for Hudson. The loss of the Oscar in the heap supposedly destroyed it. He considered it his best performance and apparently he was not too happy with the loss. And it turned out to be a fantastic performance as a whining alcoholic. What a great movie! This movie proves what I've been thinking about for centuries - Sirk is the master of the classic melodrama. Where is his Oscar? <br /> <br />
