There are quite sad stories about women and their oppression by means of religious, political and social means. Not to minimize movies and stories about genital mutilation and reproductive rights, as well as pay inequalities and marginalization in society, everything in the name of Allah or God or other ridiculous absurd reasons, but sometimes another approach is helpful and shed some light on this subject. <br /> <br /> The match is a match between Iran and Bahrain in 2006 to qualify for the World Cup. The passions are high, and several women try to dress up as men to get to the match. <br /> <br /> Women who were caught (played by Sima Mobarak-Shahi, Shayesteh Irani, Aida Sadeqi, Golnaz Farmani and Mahnaz Zabihi) and detained for accusation provided a funny and informative look at the customs of this country and most likely at all Muslim countries. Their interaction with Iranian soldiers who guarded and transported them, both the city and the villagers, and the father who was looking for his daughter, experienced hilarious moments when we wondered why they had such unspoken rules. <br /> <br /> It's mainly about a paternalistic society that feels that it has to save women from the primitive behavior of their men. Instead of educating the male population, they deny the privileges and rights of women. <br /> <br /> Seeing the changes in responsible soldiers and the reflection of Iranian society, it is no surprise that this film will not play Iran. But Jafar Panahi has a winner in his hands for those who can see him.
