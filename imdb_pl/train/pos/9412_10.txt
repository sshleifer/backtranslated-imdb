When I saw this movie in the 1950s, I also wanted to become a scientist. There was something magical and useful in learning. I took a girlfriend - a friend to see her for the second time. I do not think she would be as impressed as I am! This film was comical, but serious, at a time when synthetic fibers were rather new. The lessons from this movie could be applied to issues related to GM experiments today.
