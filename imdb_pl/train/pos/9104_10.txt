Well, I do not agree with another comment. Piedras is much better than Magnolia or any of the other films mentioned above. <br /> <br /> Especially about unreal characters, I think that someone wrote this just because he never lived in Spanish society (and I'm not a Spaniard), it's a very real movie with real characters, very well done by one of the best Spanish actresses Antonia San Juan. <br /> <br /> about the European film unlike the American film, well, we, different societies, personally do not like American contemporary movies (I like classics and some Andy American films, but they are very few). <br /> <br /> Whether we like or enjoy a movie about a permanent constitution, we make mistakes, but some people can learn about mistakes.
