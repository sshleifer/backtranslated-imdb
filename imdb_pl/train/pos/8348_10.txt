Around 1986, I saw this movie by accident on television one night. I was 6 years old. It was similar to my accidental viewing of the horrifying ending Do not Look Now in 1987. The next year I went to Venice in silent terror, hoping that my parents would not find out that I was watching! <br /> <br /> Would not I mind if my parents knew I was watching Les Valseuses when I was a kid? I would probably avoid the topic with my dad even nowadays, and my mom probably does not approve of the afterlife. I do not know if they want to see it anyway. From the persecution and imprisonment of a woman in a block of flats in the first scene to slipping on mountain roads with glazed satin eyes, I am never sure if this movie is an insensitive piece of garbage that disregards the sexual revolution or if it is a sexy film about liberation that can be seen, When it comes to your mind, you can never be so offensive. <br /> <br /> It's definitely brutal. He has a violent attitude to sex, practically without the recognition of love. Even feeding a young child turns into a greedy act of sexual exploitation. But the script is very erotic and (God is so British) exciting! Do they suck her breasts for their own good? This is exploitation. So why do I get a tree? <br /> <br /> People are going in search of an experienced older woman, find ex-con, mother? I do not know. It ends with really gruesome suicide. I described it to my friend JB Nelson, who has the courage of the Cannibal Holocaust, and went eeuurrgghh! Lack of motherly love for this movie, just the opposite. Mutilation, where the boys started. Why do they shoot the girl in the leg? Why is she coming back to them? Do women have to be punished to learn what is good from men? <br /> <br /> I think of two films, one of which I would like never to see, and the other makes me want it not to be such a harsh world. Swept Away / Madonna, what a pile of madness does not count, has never been so insulted that a woman punished for being a woman becomes a slave to a man and maybe Madonna says that everyone respects a guy who is so angry that I can not use punctuation! Once Upon A Time In America / Leone God Why Does Noodles Do It? It destroys the path to the joy that we have been following throughout his life. So close to finding love with Deborah. Now they are destroyed. Why Sergio? Why? <br /> <br /> There is no rape in Les Valseuses, but plenty of sex and nudity in abundance, both sexes. Very honestly, without excitement. No fantasy, no perfect Hollywood moves. Jokes, yes. But there is too much darkness and jealousy and tricks here to call it a sex comedy. Forget Carry On Shooting And Naked Hairdresser In The Leg Because she'll be back and start doing it with Vengeant Son & She's Ex-Con Lover and she'll learn how to Cum From Him. <br /> <br /> Two things I can not stand are rape movies and prison movies. Les Valseuses is not a rape movie! God, nobody will want to see it anymore! It's a genius movie!
