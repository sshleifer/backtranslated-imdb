in one of Neil Simon's best performances. The creaking, bizarre, former Vaudeville stars played by Walter Matthau and George Burns join forces in a special television comedy. The problem is that they have not even seen each other for more than a decade. Full of zip lines and jokes from show business, this story flows with a steady stream of humor. Good work also for Richard Benjamin as sister nephew, Rosetta LeNoire as a nurse and Howard Hesseman as director of TV commercials. Steve Allen and Phyllis Diller appear as themselves. Interesting note Note: the initial installation includes material from the Hollywood Revue of 1929 and shows Marie Dressler, Bessie Love, Polly Moran, Cliff Edwards, Charles King, Gus Edwards and the singer Brox Sisters.
