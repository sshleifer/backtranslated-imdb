It was not bad for the first PPV Raw in 006. But the ending was really shocking for everyone present and those who watched at home. <br /> <br /> FIRST MATCHRIC FLAIR VS. EDGE W / LITA AT THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP WORLD He was not a bad player, the two can seriously play a great match if they have more time for a wrestling match. Flair wins the DQ after Edge hits him with his MITB folder. 3/10 SECOND MATCH - TRISH STRATUS VS. MICKIE JAMES FOR WOMEN'S WEDDING CHAMPIONS Not bad at all, it was the first time that Diva stood together in the ring. Mickie goes about a modified Chick Kick, but Trish duck and nail his Chick Kick to win to keep his title. 3/10 THREE MATCHED - TRIPLE H VS. BIG SHOW It's really good that this match was really. The entire HHH match focuses on the injured Big Show arm, but the Big Show is still fighting. Later, HHH is able to overthrow the Big Show and get a pedigree to win. 5/10 THE FOURTH MATCH - SHELTON BENJAMIN W / MAMA VS. VISCERA {It was a bonus match} Not so bad, everything was fine. After the fall of Viscera, after the chief judge, Benjamin's mother got a purse [who had bricks in her] and slammed her with the stem three times. Viscer got up just to be caught by Benjamin's heel to win with the big man. 4/10 <br /> <br /> FIFTH MATCH - JERRY 'THE KING' LAWLER VS. GREGORY HELP Boring, slow and sloppy. Both men really did not put in a very good effort. Jerry Lawler wins the Fist Drop win. 2/10 <br /> <br /> THE SIXTH MATCH - TORRIE Wilson VS. VICTORIA VS. ASHLEY VS. MARIA VS. CANDICE MICHELLE IN THE FIRST FUTURE WOMEN'S MATCH It was fun for me. Ashley {I think} eliminates Candice as the last to win the first ever Gauntlet women's match. 5/10 THE SEVEN MATCH - JOHN PRICE VS. CHRIS MASTERS VS. CARLITO VS. SHAWN MICHAELS VS. KANE VS. KURT ANGLE W / DAIVARI IN THE MATCH OF THE ELIMINATION CHAMBER FOR THE WWE CHAMPIONSHIP It was a nice match for the elimination room. But nothing will be the best in last year's Elimination Chamber, which was the best. The last three are Masters, Price and Carlito. Carlito turns his back on Masters and gets a roll on him to eliminate him. A few seconds later, the price gets a roll-up on Carlito for three players who win the Elimination Chamber and retain the title of WWE. But his night is not over yet. 7/10 After the match comes Vince McMahon and congratulates the price for the victory. Vince McMahon declares that his night is not over yet and claims that Edge earns money in his option Money In The Bank to challenge the price for the title. Edge comes out with a lithium, gives a briefcase to Vince and heads in the ring, because Cena has one more match to go tonight. <br /> <br /> EIGHT MATCH - JOHN PRICE VS. EDGE W / LITA FOR CHAMPIONSHIP WWE {The price that was opened during a Chamber match} is pocketed by Edge, Edge and then Spear na na Price, goes to the cover and to his shock Price explodes. The edge of the spear of the next spear and covers for the shocking number of three, because he defeated the Price and won the WWE Championship for the first time in his career. 1/10 So last year's New Year's Revolution was better than this year's, but it was still fine. The EC match was also good and the shocking payouts from Edge in its MITB capabilities are by far the most shocking at the PPV show. <br /> <br /> In general: I will give him 7/10 and C
