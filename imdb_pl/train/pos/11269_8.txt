Have you ever wanted to know how much Hollywood can escape before the official introduction of the Hayes Code? Well, unfortunately "Convention City" is lost, so you just have to watch "Tarzan and his friend" to find out. In 1934 there is an unusual amount of sexual insinuations and even exposed bodies. Have a look at Jane's naked bath. While Tarzan is often considered adventure films b-made for young boys and no one else, this photo proves that the series was initially very adult. Over seventy years later, he is still as sexy as when he appeared. <br /> <br /> In addition to the taboo pushing taboo, this is a great and exciting adventure story. I've always liked the jungle movies Hollywood directed in the 1930s and 1940s, but the genre I would call great films is not much. "Tarzan and His Mate" is definitely the best movie from this long-gone subspecies. Sequences of attacks on safari by monkeys or natives can still cause tension today. Also, the animals are too cold (especially monkeys throwing boulders). Acting soon will not win bigger prizes, but it is certainly more than enough for this type of photos. The film was again stolen by Cheetah, the wisest monkey in the jungle. One of the most entertaining examples of Hollywood pre-release code.
