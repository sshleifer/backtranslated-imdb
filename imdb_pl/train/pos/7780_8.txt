Robert Stack never really survived the loss of an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for Kyle's role in "Written on the Wind" for Anthony Quinn's 12-minute appearance at "Lust for Life." Stack plays a deeply disturbed, alcoholic son of an oil mogul. He lived his life in the shadow of his friend Mitch, played by Rock Hudson. They both love the same woman, Lucy (Lauren Bacall), who becomes Kyle's wife. Kyle's sister, Marylee (Dorothy Malone), is a drunken whore in love with Mitch. Their story takes place in a glorious color under the direction of Douglas Sirk, who really dominated in the melodramatic field thanks to amazing films, including "Imitation of Life", "All that Heaven Allows", "Magnificent Obsession", and many others br /> <br / > Make no mistake - it's a potboiler, and Stack and Dorothy Malone take full advantage of their roles, Malone wins the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. There is one amazing scene, mentioned in other comments, where she is dancing wildly to loud music when her father falls down and dies on the stairs. We are convinced that Marylee sleeps with everyone, including the guy who pumps gas because she is in love with Mitch. Mitch does not want to have anything to do with her. He is so in love with Lucy that he wants to go to Iran with loyalty to Kyle to avoid temptation. I doubt if he would be so interested to get there today, no matter how much he was in love. <br /> <br /> Hudson and Bacall have less exciting roles - Hudson's Mitch is a good guy who cleaned Kyle's mess all his life, and Bacall is Mitch's wife who's in a nightmare when her husband starts drinking again after a year of sobriety. Sirk focuses on more volatile supporting players. <br /> <br /> In Sirk's hands, "Written on the Wind" is an effective movie, and the great scene at the end of the mansion is particularly exciting. The director had a gift for this type of film, and although he had many followers, he was never equal.
