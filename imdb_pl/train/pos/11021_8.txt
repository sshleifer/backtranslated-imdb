After the success of Die Hard and its sequels, it's no surprise that in the 1990s, "Hard Hard on a ....." earned the bad guy, the wrong place, the bad time concept. That's what they did with Cliffhanger, Die Hard upstairs just in time to save Sly 'Stop or My Mom Will Shoot' Stallone career. <br /> <br /> Cliffhanger is one big dream for pickers, especially for those who are experts in mountain climbing, jumping up, aviation, mimicry, and acting skills. All in all, it's full of excuses to reject the movie as one overblown stack of rubbish. Stallone even managed to work on a horse! If, however, you forget all the nonsense, it is a very nice and undeniably funny romp, which provides a lot of emotions and unintentionally lots of laughter. <br /> <br /> You must love John Lithgows evil, his ticks every team of villains, and most importantly, permanently harassed and unfortunate agent of the "tropic", Rex Linn as Travers. <br /> <br /> He may have been Henry in "Portrait of a serial killer" but Michael Rooker is notable because of his remarkable appearances as Hal, he insists on constant screams with disbelief in his captors "this man has never seen anyone he did not hurt. " the character smiles broadly when the girl falls to death. <br /> <br /> Mention must also be made of former actor "London's Burning" Craig Fairbrass, who is a naughty guy from Great Britain, who comes when using Hal as a human football, yes, you can not enjoy it, Hal needed a good kick. <br /> <br /> So, forget about it better judgment, who cares if "it can never happen", lowering the expectations of the actors, increasing the volume and joy! And if you're looking for Qaulena, he's wearing a helicopter.
