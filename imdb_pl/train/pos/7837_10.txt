After repeated auditions to the soundtrack of the CD, I knew I wanted this movie, I got it for Christmas and I was amazed. Marc Bolan had such charisma, I can not describe it. I heard about him that way, but I did not understand what people were talking about until I found myself in the company of this material. Was amazing. Clips from the Wembley concert are interwoven with surrealistic sketches, such as nuns eating at a garden party, while Marc Bolan makes acoustic versions of Get It On etc. (I'm still learning the title of the songs). George Claydon, a small photographer from the Magical Mystery Tour, plays a chauffeur who jumps out of the car and eats one of the side mirrors. Nothing I can say to describe it would spoil it, even though I put a spoiler switch in this review, so you just have to see it for yourself. Avoids the description. <br /> <br /> Yes, I love the Beatles and I was curious about Ringo's directing of the rock document - it was 35 years ago - now, I finally found out he's on DVD for 2 years, but in the end he's in my house.
