This very good movie breaks with tension. The rate is obviously high - will the police and Widmark, a public health doctor, stop criminals who do not know that they are carrying a scourge before the full-scale epidemic breaks out? But the smaller elements of the story introduce tension in every scene - between Widmark and the police captain, between the bad guys played by Palance and Mostel, between Palance and the dying scourge of a man whom Palanka mistakenly considers to be the object of hunting because he has smuggled some valuable commodity between Widmark and his wife, as well as the basic question of whether to better serve the public, inform them of the dangers or hide the situation, to avoid panic on a full scale. The film is beautifully shot by Kazan, in the extremely well-directed long shots filmed in New Orleans and ends with a stunning culmination in which Palance escapes like a rat from pursuers, through docks and warehouses of the city. The commentary is excellent, probably the best I've ever heard, including photos, framing and lighting shots, stage design, cast of unprofessional actors in small roles, ironies and parallelisms in the story, such as an insightful seminar on film techniques from the 1950s and film noir in general. Watch it once to enjoy the movie yourself, and if you're interested in the movie, for the second time with a study commentary.
