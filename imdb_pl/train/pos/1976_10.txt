The man who directed the "Third Man" also directed the sequence "Who will buy" in "Oliver!" Now this is talent. <br /> <br /> I'm raising my hat to Carol Reed. <br /> <br /> I know that the game is "second units", but still ... <br /> <br /> I had to deal with Orson Wellesem and Oliver Reed ... <br /> <br / > I suppose that the quality will end. <br /> <br /> (This shows up in the last scene with Nancy spoiler - everyone must see Oliver for the first time].) How many lines do I have to write. <br /> <br /> Encouraging people to write too much should not be encouraged. <br /> <br /> I hope it counts as "10th line".
