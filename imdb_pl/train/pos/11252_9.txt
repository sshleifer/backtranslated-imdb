This is my second time at A Perfect Spy. I watched it 2 or 3 years ago and I liked it. I still like it. It is only natural that it is compared to another large Le Carre series, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. Tinker Tailor focuses on the spy game "game"; Perfect Spy gives us the second axis - what kind of person is a spy. There are many themes that these videos share, along with others in this genre. <br /> <br /> Ambiguity - moral, sexual, interpersonal - which creates a multidimensional space of true vs false, inside versus outside, love and responsibility. In a sense, these characters are happiest when they are treated the most horribly by those they love and respect - "hammered in the back" in various nuances. <br /> <br /> The topic of fathers and father figure is also important. One of the most intriguing characters in A Perfect Spy is Rick, the main character that Magnus can be a father. He betrays and is betrayed throughout history. Rogue, who is always able to climb back up the ladder when he is overthrown, who seems insensitive to what others think about him, asks Magnus every time they meet: "Do you love your old one?" And never , "Do you love me?" Maybe it says somewhere else, but A Perfect Spy is a love story. <br /> <br /> Another topic is malice. The essence of business is turning others away - turning them against their government, against their friends and colleagues, turning them against their values ​​and beliefs. In every Le Carre movie I've seen, The Spy, who came from cold, looking into a glass war, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, Smiley's People and Perfect Spy, turning and turning, is the basis of the tragedy. <br /> <br /> Finally, not so much the subject as the artistic accent - in each of these films there is usually only one shot from the pistol, and maybe two pictures recording the story. Violence, torture and cruelty are always just below the surface. We see their results not as blood streams or damp prison cells, but in the objects that Le Carre's heroes hold when they are inevitably sucked into the swamps. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen in the above films and you like A Perfect Spy, you are at the feast. I also recommend the The Sandbagger series (Yorkshire TV), whose 2nd and 3rd seasons begin to reach this level of complexity. IPCRESS File and Burial in Berlin are nice, though light. In a political plot, try a very British coup, House of Cards and Yes, Minister / Yes, Premier. <br /> <br /> If only Brit were going to do The Three Kingdoms - a movie would be created with intrigue and complexity.
