If you've never watched the movie and how old veterans, it's a movie for you. Seeing Frank Sinatra when he was very young and extremely thin, with sunken cheeks and a wonderful voice that sang wonderful old songs. Michele Morgan (Millie Pico) gave a great performance with lots of dance and musical numbers. Leon Errol (Cyrus Drake) played an excellent supporting role along with Victor Borge (Sir Victor Fitzroy Victor), who performed classical piano and comedy without smacking, just like in his career. This is not a great musical, but Frank Sinatra was a great joy to see at the beginning of his career in the 1940s.
