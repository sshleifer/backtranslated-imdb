Although this is not the best Anime I've ever seen, but I liked Lady Death. <br /> <br /> I never read a comic book and I just saw it in the video shop and decided to give it a chance. <br /> <br /> The animation was fine, I got from it the anime sense of the 80's, which is to me that which discouraged it. Why do all others hate what is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Character development was fine. I like it, as they brought the transition from Hope to Lady Death. for those who do not like it, apparently they did not pay attention. Lucifer tells you how it happens and used his words. <br /> <br /> Creamtor was a nice mentor / soldier for her. his dark style was perfect for this type of movie. <br /> <br /> I think everyone here who has done this has to look at it and think about it. because everything that people cast, you can say about the favorite anime Vampire Hunter D
