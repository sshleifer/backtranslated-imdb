Titanic is a long but well-made tragic story about the adventures that takes place during a terrible journey on unsinkable ship. Screenwriter / director James Cameron did a great job making this movie about a fictional love story between two very different people and combining it with the real Titanic event that sank after hitting the iceberg on April 15, 1912, claiming that thousands of lives were killed in icy conditions waters of the North Atlantic. Both heroes of the film are great in their roles, including Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. They are a good pair on the screen. DiCpario and Winslet also had real chemistry that made the romance that eventually blossomed between them be much more credible. They both showed a real talent when it came out and they both showed it in their latest films. The rest of the supporting cast, including Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Jonathan Hyde and Bill Paxton in a small role, is just as impressive as their characters who help revive them in this film. Love story, action, tension and special effects are wonderful at this time. The terror of the situation in which the characters were located was so real because it really happened that you want most of them to survive this situation of life and death. Sometimes the pace was a bit slow and it was a bit too long, but the rest of the movie made up for a few flaws. Titanic is a great dating movie that will make some girls cry every time they watch. The fact that this really happened certainly added to the movie, which makes you regret all the lost lives when the Titanic sank in the Atlantic after hitting the iceberg. Overall, the Titanic is a tragic and heart-rending tale of two people who fall in love with an unfortunate ship, revived by exceptional cast performances, especially DiCaprio and Winslet, who definitely make this movie worth watching.
