The best Modesty Blaise movie I've seen so far. It's like a good TV series pilot. I even think it's a bit "cultic", like with a touch of Quentin Tarantino's magic or something. They caught a lot of Modesty, but I admit I miss Willy Garwin a bit. Even if I have read many comics and Peter O'Donnell's book, I am not disappointed with this film, quite the opposite. A positive surprise with this story about Modesty and her childhood. I did not set my expectations so high because of a bad movie from 1966. Maybe I've exaggerated with this movie a bit. But if you like comics and other stories about Modesty Blaise, you should definitely see it! I can not wait to continue ...
