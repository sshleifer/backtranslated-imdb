Acknowledgment for Fawcett's acceptance of roles that were considered controversial at the time. I recall that rape in the eighties was a taboo subject, and women's rights and emotions were rarely explored so deeply at this time. <br /> <br /> Fawcett is just a woman he follows and then follows actor Russo. He is adequate as an obsessive psychopath, but sometimes a bit transparent. <br /> <br /> Diana Scarwid has a little role, just like Alfre Woodard as a friend from home. Woodard is worried about legal consequences when Fawcett, a rape victim, takes revenge on the perpetrator. The scene in which he throws a pan of hot oil in Russo is classic and as a rapist deserves it. Then he keeps him in captivity and the consequences have to face. <br /> <br /> A very real story reflecting the emotions and rage of rape victims who have been physically and mentally disturbed. Highly recommended. 8/10.
