Dick Tracy is undoubtedly the best comic book created so far. The film has the same impression as a comic, remaining faithful colors. The Batman series climbed, fell, climbed and fell again. Dick Tracy has real endurance as something that can please both adults and children. Good guys triumph over evil, without blood and blood to achieve the goal. Al Pacino is doing a great job of his own adaptation of Big Boy Caprice, and Madonna is remembered as Breathless. But by far the best job is Warren Beatty, who just personifies Dick Tracy, as he did with Clyde Barrows. I can not wait to appear on DVD on April 2, 2002. My tape is thin.
