I do not fully understand why one of the "reviewers" gave this document "0" for reasons other than political. No, the film did not investigate both sides of this story, but certainly one film in favor of Chavez against propaganda waves against him should be seen as an attempt to balance the overall narrative (especially considering A. the history of CIA involvement in Latin America in the fermentation of social unrest - Google National Security Archive and B. relations in this country and elsewhere from clearly falsified scenes of Chavez supporters firing at non-existent opponents). The most amazing in this film is that the filmmakers remained in the presidential palace throughout the entire revolution - for sure the first in making documentaries - the images of the assassination on both sides !!!
