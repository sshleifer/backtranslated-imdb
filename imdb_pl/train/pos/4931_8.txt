When the plague explodes in New Orleans, Richard Widmark rescues "Panic on the streets," one of the lesser known films of the great Elia Kazan. Kazan has a fast pace and there are many wonderful touches - scenes between Widmark and Barbara Bel Geddes, who plays his wife and scene at the police station, show family life and professional life and relationships of average citizens who are in sharp contrast to life and low-life relationships , depicted by the menacing Jack Palance, his weak man, Zero Mostel, Tommy Cook and Louis Charles. There are also some interesting visualizations - Palance has several scenes with actors who seem to rise to their knees. <br /> <br /> Acting is wonderful, and the dialogue is sharp, if the story is not quite all the way to the direction and performances. It has some dubious aspects that the viewer will notice quite easily. In addition, it is worth to watch it. Kazan was a master director.
