I probably saw this movie for the first time around 1995. Since then, I have returned to him many times. Great! I especially like the first and second clips of "Creation" and "Civilization Rising". Wow! It was so cool during the glory days of CG animation. CG is much older than me because I know that the film "The Throne" was made 7 years before my time. But this film was a breakthrough in the early 90's. Probably it was the first collaboration of various CG experiments with music. I like it very much, I think I will watch it now. PA
