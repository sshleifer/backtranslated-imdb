The Last Hunt is one of the few westerns who have ever dealt with Buffalo hunting, both as a sport and a business, and as a way to win the plains of Indian wars. Before the white man set foot on the other side of the Mississippi, the plains had herds of American bison as large as some of our largest cities. In the period in which the last hunt began, the bison was completely destroyed. The 20th century, thanks to the efforts of conservation activists, caused the population of the species to revive, but not as it used to be. <br /> <br /> Robert Taylor and Stewart Granger appear together in the second movie and this one is much better than all the brothers who were brave. Here, Stewart Granger is a good guy, a weary buffalo hunter who has to get back to work he hates for financial reasons. <br /> <br /> The partner he chose is Robert Taylor. Forgetting Taylor for a moment, I doubt if there ever was a more rude, nastier soul than Charlie Gilsen, who Taylor introduces. At Devil's Doorway, he was an Indian fighting against the prejudices brought on by the racist played by Louis Calhern. In The Last Hunt is a racist. It kills both buffaloes and Indians for pure pleasure. He kills one Indian family when they steal mules and take a widow of one prisoner. How does a barbarian conqueror expect sexual pleasure from Debra Paget. He is furious when Paget does not see it that way. <br /> <br /> Regardless of how often they refer to Russ Tamblyn as semi-luxury, I have never been convinced that he is an Indian. It's the only weakness I found in The Last Hunt. <br /> <br /> However, Lloyd Nolan, an old, rough skinner, Taylor and Granger, is great. Nolan steals every cast scene. <br /> <br /> For those who like real westerns who want to see Robert Taylor's website never seen on the screen, and who do not like cheap heroics, The Last Hunt is the perfect hunt.
