It is rare for a movie to be as flawless as this one. It's really one of the best-preserved, most closely constructed movies I've ever seen. Each line of dialogue can be interpreted in several ways, in different ways relating to each of the three main characters. The film has an internal network of motivations and double crosses that catch and deny you. Let's add that the slowly burning romance between Kevin and Faye is just as moving as anything that has ever been involved in celluloid, and you have ingredients for the perfect movie. It exposes the romance of films like "Titanic" as banal clich√©s that they are. If you're looking for a movie to watch when you put the laundry, that's not it. You need to get involved in this movie. You can not talk while running to and from the room. This movie requires your attention. Treat it with the respect you deserve and you will get a lot out of it. Unless you think "Titanic" is the best movie ever.
