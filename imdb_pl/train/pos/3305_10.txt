Undoubtedly, this film must be one of the greatest ... in the history of cinema. I've watched it too many times to remember it, and every time I see a movie for the first time. <br /> <br /> Where is it started? <br /> <br /> Meena Kumari's central performance is undoubtedly one of the best in her career, followed by Sahib Bibi aur Ghulam and Phool aur Pathar. Every movement and nuances of its performance make every other Bollywood hero shine. Her masterly interpretation of Kathak, combined with her grace, the tragic sensibility and poetic delivery of Urdhu, is nothing she has ever seen on the Bollywood screen. <br /> <br /> Pakeezah is probably the most stylized interpretation of the human condition; photography, sumptuous photos and mise en scene are so charged with symbolism and meaning that the viewer has no shortness of breath. <br /> <br /> Naushads music is unparalleled, his knowledge of gharan courtesan music is amazing, and the way in which the narrative of dark narration, romantic motifs and overwhelming romantic melodies is truly remarkable. life and art.
