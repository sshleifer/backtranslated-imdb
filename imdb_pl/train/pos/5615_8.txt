Kafkan's thriller of alienation and paranoia. Extremely well done, and Pola≈Ñski deals well as an uncertain introvert who tries to adapt to his dingy premises in Paris and other tenants. Frightening early because of the apparent obsession with tenants and terrifying later, when he develops his defense, which will ultimately be his ruin. Personally, I could do it without the element of cross dressing, but I accept a tribute to Psycho and the fact that he had some logic, keeping in mind the story. Nevertheless, it would have been possible without and would have removed the theater element a bit, but maybe it was intentional, because the yard certainly seems to look like a theater at the end. I can not resist the impression that there are more than a few of the director's own feelings, not to be a "real" Frenchman and a Jew. Even so, there is a lot to offer here, including the great performance of the beautiful Isabelle Adjani, and the good old Shelly Winters are as reliable as ever.
