It seems that Hal Hartley's films are in a way a hit or a lack in most audiences. This film will not be an exception to this rule. Fay Grim is the continuation of Hartley's "Henry Foole" from 1998. This time he focuses on Henry's ex-wife (played to perfection by the ever-appreciated Parker Posey), who is harassed by the CIA bandits for Henry's unpublished book about all his suspicious interests. In the meantime, Fay ends with an odyssey, dealing with international spies, etc. In the second half, the movie gets bogged down a bit. If you've been a fan of Hal Hartley in the past, you can not miss it. For the novice Hartley, who first heard about his film technique, you can check his earlier films before you do it (especially if you have not seen "Henry" yet). I admired the work of the camera, which sometimes reminded me of an early photo of Man Ray.
