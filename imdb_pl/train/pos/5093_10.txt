The problem with the version of this movie from 1985 is simple; Indiana Jones was modeled after Alan Quartermain (or at least he is Alan Quartermain TYPE character) that the director of 85 made a mistake, plundering the IJ films for dialogue and history too deep. As a final product, you got a mixed up mess called Alan Quartermain, in an uneven block of cheaper imitated IJ saga (with a hint of Austin Powers-esquire cheese here and there). <br /> <br /> Many critics have described it as "a great parody" or "unintentional comedy." Unintentional word. This film was never meant to be humorous; witty, yes, but not humorous. Unfortunately, it is senseless and not witty. <br /> <br /> With this new mini-series M4TV, you'll get much more history, lead character development, solid portraits and a great, even entertainment mix. This story is a bit long; much longer than its predecessors, but deservedly because this version contains a real storyline, not just an action and Eye Candy. Although it includes both action and Eye Candy, it also corrects the mistake made in the 1985 version, forgetting about IJ entirely and returning to source materials for AQ, creating a great, thoughtful plot and a few nice additions to the plot. <br /> <br /> Now this attempt is not the whole extravaganza of Indiana Jones. It is not a weak attempt. This vehicle is driven by story and character and is a beautiful version of the AQ / KSM saga. Filmed on the spot in South Africa, the audience receives beautiful (if abandoned) views, native cultures SA, as well as nice pictures of wildlife, which blend seamlessly with performances and story. <br /> <br /> Steve Boyum completely surprised me because I have never been one of those who signed his vision. In fact, I did not like most of his work as a director until this attempt. I hope this is a more new rule of talent and less fauna than it seems. <br /> <br /> This version evaluates 9,8 / 10 on the "TV" scale from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
