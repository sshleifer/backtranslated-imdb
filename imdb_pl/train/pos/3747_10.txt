For most of my life I have never seen many movies online, but if I chose one of them, I would choose Spatula Madness, clever reference to most films like soldier's star (etc.), using the camera, and steel cunning, Jason Steele mastered the art of transforming a normal picture in the image and then placing it together with frame-by-frame animation to get the world inhabited by a spatula. the story begins in the middle, shows that for directors is delighted? then the center is at the beginning, and so on when I first saw it, I expected a soggy, beautiful appearance, but Jason, like me, loves the look, so he took every detail to the max. although I do not recommend it to children, or anyone but me would like it, but search it online (his short movie, look at the film cow), his style reminds me of the southern park, but less brutal. 10 for the look, 6 for laughter and 6 for the story, all for 10/10, good work <br /> <br /> Jason Steele, I want to see the movie.
