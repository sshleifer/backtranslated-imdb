Well ... it's easy for my favorite TV series. Call me a trivial phrase, but in the program, show violence, mafia, sex, gambling, drugs, etc. You are already earning points in my book. Combine all this with acting that surpasses everything you've ever seen on a small screen, add a director that fits the vintage cinema, and above all writing, which blows up your mind (and a few minds for a long time) and you have a show that will quite difficult to compete with. <br /> <br /> First of all, there are two actors, James Gandolfini as Tony Soprano and Edie Falco as his wife Carmela ... as for Gandolfini, he fits his role the way words do not they are able to express if you have not seen it as a ton yet, and now you see it! <br /> <br /> I can go on and on and talk about every character in the show, about psychological brilliance, capture of the scene, etc., but you would not be able to stop me, so the only thing I can say is that it's about the only program together with Seinfeld that I can watch all the time from beginning to end and enjoy it even more.
