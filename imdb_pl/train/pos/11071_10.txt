I am giving ten out of ten, one of the best films ever. Absolutely broken, stunned and stunned by the whole picture, wonderful game of Jason Statham, Ray Liotta and the whole crew, an amazing story ... Just look at yourself and gather up the courage to admit - it touched your soul, because it's weird, but they're all the answers you were looking for ... Best, sir. Ritchie! VERY BEST EVER. Those who have been looking for simple figures and skirmishes are still shouting that they are disappointed. But there are a lot of shallow films in Hollywood, you do not remember what happened the next day when you saw it. On the contrary, the Revolver is unique, I could not have expected that it would be possible to present such a clear and brilliant picture of myself, all who were to watch it. Absolutely unmatched, amazing, dazzling ... You can get an insight into it, I have no doubt about it. Actually, no words are able to express my admiration ... I still wonder how it was possible to make such a movie after years of staggering Hollywood trash that we watched. Thank you with all my heart, it's simply the best.
