This movie is great. Just. It's rare for you to find a comedy with levels, and this is a damn good example. The first time I saw this movie, when the loan was spinning, me and I looked at each other and asked ... - did you just get it? For those in doubt, look at the levels. See comparisons between Vick and people in the club, DNA! See a variety of characters, each fighting for a position, and if you see nothing more, see the relationship between Vicek's treatment and the path through the movie. EVERYTHING IN THE HEAD OF VICKA! A line opening the world of Vicek. The final scene with the camera entering Vicek's head, and the whole universe in the middle! Exactly quoted, wonderful gangsters from cartoons, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!
