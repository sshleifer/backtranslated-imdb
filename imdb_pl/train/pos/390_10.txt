The first thing I thought when I saw these movies was: This is not really a movie, at least not what we imagine spontaneously when we hear the word "movie". it is completely symbolic, everything in it has a symbolic meaning. So if you're not used to expressing things in a symbolic way, you'll find it strange, if you do not know philosophy, religion, spiritual life, you'll think it's just a fairy tale ... and even weird, chaotic. For me, "Legend Zu" is perfectly transparent. And I like it. He tells us in his paintings a story about the fight of light and darkness, a battle as old as humanity, and everyone who seeks meaning in this life, faces her. The film is of course created by Buddhists. I'm not a Buddhist. My religion and vision of the world and man is different. But while we are all human and have the same human nature, we necessarily have common experiences and we are able to understand each other. It's really a beautiful movie! And I've had more such films - movies that matter. There are too many empty stories that are only good for faster elapsed time.
