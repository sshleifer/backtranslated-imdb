I loved this movie. First of all, because it is a family movie. Second, because it offers a refreshing approach to news about HIV in the family, with much less hysteria than what I normally saw in movies. The brothers are very close, but they do not judge. Their desire to protect their youngest brother is noble, but ultimately not needed. I understand that Leo's choice of how to deal with his treatment was not the most popular among people, but I believed that it was the right choice for him. I can not believe it was a French TV show. He had great production values. I gave the movie a decade and I think you will see it too.
