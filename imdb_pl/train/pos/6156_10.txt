This movie has always been my favorite Disney movie. Then on 21/21/01 I saw the 30th anniversary of this movie DVD. WOW I remember why I loved this movie. The DVD is so great that it has an additional 30 minutes which the original did not have. I did not know about it when I started watching. Since then, the film has been made much more. The music they cut out should be left behind. You did not see this movie until you saw the full version of 131 minutes. Many people say that music is forgotten. I remember every song in the film by heart, each song has its own charm thanks to its self and connects as a hole. I remember that when I was younger, the song "Eglantine" stuck in my head for a few days. Same as "Briny Sea" (this song was meant to marry poppens, but was cut out of the movie). Please, watch the new, extraordinary 30th film and vote again for this film. 10, which really is.
