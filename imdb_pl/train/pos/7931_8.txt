Man, if someone was expecting a great zombie movie after reading this title, then you're late and deserve a disappointment. As for me, I was expecting a low budget zombie hit in cheeseball - and that's what I got. I was not disappointed at all. I thought it was a nice little movie. Zombies were exactly what they should be, because all the zombies were JUST turned over, so they are freshly undead zombies. Of course they did, because it would be quite expensive if they made a full-fledged zombie FX. I understood all this, I have no idea how anyone could seriously undermine this movie. This is called the "PRIEST OF THE LIVING OF LIFE" for love of God! Will you watch the film "Redneck Zombies" and ANY Uwe Boll and you expect it to be great? Of course not! So why do some morons on IMDb groan like students about this film, I will never understand it. Oh and YES, there are worse movies out there, so stop saying it's the worst you've ever seen, because you know you're full of it! Have you ever watched "ZOMBIEZA" ???? Or "Feardotcom" ????? Or "House of the Dead" ???? These are some of the worst I have ever seen. If you do not see that it's just a zombie movie with a low budget, apparently created by zombie movie fans, something is wrong with you. I just had a good time. Thumbs from me and I would like to see the sequel too.
