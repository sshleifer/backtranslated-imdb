The reason I say this is because I wrote the script and did not know much about it until I was asked to watch the movie. I wrote it for some producers who sold it without telling me about it. Because Alan Dobie was my friend, I have to hear about it. I just wrote the first sketch, so I realized that I was worried when I heard he was on the floor. I asked Peter Collinson, through my agent, if I could like it, to make a different sketch. I also asked if I could see my original script because I lost it. I was told it was too late. So I did the only thing I could do under these circumstances and took out my name. I had no idea what they could do with my script. Then I was invited to watch the finished movie. I was so impressed that I quickly asked to re-enter my name. It is a beautifully made piece from a hastily written first draft, and I expected that I would be asked to do more work on it; maybe if I had, it would not be so good. I would like to see my original script again, if anyone knows where he is? I would also like to see the movie again, I only saw it once in a small cinema in Soho.
