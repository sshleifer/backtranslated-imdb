The US Department of State would not want us to watch this movie because they have beef with the Iranian government. However, it shows us how much Iran is civilized, despite the content of the film, which focuses on women's fight for equal rights in the simplest way: the ability to watch a football match at the stadium, which is strictly limited to the male audience. The film is fun, and in itself is proof of freedom of speech and expression in Iran. I really liked this movie. Five girls try to break through the police border at the ticket gate to a football match between Iran and Bahrain. The resulting comedy is too ridiculous to describe, from bus travel to the stadium, to inserting police and then stopping girls until the end. Do not miss this classic movie. It must see. One of the best foreign films I've seen for years.
