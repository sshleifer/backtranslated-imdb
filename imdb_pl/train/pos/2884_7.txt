Of all the stories of the princess that Disney has placed there, Cinderella probably has the most lasting charm. I can not really say why, but for some reason the generation for a generation pushes her to the top of her lists. As a little girl, I did not want anything more than to be Cinderella with her glass slipper - it was my absolutely favorite costume. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I do not think there is a story that is more aware of the heart's cravings than Cinderella. Who has never wanted to escape the murders of everyday life and find someone who sees you like no other? History is older than English and somehow it still rings real. <br /> <br /> When it comes to characters, Disney can not make a wonderful villain. Lady Tremaine is evil for T, in a wonderfully calculating, not overtly physical way. Her tongue and eyes are doing her job - she does not need brightening bars to strike fear into your heart. Animal friends tend to creak, especially this stupid Gus. I would cheer if he met his fate in Lucifer's jaws. Cinderella was not exaggerated - sometimes he made some good remarks. However, she lacked the motivation to make her totally sympathetic. Sure, she was nice and fed with animals, but what kept her here? We never know. Even if she became a maid only in another house, at least she got paid and she respected him. It seems that the only reason Cindy works is that everything falls on her knee. He never works for his dreams, which he sings so tenderly. <br /> <br /> Which leads me to music that is beautiful, as always. Ilene forests have a beautiful, rich voice, probably my favorite hero of every Disney. There are some big standards here - Dream is the wish that makes your heart, so this is love, Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo ... <br /> <br /> Cinderella is a wonderful, cordial story with lots of musical attractions. Although he lacks some characters, he provides classic black characters and excellent voice work. If you feel sick at heart, pop-it will warm you up and make you humming Mmm Mmm Okay! <br /> <br /> Quote from: <br /> <br /> -Surprise! Surprise! -Duh duh duh- Happy Birthday!
