I must say that this movie is really amazing and moving. Reese Witherspoon is so charming, and Jason London is not so bad either! it's so sweet when Dani falls in love and breaks my heart while warming my heart while watching Court fall in love with Maureen. however, it's even sweeter to see how much he cares about Dani. I must admit that I wanted him to finally fall on Dani. it's so cute when he looks at her as she fell for him. I did not want her heart to be broken so much. but the biggest tragedy I've ever seen has taken place in this film. watching me dying made me cry all day. I just could not believe it. however, no more love was shown in the film, and then Maureen and Dani. they really can survive everything. I'm giving this movie 9 because I did not want Court to die, but it was still one of the most amazing movies I've ever seen.
