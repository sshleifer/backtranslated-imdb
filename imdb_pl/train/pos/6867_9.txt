I was born in 1982. Most of my childhood memories are in the late 80's and 90's. I first saw Groove Tube in 2001 when I was 19 years old. <br /> <br /> And I found it funny. <br /> <br /> So for anyone who thinks that something "outdated" maybe 30 years later will be quite fun ... think again! It's funny, even if you do not know what the 70's looked like, and the thought of bell pants makes you shrink. Who can argue with the type of Bozo the Clown that reads adult literature? There is something to laugh about. The final display of scrotal puppets is the best.
