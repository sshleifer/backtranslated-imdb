Actually, they could not have chosen a better actor to play Little Richard than Leon. It captures Little Richard in the most credible essence. The outfits in which everyone and everyone watching this movie will certainly smile on the face throughout the entire movie. Although the film is a bit long, it draws attention to the personality and costumes of Little Richard. The ending should be aimed at moving Little Richard into the present, in which you could see him, how he aged in the new millennium. I will always be the king of Rock-N-Roll, as far as I am concerned, regardless of what other media say.
