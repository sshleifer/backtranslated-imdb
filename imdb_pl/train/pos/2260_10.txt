GOOD GOOD MOVIE! One that is seriously underestimated. Songs that children sing in the film gave me a sense of their pain, but also hope for the future. Whoopi Goldberg is putting on a good performance here, but the best achievement in the whole film is the actress who plays the title character. I'd like her to be in more movies. <br /> <br /> This movie should have a higher rating. I give it 10/10.
