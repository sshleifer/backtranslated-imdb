Now, with all cinema special effects, this movie may not be high on the list of things to see. But if you know anything about the development of the story, the deep truth and intentions of this film (series), you would understand my pov <br /> <br /> Granted, the specifics of the film are the writer's renderings, from whom you can not be expected to know what will happen in end. But the film is biblically accurate and rightly "scare" viewers into thinking about what they can be. I am a Christian, not because of this film, but because of my personal decision to accept Jesus as my Savior. The film and the potential that something similar to the circumstances presented in it can amaze someone who thinks about their actions and decisions. It is not a cheap attempt to scare people to believe in God, but rather a way to attract your attention. <br /> <br /> As a Christian I know I will not be left behind and thanks to movies like I can look beyond the entertainment, acting and budgeting areas of movies to appreciate the depth of the film. It's a movie that you should not only see, but feel with your heart and soul.
