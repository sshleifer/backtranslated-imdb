I watched this movie from Ralph Bakshi (Wizards, hey good looks), one night ago at www.afrovideo.org and I did not see anything racial (I'm not stupid), I admit that character designs are a bit primitive and unexpected today, but I think that it's a satire and a very, very urban story about Remus's old stories, that the culture of Black America, created up to the main characters and a blatant tribute to "The Tar Baby" and "The Briar Patch. "These are not bigotic stories, but remember that the culture icons created by Black Americans and I, as a white woman, read and love these stories. And I also found an interesting time view of black culture in Harlem in New York in the '70s. <br /> <br /> Well, to get to know this movie: this movie is a live action / animation movie that starts in live action with companion Sampson (Barry White) and Preacherman (Charles Gordone), who are rushing to help their friend Randy (Philip Michael Thomas), escape from prison, but stopped by blocking the road to end the shooting with the police. Waiting for them, Randy reluctantly listens to Pappy's escort (Scatman Crothers) as he begins to tell Randy the animated story of Brother Rabbit, a young stranger to a big city who quickly gets up from the dark to rule over Harlem; You know, for me Rabbit, Bear and Fox are animal versions of Randy, Sampson and Preacher. An abstract juxtaposition of stylized animation and live material, the film is a graphic and damning satire about stereotypes prevalent in the 1970s? racial, ethnic and other. <br /> <br /> So in any case, this is another good movie by Bakshi; and should we sweep such films under the rug? pretend they never exist hmmm ... I think it would be a shame; I think we should watch these films and find out what's going on, how far we've come since then.
