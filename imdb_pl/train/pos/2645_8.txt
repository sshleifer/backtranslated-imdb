No movies attracted my attention like this. You see, I wanted to see this movie again for over twenty-five years. The only time I saw him was a teenager who could have been the year in which he was released, 1977. <br /> <br /> What I remember from the movie is the fact that he has touched deeply rooted emotions so deeply that there is still an overwhelming urge to look again. Intrigue, which this film provides to the human element of searching for father and son, will certainly affect every human soul that observes it. Why this movie has not been removed from memory and shown as often as many other films with a smaller depth, I do not know. <br /> <br /> Postscript: I received a copy of the film and after seeing it again I was delighted to see that my memory was real. The rating reflects the content of the film. I would like to watch this movie on DVD, seeing the production from 1977 on the used VHS tape, which took away the general quality.
