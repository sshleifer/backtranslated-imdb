I consider it highly intellectual and artistic in every respect! I felt that the script conveyed everything I felt physically and emotionally when I came home from work and watched it. is a tribute to the cinema in the highest form and format. <br /> <br /> Saint Guacamole! as I would like these days to come again. I tried to put a window with bubbles on the side of my car (honda civic 1984), but the muffin trays were not cut. also in my society, sexual positions are limited and are not supported by a waterbed, as is wonderfully presented in a "van". <br /> <br /> The "van" is most important for the freaking out of gaiety and can replace porn if you watch some scenes privately. <br /> <br /> I really expect Sam Grossman (director) to achieve his work. <br /> <br /> Ratings John: **** 1/2 Sam: *****
