Four great stories of master Robert Bloch, adapted to the screen by the best actors in the early seventies, are the basis of this excellent production of Amicus. It was a very popular movie in the sixties until the mid-seventies and is one of my favorite horror movies. This is particularly emphasized by the episode "Sweets to the Sweet", in which Christopher Lee is persecuted by his evil little child, heiress of his motherly tradition. Great fun from beginning to end and good to very good are also the other three episodes (the last of the comic, but with a great addition Ingrid Pitt, the most famous vampire of English cinema).
