Something in "Paulie" touched my heart, like few movies. It's a witty, funny but emotional movie. I'm late to become a fan of this movie. I did not see "Paulie" until May 2004 and since then I have ordered a panoramic DVD from a seller on eBay. <br /> <br /> The special effects of showing Paulie's conversation are great. My son asked me how a bird knows so many sentences. Perhaps my favorite part of the movie is Paulie, who is at Gena Rowlands (Ivy's), then Cheech Marin (Ignacio). Tony Shalhoub (Misha) plays an excellent role as a good person. You root him all through the movie. <br /> <br /> You can not go wrong with renting or buying this movie !!
