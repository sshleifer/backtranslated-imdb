I'm not a fan of newer movies, but this one was a real pleasure to watch. Adults and children could watch it together - how unusual! Aunt liked it too. He had laughter, tears, love, adventure, special effects, good actors - and a talking parrot. It reminded me of the favorite, the wizard from the land of Oz. The hero, Paulie, the intelligent parrot, is separated from his home and family and undergoes many adventures, temptations and disappointments, always remembering his decision to find a friend, Marie. Highly recommended.
