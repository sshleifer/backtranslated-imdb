Damn it straight ..... this show was a kick in the back of the day and it still outshines fairy tales today. I can not wait to track down some DVDs that I'll share with my little guy and see the same glint in his eyes. I introduced him to Voltron (5 lions, not 15 vehicles) and I laughed when one day he said to me: "Dad ... you probably watched amazing tales when you were a child !! "How cool is this. <br /> <br /> Come to Hollywood, throw it away and try it live. There could be nothing worse than Spiderman 3 ... Man oh man ... 2007 was pretty bad for summer movies. <br /> <br /> OK, I will flinch now <br /> <br /> Regards
