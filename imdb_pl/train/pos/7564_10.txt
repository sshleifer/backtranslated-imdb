In my work, I sometimes contact independent filmmakers who try to publicize their film. When I can, I watch these low-budget movies and often make me think that the future of Hollywood goes to dogs. From time to time there is a film that is born of pure passion and desire, as if created to remind the film industry that good movies are still possible. The short film BROKEN, directed by Alex Ferrari, is a real surprise and worth your second look. <br /> <br /> Approaching 20 minutes, BROKEN tries to tell the fascinating (but surrealistic) story almost the story behind. The audience is in the middle of the action, not knowing what's going on. A young woman (Samantha Jane Polay) wakes up from sleep to hear the shot from the gun and then gets kidnapped from the house. When she wakes up, she is surrounded by a group of mercenaries who look like they are at home in a comic book. These nasty guys and girls are bigger than life. They are all guns and knives. No way out. <br /> <br /> Kicker is such that despite being a low-budget movie, he does not play like one. From the very beginning, the feeling is that B R O K E N was filmed, assembled and produced by professionals. It looks like something that Quentin Tarantino could have done on a day off from work when he drowned the Wachowski brothers. The film is sharp and cool, looks good and looks great. <br /> <br /> Acting is much better than usual in these smaller films. Polay and Paul Gordon (playing the main killer, Duncan) have been well matched. As two of the few roles in the film, it's up to them whether or not they take the film. No special effects, no matter how good, would not save this movie from bad action. Fortunately, Polay manages to convey real fear, and Gordon manages to become a real psycho. Some of the more limited roles seem to be filled with less talent, but it hardly shows. <br /> <br /> The downside of B R O K E N is that it only has 20 minutes. The story ends with Twilight Zone twist, which seems a bit fancy and is not subtle. Looking at it, I felt like I had some revelation, but there was only the feeling that it was much more mundane than I expected. The film tries to be one of those puzzles that leave the audience talking for hours at a local cafe, but this is unsatisfactory. I still think it's the first 20 minutes of a long movie. <br /> <br /> MY ASSESSMENT: 8 out of 10.
