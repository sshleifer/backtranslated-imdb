Bend as Beckham is full of intriguing scenes, but has a general predictable stroy line. It's about a girl named Jess who is trying to fulfill his dream of life to become a famous footballer and finally has a chance when he proposes a position in a local team. there are so many limits and limitations with which he is struggling, which holds her back, but she is still determined and strives. I recommend it to anyone who likes a nice, light film and wants to get inspired by what people can achieve. Choices of the songs are really good - "calm my child, just keep going ... to the destination, and you will make boundaries and complications". In any case, I hope it has helped you in your assessment. Bend him like Beckham
