Really, this is not a bad word about this movie. At first, I was not impressed, but it quickly grew up on me. I like it very much and I think it is a pity that many people do not see that in some territories it was forbidden, and I was one of them. The film is available in the shock department, gore and atmosphere. Sheet music is a beautiful piece of equipment that supplies tensions. It seems fair that Chris Young has become one of the best composers in the industry. Acting in this film has a fairly high standard, if in some places it is a bit wooden, and the effects are very real and sharp. All this is praise for a good movie slasher in my book. In some reviews I noticed that there was a serious brawl in the film about the famous shot of the murderer P.O.V. And I ask: WHAT ARE THIS EVENING? This is a classic shot that evokes fear in any good fan of the genre and is great to keep the killer's identity secret. The only thing that stops this movie from getting the highest marks in my book is that the unexpected turn of the action (revealed killer) is not treated with more care, it just happens quite quickly, though the great performances make it it's almost reliable. Besides, PRANKS is a great movie (although I prefer the original title) and it's a pity that so many people like him as a cheap piece of nonsense. This is more than just this, but only a few know about it, because it seems that it got lost in the fog of the early 80's. It's a pity ... it's a really good movie! Believe me!
