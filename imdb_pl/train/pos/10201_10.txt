This is a very good movie, not only for fans of Lady Death comics, but also for those who like animated films / a series of adventures and fantasies. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of an innocent girl who is killed for something she did not do, but for who she is the daughter of the ruler of hell, Lucifer himself. <br /> <br /> Then he's looking for revenge ... and the rest you'll see better from the movie. <br /> <br /> I really liked the movie, the characters are like the original comics from Chaos. I have never had the opportunity to read the first parts of the story in comics, only the last ones, after the fragments of the movie, so I can not tell you if the events are exactly like comics, but ... one way or another is the story of Lady Death!
