An unmarried twenty-something (played by John Travolta) leaves the farm and goes to Houston, where he learns about life and love in Texas Honky-Tonk. At first glance this is a modern love story ... Texas style. There are plenty of cowboy hats, pickups, neon beer signs and references to big buckles and rodeo. Music, if not from Texas, is adapted in Texas, thanks to the talent of Mickey Gilley, Johnny Lee and Charlie Daniels Band. And this Texas twang ... "y'all". <br /> <br /> The story and characters are more or less as subtle as the taste of Texas 5-alarm chili with Jalapeno peppers. It is enough for civilized viewers to stop the film in favor of a distinguished classic, with the participation of Laurence Olivier or Ingrid Bergman. "Hamlet" is not. But "Urban Cowboy" is sharp and clear, and I like it. <br /> <br /> Technically the film is generally good. Dialogue, production design and costumes are realistic; the edition is clever. And both casting and acting are commendable if they do not deserve an Oscar. I would not give Travolta the role she plays but does a great job ... like Debra Winger. Barry Corbin and Brooke Alderson, among others, are also good at supporting roles. But the cinematography seemed weak. The copy of the film I watched was grainy and sometimes suffered from a reddish-orange hue that I saw in other films from the same period. <br /> <br /> At first glance, the movie does not seem to offer any social or political "message". But I would say that when "Urban Cowboy" was released twenty-five years ago, it had rather prophetic implications. In 1980, the United States had all kinds of problems, and least of all American hostages in Iran. In the minds of many people at the time, the United States was pushed and persecuted. <br /> <br /> This film, along with its other eras, offered something that the Americans wanted to see in their political leadership. .. endurance. "Urban Cowboy" is a very physical movie. Characters in it can not be the brightest people on Earth. But they are difficult! <br /> <br /> Everything about Urban Cowboy is anti-intellectual. As a carrier of cultural expression, this film from 1980 was one of the few that started a new difficult era for the US. It began in 1980 with the choice of Reagan. And this era continues to this day, with the president who will probably not be remembered for his intellect, but will be remembered for his hardness and aggression, qualities that Americans seem to gravitate as confidently as Texans to five chili alarms.
