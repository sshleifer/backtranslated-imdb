Honestly, if someone would tell me that the director Lemony Snicket's Series of Unfortunate Events, City of Angels, and Caspers was going to make a small, low-budget independent film and that it would be really good, I would say that this person has to joke. But that's what Director Brad Siberling did. And it was really good. <br /> <br /> "10 Items or Less" has similar conceit to films like "Before Sunrise", "Lost in Translation" and recently "Once." It involves an accidental encounter between two people who, if coincidentally, would not place them there, they would probably never cross paths or, if they did, they would not say a word to each other. As with these films, "10 items or less" focuses on the relationship that builds and on how the characters understand and build on their strengths and weaknesses. <br /> <br /> The story concerns Morgan Freeman, who plays an unnamed actor who examines his role as a grocery store employee in an upcoming independent film, and due to things he can not influence, ends the day with a woman in 10 subjects or less the belt played by Paza Vega. He has a rotten marriage and hopes to land in a new job as a secretary. Initially, the figure of Freeman needs only a lift to the house. However, after spending time with her, she wants to get to know her and maybe even give her advice. <br /> <br /> Brad Siberling builds characters almost entirely thanks to the exchange between Freeman and Vega. The plot is just a setting for the two characters that can work together for most of the 80 minutes of the movie. Freeman is enjoying himself with his character because he appears as an outsider in a lower-class world in which the character of Vega, Scarlett, lives. In the meantime, Vega goes beyond the stubborn cash official, nervous about the situation of his life, who wants to move on. <br /> <br /> There are a few things that really stand out in this movie. First of all, Siberling probably paid attention to the independent cinema to make sure that the relationship is honest and does not fall into any Hollywood traps. This is a very common friendship that develops convincingly throughout the film. It works, even though the situation itself seems a bit inconceivable. <br /> <br /> I am also impressed with the performances. While the presence of Freeman ensures the credibility of the film from the very beginning, it shows a certain amount of charm and fun, which usually can not be seen. Meanwhile, Paz Vega is preparing for a breakthrough in the American film in the future. I loved her in spanglish and she's as good as that hard, meaningless Scarlet. At the end of the film, he successfully communicates the development of his character. I can not wait to see her in the next movies. <br /> <br /> In general, 10 Items of Less works best as a piece of characters, well written and directed by Brad Siberling. He did not write much, and his feature film consisted mainly of large Hollywood movies. But there is definitely an artist here and I really want to take this road again.
