Paul Greengrass definitely saved the best Bourne at the end! I've heard that many people complain about the way he filmed the movie, and some even compared the camera style to the Blair Witch Project. I just have to say ... Are you kidding me? Come on, it was not that bad at all. I think it helps the action scenes feel more realistically, which I would prefer for a highly stylized stunt choreography. As for the rest of the movie, I did not even notice it. <br /> <br /> You can say that Damon really feel good in the role of Jason Bourne. Sometimes it can be a bad thing, but in this case it is a really good thing. In this installment, he really becomes Jason Bourne. Damon also has a great cast in Joan Allen, Ezra Kramer and Julia Stiles. David Strathairn was a great addition to the cast because he added more depth to the secret CIA organization. <br /> <br /> Although the movie is full of great car chases and continuous action, they managed to level the development of the character in all this. This movie far surpasses the other two films of Bourne and is definitely one of the best films of the 2007 summer season!
