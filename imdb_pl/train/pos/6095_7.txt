It bothers me a little. The performance is horrible on the one hand, acting is awful (even if we get real actors in one episode, such as Brad Pitt and Bill Moseley), the dialogue is moronic, and the assumption / moral of each episode seems something elevated from the 50th educational short. There's no way you'll be scared of these episodes for a moment, and Robert Englund's cameo is short, aimless and boring like Bob Saget, like the funniest American home videos. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this is one of the funniest things on TV. Fashion of the 80s, soft focus makes the actors look like them on the set The View all the time, the rooms give the material more parody than horror, so we have an episode where the high school student is afraid that if he does not succeed his girlfriend will dump him, and his parents will renounce him, another is afraid that he will be locked up in prison because he is a poor standard mother (her husband plays Brad Pit), another is afraid that all parents in the world are in he will talk to him when he runs away from home, another is afraid that he will be confused with his socially disadvantaged twin, another is afraid that he will not tear his mother and stepfather apart, killed for a reception in his home. The list is long. <br /> <br /> Thinking that these are dreams, I suppose you could look beyond absurd plot points and devices, but they are so out of the box that there is no way for writers to properly scare the audience. You have characters dressed like something from an 80's nightmare, wandering around, leading a bad dialogue in a very dark way and making illogical decisions that do not serve any other purpose, but move the story to the next strange plot point (usually watching how it makes this peripheral character something unusual for a reasonable person, while our main character stares in horrified and too shocked to do something about it). <br /> <br /> If you're looking for something that scares you, stay away. On the other hand, if you're looking for one of the funniest things from the 80's. Look at this. <br /> <br /> Recently, he was shown on TV Chiller (almost every day) and watched earlier with morbid curiosity, and now only to be able to laugh every day. With Arrested Development and Extras off the air, it is currently the funniest thing on TV.
