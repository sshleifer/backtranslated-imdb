The famous was "famous" because of the tension and release of the cartoon style, in which the semi-main character is in terrible danger, just to save the hero at the last moment. This particular Kacper is the only one I remember where death really takes a hand. But even in death there is still a happy ending. <br /> <br /> Standing in famous Studios' cartoons, "virtue always wins". Popeye always goes to spinach in time, Baby Huey is always crowding fox, Little Audery always "learns her lesson". Some FS drawings are really dark and depressing. <br /> <br /> You must give them credit. as much as I love Looney Tunes and "Tom and Jerry". I do not think anyone would have a better cartoon product at the time than Paramount. Color, animation, music (great Winston Sharples), editing, voices. They were consistent and were a great example of what the art form had to offer.
