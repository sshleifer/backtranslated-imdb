This is one of those groundbreaking films that should be put in the context of time. Darkness in Tallinn was established in 1993. It was a period of chaos, confusion and serious disturbances not only for ordinary citizens of Estonia, but also for countless other nations, which were part of a powerful Soviet empire. In such a tense climate, a young country named Estonia was born. It is known that newly established governments face initial problems, Estonia has also faced many problems when some corrupt officials manipulated machines to fill their dirty pockets using their selfish means. This is one of the main themes of this film. Darkness in Tallinn appears as an Estonian film, but was made by Finnish director Ilka JÃ¤rvilaturi. He tried to put in as many doses of Estonian humor as possible. That is why you can call it a comedy film about political background. As ordinary people are involved in this film, we can say that this movie means good versus evil. it is not a new concept because it is easily available in most religious books of different religions. The darkness in Talinn shows us how ordinary governments can be overthrown by corrupt people. A nice movie to watch on a sunny day.
