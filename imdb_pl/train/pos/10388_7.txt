I am a big fan of the Dukes of Hazzard series. And I really liked this movie. I enjoyed much more here than in other summer hits. <br /> <br /> It's funny that people are moving against this movie with excuses like "lame conspiracy" and "it's much more cruel than the show." Does anyone remember the brutality of humor in the pilot episode? Daisy jokes, and Bo says that Luke probably gave birth to half of the children in the orphanage. The only reason he has been cleaned up is that he has changed to an earlier time period. <br /> <br /> And as far as the story goes. It was the perfect plot of the Dukes. In fact, as a remake, it probably remains more authentic to the source material than any television program that has moved to the big screen. <br /> <br /> While Sean William Scott and Johnny Knoxville are not EXACTLY like their small screen versions, they do a great job and work together great. I was not very interested in Burt's Boss Hogg. And I would like a little more incompetence from sheriff Roscoe. In the movie Roscoe is a bit ... terrifying. <br /> <br /> And who did not have a smile when General Lee chases Atlanta streets and Hazzard's back roads? People, let yourself enjoy the movie, which is just a pretext for nostalgia, bikini and car chases, you will not be sorry. It's just a great stupid movie!
