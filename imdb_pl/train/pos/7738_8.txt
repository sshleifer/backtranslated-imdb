After Dark, My Sweet is a wonderful, modern noir, full of dingy characters, dirty roads and, of course, sweaty characters. It seems that most of the really big noirs from the last two or three decades have taken place in the South, where men shine and women shine too. Why? Because it is hooooottttttttttt. And because everyone looks better wet (at least men - sweaty women leave me sticky). <br /> <br /> In any case - there may be some spoilers here. <br /> <br /> This film is a great example of what should be noir - constant stimulation (although some with attention disorders call it "slow"), clearly and widely drawn (though not simple) figures and tons of atmosphere. Noir, if at all, concerns moods and attitudes. Therefore, the great are not marked by your traditional definitions of "great" acting (see Bogart, Mitchum, Hurt and Nicholson - they (and their characters) were something unreal - but they had style and sass and they were a crime movie, which is exactly what what do you want). or quickly accelerated adventures (again all the great noirs seem to burn like a cigarette). Big noirs create an environment and just inhabit them with characters for a few hours. <br /> <br /> After Dark My Sweet, let's do it - and that will allow you to enjoy the company of very interesting and complex characters. Uncle Bud and Collie are intriguing - never letting the audience know what really turns them on - and Patric and Dern (by the way, Bruce Dern) are perfect, especially Dern (see previous commentary). They take the basic outlines of characters and give them depth and arouse our sympathies. <br /> <br /> The story itself is interesting as well. There are better threads in the noir world (almost no secret here - mainly this tension), but this one is solid. If anything, just a "good" plot has more to do with writing Jim Thompson than anything else. With Thompson, the story is almost secondary; he avoided the labyrinthine stories of Hammett and Chandler about simpler tales with stronger, more confused characters. Look at a novel like The Killer Inside Me and you'll see immediately (from title) what it's all about. As for Thompson, that's not the point, it's just that (quoting Roger Ebert). So, the relatively simple thread of kidnapping is not the most important, and if you do not like it, it's a joke on you. <br /> <br /> Why is this an 8-star film instead of a 10-something movie because of female advantage. She is not bad, per se, but there is Angelning Huston and Anette benning (see Jim Thompson's The Grifters adaptation, if you do not know what I'm talking about - besides it's a better movie and you should start a modern noir there) - it's the best from the 90s. and Blood Simple challenges for the best title from Chinatown). She just does not have chops (nor does it look like that) and although she and Patric have some chemistry, I do not have it with me. So there.
