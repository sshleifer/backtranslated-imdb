What can I say, except that these people are great in every respect. I like Sharon McEeda, I like this clean Nostalgic series and I have a packed 9 CDs of 30 episodes, I did not realize that they did so much, I also think it's a great shame they did not do more. I regret that I did not receive these powers, Imagine that somewhere I was knocked out of my cycle, and I was knocked out, and then I wake up in a special hospital. Later I discover that my body has been improved. Like Richard Barrat. These stories are 50 minutes of pure action and tension all the time. You can not fight these three people because they would defeat you in all forms of weapons. Music is well written, and for me in my mind there is a wonderful picture of 3 super beings. The kind of power that masters have is the same as our home dog or cats, better eyesight, better hearing and touch. and the strength of 10 men for Richard and Craig and the strength of 3 women for Sharon. Who thought I was beautiful and intelligent. When I was a boy, I was in love with her !!!! Now I see why on my DVD set. The box is very nice and contains a free brochure about the series. I also thought that Trymane is a good boss, a company, but he did it all!
