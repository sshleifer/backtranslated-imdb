This is one of those westerns who, well, stands almost alone in the unwavering quality of his dialogue. Very few can stand it in the long run. Having said that, the rest is quite bad. Nevertheless, I give him eight, because there is no other western with such a consistently good dialogue, except maybe The Wild Bunch, Junior Bonner and maybe a few more. <br /> <br /> It is full of weakness, John Drew Barrimore the most glaring. However, it has one really unforgettable scene. Nothing special. It's just after Kid Wichita kills the sheriff and goes to Jack Elams, trying to make him fight. Wonderful things. With the best in every western style.
