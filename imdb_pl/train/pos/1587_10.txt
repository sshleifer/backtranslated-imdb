Does anyone know where I can see episodes of season 4 on the Internet that I can see or download? Because I would die to see them, and here in Germany it will not be shown on television. Please help me. I want to see the episodes of season 4 badly. I've seen episode 4 and episode 18 on YouTube. But I could not find more episodes of season 4. Is there a page where I can see episodes? Because I read a few comments on forums from Germany and there were people who had already seen episodes of season 4, although they were not shown on TV in Germany. I'm happy with all the information I can get. Thanks Kate
