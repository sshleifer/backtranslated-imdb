When I rented this movie, I thought I would see a horror movie. However, in this typically secret drama of the seventies, directed by the strange James T. Flocker, there is little horror. Good looking Matt Boston carries a picture with its great performance, and the typical weird atmosphere of Flocker movies is ubiquitous.
