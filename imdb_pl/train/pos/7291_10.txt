When you usually watch a short movie, you're always afraid that the person making the movie is trying to throw in too much. This is not the case with this. A great story about a young girl who has enough and other earthly strengths, trying to help in improving the situation. <br /> <br /> Eric Etebari does a wonderful job of representing the spirit of twisted justice and helps convey the complexity of a vague line of right and wrong. <br /> <br /> Both the young girl and the father are giving great performances in this great short film, but Eric's performance is definitely a show thief in this story. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie because of its complexity, performance and great history.
