This movie was not only better than the entire last season of H: LOTS. But it was better than any movie made for TV I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> Looking at the "Top 250" I see that only one small movie film made it: How the Grinch Stole Christmas. I think the time has come to increase this group to 2. <br /> <br /> I admit that the original series had several shows that were better than this, but it did not bother me. I just LOVED the opportunity to re-enter the world of the Baltimore homicide unit!
