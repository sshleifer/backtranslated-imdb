Ok, at the beginning it looked like "Shrek" - a loner, who is constantly accompanied by a comic relief. Then it evolves into something really fascinating because the glove is set. The result is a nice movie in which I agree that they are too dramatic for children to watch (for example, Manny's past). The premise, of course, worked for a long time, thanks to which they can be successful in creating a movie set with almost no sets (only ice caps and rocks) and three characters. It is good to know that they manage to do something emotional. As I said, sometimes you can tear your tears, so, children, warn me. Animation is a real disappointment. It was not as embellished as the feature films or shrek, and it shows. People are unrealistic and we have seen better examples of CGI. But do not let it sound like a record: as a solo effort, the "Ice Age" is commendable. And it will gather many fans, I have no doubt. Oh, yes, the moments with this little mouse are priceless and they steal.
