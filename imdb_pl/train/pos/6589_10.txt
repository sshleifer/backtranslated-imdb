I loved this program from the first broadcast and I always expected to watch each episode every week. The plot, characters, writing, special affects were unique! Then the science-fiction channel got screwed up again and canceled a very funny, well-written program. I say, bring it back, I know all the actors will come back. I would suggest buying a DVD, I am. I hope that science-fiction channel managers will learn about these comments and realize that they must be more involved in their viewers. I now watch only one program on this channel (ghost hunters), but I'm pretty sure that they will cancel it soon.
