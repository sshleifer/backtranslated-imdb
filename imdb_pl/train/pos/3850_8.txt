This is the last film in Dutch, which Paul Verhoeven made before mainstream Hollywood movies "Basic Instinct", "Robocop" and "Total Recall". Sets the scene, opening the story with a black spider that catches the prey in its network before we meet Gerard Reve, an annoying egocentric writer with a morbid imagination. Gerard was invited to a guest speaker for a meeting at the Literary Club in a seaside town about an hour from Amsterdam. Verhoeven allows us to see how Gerard's imagination distorts reality. Asked if the writers are somewhat close to madness, he admits when he reads the newspaper "and says" boom ", I read" doom "when he says" flood ", I read" blood "when he says" red "I see" dead ". "" When he tells a story enough, he begins to believe it; "I lie to the truth." He accepts the offer to become a night guest of the Club treasurer, a beautiful rich salon owner. When she meets her and finds out that her husband is dead, she begins to imagine that she is a "black widow". Is it more a reality that distorts him or is he a murderess? This is a psychological drama. When telling which of the old movies stuck in my mind, I thought it was my favorite sex. It seems that his work is also Paul Verhoeven and is a master who makes us question our own understanding of reality. It's a nice change of pace from the usual Hollywood tariff. I saw it in 1983 and it is a movie that got stuck.
