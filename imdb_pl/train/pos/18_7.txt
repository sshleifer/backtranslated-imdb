"Stanley and Iris" is a film warming the heart about two people who find each other and help each other overcome life's problems. Stanley's life is difficult because he never learned to read or write. Iris is a widower with two teenage children working in a bakery, where he meets Stanley. He decides to teach Stanley how to read in her home in her free time. In time, they become romantically involved. After Stanley learns to read, he goes to a good job in Chicago just to get back to Iris and ask her to marry him. <br /> <br /> It's really a good movie without nudity, violence and profanity, which is rare in today's movies. A good movie all around. <br /> <br />
