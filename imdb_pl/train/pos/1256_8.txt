It is a very dramatic and full of tension film. There are many threads and phrases. The story or director opens question marks on the death row or alleged crimes committed by black people. This film is very well directed by Arne Glimcher, and the great sound of James Newton Howard is perfect. Good results from Sean Connery and Ed Harris. If you like it, do not miss "TRUE CRIMES" or "THE HURRICANE". My wife and I gave 8/10.
