What can you say when you see a good French movie that tries to draw a taut tale in accordance with the social background of the characters? The most important thing is that we believe in these characters, and when they get to know each other, we want them to stay together. It is simple and very efficient. Background history is less important. Why is the script appearing on the side of a half-developed thriller? This helps not get stuck in the social demonstrations that most French madmen like to do. Not too much ambition, right: Sur mes l√®vres is just a funny French movie with good characteristics. <br /> <br /> For all the wise noir points in the end scenario, the end is definitely too easy. It is as simple as in the Rear window (obvious reference and definitely not a noir movie), but with a less convincing context. Where I am amazed, I see that the curator's figure has not been erased. It brings very little to history; when it appears alone, we wonder if we have not missed any part before. Jacques Audiard is not yet a novice. Strange and strange.
