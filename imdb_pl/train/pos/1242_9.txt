I love this movie. It is well written and played, has good photos. The story combines action, humor, mysticism and tenderness with great sets and beautiful shots. See it, buy it, show it to your friends. <br /> <br /> Acting is good, and Murphy does a great job of presenting a reluctant / unlikely hero. I liked all the characters and it turned out that they were interesting and well developed thanks to dynamic interactions. <br /> <br /> I took care of what happened to these people and although the result was quite predictable (good people win, the hero gets an amazingly attractive girl and the holy child saves lives - who can not see that coming?), I was still happy when everything ended well. Thank God, the dignity of this film has never been ruined by nonsense continuation. Grab the popcorn, cuddle on the sofa and watch this funny, cheerful and funny movie.
