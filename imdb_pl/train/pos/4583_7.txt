I saw it on a Cantonese VCD with English subtitles. I thought that this story was good, but there were situations in which some of the sub-units were grossly exaggerated. It got the movie, as did the rather poor musical score that really irritated me throughout the film. If the musical score improved, I could overlook a few exaggerated scenes. Then the movie would be much better.
