After growing up on the sandy streets of Detroit, MI and having friends who traveled to New York, I fell into a lifestyle as a member of the House. I joined the House of Theieves. We've adapted the same rules as most homes, but we were professional fraudsters who would increase and commit credit card fraud to get the great jewels and clothes we needed. I even learned how to make checks and driving licenses, and pay them out in more than seventeen states, until the jealous queen calls me from the secret service and I go to the federal prison. But I've learned a lot of these queens in this movie and I recommend that you look at it yourself. You can even read about how I grew up in Detroit homes and about the criminal activities in which we found ourselves. My book, Identity Programs, is available for sale at Amazon dot com or on Identity Schemes dot com. But believe me, it's much better than Paris Burning, because it's a brand from 2005.
