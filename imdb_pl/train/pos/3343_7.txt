My daughter is really angry at me when I talk about Drew Barrymore, as if she was struck in the face with a pan, not to mention her chin Dudley Dooright, for which Jay Leno would die. How wonderful, when I discovered in "Fever Pitch" that I really like Miss Barrymore; and Jimmy Fallon; and Red Sox; and Boston! This film is probably best characterized as a sweet, light comedy. To be absolutely stereotypical, girls will like the movie because of his romantic charm and the sensitivity of Jimmy Fallon, and the boys will love this masculine relationship and the image of sports mania. <br /> <br /> My sports hatred My wife, my teenage daughter and we all found something that we liked about the movie. It speaks in itself. It's a nice way to spend about one and a half hours and it's probably a really good date.
