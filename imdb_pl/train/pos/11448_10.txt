For the first time I saw this absolutely thrilling documentary in its first release in 2001 and really influenced me so much that I overheard some of my friends to see me with me during the next screenings. The main thing: none of my friends have left disappointed (never!). This stellar movie tells about Scottish conceptual artist Andy Goldsworthy, who creates absolutely beautiful works of art using natural materials (wood, water, flowers, rocks, etc.), to create elements that will eventually return to their natural form (statement in a temporary state everything?). We see how Goldsworthy creates several temporary artworks, as well as some of its long-term installations in major galleries around the world, as well as several tracks in the world of nature. German film director Thomas Riedelsheimer directs, photographs and edits this meditation on the creative process, which is a real treat for both the eye and ear (with an ambient musical score, composed and performed by Fred Frith, whose music is generally acute experimentally / noise guitar textured as well as a capable band of musicians). Although this movie has been available on DVD for several years, if you manage to find a movie highlighting the revival of this amazing movie, look for it for sure (it's easily a movie composed on a big screen, with an efficient sound system to really experience this movie in the right way ). No MPAA rating, but nothing that could offend (unless the birth of a live sheep on the screen is intended to offend or interfere)
