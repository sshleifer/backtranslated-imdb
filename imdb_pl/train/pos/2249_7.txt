I liked watching Brigham Young and found it to be a positive and largely true representation of the LDS faith. I think the remake of this epic journey through the plains would be beneficial because many people today do not know the trials and persecutions that the early Mormon church struggled with. It's an amazing story of strong and devoted people. <br /> <br /> As a member of the Church, the most disturbing aspect of the film (most historical inaccuracies did not bother me) was the portrait of Brigham Young as the one who "consciously cheated" church members to believe that he was called to succeed Joseph as a prophet . Although I understand the dramatic reasons for this plot, it creates the impression that his doubts in this respect are a historical fact, when in fact both Brigham and the majority of church members understood and believed firmly that he was called to lead the church. Brigham consciously did not deceive the saints; rather, he led them with confidence through inspiration. This is important for the Mormons because this is an important aspect of our faith: that God is really speaking to the prophets today and that Brigham Young, like Joseph Smith, was the inspired prophet of God. <br /> <br /> Do you not believe this statement or not, just know that the film does not show exactly what Brigham believed himself.
