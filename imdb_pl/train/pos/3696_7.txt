Although I live in Minnesota, I studied recently in France and came across this bizarre jewel of the film. <br /> <br /> This movie was at least amazing. A creative and unique film, various directors, each of them borrowed something other than their interpretation of love in the City of Light. The first instinct is to try to match each of these little stories to the overall story, which can be done with Love Actually from 2003. This attempt, however, makes the magic of each segment obsolete. Given that each of the short episodes is treated as an individual movie, love stories together tell a beautiful message. <br /> <br /> The movie is sometimes surprisingly strange - often confusing - and each individual segment can be difficult to follow. However, for an observer who pays particular attention to each of the segments, the short lines of the story become clear after a short time. The confusion is almost intriguing; keeps you on the edge of the seat, waiting for what will come. It leaves the viewer wondering, "Does this really happen?" But at the same time leaves them satisfied that it actually happened. It is a kind of film in which the viewer after leaving the theater can not decide whether he loves him or hates him. The initial reaction is to constantly watch it to see how individual lives merge into a film masterpiece. <br /> <br /> An interesting decision to make a movie in many languages ​​add something to the specter of people who can relate. It adds to the reality of the movie - here, American tourists speak English, Parisian French and so on. The number of people that includes the film leads to an understanding of the international language of love. <br /> <br /> From disease to supernatural, love of parents to love husbands, this film covers all the basics of romantic story. In its beautiful and bizarre way, every unique event in some way fits the story: of all kinds, sizes, nationalities and shapes of love.
