I just saw the Hot Millions on TCM and I forgot this gem completely. Ustinov creates a clever and divisible plot that allows him to cleverly move from two bits to a genius ... Well, you'll see. Maggie Smith is perfect as an inept secretary / neighbor who has a difficult job but has a warm and lively personality that permeates the picture. He creates a great portrait of a warm, witty and real person who in the long run ... well ... <br /> <br /> Molden and Newhart as top executives take up the challenge of being a banal role and letting them come out comic life. <br /> <br /> Robert Morley and Ceasar Romero are just a pleasure to see, and at least in the case of Romero Ustinov, he pulls out a helping hand. <br /> <br /> This movie is supposed to be a retrograde shot in the face of a growing age of computers and this is a problem for the average guy or man, but in reality the characters are so engaging and so funny that they are watching this computer plot is almost lost ... I'm talking almost. <br /> <br /> Leave your usual expectations of modern comedy and look for great performances and friendly, forgiving and deeply engaging storylines in this picture.
