After watching the movie last night, I had the sense of hopelessness that organizations are struggling to solve the problem that the film presents. The scale of prostitution seems so large that it is difficult to understand how it can be overcome without major government changes in Cambodia. <br /> <br /> In any case with a review. <br /> <br /> Although this is a gloomy movie with an uncomfortable, central relationship, which is a very engaging movie, and even I would even say that it is pleasant. The film was well-timed, and Thuy Nguyen's performance was perfect. I also felt Ron Livingston played a very difficult role. <br /> <br /> It would be nice to have some more information about why Patrick feels he must help Holly, but maybe the reason is simple explains the character of Chris Penn. I will not explain it here - go see the movie. <br /> <br /> It's a good, thought-provoking movie with clearly good intentions. I hope that it will get a wide enough edition to reach a decent group of recipients and get more support for the K-11 project.
