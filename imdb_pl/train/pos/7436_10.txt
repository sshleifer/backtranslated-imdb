This filmed presentation of "Rime of the Ancient Mariner" is the most beautiful and interesting version of Coleridge's haunting poem. Striking pictures, combined with a collection of two centuries of efforts to illustrate the epic poem of 1798. Through world-renowned artists and the excellent narrative of Michael Redgrave, they are very much worth the time to see this excellent visual work. <br /> <br /> In the era of television, such work is an invaluable tool to encourage both young students and adults to discover and learn the value of great poetry. To the best of my knowledge, this type of work is rare; it is regrettable. As a world literature student and as a former college professor and academic advisor, I feel that more wonderful epic poems, such as Coleridge's "Rime of the Ancient Mariner", should be so "translated." Although I am not a film critic, but as an avid reader of classical literature, I am pleased to recommend this excellent production without any reservations.
