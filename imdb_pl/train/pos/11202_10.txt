At first, I thought that the Ring would be more than a normal movie with an ordinary story. How surprised I was! Of course, the plot is simple - one girl is in love with two men - but Hitchcock brings it to us on a silver plate, with laughter and fear, with compassion and anguish. The way it presents the popular crowds of the fair, the attraction of the girl to both men, the tragic elements that connect with the techniques that open the mind to most of his biggest films (North through North West, Lina, etc.). The master did it well even before the age of 30!
