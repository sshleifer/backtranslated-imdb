This movie is really FUNNY! If you want to rest your brain for an hour, go and see. This is called blonde and blonde, so do not expect deep and significant jokes. What is this movie and enjoy all the stereotypes we have about two blondes. It's just a fun movie to watch on a date or in the company of friends (especially if you're not too sober.) Lol) Pamela and Denise are still good. It is a mistake to judge this film as a work of art. Come on, this movie is about BLONDES! It's supposed to be light, fun and superficial. One more thing, I do not think the girls will appreciate and like this movie, but the guy will definitely do it.
