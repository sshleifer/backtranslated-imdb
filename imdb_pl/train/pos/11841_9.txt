It was a great movie with a good story. My children (10, 7, 5 and 4) loved this movie, including me. The music was also fantastic. No, horses do not talk, but the story is told by the Spirit. And hear the story told by the horse if the view was nice. <br /> <br /> I think the title says everything "ghost." This movie really gives a sense of family, home and friends. I would have to say that my 4-year-old boy and 5-year-old girl were really touched by this film, and even so engaged, laughed so much, and finally cheered for the spirit. <br /> <br /> Enjoy "Spirit" with your family and let your spirit rise thanks to this passionate story. Your children will love it. I think you too.
