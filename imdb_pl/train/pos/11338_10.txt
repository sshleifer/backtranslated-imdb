I saw it in "Dances with Films" and it was amazing. I really felt like Jake. Talk about adding insults to injuries! Your parents are not only divorcing themselves, but a monster is behind you. <br /> <br /> It was both cordial and frightening - there were a few moments when the audience was shouting with real fear. It reminded me of a little Japanese horror, except that the story was really good. <br /> <br /> And that's what separated "Jake's Closet" from an ordinary movie pabulum - a great scenario with attractive characters. In addition, combining elements of horror with family drama, the film draws from the best of both species, and avoids the stereotypes of both. <br /> <br /> If he does not show up in cinemas, definitely get a DVD.
