I waited for this film to come out for a while in Canada, and when it finally did, I was very excited to see it. I really liked it. Of course, at the beginning it is a very sad movie (and it was the New Year - which makes it even sadder) - but it sticks to you. The next day I thought about it again, because although it revolves around something so emotionally exhausting, after a few days you realize that it is such a beautiful story. As one person can be seen as a link to so many people, but sometimes you can blind so many things. And how Diane Keaton's character saves the rest, just being there. And how they save her in this process. It was a great movie, and Chris Pine (one of my favorite actors) provides excellent comic relief. This is definitely a movie that will require a box of tissues, but it will definitely stay with you for a long time.
