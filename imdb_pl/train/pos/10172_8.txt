"Rumors" Friz Frelenga is an excellent private cartoon Snafu, which warns against the spread of rumors causing panic during the war. Produced, like all Snafu shorts, which are to be shown to the military audience as entertainment instructional videos, Rumors are extremely ingenious and drive a lot of ideas into a very short life span. When Snafu begins to gossip about a bomb blast, it turns into a rumor that America lost the war. It is exquisitely illustrated with a long, rubbery piece of honey and a few strange, fictional creatures that come back to visit Snafu with more and more terrible news about the army of their country. "Rumors" are ingenious, fast and funny, and all this is outshinned by the "do not explore the army" message. Is one of the best Private Snafu shorts.
