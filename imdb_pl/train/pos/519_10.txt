I saw this movie for the first time about 20 years ago and I never forgot it. It's beautifully filmed, and history stays on all the time. It is hard to believe that it was done in 1946, because the story is still fresh and really makes you think. I do not know about film technique, but the special effects in this movie are great considering what has been done. In addition, acting is great, and the use of English and American actors is quite amazing. I recently bought a DVD, so now I can watch whenever I want. I highly recommend anyone who is interested in post-war British films to watch it.
