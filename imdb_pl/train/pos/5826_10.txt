I remember when I saw this short movie for the first time, I really laughed so much that, as with many other films that I saw, no sound came out! Curly is really great in "singing" the opera in this song, I'm surprised he did not consider the singer's career because he was really good! <br /> <br /> If you noticed that the movie was shot at the end of Curly's career as Stooge, you can really say that he changed because he lost weight and was thinner, his voice deepened, his face was lined with wrinkles although he could still download it, he looked fifty at the age of forty. It happened because he suffered a lot of small strokes before his great, which ended his career. Nevertheless, he managed to do it in the last! <br /> <br /> If you do not mind the fact that Curly really was very sick at the moment, it's actually one of their funniest shorts. I know it did not bother me that Curly is really changing because I still thought he was great! <br /> <br /> 10/10
