A bet between Edgar Allen Poe and a journalist begins ... Poe bets that a man can not spend all night in a terrifying castle. Of course he can, but will he come out unscathed? It's hard to tell all those strange people who should not be wandering around here, including the ice-cold Barbara Steele. This is a rather strange movie in which the presentation is in both French and English, and switches back and forth several times. Perhaps this is because parts of the dialogue have been lost? It is also quite dark and claustrophobic, because you can not see too much outside the small circle of light, which candles and such generate, and the feeling of horror and approaching fate almost always. This version (in Synapse) is also uncensored and I wondered what could be censored in the 1964 film, until I saw the topless scene, I think so. In general, it is quite good and dark black and white. Barbara Steele also definitely creates a movie. 8 out of 10.
