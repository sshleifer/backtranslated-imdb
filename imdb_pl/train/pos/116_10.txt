Man, man ... I stupidly delayed (this is not the right term, there is a long list!), To watch this movie and finally I had the opportunity to do it. And the "news" is: A wonderful, labyrinth spectacle! <br /> <br /> For every "imitator" of Von Trier: both Rigets, Element of Crime, Dogville, Dancer in The Dark, The Five Obstructions, etc. Europe is probably the difference for its size in visual terms. Everything is beautifully bleak and claustrophobic! You really feel like you are in this "imagined" time-lord. Taking into account the masters of the surreal cinema, such as Bunuel, Bergman, up to the 40's noir movies with acid drops of avant-garde Vona Trier, he leads the film art scene as a "well-planned totalitarian" filmmaker. His authoritarian way of dealing with very intricate problems, without being irrational, strikes the viewer's nerves with the intention of curing some of the deepest wounds we feed in our hypocritical world. <br /> <br /> Just like a utopian one, I believe that people like Von Trier can help society in many ways in a wider sense. Daily films and filmmakers who carry this kind of power are no longer needed as a tool for reflection, perhaps this may be the beginning of a new era: "The age of emotional control over our fears." This is what he constantly offers us in his work. <br /> <br /> Bravo!
