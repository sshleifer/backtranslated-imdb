"Kolchak" was a TV series that really did not fit into any category. Part of horror, comedy, social consciousness, and what we have is something that people are not ready for. It's a pity, because I started watching these programs on the Chiller network (I've never seen the originals), I realized how different and interesting it really is. <br /> <br /> Starring Darren Mcgavin as a reporter columnist for the International News Service, and Simon Oakland as his always-evil boss, Tony Vincenzo, the show followed the exploits of a Chicago reporter, who increasingly became part of the story in person because he searched the windy city for modern creeps that hit the night. The basic charm of Macgavin really distinguishes this show. A slightly stupid guy who always wears the same suit, you can not help him, but you love him. His jokes are great, and between him and the skeptical editor, Oakland, they are simply funny. <br /> <br /> Stories are mostly good and acting is very good. The seventies were not a * great * period for special effects, and the show suffers because of it, but if you suspend disbelief, then you have a funny series that has overtaken its time.
