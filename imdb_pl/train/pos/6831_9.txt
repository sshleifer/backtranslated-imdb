I only know about one other film that could compete with Bergman's "Opening" and "Persona"; Both films are simply amazing, they have a wealth of ideas that are difficult to capture at first glance. We have a deep meditation on the relationship between art and life as one actress, Myrtle Gordon (Gena Rowlands), who is more in touch with the character she plays on the stage than she would like. Accidental death of one of her fans, a young girl who declares her love for Myrtle, and then is hit by a car, leaves the actress a deep trace. He begins to ask himself the question about her aging, which begins to affect her, until the only solution becomes alcohol. But that does not help much, and Myrtle is a step away from total madness. The scene in which he kills the imagined (or not) ghost of a dead girl is one of the most exciting scenes I found in Cassavets. The film ends with a show of genius on behalf of the director who is shooting a theater scene in which he and Gena Rowlands improvise the scene because Myrtle comes too drunk for the premiere to do his part exactly. This scene has been filmed spontaneously, with a live audience, laughter is real, chemistry between Casavates and Rowlands is amazing. If you liked Persona or you're interested in a movie that offers meaningful ideas alongside great entertainment, this movie will suit you.
