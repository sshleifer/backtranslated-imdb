Although initially I was reluctant to jump into the fashion of watching "Lost", I accidently caught one episode at the beginning of season 1 - the one with a polar bear - and since then I have my undivided attention. It means. Not a polar bear. So with me (heh) with me, while I'm throwing away so many wandering, semi-consistent praise, as soon as I can get. <br /> <br /> "Lost" takes a simple idea of ​​a passenger flight full of people crashing over the desert island and gradually adds an extraordinary depth to its premise, exploring each character deeply and unwaveringly - what drives them, who are they? Where did they come from? It soon becomes clear that the island where they are located acts as a common denominator of many things in their lives, regardless of whether they flee from something (including Sawyer and Kate) or make contact with spirituality (Locke, Claire). But "Lost" also brings the island itself and the mysterious horrors that are in it ... and they all seem strangely connected. <br /> <br /> While television actors are not exactly known for their subtlety or dazzling acting skills, most of the cast of "The Lost" are in fact spectacular actors in their parts, projection of heart and humor in their performances. There are also a lot of glasses, but in general it's not a plastic type of Hollywood, like most TV shows. All characters feel very real and are extremely attractive to watch. Their interactions rarely fall prey to predictable happiness, small arguments or a tacky melodrama (though they are annoyingly mysterious)? these people, above all, try to survive and regardless of what relationship appears, they are treated as secondary to the action. The realism of these characters facilitates a well-sculpted plot. <br /> <br /> About this thread ... Imagine a tree as a template chart, then branches as sub-threads (in this case one branch for each character) ?? Well, Lost adds twigs to each branch, then small twigs to these twigs, like other lines of the story. If you are the brother / sister of one of the main characters of retrospection, you will get your own storyline. If you are a DOG, you will have your own story. Until the writers manage to merge them into one glorious climax in the end, they arise. I am more than a little sorry that there will be some disappointing performance at this concert, as I'm sure most people are. <br /> <br /> But assuming that the writers are downloading, "Lost" is probably the best concert ever to hit television. <br /> <br /> 9/10
