The romance of the film, which is also its main motif, is good and nicely presented. However, the surrounding of the love story is too lyrical, graphic and unrealistic. What's worse, the psychology of the main character is strange and incomprehensible, just like the end of the movie. Do not hesitate to watch this movie if you're interested in it, but do not expect too much.
