I'm going to go all out and defend "Shades of Gray" as a good show episode, which delved into the life and death of Commander William Thomas Riker, who fought a mortally deadly disease. > <br /> The scenes from the flashback sequences were well implemented in the mood in which Riker played, for example when he experienced his romantic episodes, such as "11001001", "Angel One" and "Up the Long Ladder". It highlights the tragic moments, such as Tasha's death in "Skin of Evil", as well as the elements of a pulsating danger in "Heart of Glory", "Conspiracy" and the previously mentioned "Skin of Evil". Riker also showed courage, telling joking jokes, such as: "My ancestor was once bitten by a rattlesnake ... after 3 days of intense pain, the snake died." This episode underlines the psychological torture of Will Riker under extreme compulsion. And, YES, in my opinion, I am biased in proclaiming "shades of gray" as a solid episode, because during my original broadcasting my face was covered with sweat, wondering if Riker would take it alive and alive to see other great galactic adventures in outer space outside of borders ... <br /> <br /> Of course, in the years to come, I think I have formed a strange opinion about this particular episode ... but if the award should be awarded to "the best episode of the music video in the history of television", so I think this episode should be highly rated in this respect.
