Many reviewers have noted that Pinjar is not like a series of films produced in Bollywood. Although this is true, Bollywood films are generally geared towards a particular audience and should be appreciated for achieving their goals in this regard. <br /> <br /> However, Pinjar is a great movie for those looking for a change from a normal movie based on the Bollywood equation. Set at the time of the division between India and Pakistan, Pinjar focuses on a girl from Punjabi who becomes a victim of social and cultural attitudes towards the treatment of women in her time. Paro, the protagonist, is forced to choose between life and the man who kidnapped her, and Punjab ruled the passing hope of life with his family in India. More than a question of Hindus and Muslims, Pinjar defines and defines the role of women as a daughter, wife and mother in India and Pakistan in 1947. Unlike typical Bollywood films that are escapist in nature, Pinjar is a movie that makes his audience contemplate on these issues during and after the film.
