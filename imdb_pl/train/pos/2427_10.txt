It's a really great unknown movie. Perfect dialogue without typical clich√©s. This movie was based on the actor's talent and was broken. He even had a bit of comedy, but he was not exaggerated. this is what a crime drama should be, not the typical special phenomena that affect rubbish with thrown sex. I especially liked the interracial aspects of it all. <br /> <br /> Now for the actors themselves. Laurence Fishburne was excellent in the career of a small criminal. It is a pity that he can show his talent in his own film. Titus Welliver was fantastic as a Fishburne half-junk lynx. Eamonn Walker added the taste to the perfectly seasoned movie. Paul Calderon was perfect as a fat monkey / drug lord. I loved his game from the times of "King of New York". But the best acting in this movie comes from Gregory Hines and Michael Paul Chan, who were perfectly matched as two of Calderon's followers. <br /> <br /> Once in a lifetime is definitely the owner. **** 1/2 * from *****.
