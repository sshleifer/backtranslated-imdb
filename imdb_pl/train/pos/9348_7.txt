We have a situation here. It was found that a man is in danger and people want to help him - in different ways. In the end, they are forced to leave. You can not fix people. And although Reign Over Me is traditionally Hollywood in different aspects, this message is not. <br /> <br /> This story does not apply to Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler), a man who lost his wife and three daughters at the age of 9/11, who went into a nearly psychotic PTSS. It's about what Charlie does to Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle), a dentist in New York who was his roommate at the dental school and knowing about his tragedy, notes him on the street and re-establishes a connection. Charlie rides a small, motorized scooter - a fairly fancy device to negotiate traffic in Manhattan - with large headphones on a mass of unruly hair. Hair is the main prop of Sandler to show that he is mad. And the use of music as an escape must hit any of the iPod-equipped metro players. <br /> <br /> Charlie is a disaster, but paradoxically Alan, stuck with his controlling wife (Jada Pinkett Smith), soon begins to envy him. Charlie lives like a skinny young man with a huge trust fund (money from the tragedy insurance) and starts to draw Alan to "spend time", "eat Chinese", buy records or watch Mel Brooks marathon in the repository. Charlie lives in a nice big apartment sheltered by the average housekeeper, constantly changing the kitchen, picking up an old Springsteen vinyl, Who, etc., and playing a video game called Shadow of the Collosus on a big screen in a huge empty living room. <br /> <br /> Charlie's in-laws are deeply concerned about him, but also somehow offended, as we later learn. Alan has a new patient who offers him. Charlie's desperation makes us see Alan. Trying to help Charlie partly allows Alan to escape from his own stifling reality, but partly only makes him more aware of them. <br /> <br /> Cheadle and Sandler make up a strange pair, but it does not matter, because it's convincing that they both need each other. Charlie desperately wants a friend who has never known his family because he never pretends to lose him. And what if, as a roommate Charlie, he slept naked, and the dream was going and he had a horrible musical taste (no Motown)? Alan wants to get away from his neat, devastating life. He is under the thumb of not only his wife, but also the dental partners who rule over him, although he established the practice. By the way, they are white and black. <br /> <br /> There is also a voluptuous patient from hell who seriously disrupts things in dental offices, but begins to look different when Charlie comes and notices that he is a child. His libido seems to lurk at any moment readiness to revive. He also draws Liv Tyler's breasts, a psychotherapist in the same building as the dentists who start to heal Charlie when he admits he may need help. <br /> <br /> Sandler's furious scenes are a bit too theatrical, as are many plot devices (in fact this movie seems to be a game at more than one point), but he has several monologues in which he expresses his sadness in a deep way. moving. <br /> <br /> Charlie's not only delusional and sad, but dangerous and violent, and all these efforts to help him turn his back. The film is admirable in the way it communicates the feeling that people can not do good. This is an interesting movie - sometimes moving - and for the first time 9/11 has been resolved in terms of the suffering of the survivor. But there is an element of comedy that sometimes seems to be tasteless, many people are too broadly drawn, and too much Hollywood interiors have a terrible decor; only the streets of Manhattan look real. There is a theater scene that is ridiculous, and Donald Sutherland is a judge who is too good to be true. The Alan family problem is solved too easily on the phone. And yet it's worth watching the acting - control and subtlety of Cheadle, and Sandler in a serious role almost as good as in P.T. Anderson's Punch-Drunk Love from 2002, although it is definitely a better movie, in fact it is much better.
