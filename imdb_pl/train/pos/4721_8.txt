The sad story of the downed pilot B-17. Brady is shot down in occupied territory. The local farmers raised his kindness and protection at the expense of their own lives. I have never heard about this film and it has attacked me for two hours. After the movie, I'm happy that I spent some time. This is the whole story to explain Brady's face at the beginning of the movie.
