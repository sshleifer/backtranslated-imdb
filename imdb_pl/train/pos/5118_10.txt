******** Spoilery - Ostro≈ºny ********* <br /> <br /> What can I say? I am biased when it comes to Urban Cowboy. I love it and have watched it countless times - and I usually find something new in them every time I watch it. <br /> <br /> I think one of the things I like about it is that Urban Cowboy is about people from the working class, not rich people who live in LA or New York. That's true, with the exception of Pam. <br /> <br /> Travolta plays Buda, a small boy from Texas, who moves to Houston to work in the oil fields. And then Travolta played in good dramatic movies, such as Saturday Night Fever, instead of playing stereotypical bad / good guys in big budget movies. It's a really good movie - a competition for mechanical bulls and a two-stage dance can be silly, but you must enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Bud meets Sissy (played by Deer Winger with a slutty glow) - and soon after they are married and live in their dream trailer. But their relationship becomes a real gender struggle. Bud wants to be a real cowboy. Sissy wants to be with a real cowboy. But nowadays the roles of men are not so clear. Where can Bud prove he is a real man? He can do his dangerous work during the day and ride at night on a mechanical bull - he can be an "urban cowboy". But Sissy wants to drive his pick-up and wants to ride a mechanical bull. So where does Bud leave it? Since Sissy claims to be independent, she lies about bull riding and flirts with a former prison star and a prison rodeo - a real bull - Wes (played wonderfully grossly by Scott Glenn). Bud is in danger, and Bud and Sissy break up. <br /> <br /> Sissy breaks up with Wes, who uses her. Going further, Bud becomes the boy's toy Pam, a rich girl whose dad is in oil and that means everything. Sissy comes with a trailer to clean her up - Pam does not do this kind of thing. He writes a make-up letter to Bud, but the evil Pam pulls him out and takes credit for Sissy's homework. <br /> <br /> Uncle Bob Bud dies tragically at work when lightning strikes and causes an explosion. Bud and Sissy have a chance for reconciliation, but they are too stubborn. Later, the bullfighting competition takes place in Gilley and you know Bud will win. Pam realizes that Bud does not love her, but Sissy - he did it for her. Wes is trying to rob Gilleys, but do not you know that the urban cowboy, Bud, saves the day and recovers the woman he loves. <br /> <br /> Of course you can ask why Bud and Sissy will go to Gilleys every night and "live like pigs". Maybe it contributed to their bad marriage. Or why Bud did not stay with Pam - she was not so bad and had money. Or why they had to kill Uncle Bob. Or why Bud and Sissy had such stupid friends as Marshall and Jessie, who always tried to smash them: Marshall says to Bud: "She {Sissy} rides this bull better than you!" But some of the fun with Urban Cowboy mocks this a bit - and saying it's not Bonnie Raitt on stage!
