Great actors, actress nominated for an Oscar, stunning scenery, good, strong plot and more laughter than you can fit in my new purse (and quite a lot). This movie was brilliant. He played beautifully in more serious scenes, and the moments were fun. .well, lateral division. I have never heard that the audience of the cinema laughed so much, and tears ran down my cheeks during "stoned ladies on the stage of a teahouse". Well done for the British film industry and Craig Ferguson, whose magical ingredients have made it one of my favorite films of the year, if not all time.
