Mobile suits that can destroy whole armies - check! A weapon that almost does not have to be aimed and continues to annihilate everything - Check! Angel-based mobile suits - Check! <br /> <br /> OK - this is the Gundam series. This, Gundam Wing, has a good character development, complexity of the real world, interesting ideas and some sweets. <br /> <br /> With characters, the initially weak Relena Dorlan (later Peacecraft, then back to Dorlan) becomes stronger and more independent (although he is still besieged by Heero Yuy, the main character of the series). The mentioned Heero, initially a cold, hard butcher, becomes more and more human and at the same time remains in character. And seeing how the lost Millardo Peacecraft (which is Zechs Marquise) flows between OZ, freelancer and command White Fang shows how some people can really lose themselves in their creations. the political and military situation is also quite good - it reflects how the real world works. However, in 49 half-hour episodes it becomes a bit responsible, because this complexity is not fully used. <br /> <br /> The ideas underlying the series - the necessity of struggle, the desire for peace, etc. - are those that resonate even today. In retrospect, the series was ahead of its time, with the "war on terrorism" and everything. But exploration of these ideas, monologues, especially Treize Kushrenada, is an amazing dramatic work, creating some of the best works in the series. <br /> <br /> But sometimes good writing is sometimes very poor, which dramatically causes him to lose some of his advantage. <br /> <br /> When it comes to sweets, this is what it has in bucket loads, everything from mobile suits to Libra battleship (no tampons you idiot!) is well designed and explodes with large balls of oranges (which is bad, because better animation would have better explosions). But who cares ?! Things explode and it all counts. <br /> <br /> In short, the mere complexity of the series means that if you miss a few episodes, you have lost a lot. Poor writing can irritate you, and sometimes the animation will make you go "WTF?!?!" However, it is composed in a classic style of animation, its scale, sparks of amazing dialogue and more mature exploration, which is expected from such Japanese animations.
