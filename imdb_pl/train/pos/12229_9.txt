For me, there is something so attractive and nostalgic about low-cost science fiction. As a child in the 1950s, it was all. In 1957, I saw "The First Man Into Space" in the cinema with my dad. Marshall Thompson and other poor slob performed, which received the title role. It is also about a bad space mission in which the astronaut turns into a grizzly killer. I scared Good and Lots from me. The memory of these miserable hymns still lives in me. "Incredible Melting Man" is almost a transformation only in a glorious color ... wherever scenes were well lit. I just love what it is ... ... a little over an hour of darkly lit scenes, disgusting sounds and this amazing music. Bravo!
