Okay, I admit that casting in the movie is REALLY strange - part of it is due to the story, but I still had some trouble believing that Pierce Brosnan is playing on this track (though he did quite a good job). <br /> <br /> It is based on the true story of an Englishman who lived with Canadian Indians at the beginning of the 20th century. He claimed to be a mixed Indian blood. In fact, he was so successful and wondered if people came from different directions to listen to his lectures and take on his wild wanderings - even though he was not a mixed Indian and all his knowledge came from books or fake ones! The film focuses on this and what happened when the fraud was discovered. <br /> <br /> Acting and settings were great and I really liked the movie (once I suspected disbelief about Brosnan). Distribution was not widespread - probably because it was a wise brain - not a Bond movie, or an affair - just a really strange movie about an extraordinary man.
