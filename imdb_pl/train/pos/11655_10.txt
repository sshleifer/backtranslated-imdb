One of them is too many topics avoided in the cinema and eating disorders. This movie shows it as it is. He is not delighted that the viewers can enjoy themselves, he is shown with real truth, which makes him even more powerful. I only saw it once, and it was a few years ago, but I still remember everything about it and how it felt. It is a very strong film and is a good support for anyone who has a eating disorder to give them willpower to stop. This is what films should be about - they should be there to help people and not praise things that are bad.
