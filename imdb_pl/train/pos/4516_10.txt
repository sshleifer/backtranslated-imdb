Since Rita's education, Julie Walters has been one of my role models, and her performance in this role as a woman who helps the man she loves to synchronize with her feminine side is wonderful. I would never believe her character in the hands of a lesser actress, but Walters pulls it out with gusto and panache. Adrian Pasdar has so far given the best performance in the male role.
