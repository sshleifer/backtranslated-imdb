Man, this is a hard disk DVD. I could find him only in Region 2, Spanish import, and it was expensive. <br /> <br /> Was it worth it? Yeah. Not so much, because it is a masterpiece of filming, though directed by Curt Siodmak (subtitles on IMDb.com sound "Robert", but a list of loans on DVD Curt), or because it has some famous characters from other murder puzzles of Elisha Cook, Jr. and Thomas Gomez - but because my ten-year-old curiosity of the movie has finally been met. <br /> <br /> Essentially, a respected but self-sufficient engineer (Alan Curtis) stood by his distant wife and is in a New York bar with two tickets in his pocket. A woman with a strange hat is on a stool next to him and kindly invites her to join the musical review. She accepts, a bit gloomy. Bartender mopey gives them both when they leave. <br /> <br /> During the show, a stormy star notices that this woman in the audience is wearing the same hat and explodes from the stage with anger. The drummer in the band, Cook, looks at the silent lady, but does not get an answer. Curtis takes the woman home and asks her name, but she does not want to give her, and she does not want to know him. If she was a Longfellow admirer, she would say something about the ships that pass by at night. <br /> <br /> Okay, Curtis goes home to find his wife murdered during his absence. Chief police officer, Gomez, returns him to the district prosecutor. His only alibi is that he was with a ghostly lady that no one else remembers - not a bartender, not a Latina star, no taxi driver ("Al Alp"), no drummer - and the woman has disappeared, can not be dug. <br /> <br /> Curtis was convicted and sentenced to death. But Inspector Gomez wondered about it and thought it was probably innocent, because no one with brain would come up with such a stupid story. He joins the loving secretary Curtis, Elli Raines, in an informal investigation into the case. <br /> <br /> They visit the alleged witnesses again. The sinister bartender is run over by the car, perhaps by accident, so he is not in the picture. Enraged Latina walked away because the show had closed and she did not cooperate anyway and did not know the source of the hat. Elisha Cook, Jr., is strangled by a real murderer, but not before he appears in the scene in which he drums drums into an improvised jazz band. His sweaty face takes on an expression that does not suggest intense concentration, but rather a monstrous, orgasmic madness. His eyeballs roll to the ceiling, his mouth opens, his hammer becomes insane. I was laughing loudly. <br /> <br /> No one is outstanding, but they are all professional enough. Thomas Gomez is always reliable. The best performance, however, is probably Franchot Tone. He is a real murderer and he pretends to be an alibi. It is reserved and artistic. Even when he faints, he is nice. I do not know how to put it exactly, but Tone seems to think and just act on his behalf. Alan Curtis as an innocent engineer is close to zero on the Kelvin scale and belongs to the painting B. <br /> <br /> I do not know why it is considered classic. It's really your basic secret to Cornell Woolrich's murder, not as good as some of his others. But Siodmak's direction is sensitive. A man runs up and his hat is curled up in the gutter, and water flows around him. Its use of shadows is quietly effective. <br /> <br /> I'm happy that I have them.
