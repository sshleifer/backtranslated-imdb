A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause), moved to a small town and must deal with a vile teacher (Glenn Shadix), their incestuous relationship, a charming girl (MÃ¤dchen Amick) and one hell a big secret. <br /> <br /> Okay, so technically, it's a bad movie. But who cares? It's very funny! <br /> <br /> It happens with impossible things (with the participation of corn), people go crazy about cats, they are bad one-layered, there is too much cheese to handle! <br /> <br /> Yes, yes. You'll like it. Much. He will not move you, he will not touch you, he will not scare you or excite you in any way, but he will keep you entertained and laugh!
