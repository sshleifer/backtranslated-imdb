William Hurt may no longer be an American idol, but he still has quite good taste in film projects B. Here he plays a specialist for cleaning dangerous waste with a tragic past, tracing the eternal loser on the run - played by a former pretty boy Weller - who has been contaminated with deadly poison. The current pretty boy Hardy Kruger Jr. - probably more handsome than his dad - appears as the arrogant boss of Weller in a terrifying sequence at the chemical production plant that moves history. Natasha McElhone is a somewhat crazy government agent who looks at an incident that provides an inevitable and passionate love interest to the hero of Hurt. Michael Brandon jumps out to play in the slimy type of non-prisoners you can not wait for. The Coca-Cola company wins the Product Placement award for 2000, because the non-alcoholic beverage is presented in the whole production, shot with love on the spot in the winter picture postcard Hungary.
