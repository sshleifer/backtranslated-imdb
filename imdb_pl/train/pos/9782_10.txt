Peaches are a really great movie. I am writing this to refute the review of a person named "Auscrit" who appeared on this site. First of all, the idea that Monahans' first film "The Interview" is somehow TV, is an extraordinary statement. Here is a film that has been highly praised around the world, and also just one of the best Australian films ever made. He fully deserved to win the best photo. Peaches are a courageous, courageous and courageous trip. For me it works on every level, and now I've seen it twice. Monahan is a filmmaker who shows great skills and incredible sensitivity. To "Auscrit" could comment that this is another TV movie, etc. And Hugo Weaving is not good, it just does not "get" the movie. Or in particular, he does not want to get it. Honestly, this is the kind of comment you expect from another filmmaker who is jealous or bitter or both. Or someone from the industry, or distribution, exhibition or bureaucracy. Your average player I found simply does not write such comments. I noticed other comments on the site and references to the Sommersault movie. You have to wonder what people think about. Unfortunately in Australia at the moment when the SS was released, the pressure was that if you did not like it, then there was something wrong with you in the film. This media manipulation is quite common. In fact, the only similarity between the two films is that they are the rights to transition films. Unfortunately for me SS is a movie about nothing, what could be said in 15 minutes. I see it as a one-dimensional movie with anxiety. Peaches versus this masterpiece. Personally, I can not wait for what Monahan does next, because he is clearly ahead of each of his contemporaries when it comes to cinema. In conclusion, if the film does not win everyone at this year's AFI and IF Awards, it is a fake game. As for Auscrit, please find something more constructive in your time
