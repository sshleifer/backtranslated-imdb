Have you ever wondered how far one movie can go? <br /> <br /> Schizophreniac is constantly discovering the world of extremes with Harry Russo. <br /> <br /> Harry is an upset writer, a killer and a crazy drug addict who will stop at nothing to destroy those who stand between him and madness. Guided by the demonic voices of his ventriloquine mannequin, Harry begins the killing killing. <br /> <br /> From director Ron Atkins comes the first part of the worst story ever filmed. <br /> <br /> The only other movie I've seen similar to it would be the second part entitled Schizofreniak Necromaniac <br /> <br /> This is a really low-budget movie and will not be for everyone, but if you're looking for something disturbing, different and frightening, it will be a good choice. <br /> <br /> DO NOT EXPECT LONG AS A MODERN HORROR (such as a scream) <br /> <br /> It is recommended that the viewer be discreet
