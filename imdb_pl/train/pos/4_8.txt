FUTZ is the only program preserved from the experimental theater movement in New York in the 1960s (beginning Off Off Broadway). Although it is not for everyone, it is a truly brilliant, darkly funny, deeply disturbing tale of love, sex, personal freedom and revenge, a serious tale of morality, even more important now that Congress wants to ban gay marriage by destroying our constitution. But history is not about being gay - it's about love and sex that is not in line with social norms and that's why they have to be removed by violence and hatred. At first glance, it tells the story of a man who falls in love with a pig, but like every great fairy tale, it's not about animals, but about something more - suppressing conformism in America. <br /> <br /> The stage version gained international recognition in its original production, toured in the United States and Europe, and together with others it influenced almost the entire theater that came. Fortunately, we have preserved the performance to the extent it was originally created, with the original cast and original director Tom O'Horgan (who also directed HAIR and Jesus Christ Superstar on Broadway). <br /> <br /> This is not a mainstream, easy-to-make studio movie - it's an aggressive, disturbing, glorious, deeply emotional, incredibly fancy piece of story you will never forget. And this can change the perception of the world ...
