I appreciate such films: elegant and well made, funny, absorbing, well-functioning and nicely oriented. Nobody - even Pacino - chews the scenery *, trying to stand out; one of the most effective moments in the film (Aielo stretching on the beloved ramp) is cooling because of his restraint. <br /> <br /> Not as good as, say, QUIZ SHOW, CITY HALL is a similar material: engaging the mind as well as the eye, ear and heart. Why the well-dressed entertainment flots at the box office are something supposed. <br /> <br /> * You know, Pacino is lost in one particular scene, but precisely because it is required. A great scene too.
