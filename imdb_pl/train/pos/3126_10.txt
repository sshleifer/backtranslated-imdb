I do not give ten stars easily. The film really impresses me, and the Bourne Ultimatum goes far beyond that. What's more, this trilogy has merged so nicely that I consider it one of the greatest film trilogies of our time. Although all three films could not be more different from the Ludlum novel, they still represent a powerful turning point in film achievements. Bourne's ultimatum made me want to cry that the series was complete, but I could not stop smiling for hours. <br /> <br /> Since the appearance of the opening title I knew that we are playing a horse. Paul Greengrass did it again. Everything we love from previous Bourne films is here once again: action, dialogue and of course a shaky camera. However, for me the latter has never been a problem. I think it adds tensions. <br /> <br /> I'll be back to see this movie a few times before it's released on DVD, simply because it's brilliant. This is a completely satisfying conclusion and should stand the test of time as a fantastic movie, and in total an unforgettable trilogy.
