I watched it in July and even with a Christmas motive it turned out to be touching and sensitive. It is not for someone with the mind of reality, because it is full of fantasy and beautiful moments that sometimes do not make sense. William Russ did a great job as Hank. I only saw him in the remake of The Long, Hot Summer, where he played a weak character. But in all of this, the expression of his eyes, how Hank thought it was happening to him, was wonderful and tender. Valerie Bertinelli was excellent and charming as usual and very credible in this role. And Peter Falk as Max was great and always made me smile when he appeared in many important scenes. There were many special scenes, including one in which Hank realizes who Max really was. This is not for everyone ..... especially for those who are not in the movies of "well-being" and this is definitely one! If you like everything to be perfect and make sense, avoid it. But I think it's worth watching again, that's why I recorded it. (Yes, some of us still have VCRs :)
