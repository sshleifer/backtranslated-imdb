This is an amazing return of the film's master, Tsui Harka. This is one of several films that deserve a face-to-face meeting with Steven Chow at Shaolin Soccer. Since the beginning of the film, astronomical backgrounds have appeared on each edge, which were <br /> <br /> in perfect style. If you're a science fiction geek or Chinese martial artist, you'll love the excessive amount of 3D effects and realistic computer-generated weapons. There appears a great performance (as always) from Ekin Cheung, who plays "Sky King". He works with Louis Koo (Red), who was very impressed with his flexible "wings" that reflected the oncoming attacks. The fighting movements of these actors were efficient in every respect. Not only the action is great, but it also has a somewhat complex plot. Many critics of this film complain about the lack of a story / theme or simply "pushed into random pieces of debrise", and even described them as "Legend of Poo". However, the viewer can not rely on watching Dragon Ballz and other similar Manga Cartoons to understand this movie. Others who are famous for "Wu Xia" movies will have a better approach. With respect. there may be one weakness that can be predicted. The blow, which was delivered to the enemy on the last battle scene, could be significantly and destructively made. Despite all this, his must see.
