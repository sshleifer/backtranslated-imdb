Recently shown on cable television, the film begins with the renunciation of distance from any cooperation of real people; this in itself is eye-catching. Despite this, the script and acting of the main characters are great, and I was completely absorbed by the whole verve. This is in no way a clear, thoughtful and interesting dialogue. previously composed together and then separated. The film captures the essence of their life and philosophy, in a story that presents an explanation of their initial "division". It is impressive that the actors give such seemingly realistic portraits of the characters they play, mistakes and everything that at least the viewer was convinced that I was a witness to a real event in almost every detail. The great skill of this game is that thanks to insightful writing and a great film about "two of us" conversation can make a perfect picture. Worth at least 8 out of 10.
