This document was very accurate and exposing, yet funny, which seemed rather impressive to me. I felt like they did a very good job, covering sport from its beginnings to the present day, but there is a reason why I do not give such a high result to this film ... <br /> <br /> I felt like sometimes history has focused too much on the "proper nouns" of this sport, so to speak: too much in particular places in which to surf, and especially too much on individual surfers. I felt that the document has more in common with the nature of sport, the ideology of this sport, etc. It would be better (although of course it was covered, I do not think it took as much time as required). <br /> <br /> And for many people who are not absolutely hideous in surfing, sometimes you hear how they continue, about specific locations and specific surfers, it can become boring. Although video clips and in-depth studies are well respected, they could be presented in a way that would be better for those who are not avid surfers. <br /> <br /> In addition, my biggest disappointment was Sometimes they talked about how amazing and wonderful things were in the history of surfing, but they did not have real material from these events and you were all waiting for a breathtaking, silver screen in the breast an event that men talk about life changing moments, and finally everything you get, people talk about it, not real movie footage. It was too tempting for me to hear these stories, and then I could not see them. I understand the difficulty of getting everything, but please do not brag about it, then show it. <br /> <br /> Generally a very fresh documentary I liked; this is not the best document due to the above reasons, but being very fresh and having an extremely exciting movie material and a good soundtrack, it is a document that I advise everyone to check.
