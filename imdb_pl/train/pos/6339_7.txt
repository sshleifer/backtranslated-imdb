Part of The Grinch was created for Jim Carrey and I was very impressed with his performance. Not being his big fan, I was apprehensive but pleasantly surprised by the result. Taylor Momsen as Cindy Lou Which was the sweetest girl I've seen on the screen for a long time, and has shown maturity over the years in acting. At some point even tears drew me! I never read Dr. Seuss's book, so I did not know what to expect, the mood was quite dark. Overall, I liked the movie (except songs!) And would recommend it especially to watch the family.
